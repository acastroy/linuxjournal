Last month, I discussed localhost troubleshooting, and this month, I
extend troubleshooting to your local network. Find out why shawn can't
talk to bill.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1420580.0x1518408"></a></h2></div></div><p>
This column is the second in a series dedicated to one of my
favorite subjects: troubleshooting. Because my column is generally aimed
more at tips and tricks and less on philosophy and design, I'm not going
to talk much about overall approaches to problem solving. Instead, in
this series, I describe some general classes of problems you
might find on a Linux system, and then I discuss how to use common
tools, most of which probably already are on your system, to isolate
and resolve each class of problem.
</p><p>
In the first column, I talked about how to diagnose high-load issues on a
server, but the fact is that these days, just about every Linux computer
is connected to a network, and a large number of the problems you have
are based in the network. This month, I focus on local
network troubleshooting, and although I am writing from the perspective
of servers, most of these steps will apply to any Linux machine on a
network. Also, because the goal of this article is to show how to become
better at troubleshooting, I list each step from the lowest
level on up. In real life, I'd probably skip ahead here and there to make
the troubleshooting process faster.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1420580.0x1518618"></a>
bill Is Down</h2></div></div><p>
The generic problem I cover here is how to track down the root
cause when one machine can't communicate with another machine on the same
network. For this example, let's assume I have two servers named bill and
shawn. The server shawn is trying to communicate with bill over port 25
(port 25 is used for sending e-mail over SMTP), but wouldn't you know it,
bill isn't responding.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1420580.0x1518720"></a>
Does shawn or bill Have a Problem?</h2></div></div><p>
One of the first things I might do in a scenario like this is find
another machine on the same network and try to connect with bill from
there. If I can talk to bill from another machine on the same network,
the problem is most likely with shawn or with the network in between
shawn and bill. If I have the same problem from another machine on the
same network, it's more likely that the problem is with bill, so
I would start troubleshooting from there. Just so I can discuss more
troubleshooting steps, let's start troubleshooting from shawn.
</p><p>
One of the most embarrassing things in troubleshooting is to waste
an hour only to find out that something wasn't plugged in. So the
first step I perform is to make sure that shawn is plugged
in to the network. Although I could inspect the port physically on the
server, if the server were in a different city, I might run a program
like ethtool. ethtool gives you a lot of different diagnostics on your
Ethernet devices. By default, all you have to do is run ethtool as root
and pass the Ethernet device you want to check as an argument. In many
cases this will be eth0:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo ethtool eth0
Settings for eth0:
     Supported ports: [ TP ]
     Supported link modes:   10baseT/Half 10baseT/Full 
                               100baseT/Half 100baseT/Full 
                               1000baseT/Half 1000baseT/Full 
     Supports auto-negotiation: Yes
     Advertised link modes:  10baseT/Half 10baseT/Full 
                               100baseT/Half 100baseT/Full 
                               1000baseT/Half 1000baseT/Full 
     Advertised auto-negotiation: Yes
     Speed: 100Mb/s
     Duplex: Full
     Port: Twisted Pair
     PHYAD: 0
     Transceiver: internal
     Auto-negotiation: on
     Supports Wake-on: pg
     Wake-on: d
     Current message level: 0x000000ff (255)
     Link detected: yes
</pre>
</p><p>
As you can see, ethtool gives all sorts of information, including
the fact that this machine supports 10 base T, 100 base T and gigabit
networking speeds, but it currently communicates at 100 base T, full
duplex. To check for a link, just look at the very last line that says
&ldquo;Link detected&rdquo;. As you can see in my example, link is detected, so my
cable is plugged in and I can move on.
</p><p>
Before I move past ethtool completely, it's worth mentioning that it
does a lot more than just diagnose link problems. A common problem I've
found on networks is a host with slower-than-normal network speeds. Often
you'll see this crop up after a reboot or a power outage. What often
happens is that when the interface connects to the network, it will try
to auto-negotiate the fastest speed it can. Sometimes auto-negotiation
doesn't work correctly, in which case the interface might fail back to
half duplex mode or might even fail back to 10 base T! If you know that
your network can support 100 base T at full duplex, you can use ethtool
to disable auto-negotiation and force full duplex. To do this for eth0,
you would type:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo ethtool -s eth0 autoneg off duplex full
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1420580.0x1518ae8"></a>
Test Local IP Settings</h2></div></div><p>
After we have confirmed that shawn is plugged in, the next step is to
confirm that eth0 on shawn is configured correctly. To do that, I would
use the ifconfig command with eth0 as an argument. I should get back
all of the network information I need to determine whether eth0 is set
up correctly on shawn:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ifconfig eth0
eth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:17:42:c0:ff:ee  
          inet addr:10.1.1.9  Bcast:10.1.1.255  Mask:255.255.255.0
          inet6 addr: fe80::217:42ff:fe1f:18be/64 Scope:Link
          UP BROADCAST MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1
          RX packets:1 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0
          TX packets:11 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0
          collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000 
          RX bytes:229 (229.0 B)  TX bytes:2178 (2.1 KB)
</pre>
</p><p>
There is a lot of output in that command, but the first line I would
look at is the second line of output. There I can see that eth0's IP
address is 10.1.1.9 and that its subnet mask is 255.255.255.0. If the
machine were supposed to have a different IP or subnet mask from what I
see here, that potentially could be the cause of the problem. If
eth0 didn't have an IP or subnet mask configured at all, I might run
<tt  >ifup eth0</tt> to bring up the interface, or I might look into the local
network settings (/etc/network/interfaces on a Debian or Ubuntu machine,
/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0 on a Red Hat-based machine) to
see if anything is set incorrectly. If I can't seem to get the interface
to come up, and this host gets its IP from DHCP, I might have to move
my troubleshooting focus to the DHCP server.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1420580.0x1518d50"></a>
Test the Local Subnet</h2></div></div><p>
After you have confirmed that the interface is on the network and should
be able to communicate, the next step is to test whether you can access
another host on the same subnet&mdash;specifically the gateway if you have one
configured. Why? Well, if you can't talk to a host on the same subnet,
especially if you can't talk to the gateway, there's no point in
testing communications with hosts outside of your local subnet. First, I
will use the route command to see what gateway is configured, and then
I will use ping to see whether I can access the gateway:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo route -n
Kernel IP routing table
Destination  Gateway   Genmask         Flags Metric Ref  Use Iface
10.1.1.0     *          255.255.255.0   U     0      0     0 eth0
default      10.1.1.1  0.0.0.0          UG    100    0     0 eth0
</pre>
</p><p>
In this example, I have a very basic routing table, and the line that begins
with the word default defines my default gateway: 10.1.1.1. Be sure to
use the -n option with route in this step. Without the -n option, route
will try to resolve any IP addresses it lists into hostnames. Besides
the fact that route will execute faster with -n, if you have network
problems, you might not even be able to talk to your DNS server, plus DNS
troubleshooting is a topic for another column.
</p><p>
Because I see that the gateway is 10.1.1.1, I would use the ping command
to confirm that I can communicate with that gateway:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ping -c 5 10.1.1.1
PING 10.1.1.1 (10.1.1.1) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from 10.1.1.1: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=3.13 ms
64 bytes from 10.1.1.1: icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=1.43 ms
64 bytes from 10.1.1.1: icmp_seq=3 ttl=64 time=1.79 ms
64 bytes from 10.1.1.1: icmp_seq=5 ttl=64 time=1.50 ms

--- 10.1.1.1 ping statistics ---
5 packets transmitted, 4 received, 20% packet loss, time 4020ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 1.436/1.966/3.132/0.686 ms
</pre>
</p><p>
This output tells me that my machine can at least talk with the gateway
and presumably with the rest of the 10.1.1.x network. Now, if I couldn't
talk to the gateway, that could mean my network administrator is
being annoying and blocking ICMP packets. If that's the case, I would
just choose another machine on the same subnet (10.1.1.2-10.1.1.254)
and try to ping it instead. If I am the network administrator (and
therefore not blocking ICMP), or if ICMP isn't being blocked for some other
reason, the problem at this phase could be some sort of VLAN issue
that I would have to resolve on the network switch itself.
</p><p>
If you run the route command and don't find a default gateway set,
you might be tempted to conclude that's the source of the problem. Be
careful! That conclusion might be premature. See, if shawn and bill are
on the same subnet, I don't need a default gateway configured for those
servers to communicate. I'm not going to get into how to calculate subnets
in this column, but suffice it to say in my example, if shawn has an IP of
10.1.1.9 and a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0, bill could have an IP of
10.1.1.1 through 10.1.1.254 and be on the same subnet. In that case,
I might just ping bill directly. Ideally, I would have a third host on
the same subnet I also could ping. That way if bill doesn't respond,
but another host on the same subnet responds, I can narrow in on bill
as the likely source of the problem.

Next: Probe bill's Ports</h2></div></div><p>
If bill is responding to ping, the next step is to test whether port 25
is even open on bill. There are a few different methods for doing this, but
telnet is one of the easiest and is likely already to be installed on
your machines. Let's assume bill has an IP of 10.1.1.17; I would type:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ telnet 10.1.1.17 25
Trying 10.1.1.17...
telnet: Unable to connect to remote host: Connection refused
</pre>
</p><p>
If telnet doesn't complain about Connection refused, but instead
starts outputting SMTP commands, then congratulations, you don't have a
networking problem! On the downside, this means you probably have some
sort of SMTP problem, which might be more of a pain to troubleshoot. If
telnet complains with Connection refused, either port 25 is down on
the remote machine (possibly the SMTP service on bill isn't running or
isn't listening on that port), or a firewall is blocking you. This is
where a tool like nmap can be handy, and it's one of the reasons I often use
nmap instead of telnet when I want to test whether a port is
available.
</p><p>
You see, many firewalls are configured to block ports by dropping packets
with no reply. Because normally a server would send a basic reply back
to let you know the port is closed, if the packet is dropped instead,
nmap will flag it as filtered instead of closed:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ nmap -p 25 10.1.1.17

Starting Nmap 5.00 ( http://nmap.org ) at 2010-01-04 20:20 PST
Interesting ports on 10.1.1.17:
PORT   STATE  SERVICE
25/tcp filtered smtp
</pre>
</p><p>
In this case, nmap says the port is filtered, which tells me there
is a firewall blocking this port. If these machines were on different
subnets, there might be a firewall in between the networks restricting
access. Because I know these machines are on the same subnet, I would
assume that there is some iptables firewall configured on bill that
needs to be checked.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1420580.0x1519538"></a>
Test bill Directly</h2></div></div><p>
Let's assume we think the problem is on bill. After I've performed
the same network troubleshooting on bill that I have on shawn,
the next step is to log in to bill and test whether port 25 is open and
listening for connections. For this, I will use the netstat tool. netstat
can be used to output all sorts of information about network connections
on the machine. In this case though, I will just use the -lnp options
to list listening ports and the processes that have the ports open,
then I will grep for the port I'm interested in, port 25:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo netstat -lnp | grep :25
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:25    0.0.0.0:*     LISTEN   1878/master
</pre>
</p><p>
The column I want to pay the most attention to here is the fourth column
that lists what local address is open on port 25. In this case, I can
see it is set to 0.0.0.0:25, which means bill is listening to port
25 connections on all available interfaces. If I had set up the mail
server to listen only on eth0, this would be set to 10.1.1.17:25. If, on
the other hand, I saw this was set to 127.0.0.1:25, I might have found
the cause of the problem: the mail server was set to listen only to the
localhost address (127.0.0.1) and isn't listening for any connections
from the outside network. In that situation, I would reconfigure my mail server
so that it listens on eth0. If I got no output from
the above command, I would know my problem is that my server isn't
running at all (or isn't set to listen on port 25). Then, I'd need to
start my mail server and troubleshoot why it stopped running to begin
with, or why it isn't listening on the right port.
</p><p>
As you can see, network troubleshooting can lead you in all sorts of
interesting directions. Even now I've barely scratched the surface. In my
next column, I'll extend network troubleshooting beyond the local network
and touch on how to track down routing and DNS problems from your local
networks to the Internet itself.
