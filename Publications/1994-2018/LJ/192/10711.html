Some final fixes to the Twitterbot script we developed last month.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2390580.0x24883b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
I can't believe it, this is my 52nd column. That means I've been
writing for <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> for almost four and a half
years. Hopefully, you've been reading
my column just as long and enjoying our monthly forays into the world of shell
script programming. On the tech side, quite a bit has changed in the last
four and a half
years. But on the Linux/shell side, it's surprisingly similar to how it was
when I wrote my first column.
</p><p>
Last month, we continued to build a Twitter autoresponder script that
could read and parse Twitter messages (aka tweets). We got it working
and wrapped up the column by realizing we actually needed to capture
the unique tweet ID in addition to name and message, so we could ensure
that the script kept track of what it had or hadn't answered.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2390580.0x2488618"></a>
Where We Are Now</h2></div></div><p>
The script keeps track of tweets by ID and knows both how to parse the incoming
Twitter stream and how to remember if it has seen a one-word tweet request or
not. Run it once, and I see:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Twitter user @jlight asked for the time
@jlight the time on our server is LOCALTIME
</pre>
</p><p>
The next time I run it, just a few minutes later, I see:


<pre     class="programlisting">
Twitter user @truss asked for the time
@truss the time on our server is LOCALTIME
Twitter user @tlady asked what our address in tweet 7395272164
@tlady we're located at 123 University Avenue, Anywhere USA
</pre>
</p><p>
It looks good, but there's a problem in the script, because one of the output
diagnostic lines is:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Twitter user @ asked for the time
@ the time on our server is LOCALTIME
</pre>
</p><p>
Somehow it's not identifying the user ID for this particular user. After a quick
analysis of the actual Twitter.com data, it appears that the
first tweet comes out of the parser section without an associated user ID.
</p><p>
To debug this, first get a copy of the script to follow along
(the script from last month is at
<a href="../listings/191/10695.tgz" target="_self">ftp.linuxjournal.com/pub/lj/listings/issue191/10695.tgz</a>).
In the while loop, I'll add this line to aid in debugging:

<pre     class="programlisting">
echo got name = $name, id = $id, and msg = $msg
</pre>
</p><p>
Now when I run the script, here's what I see:

<pre     class="programlisting">
got name = , id = 7395437583, and msg = VERY cool
got name = spin, id = 7395333666, and msg = time
got name = astrong, id = 7395281516, and msg = time
got name = truss, id = 7395281011, and msg = time
</pre>
</p><p>
Clearly something's wrong, but what?
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2390580.0x2488bf0"></a>
Debugging a Complicated Script</h2></div></div><p>
One reason I like to use temp files in scripts rather than having
incredibly long and complicated pipes is for debugging this sort of
problem.
</p><p>
Recall that the main parsing work is done by curl feeding its output to
grep, then a sequence of sed invocations and finally a quick
call to awk:

<pre     class="programlisting">

$curl -u "davetaylor:$pw" $inurl | \
  grep -E '(&lt;screen_name&gt;|&lt;text&gt;|&lt;id&gt;)' | \
  sed 's/@DaveTaylor //;s/  &lt;text&gt;//;s/&lt;\/text&gt;//' | \
  sed 's/ *&lt;screen_name&gt;//;s/&lt;\/screen_name&gt;//' | \
  sed 's/ *&lt;id&gt;//;s/&lt;\/id&gt;//' | \
  awk '{ if (NR % 4 == 0) {
             printf ("name=%s; ", $0)
         }
         else if (NR % 4 == 1) {
             printf ("id=%s; ",$0)
         }
         else if (NR % 4 == 2) {
             print "msg=\"" $0 "\""
         }
       }' &gt; $temp

</pre>
</p><p>
Adding the command <tt  >more $temp</tt> immediately
after this means we can eyeball the data stream and see what's
different about the first and second lines (as the second is parsed
properly). Here's what I see:

<pre     class="programlisting">
id=7395681235; msg="African or European?"
name=jeffrey; id=7395672894; msg="North Hall IStage"
</pre>
</p><p>
Note that there's no <tt  >name=</tt> field on the first
message. My theory? There's a logic error in the awk statement
that's causing it to skip the first entry somehow.
</p><p>
To test that assumption, I'll temporarily replace the entire awk script
with another that outputs the record number (mod 4) followed by the
data line:

<pre     class="programlisting">
awk '{ print (NR % 4), $0 }' &gt; $temp
</pre>
</p><p>
The result is exactly what we were expecting, which is a bit confusing:

<pre     class="programlisting">
1 7395934047
2 we are at the MGM as well!
3 14171725
0 sideline
1 7395681235
2 African or European?
3 14712874
0 jeffrey
</pre>
</p><p>
Here, Twitter user sideline has sent &ldquo;we are at the
MGM as well!&rdquo;, and jeffrey sent the message &ldquo;African or
European?&rdquo;.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2390580.0x2489220"></a>
What's Really Wrong?</h2></div></div><p>
The problem isn't that the data is being eaten, it's that the
awk script is pairing the name information with the wrong tweet.
Let's re-examine the awk script:

<pre     class="programlisting">
awk '{ if (NR % 4 == 0) {
           printf ("name=%s; ", $0)
       }
       else if (NR % 4 == 1) {
           printf ("id=%s; ",$0)
       }
       else if (NR % 4 == 2) {
           print "msg=\"" $0 "\""
       }
     }'
</pre>
</p><p>
NR%4=0 is correctly tagged as the name, NR%4=1 as the message ID, NR%4=2
as the msg, and NR%4=3 is skipped. (It's the Twitter user ID, not the tweet
ID. It might be useful in a different context, but not for what we're
doing.)
</p><p>
The problem is subtle, but it becomes obvious when you compare what the
parser is generating against the actual tweets in the Twitter
stream. We
saw the first two like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
id=7395681235; msg="African or European?"
name=jeffrey; id=7395672894; msg="North Hall IStage"
</pre>
</p><p>
But in fact, the tweet &ldquo;African or European?&rdquo; was sent by
jeffrey, and the &ldquo;North Hall IStage&rdquo; was sent by the user
identified in the subsequent line of parsed and formatted data.
</p><p>
Conclusion? We're splitting the data lines in the wrong place. Instead
of adding the carriage return after NR%4==2 (it's subtle, we use
print instead of printf), we actually should be adding it after
the match for NR%4==0, like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
awk '{ if (NR % 4 == 0) {
           printf ("name=%s;\n", $0)
     } else if (NR % 4 == 1) {
           printf ("id=%s; ",$0)
     } else if (NR % 4 == 2) {
           printf ("msg=\"%s\"; ", $0) }
     }'
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, let's try that statement again:


<pre     class="programlisting">
id=7395681235; msg="African or European?"; name=jeffrey;
id=7395672894; msg="North Hall IStage"; name=sideline;
</pre>
</p><p>
Ah, that's the ticket!
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2390580.0x24897f8"></a>
Fixed It, Now Let's Clean Everything Up</h2></div></div><p>
With the problem solved, I'll remove the added debug statements and unleash the
listener beast:


<pre     class="programlisting">
got name = jeffrey, id = 7395681235, and msg = African or European?
got name = sideline, id = 7395672894, and msg = North Hall IStage
got name = Genuine, id = 7395669466, and msg = ummmmm I know
</pre>
</p><p>
Perfect. Bug debugged!
</p><p>
Now when we run the script, it correctly sees only the new tweets since
it was last run, and it responds only to those it understands:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Twitter user @Larkin asked for the time
@Larkin the time on our server is LOCALTIME
Twitter user @jennyj asked for the time
@jennyj the time on our server is LOCALTIME
</pre>
</p><p>
Run the script again, and it sees only what's newer yet:


<pre     class="programlisting">
Twitter user @NoA asked for directions in tweet 7396527668
@NoA directions to our office are here: SOMEADDRESS
</pre>
</p><p>
Perfect! Now, a tiny tweak. As we've debugged things, I have set the
variable <tt  >tweet</tt> to <tt  >/bin/echo</tt>,
so as not to flood my followers with unnecessary messages. Change it back
to the tweet.sh script (as developed in an earlier series of columns),
and the script actually responds with tweets.
</p><p>
The first run looks like this:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sh tweet-listen.sh
Twitter user @mosa asked for directions in tweet 7396566048
(sent tweet @mosa directions to our office are here: SOMEADDRESS)
Twitter user @xwatch asked for the time
(sent tweet @xwatch the time on our server is TIME)
Twitter user @NoA asked for directions in tweet 7396527668
(sent tweet @NoA directions to our office are here: SOMEADDRESS)
</pre>
</p><p>
To ensure that it won't answer more than once to a tweet query, I'll run the
script again:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sh tweet-listen.sh
$
</pre>
</p><p>
That's it! Now one tiny additional task is left, to add it to crontab so that
it'll be an active listener, which is done by having it run every two minutes
with the line:

<pre     class="programlisting">
*/2 * * * *  bash $SCRIPTS/davesbot/tweet-listen.sh
</pre>
</p><p>
That's all there is to it. Congratulations, we've just built a fully
featured Twitterbot.
</p><p>
If you'd like to test it, it has its own account on Twitter, @davesbot. Start
by sending a 2&ndash;3 word message, and it'll tell you what it can do. Grab the
final source code from the LinuxJournal.com site at <a href="../listings/192/10711.tgz" target="_self">ftp.linuxjournal.com/pub/lj/listings/issue192/10711.tgz</a>.
