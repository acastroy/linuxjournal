Selenium Core provides basic Web application testing, and
Selenium RC allows you to write test scripts in other
programming languages, such as Perl, Java, C# and others.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x130c580.0x1404250"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Web 2.0 may pale in comparison to the days of the dot-com bubble and Web
1.0 from a financial point of view, but from a technical point of view,
it's light-years ahead. As a Web developer, you find yourself designing
more complex and more demanding Web applications than your bubble 1.0
predecessors ever dared to dream of. This is the fun part. The less fun
part is trying to test those feature-rich applications. The prospect
of manual testing does not thrill any developer, and the multitude
of browsers you need to test with makes it an even bigger nightmare.
Figure 1, which is based on the browser market-share statistics provided
by Net Applications at the time of this writing, illustrates quite clearly the state of the browser
war 2.0.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10601f1.large.jpg"><img src="10601f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Browser Market Share
</p></div></div><p>
The breakdown is as follows:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Microsoft Internet Explorer: 66%
</p></li><li><p>
Firefox: 24%
</p></li><li><p>
Safari: 4%
</p></li><li><p>
Chrome: 3%
</p></li><li><p>
Opera: 2%
</p></li><li><p>
Other: 1%
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Although estimates vary from different companies that monitor Web usage
traffic, the conclusion is obvious: you no longer can afford
to test with a single browser. And, note that Microsoft IE, which accounts
for about 66% of the traffic, actually is three very different browsers:
IE6, IE7 and IE8, which are known to render Web sites differently.
</p><p>
The situation is expected to get worse as mobile broadband Internet
becomes cheaper and more common, adding more browsers you'll have to test
with, sometimes with limited capabilities and nonstandard
resolution.
</p><p>
The good news is that you are not facing this problem alone, and there
are some advanced automatic Web application testing frameworks that
can reduce the burden significantly.

Selenium to the Rescue</h2></div></div><p>
Selenium is much more than an average Web site unit-testing
application. It is actually a set of tools, consisting of the following:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Selenium Core
</p></li><li><p>
Selenium Remote Control (RC)
</p></li><li><p>
Selenium Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
</p></li><li><p>
Selenium Grid
</p></li></ol></div><p>
Selenium Core provides basic testing functionality. It is implemented
in JavaScript and can be deployed either standalone (in which case
it has to be installed on the Web server) or more commonly, as part
of Selenium RC, IDE or Grid, which all use Selenium Core engine. Figure 2
shows the relationships between the Core and other Selenium projects.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10601f2.large.jpg"><img src="10601f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Selenium Architecture
</p></div></div><p>
Selenium RC is a Java-based command-line server that launches browsers
and sends test commands to Selenium Core. You can write your tests,
implemented as Selenium RC clients, in a variety of programming languages,
such as Perl, Java, C# and others. If you are
not afraid of some basic programming, this is the most powerful way to
use Selenium.
</p><p>
Selenium IDE is a Firefox plugin that allows you to create tests
using a graphical tool. These tests can be executed either from the
IDE itself or exported in many programming languages and executed
automatically as Selenium RC clients.
</p><p>
Selenium Grid solves the scalability problem by coordinating many Selenium
RC instances, allowing you to run multiple tests in parallel on different
machines.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x130c580.0x1405380"></a>
Selenium RC</h2></div></div><p>
I usually use Selenium RC, and I recommend it even to people with
only a little bit of programming background. The API is simple, and the flexibility
it provides is well worth the learning curve involved. RC
consists of a server and client parts, which is a bit confusing, as the
server has nothing to do with the Web server you are testing, but rather
drives the Web browser used for testing. The server is a Java command-line
application and should be executed as follows:

<pre     class="programlisting">
java -jar selenium-server.jar
</pre>
</p><p>
The <tt  >--help</tt> command-line switch will give you a full listing of supported
options, but usually the defaults are sufficient. You also can invoke it
programmatically from Java. The server will wait for client connections on
port 4444 by default. The client can be written in one of the following
languages: Perl, Python, PHP, Ruby, Java, C# and Erlang. The list is
quite impressive. In fact, before I discovered Selenium, I was not aware
that anybody outside Ericsson was using Erlang. The following sample Perl
code shows a rather basic Selenium test that opens a Firefox browser
and performs a search for the word Selenium using Google:


<pre     class="programlisting">
use strict;
use warnings;
use Test::WWW::Selenium;

my $sel = Test::WWW::Selenium-&gt;new(
                host          =&gt; "localhost",
                port          =&gt; 4444,
                browser       =&gt; "*firefox",
                browser_url   =&gt; "http://www.google.com",
                default_names =&gt; 1);
$sel-&gt;open("/");
$sel-&gt;type("q", "selenium");
$sel-&gt;click("btnI");
$sel-&gt;wait_for_page_to_load(60000);

print "$sel-&gt;get_title()\n";

$sel-&gt;stop();
</pre>
</p><p>
The code above opens a new Selenium session, connects to the Selenium
server running on the same machine as the client (the code in the listing) on port 4444,
opens a Firefox browser, goes to the http://www.google.com URL, types
the word selenium into the query field and clicks Google's &ldquo;I'm Feeling
Lucky&rdquo; button. Both query and search elements are identified by their HTML
element ID or name, q and btnI, respectively (examine the source code for Google's main page).
The script waits for the page to load, prints the page title and shuts down the Selenium session.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x130c580.0x14056f0"></a>
Selenium Core</h2></div></div><p>
Selenium Core is the heart of Selenium. It is a collection of JavaScript
functions that are used by all Selenium projects, but it is rarely used
on its own. If you take a look at the HTML source for the Web site under test
(using View&rarr;Page source in Firefox or with whichever browser you told
Selenium to execute),
you will notice some additional JavaScript code that looks
like the following:


<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;script
  type="text/javascript"
  src="/selenium-server/core/scripts/selenium-browserbot.js"&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
This is actually the Selenium Core code. The way Selenium
&ldquo;injects&rdquo; itself into
the Web page can vary (more on this later); however, when Selenium Core is
used directly, this code has to be added to your HTML manually. Naturally,
it requires access to the Web server that's serving the page, which is not always available.
The biggest advantage of this mode is that it will work reliably
with all browsers&mdash;something that other methods of using Selenium
cannot guarantee.
</p><p>
Nevertheless, standalone Selenium Core is rarely used these days and may
be deprecated in the future, so for the rest of this article, I concentrate
on
Selenium RC and IDE, which are the preferred methods of using Selenium.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x130c580.0x14059b0"></a>
Selenium IDE</h2></div></div><p>
Contrary to Selenium RC, for which you write your test cases using
some programming language, the Selenium IDE allows you to develop your
Selenium test cases in a graphical environment by simply interacting
with the Web application under test as your users would. It probably
is the easiest way to develop test cases. Selenium IDE is implemented as
a Firefox plugin. The IDE not only records the Selenium commands that
correspond to your interactions with the browser, but it also allows you
to modify their arguments and add more commands to the recorded test
case. The plugin has a context menu that allows you to select a UI
(User Interface) element from the browser's currently displayed page and
then select a Selenium command from a drop-down list, automatically adding
relevant parameters according to the context of the selected UI element.
</p><p>
After installation, the IDE is accessible via Tools&rarr;Selenium IDE in the
Firefox menu. To illustrate the IDE functionality, let's re-create the
above Google search test case using the IDE. In order to do this, you
simply should run the IDE, check that the record button is on, open
the http://www.google.com page, type selenium and click Google
Search. As you type, the Selenium IDE captures what you do (Figure 3).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10601f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Selenium IDE Screen Capture
</p></div></div><p>
Selenium recorded the manually entered commands. This test
case now can be played back using the IDE, saved as HTML or exported in a
variety of formats, including ready-to-run code snippets for Selenium RC.
The exported test case looks very similar to the handwritten code above,
although in this case, I exported it in Python in
order to demonstrate some of Selenium's capabilities:


<pre     class="programlisting">
from selenium import selenium
import unittest, time, re

class googletest(unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        self.verificationErrors = []
        self.selenium = selenium(
              "localhost", 4444,
              "*chrome", "http://www.google.com/")
        self.selenium.start()

    def test_googletest(self):
        sel = self.selenium
        sel.open("/")
        sel.type("q", "selenium")
        sel.click("btnG")

    def tearDown(self):
        self.selenium.stop()
        self.assertEqual([], self.verificationErrors)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    unittest.main()
</pre>
</p><p>
Note that in addition to using a unit-testing framework, the code above
differs from the Perl example by using the <tt  >"*chrome"</tt> browser string instead
of <tt  >"*firefox"</tt>. This is one of the most confusing
issues with Selenium,
and it deserves a section of its own here.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x130c580.0x13fc768"></a>
Browser String Parameter</h2></div></div><p>
Before I go into the really confusing details of this parameter, it is
important to understand that even though Selenium is not a new project,
it still is under active development, and as it sometimes happens with
open-source projects, some of the development effort that went into introducing
new features might have been better spent debugging old ones and making it more
stable. As a result, in certain configurations, some Selenium features
might not work as expected, and others may not work at all.
</p><p>
The browser string parameter not only specifies the browser Selenium will
work with, but also the method Selenium uses to control the browser and
the mode of communication between the Selenium server and the Selenium
Core running inside the browser. And, yes, there are multiple modes
for some browsers. Not all modes are implemented for every browser, and
some Selenium commands will not work with certain modes. To add to the
confusion, the default modes sometimes change between different Selenium
versions. In Selenium version 1.0 <tt  >"*firefox"</tt> is an
alias for <tt  >"*chrome"</tt>
and <tt  >"*iexplore"</tt> for <tt  >"*iehta"</tt>.
</p><p>
This explains why the automatically generated
Python code produced a different value for the browser string than
was used in the manually produced Perl code, even though both tests used Firefox.
Both the <tt  >"*chrome"</tt> and
<tt  >"*iehta"</tt> browser profiles implement a
&ldquo;native&rdquo;
approach in which Selenium uses a browser-specific method to
&ldquo;inject&rdquo;
the Selenium Core JavaScript code and to control the browser, as opposed
to a Proxy Injection (PI) mode, which is generic and, at least in theory,
should work with all browsers.
</p><p>
When Proxy Injection mode is enabled, Selenium RC, which has a built-in
HTTP proxy server, configures the custom profile of the browser under
test to work with its local proxy. Every HTTP response returned by
the proxy server has had the Selenium Core JavaScript code
&ldquo;injected&rdquo; into
the &lt;head&gt; HTML element.
</p><p>
By design, the Proxy Injection mode works with all browsers, even
those that were not tested with Selenium, as long as the browser
supports JavaScript and an HTTP proxy. Not only that, but it also allows
circumventing the &ldquo;same origin policy&rdquo;&mdash;that is, it allows you to test different sites on
different domains during the same Selenium session with browsers for
which the &ldquo;native&rdquo; mode is not complete, for instance Opera. At this
point, you may think that this is the mode you should use for your tests,
but unfortunately, during Selenium's development the developers discovered that
some important functionality is very hard to implement in PI mode. As a
result, most developers gradually switched to the so-called native mode,
even though it requires a separate implementation for every browser. As
a result, the PI mode is poorly maintained and quite buggy.
</p><p>
As you can see, even though it is often praised for its multiple browser
testing capability, in reality, browsers other than Firefox and Internet
Explorer are poorly supported. At the end of the day, if you have to
ensure that your Web site looks and works correctly under all important
browsers,
your best bet may be a browser screenshot tool, such as BrowserShots or
BrowserSeal. BrowserShots is a Web-based screenshot service supporting
a wide range of browsers that unfortunately suffers from long response
times. BrowserSeal, on the other hand, is a standalone application running
on your PC optimized for Web site screenshots. It produces screenshots
in a few seconds, compared with a few minutes for BrowserShots; however,
there is only a Windows version available at the time of this writing.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x130c580.0x13fce48"></a>
Selenium Grid</h2></div></div><p>
At first glance, it looks like Selenium RC supports enough parallelism
that any additional distributed processing capability would not be
needed. After all, a single Selenium RC server allows you to open a number
of parallel sessions (that is, drive a number of browsers at the same
time)
and a single Selenium RC client. In addition to being able to work with
multiple concurrent sessions of one server, it can communicate with multiple
servers at the same time.
</p><p>
However, in practice, running more than six browsers on the same Selenium
RC server is not advisable due to performance issues. Additionally,
managing a large number of Selenium RC servers is a major headache and
does not scale very well. This is where Selenium Grid can help.
</p><p>
Selenium Grid introduces another component to the Selenium
architecture&mdash;Selenium Hub, which manages a pool of available Selenium Remote Control
entities and is responsible for the following:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Transparently allocating a Selenium RC entity to a specific test.
</p></li><li><p>
Limiting the number of concurrent test runs on each Remote Control.
</p></li><li><p>
Shielding the tests from the actual grid infrastructure.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
As far as your RC client programming is concerned, the move from Selenium
RC to Grid requires minimal code changes. All you have to do
is to change the infamous browser string parameter. For instance,
change <tt  >"*firefox"</tt> to something like
<tt  >"Firefox on Windows"</tt> or <tt  >"Safari on
Mac"</tt>.
</p><p>
Selenium Hub's configuration is a bit more complex. First, you have to
modify the grid_configuration.yml file. Let's say you want to use
two RC instances&mdash;one with Firefox on Linux and another with Internet
Explorer on Windows. In that case, your configuration file will look like
this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
hub:
   port: 4444
   environments:
       - name:    "Firefox on Linux"
         browser: "*firefox"
       - name:    "IE on Windows"
         browser: "*iexplore"
</pre>
</p><p>
After that, you should use <tt  >ant</tt> to launch the Selenium Hub by running
<tt  >ant launch-hub</tt> on the hub machine.
The RC instances are created by running the following commands,
one on a Linux machine and one on a Windows machine.
</p><p>
On the Linux machine:

<pre     class="programlisting">

ant -Denvironment="Firefox on Linux" \
    -DhubURL=http://&lt;hub-IP-address&gt;:4444 \
        launch-remote-control

</pre>
</p><p>
On the Windows machine:

<pre     class="programlisting">

ant -Denvironment="IE on Windows" \
    -DhubURL=http://&lt;hub-IP-address&gt;:4444 \
        launch-remote-control

</pre>
</p><p>
After that, you can code your RC client to use any of the above RC server
instances via the hub.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x130c580.0x13fd738"></a>
Selenium API</h2></div></div><p>
Comprehensive description of the Selenium API is beyond the scope of this article,
but the list below demonstrates what the framework is capable of:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
<tt  >$sel-&gt;click($locator)</tt> &mdash; Clicks on a link, button, check box or radio button.
</p></li><li><p>
