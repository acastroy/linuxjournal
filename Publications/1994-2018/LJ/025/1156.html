&ldquo;I should write a program to do that!&rdquo; only to realize that you
will have to write more than just the code needed to solve the
problem at hand? Your program will probably need to get the names
of data files from the command line, open and read these files, and
allocate and manage memory for data storage. This programming
overhead can be a lot of effort to write and debug. To make this
programming task even less appealing, what if you need this program
&ldquo;right now&rdquo; and it may be used only once or twice? Does writing
this program still seem worth all the effort? If you are using one
of the more traditional languages, such as C or C++, perhaps not.
However, the awk programming language may be just the right tool
for writing the programs you need while minimizing the programming
overhead.
</p><p>gawk, the GNU version of the powerful awk programming
language, lets you concentrate on writing the code to solve the
problem at hand without worrying about all the overhead required to
actually make your program do its job. gawk offers many features
designed to help you quickly write useful and powerful programs.
With features such as pattern-matching, associative arrays,
automatic handling of command-line argument files, and no need for
variable declarations, gawk is able to free you from many of the
tiresome details that often get in the way of getting the job
done.</p><p>gawk is suitable for a wide range of applications, from
simple, one-line applications to complex applications that will be
used on a regular basis. gawk is also a simpler, easier to use
alternative to Perl. Although Perl programs will run faster than
comparable gawk programs, the syntax and features of gawk are (in
my opinion) easier to read and tend not to become quite so
obfuscated.</p><p>C programmers will find that parts of gawk are already quite
familiar to them. In many ways, the syntax of gawk looks very much
like the syntax of C, with constructs such as pre- and
post-increment and decrement operators, nestable if-else blocks,
for loops which look exactly like those in C&mdash;even the familiar
<b  >{</b> and <b  >}</b> defining sections of
code. This close similarity to C is not such a surprise when you
consider that one of the originators of the awk programming
language, Brian Kernighan, was also one of the originators of
C.</p><p>However, beyond this similarity in syntax, awk is a language
quite unlike the traditional languages in most common use
today.</p><p>In this article I will describe the more basic features of
working with gawk, the GNU version of awk. There will be many parts
of this language that I cannot cover here&mdash;for these you will need
to consult one of the sources listed in the reference section at
the end. Although I will be describing gawk, the features discussed
here should be applicable to most versions of the awk programming
language. As such, the names gawk and awk are often used
interchangeably.</p><p>In keeping with the tradition set by countless authors
writing about a programming language, here is the ever-popular
&ldquo;Hello World&rdquo; program written in awk:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
BEGIN { print "Hello World" }
</pre><p>Before I explain how to run this program, I will describe how
a gawk program, or script, works.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2728580.0x28208c8"></a>Pattern Matching</h2></div></div><p>A major difference between gawk and most other languages is
that gawk is a pattern-matching language. That is, gawk scans its
input looking for patterns which have been specified in the gawk
program, and executes the block of gawk code associated with that
pattern. A gawk program, or script, consists of one or more
patterns which the programmer wishes to match against each line of
input, and the corresponding action blocks (enclosed between
<b  >{</b> and <b  >}</b>) which are to be
executed when that pattern is found in an input line. So a gawk
program has the form:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
<span   class="emphasis"><em>pattern1</em></span> { <span   class="emphasis"><em>action1</em></span> }
<span   class="emphasis"><em>pattern2</em></span> { <span   class="emphasis"><em>action2</em></span> }
 .
 .
 .
<span   class="emphasis"><em>patternN</em></span> { <span   class="emphasis"><em>actionN</em></span> }
</pre><p>These patterns, which can consist of a simple expression, a
regular expression, a combination of patterns, or even an empty
pattern, can be as simple or as complex as needed. To print all
lines in a file which contain the word &ldquo;Linux&rdquo;, the pattern is
simply defined as <b  >/Linux/</b> and the action block
is <b  >{print}</b>. Thus, the complete gawk program can
be written as:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/Linux/ { print }
</pre><p>Action blocks consist of one or more gawk statements enclosed
between <b  >{</b> and <b  >}</b>. In this
simple example, the print statement will print everything on each
line which contains the pattern &ldquo;Linux&rdquo;. However, this program
will also match such words as &ldquo;LinuxKernel&rdquo;--the pattern does not
have to be a discrete word. Also, since pattern matching is
case-sensitive by default, it will not match the pattern
&ldquo;linux&rdquo;.</p><p>If you need to match both upper and lower case, the pattern
can be changed to allow for this&mdash;it just becomes a more complex
pattern. If you wanted the pattern to match both &ldquo;linux&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Linux&rdquo;, you could write the pattern as
<b  >/[Ll]inux/</b>. In this case, you are telling gawk
to look for groups of characters that begin with any of the
characters enclosed in the square brackets (here, either an upper
or lower case &ldquo;L&rdquo;) followed by the lowercase letters &ldquo;inux&rdquo;.
Other options for dealing with case sensitivity are to use the
built-in functions <b  >tolower()</b> or
<b  >toupper()</b> to change the case of the input line
(or just parts of the line) before the pattern matching takes
place, or you can set the built in variable
<b  >IGNORECASE</b> (in awk, built in variables are
always written in upper case) to any non-zero value at the start of
your program.</p><p>Patterns in gawk can be as simple or as complex as needed to
match the desired item in the input line. If you do not specify a
pattern, the action block will be executed for every line of input.
This is known as an empty pattern. So if you do not explicitly put
a pattern into your program, gawk treats the lack of a pattern as a
pattern that will match everything in the input.</p><p>Alternatively, if you specify a pattern but no action, gawk
will provide a default action&mdash;namely
<b  >{print}</b>--for you. So the simple program above
can be rewritten as <b  >/Linux/</b>, although it is
usually better to define an action explicitly, since this results
in more readable code.</p><p>gawk also defines several special patterns which do not match
any input at all, the most commonly used being
<b  >BEGIN</b> and <b  >END</b>. The action
block associated with <b  >BEGIN</b> will be executed
only once, before gawk starts to read the input files, and allow
you to take care of any setup and initialization details that may
be needed. The action block for the <b  >END</b> pattern
will be executed after the processing of all input has been
completed and is useful for printing any final results from your
program. The <b  >BEGIN</b> and <b  >END</b>
patterns are optional&mdash;you include them only when there is a need
for them.</p><p>However, if you wish to write a gawk script that takes no
input at all&mdash;say for example, the ever-popular &ldquo;Hello World&rdquo;
program that was shown earlier&mdash;your gawk statements must be
enclosed in the action block for the <b  >BEGIN</b>
pattern. Otherwise, gawk will see them as part of the main input
loop block (described next) and wait for some input (or a
Control-D) before printing&mdash;probably not what you want to happen in
this case.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2728580.0x2821580"></a>Main Input Loop</h2></div></div><p>Work in almost any programming language and you will have to
write code to get the names of any files from the command line,
open these files, and read their contents. For most file access,
gawk let you skip these steps entirely. If you pass one or more
file names on the command line, after executing the code in the
BEGIN block (if present), gawk will automatically get the name from
the command line, open a file, read its contents line-by-line, try
to match any pattern you have defined against these lines, close
the file when it is finished, and move onto the next file listed.
If the input is coming from standard input (i.e., you are piping
the output of another program to your gawk program), the input
process is equally transparent. However, if you find that you need
to handle this file input in some different manner, gawk provides
you with all the tools necessary to do this. But for most of the
file handling you will need, it is better to let gawk's input loop
do the work for you.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2728580.0x2821688"></a>Running a gawk Program</h2></div></div><p>Now that we have seen how a gawk program works the next step
is to see how to make your program run. With gawk on Linux, we have
three ways to do this. For those truly quick-and-dirty tasks, an
entire gawk program can be written and executed on the command
line, although this is really only practical for very small
programs. Using our simple example from above, we can run it with
the command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
gawk '/Linux/ {print}' file.txt
</pre><p>When running a gawk script from the command line, you must
enclose the awk statements in single quotes and list any data files
after the closing quote. If you need to use more that one gawk
statement in an action block, simply separate each statement using
the semicolon. For example, if you wanted to print each line that
contained &ldquo;Linux&rdquo; and keep a count of how many input lines
contain the pattern <b  >/Linux/</b> you could
write</p><pre     class="programlisting">
gawk '/Linux/{ print; count=count+1 }
END { print count " lines" }' file.txt
</pre><p>You can list any number of data files on the command line and
gawk will automatically open and read them, looking for any lines
which match the pattern defined.</p><p>You can also use your favourite editor to write your gawk
program and pass the name of the file to gawk using the
<b  >-f</b> option to tell gawk to try to execute the
contents of that file. (For convenience, I like to use the
extension &ldquo;.awk&rdquo; on these files, although this is not necessary.)
So if the file linux.awk contains the pattern-action block:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/Linux/ {
    print
    count = count + 1
}
END {
    print count "lines found."
}
</pre><p>It can be executed by the command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
gawk -f linux.awk file.txt anotherfile.txt
</pre><p>Under Linux (and other versions of Unix) there is another,
easier way to run your gawk program&mdash;simply put the line</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#!/usr/bin/gawk -f
</pre><p>at the top of the program to indicate the path to the gawk
interpreter. Make the file executable using the chmod
command--<b  >chmod +x linux.awk</b>. Then we can execute
the gawk program by typing its name and any parameters. (Note: you
will need to check the actual location of the gawk interpreter on
your system and put this path in the first line.)</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2728580.0x2821c60"></a>Input Fields</h2></div></div><p>Another powerful and time saving feature of gawk is its
ability to automatically separate each input line into fields, each
referred to by number. The entire line is referred to as
<b  >$0</b> and each field within the current line is
<b  >$1</b>, <b  >$2</b>, and so forth. So if
the input line is <b  >This is a line</b>,</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$0 = This is a line
$1 = This
$2 = is
$3 = a
$4 = line
</pre><p>Likewise, the built-in variable <b  >NF</b>, which
contains the number of fields in the current input line, will be
set to 4. If you try to refer to fields beyond
<b  >NF</b>, their value will be <b  >NULL</b>.
Another built-in variable, <b  >NR</b>, contains the
total number of input lines that awk has read so far.</p><p>As an example of the use of these fields, if you needed to
take the contents of a file and print it out, one word per line
(useful if you want to pipe each word in a file to a spell
checker), simply run this script:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
{ for (i=1;i&lt;=NF;i++) print $i }
</pre><p>To separate the line into fields, gawk uses another built in
variable, <b  >FS</b> (for &ldquo;field separator&rdquo;). The
default value of <b  >FS</b> is <b  >" "</b> so
fields are separated by white space: any number of consecutive
spaces or tabs. Setting <b  >FS</b> to any other
character means that fields are separated by <span   class="emphasis"><em>exactly
one</em></span> occurence of that character. So if there are two
occurences of that character in a row, gawk will present you with
an empty field.</p><p>To get a better idea of how <b  >FS</b> works with
input lines, suppose we wanted to print the full names of all users
listed in /etc/passwd, where the fields are separated by
<b  >:</b>. You would need to set
<b  >FS=":"</b>. If the file names.awk contains the
following gawk statements:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
{
    FS=":"
    print $5
}
</pre><p>and you run it with <b  >gawk -f names.awk
/etc/passwd</b>, the program will separate each line into
fields and print field 5, which in this case is the full name of
the user. However, the line <b  >FS=":"</b> will be
executed for each line in the data file&mdash;hardly efficient. If you
are setting <b  >FS</b>, it is usually best to make use
of the <b  >BEGIN</b> pattern, which is run only once,
and rewrite our program as:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
BEGIN {
    FS=":"
}
{
    print $5
}
</pre><p>Now the line <b  >FS=":"</b> will be executed only
once, before gawk starts to read the file /etc/passwd.</p><p>This automatic splitting of input lines into fields can be
used to make patterns more powerful by allowing you to restrict the
pattern matching to a single field. Still using /etc/passwd as an
example, if you wanted to see the full name of all users on your
Linux system (field 5 of /etc/passwd) who prefer to use csh rather
than bash as their chosen shell (field 7 of /etc/passwd), you could
run the following gawk program:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# (in awk, anything after the # is a comment)
# change the field separator so we can separate
# each line of the file /etc/passwd and access
# the name and shell fields
BEGIN { FS=":" }
$7 ~ /csh/ {print $5}
</pre><p>The gawk operator <b  >~</b> means &ldquo;matches&rdquo;, so
we are testing if the contents of the seven field match
<b  >csh</b>. If the match is found, then the action
block will be executed and the name will be printed. Also, remember
that since patterns match substrings, this will also print the
names of tcsh users. If a particular input line does not contain a
seven field, no problem&mdash;no match will be found for this pattern.
Similarly, the pattern <b  >$7 !~ /bash/</b> will run its
action block if the contents of the seven field do
<span   class="bold"><b>not</b></span> match the pattern
<b  >bash</b>. (Unlike the match operator, this pattern
will match if $7 does not exist in the current input line. Recall
that if we try to access a field beyond NF, its value will be NULL,
and NULL does not match /bash/, so the action block for this
pattern will be executed.)</p><p>To further demonstrate the power of fields and pattern
matching, let's go back to the problem of dealing with case
sensitivity in pattern matching. By using a built-in function,
<b  >toupper()</b> or <b  >tolower()</b>, we
can change the case of all or selected parts of the input line.
Suppose we have a data file containing names (the first field) and
phone numbers (the second field), but some names are all lower
case, some are all upper case and some are mixed. We could simplify
the matching by modifing the pattern to:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
toupper($1) ~ /LINUX/ {print $0}
</pre><p>This will cause the name in field 1 to be converted to upper
case before awk tries to match it against the pattern. No other
parts of the input line will compared against the pattern.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2728580.0x2819518"></a>Control Structures</h2></div></div><p>The control statements in the gawk language closely resemble
those found in C, thus making gawk more easily written and
understood by C programmers. gawk contains the pre- and
post-increment and decrement operators <b  >++</b> and
<b  >--</b>, as well as an if-else statement that looks
very much like the one found in C. Also multi-line blocks of code
are grouped within <b  >{</b> and <b  >}</b>.
Even the for loop seems to have been taken right out of a C
programming book.</p><p>This allows you to &ldquo;mix and match&rdquo; code which takes
advantage of gawk's pattern matching with code that uses more
traditional control structures, so if patterns are not sufficient
for your task (or you are not sure how to use them to accomplish
your task) you can use standard programming techniques as well.
Conventional programming with gawk is not covered here; the gawk
info page (run <b  >info gawk</b>) documents this well,
and the goal of this article is to demonstrate gawk's
distinguishing features.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2728580.0x2819830"></a>Variables and Arrays</h2></div></div><p>Another timesaving feature of gawk is that there is no need
to declare a variable before using it. A variable can be a string,
an integer, or a floating point number depending on the value
assigned to it. gawk will handle conversions for you automatically.
As a result, an expression such as <b  >total = 2 +
"3"</b> is valid and will give the expected result,
<b  >5</b>. To make your job even easier, gawk will
initialize each variable when it is used for the first time,
setting it to <b  >0</b> for an integer or
<b  >""</b> for an integer or a string, respectively.
This takes away any worries about uninitialized variables.</p><p>gawk also carries this ease of use of variables to arrays.
There is no need to declare an array before using it, or even to
specify a maximum size for that array. To create an array, simply
use it and gawk will allocate the required space for you. As you
add more data to the array, its size will automatically expand to
accomodate it.</p><p>However, the array indices in gawk differ from those in
languages such as C, in that gawk indices are associative, rather
than numeric.</p><p>In an associative array, the array index is associated with
the value assigned to it. This means that you can write expressions
such as <b  >theArray["text"]="this is a line"</b>. If
you wish, you can still use an integer as the index, as in
<b  >theArray[50] = "some value"</b>. It is also possible
to use a mixture of strings, integers, and even floating point
numbers as indices in the same array, since gawk treats all indices
as strings. So the expression <b  >theArray[50] = "some
value"</b> is equivalent to <b  >theArray["50"] = "some
value"</b>.</p><p>To make working with arrays as easy as possible, awk provides
the programmer with several powerful array operators. For example,
to test whether a value is present in an array you can use the
<b  >in</b> operator. For example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
if (someValue in theArray) {
   # action to take if somevalue is in theArray
}
else {
   # an alternate action if it is not present
}
</pre><p>To perform an action on all values in an array, such as
printing each value contained in it, you can use a variation of the
for loop, for example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
for (i in theArray) print i
</pre><p>gawk sets the variable <b  >i</b> to the next value
in theArray on each pass through the loop and then prints
it.</p><p>To remove a value from an array, simply use the delete
operator. For example, <b  >delete theArray["word"]</b>
will remove <b  >"word"</b> from
<b  >theArray</b>.</p><p>With associative arrays, you can quickly build powerful
applications without concern for the traditional overhead of
declaring the array, allocating the memory, or searching for an
item in the array. And size is not a factor&mdash;the following gawk
program easily read and stored all 45,101 words from the file
/usr/dict/words into an associative array (in this case, using the
number of the current line as the array index):</p><pre     class="programlisting">
{ words[NR] = $1 }
END { print NR " words read" }
</pre><p>Such a task would be much more involved in C, as you would
need to determine how you want to store all the words (An array
declared with a size sufficient for all 45101 character strings? A
linked list? A binary tree?). You may argue that with C you are
free to choose a data structure which will provide much more
efficient memory allocation and faster access speed than is
possible with an associative array. While this may be true, it does
not tell the whole story&mdash;it will certainly take you some time to
write and test this C program (and very likely, more time to debug
it). The power of the associative arrays and the simple,
transparent memory management built into gawk means that you are
free from dealing with such concerns&mdash;just tell gawk what you want
and it handles much of the hard work behind the scenes.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2728580.0x281a1d0"></a>Run-time Performance</h2></div></div><p>It seems impossible to have such ease of use together with
speed; there must be a trade-off. This is one area in which gawk
suffers&mdash;run-time performance. However, this is not to say that
gawk is a terribly slow language. Since gawk is interpreted rather
than compiled, it cannot compete with compiled languages for speed
of execution. (It also is somewhat slower than a comparable program
written in Perl.) However, if your main concern is getting a
working program written as quickly as possible, you probably do not
want to wrestle with C or C++ for a week to perfect the most
efficient algorithm. By trading off the speed advantages and
control features of C (or another compiled language) for ease of
use, gawk lets you get the job done quickly and relatively
painlessly.</p><p>If, however, execution speed is a critical point, gawk makes
an excellent tool for implementing and testing a prototype before
you start to code in C. And when the prototype is complete you may
find that the gawk version is fast enough to meet your
needs.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2728580.0x281a330"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>gawk offers the programmer a simple, somewhat C-like syntax,
automatic file handling, associative arrays, and powerful pattern
matching&mdash;features which can help you to create a program much more
quickly than with a more traditional language. gawk also has many
other useful and powerful features such as user-defined functions,
recursion, many built-in functions, regular expressions,
multidimensional arrays, formatted output using printf and sprintf,
even the ability to set variables on the command line. These
features are beyond the scope of this article. Without doubt,
gawk's interpreter will produce a slower running final product than
a C compiler, or even a Perl interpreter. But this slower execution
speed (it certainly is not slow!) is more than compensated for by
the speed and ease of program development and testing. When you
need a program to perform a task and you need it right now, whether
it is a quick-and-dirty, use-once program or a program that will be
getting plenty of use, <a href="1156r1.html" target="_self">gawk</a> may
prove to be the right language for the task.</p></div></div>
