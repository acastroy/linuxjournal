    Have you ever wanted to turn back time after making a
    mistake and irrevocably damaging a file you were editing?
    You can do so with minimal effort after reading this
    article.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x119c580.0x1294558"></a></h2></div></div><p>For years, software developers have been
keeping track of all their changes to programs they are developing
with what they call &ldquo;version control&rdquo; software. However, even
competent developers have sometimes found it too troublesome to use
these tools except where they find it absolutely necessary, and so
it is not surprising that very few non-developers have used these
tools at all.
</p><p>The reason that they find these tools so difficult to use is
that <span   class="emphasis"><em>the rules for how to use them are written with the
most complicated situations in mind.</em></span> For most personal
use of these tools, that is like learning to fly a jet aircraft in
order to drive a car. There is an easier way.</p><p>The assumption that makes everyone do so much extra work is
that <span   class="emphasis"><em>more than one person will be trying to modify the
file at the same time.</em></span> For your own personal files, or
for keeping track of changes to system files when you are the only
system administrator, that is not an issue.</p><p>The standard program for doing version control under Linux
(and most other versions of Unix) is GNU's
<span   class="bold"><b>RCS</b></span>, which stands for
<span   class="bold"><b>R</b></span>evision
<span   class="bold"><b>C</b></span>ontrol
<span   class="bold"><b>S</b></span>ystem. It has many options, but
you hardly need to know about any of them to make good use of it.
You can treat RCS as one of the simplest tools on your
system.</p><p>In fact, you can keep track of all the changes that you ever
make to a file with one command. Run the command <b  >ci -l
<i><tt>filename</tt></i></b> each time you make a
change to the file (&ldquo;ci&rdquo; stands for
&ldquo;<span   class="bold"><b>c</b></span>heck
<span   class="bold"><b>i</b></span>n&rdquo;; you are &ldquo;checking in your
changes&rdquo;). The first time you do this, you will be given the
option to describe the file:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ ci -l <span   class="emphasis"><em>foo</em></span>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>foo</em></span>,v  &lt;--  <span   class="emphasis"><em>foo</em></span>
enter description, terminated with single '.'
  or end of file:
NOTE: This is NOT the log message!
&gt;
</pre><p>You are not required to describe the file, but you can if you
like. Then type a <b  ><i><tt>.</tt></i></b>
character on its own line, or press <b  >^D</b> on an
empty line.</p><p>When you have made a change to the file, you need type only
one command to tell RCS to keep track of that change for
you:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ ci -l <span   class="emphasis"><em>foo</em></span>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>foo</em></span>,v  &lt;--  <span   class="emphasis"><em>foo</em></span>
new revision: 1.2; previous revision: 1.1
enter log message, terminated with single '.'
  or end of file:
&gt;
</pre><p>Here, you may wish to describe the change you have just made,
especially if you think you will want to examine the change at some
future time, but it is not required.</p><p>Remembering that single command is enough to prepare you for
disaster. The rest of this short article will show you a few easy
tricks that make RCS a <span   class="emphasis"><em>little</em></span> more comfortable
to use, and help you learn how to recover from disaster.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x119c580.0x12950b0"></a>Even Easier?</h2></div></div><p>If you think running one command each time you finish editing
a file is <span   class="emphasis"><em>still</em></span> too much work, we can make it
even easier for you! (Laziness is a <span   class="emphasis"><em>virtue</em></span> if
it causes you to work smarter instead of harder.)</p><p>We'll use a <span   class="emphasis"><em>shell script</em></span>. You can create
a file in your own &ldquo;bin&rdquo; directory (if your account is on a
computer shared with other people) or in /usr/local/bin (if you are
using your own computer). Whichever directory you choose must be
listed in your <b  >PATH</b>. To make it easy to type,
we'll call it <span   class="bold"><b>et</b></span>, short for edit
text.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/bash
# et - Edit Text file, while keeping
#      track of changes with RCS
[ -z "$1" ] &amp;&amp; {
  # No file specified on the command line
  echo "Edit what file?"
  exit 1
}
${EDITOR-vi} $1
# Only check in the file if it exists.
[ -f $1 ] &amp;&amp; ci -l $1
</pre><p>Type that into a file named
<span   class="bold"><b>et</b></span>, without making any typos. Then
run the command <b  >chmod +x et</b> to make the file
<span   class="emphasis"><em>executable</em></span>. Now, you will be able to run
<b  >et <i><tt>filename</tt></i></b> to edit
and then automatically check in your changes.</p><p>The <b  >#!/bin/bash</b> line tells Linux this
script is a shell script that is interpreted by the bash shell,
which comes as a standard part of every Linux distribution. All the
other lines starting with a <b  >#</b> character are
comments, and are ignored by bash.</p><p>If you decide that you will never want to include a
description of the changes you have made, you can change the last
line of the script to</p><pre     class="programlisting">
[ -f $1 ] &amp;&amp; echo "." | ci -l $1
</pre><p>The reason for the <b  >[ -f $1 ]</b> part is so
that if you type <b  >et
<i><tt>mistake</tt></i></b>, and then quit the
editor without saving the file, you won't get error messages when
ci finds that there is no file for it to check in.</p><p>The <b  >${EDITOR-vi}</b> part runs your favorite
editor, or if you have not chosen a favorite editor, it defaults to
the old standard vi editor. You can choose a default other than vi;
pico, jed, joe, Emacs, and other editors are all possibilities. For
example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
${EDITOR-jed} $1
</pre><p>will run jed, unless you have chosen some other favorite
editor.</p><p>To choose your favorite editor, which will apply to all
programs that want you to choose an editor, not just
<span   class="bold"><b>et</b></span>, you will need to set the
<b  >EDITOR</b> environment variable to the name of the
editor you want to use. If you are using a bourne shell, such as
bash, zsh, pdksh, ksh, or sh, you will want to add a line like the
following to the file .profile in your home directory:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
EDITOR=jed ; export EDITOR
</pre><p>If you use the C shell (csh or tcsh), you will want to add a
line like the following to the file .login in your home
directory:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
setenv EDITOR jed
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x119c580.0x1295cb8"></a>How Does It Work?</h2></div></div><p>RCS doesn't keep a whole new copy of the file each time you
check in changes. Instead, it records only the lines with changes
in them, along with the descriptions of the changes (if you choose
to provide them). It does this in a separate file. Changes to the
file <span   class="emphasis"><em>filename</em></span> are kept in the file
<span   class="emphasis"><em>filename,v</em></span>. If you find this to be too much
clutter, you can tell RCS to stash the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>filename,v</em></span> file out of the way, in a
subdirectory called RCS. Simply create the subdirectory, and RCS
will automatically use it.</p><p>Remember what it looked like when the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>foo</em></span> file was checked in, above? Let's create a
<span   class="emphasis"><em>bar</em></span> file whose corresponding
<span   class="emphasis"><em>bar,v</em></span> file is kept out of sight in an RCS
directory:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ mkdir RCS
$ vi <span   class="emphasis"><em>bar</em></span>
$ ci -l <span   class="emphasis"><em>bar</em></span>
<span   class="bold"><b>RCS</b></span>/<span   class="emphasis"><em>bar</em></span>,v  &lt;--<span   class="emphasis"><em>bar</em></span>
enter description, terminated with single '.'
  or end of file:
NOTE: This is NOT the log message!
&gt;

$ ci -l <span   class="emphasis"><em>bar</em></span>

new revision: 1.2; previous revision: 1.1
enter log message, terminated with single '.'
  or end of file:
&gt;
</pre><p>If you did not originally create an RCS directory, and you
get tired of seeing the <span   class="emphasis"><em>,v</em></span> files, you can use
these commands to get them out of the way safely:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ mkdir RCS
$ mv *,v RCS
</pre><p>RCS will know where to search for them.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x119c580.0x128cde0"></a>Turning Back the Clock</h2></div></div><p>So what do you do when you screw up? You have carefully kept
copies of your changes, but how do you retrieve yesterday's
version, or last year's version, or the second most recent
version?</p><p>RCS keeps track of versions by <span   class="bold"><b>version
numbers</b></span>. The first version you check in is assigned the
number <span   class="bold"><b>1.1</b></span>, the second is assigned
the number <span   class="bold"><b>1.2</b></span>, the third
<span   class="bold"><b>1.3</b></span>, and so on.</p><p>When you find that you have made a mistake, you can compare
what you currently have with previous revisions. To compare against
the previous revision, use this command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ rcsdiff -u <span   class="emphasis"><em>filename</em></span>
</pre><p>The <b  >-u</b> tells rcsdiff to use the
&ldquo;<span   class="bold"><b>u</b></span>nified diff&rdquo; format to show
you the changes, and it compares the current version of the file
<span   class="emphasis"><em>filename</em></span> with the most recent version that was
checked in. Here's an example. The previously checked in version of
the file foo, version 1.3, consisted of:</p><pre     class="programlisting">

RCS system.  This is only a test.
</pre><p>I have since edited the current version to read:</p><pre     class="programlisting">

</pre><p><span   class="bold"><b>Before</b></span> checking this new
version in, I can check the differences between the current
contents of the file and the previous version that was checked in,

Initial revision
==============================================
</pre><p>The most important parts for you to understand are the
revision descriptions at the end. For example, under the
<span   class="bold"><b>revision 1.2</b></span> section, there is a
comment <b  >Added some text.</b> This is the comment
that you are allowed to type in after every revision. If you choose
not to enter a comment, it says instead:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
*** empty log message ***
</pre><p>which isn't particularly helpful when you are looking for a
change you made.</p><p>On the other hand, if you find entering a comment to be so
much work that you are tempted not to use RCS, you are better off
when things go wrong to be able to go looking for the version you
want than to have no information whatever. Don't avoid using RCS
because you feel you ought to describe every revision...</p><p>These logs become very long, very quickly. In order to look
at the log one screen at a time, use a pager program:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ rlog <span   class="emphasis"><em>bar</em></span> | less
</pre><p>Again, you can send the log to a file or print it, if you
prefer.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x119c580.0x15a2060"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>There is a lot <a href="1250s1.html" target="_self">more to RCS</a>
than can be found in this article, since this is a tutorial

RCS comes with a full complement of manual pages, as well as papers
about how to use RCS in a development environment. In addition,
