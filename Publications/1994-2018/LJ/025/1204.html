    If you have a valuable or fragile network to protect, you
    may want to protect it with a very strong, well-proven
    firewall. In this article, Benjamin Ewy explains very
    thoroughly how to build your own 'bastion host' firewall
    with Linux.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22ce580.0x23c6500"></a></h2></div></div><p>As more and more companies try to develop
a presence on the Internet, establishing a secure network perimeter
is becoming a very important topic. There are many varieties of
what are loosely referred to as firewalls. The general principle
behind a firewall is that it serves as a choke point between an
internal network and the outside world. The choke point only allows
traffic through that is deemed safe.
</p><p>IP-based filters are one common form of firewall that rely on
the source and destination addresses to decide which kind of
traffic to pass through. They have the advantage of flexibility in
that they can easily be adapted to different types of traffic as
needed. The primary disadvantage of IP-based filters is that they
rely on IP addresses as the principle form of authentication, and
they also lack the ability to look higher into the protocol layer
to determine exactly what kind of traffic is being sent.</p><p>Application-level gateways are another form of firewall that
often consist of a computer called a <span   class="bold"><b>bastion
host</b></span>. The bastion host runs a set of firewall software
which implements the policy &ldquo;that which is not expressly permitted
is prohibited&rdquo;. This policy is implemented at the application
level, which allows the bastion host to more completely control the
traffic that passes through it.</p><p>Implementing the interface between the internal and external
networks at the application level allows much more control over the
authentication for particular services and, in particular, allows
for many forms of <span   class="bold"><b>strong</b></span>
authentication. The main disadvantage of application-level
Firewalls is that they require interfaces for every specific
application that is to pass through the gateway. If a new
application interface is desired, either custom software must be
written or the service cannot be provided. The Trusted Information
Systems Firewall Toolkit (fwtk) is a very useful kit for creating
bastion hosts.</p><p>The fwtk supports the functions of a bastion host by
providing several small programs that can be pieced together as the
site operator desires while simplifying management with a common
configuration file. For each service the security policy allows to
pass through the firewall, a specific application level
<span   class="bold"><b>proxy</b></span> is required. The fwtk comes
with proxies for telnet, rlogin, SMTP mail, ftp, http, X window,
and a generic TCP plug-board server that works as a transparent
pass-through proxy for many other services.</p><p>Additionally, the fwtk comes with a tool called
<span   class="bold"><b>netacl</b></span>, which implements network
level access control, and <span   class="bold"><b>authsrv</b></span>,
which implements a network authentication service. This article
focuses on preparing a generic Linux host to be a bastion host,
obtaining and compiling the fwtk, and configuring its services to
support a secure network environment.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22ce580.0x23c6978"></a>Preparing Your Bastion Host</h2></div></div><p>The first step is to prepare the Linux host to be a
functional and secure bastion host. There are several principles
that firewall builders should adhere to. The ideal bastion host
should only provide proxy services and should not be a general
purpose machine. Only administrative accounts should be allowed,
and if possible, logins to the bastion host should be restricted to
the console, although allowing strongly authenticated remote access
for remote maintenance will be discussed. The bastion host should
not rely on any network services such as NIS or any form of remote
file access, such as NFS. Allowing either of these opens up
numerous holes that can compromise your bastion host.</p><p>Next, it is necessary to verify that the required
functionality is available with the Linux host. Every bastion host
has at least two network interfaces, one connected to the internal
network and the other connected to the external network access
point. These interfaces should be configured and tested prior to
any further modifications, and you should verify the accessibility
of your bastion host from both the internal and external networks.
Refer to the Linux NET2 HOWTO and the Linux Multiple Ethernet
mini-HOWTO as necessary.</p><p>The kernel should be rebuilt, ensuring that IP forwarding
(CONFIG_IP_FORWARD) is <span   class="bold"><b>disabled</b></span>
when you do <b  >makei config</b>. If IP forwarding were
enabled, the kernel would automatically forward packets from one
interface to the other interface if a route has been established.
Controlling this forwarding is what building a bastion host is all
about. Finally, if you want to provide a secure mechanism for SMTP
mail service, it is necessary to first configure and test sendmail.
Refer to the Linux Kernel HOWTO and the Linux Electronic Mail
HOWTO, as appropriate.</p><p>The next task is to secure the bastion host so that only the
proxy services are available. Begin by removing all unneeded
services from the inetd configuration file, /etc/inetd.conf. Simply
put a <b  >#</b> in front of each unneeded service line,
and when done editing the file, issue a <b  >kill
-HUP</b> to the process id of inetd (perhaps with
<b  >killall -HUP inetd</b>). Remove ftp, telnet, SMTP,
nntp, shell, login, talk, stalk, pop, uucp, ftp, bootp, finger,
systat, netstat and <span   class="bold"><b>every</b></span> other
service you are not expressly sure you want to provide. We will be
defining our proxy services in this file later.</p><p>Finally, prevent the startup of any stand-alone daemons by
cleaning out the boot files in /etc/rc.d, removing unneeded
programs. In particular, check the rc.inet2 file and comment out
rpc.portmap, rwhod, rpc.mountd, rpc.nfsd, rpc.ugidd, and ypbind.
After you are done removing services, reboot your bastion host and
carefully examine the output from a <b  >ps aux</b> and
check that you didn't miss any unnecessary programs. It is also a
good idea to run <b  >rpcinfo -p</b> and the port scanner
that comes with the fwtk in the tools directory to verify that all
unnecessary services are dead.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22ce580.0x23c6ea0"></a>Compiling the Firewall Toolkit</h2></div></div><p>Obtain the toolkit, Linux patches, and, if desired, the S/Key
package, as detailed in <a href="1204s1.html" target="_self">Obtaining Firewall
Resources</a>. Bellcore's S/Key provides one-time password
support for network authentication if built into the toolkit. A
number of commercial one-time password systems are also supported
by the fwtk, but their use is not detailed in this article.</p><p>Put the fwtk archive in /usr/src/, and run <b  >tar xfz
fwtk-v1.3.tar.Z</b> to unpack it. If you prefer to build in a
different place, modify the Makefile.config as appropriate. The
Linux patches that we will be applying assume /usr/src/fwtk is the
source code directory.</p><p>These patches are based on the work of Marco Pauck
(<a href="mailto:pauck@wmd.de">pauck@wmd.de</a>) and the
firewall-users mailing list. In addition, there are some
modifications and additions done by the author to allow the x-gw
proxy to work and to support the S/Key authentication mechanism.
Most of the patches work around Linux's select() function. Put the
fwtkpatches.tgz file into /usr/src/fwtk. Then run <b  >tar xfz
fwtkpatches.tgz</b> which will create a patches directory. Go
into the patches directory and run the INSTALL script or apply the
patches by hand. If you do not want S/Key support, run the
INSTALL.noskey script instead.</p><p>Assuming you want S/Key, put the S/Key archive in /usr/src
and run <b  >tar xfz skey-2.2.tar.gz</b> to un-archive
it. It is necessary to compile S/Key first so that its libraries
can be linked into the authentication service when we compile the
fwtk. This S/Key is already ported to Linux, so all that is
necessary to build it is to run <b  >make</b> inside the
/usr/src/skey-2.2 directory.</p><p>When the patches have been installed and S/Key has been
compiled, you can modify the Makefile.config if you want to change
any of the defaults, but the rest of this article will assume you
have left the Makefile.config as patched. Go to /usr/src/fwtk/ and
run <b  >make</b> and <b  >make install</b>.
The firewall components will be installed in /usr/local/etc/ by
default.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22ce580.0x23c73c8"></a>Configuring the Network Access Control
Lists</h2></div></div><p>The firewall toolkit is made up of three main components:
netacl, authsrv, and the various service proxies. Netacl is similar
to the tcp wrapper, tcpd, that is common on many Linux systems.
Netacl is used to check rules on a per-service basis and take the
defined action. You edit your /etc/inetd.conf file to call netacl,
passing the normal service to netacl as its first parameter. An
example entry for the finger service might look like
<a href="1204l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a>. inetd will invoke
netacl when a connection is made on the finger port.</p><p>Netacl looks in the common configuration file to see what
action to take. The common configuration file is called the
netperm-table and is found in /usr/local/etc/netperm-table. A
default netperm-table that has many examples, in addition to the
ones presented in this article, is installed automatically. Netacl
looks in the netperm-table and reads entries that start with
<b  >netacl</b>. Netacl understands the
<b  >permit-hosts</b> and <b  >deny-hosts</b>
options for defining access lists and requires
<b  >-exec</b> to be defined for each line as well, as
shown in <a href="1204l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2</a>.</p><p>A given <span   class="emphasis"><em>service</em></span> can have multiple lines
of both the permit and deny varieties. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Address</em></span>
can be a list of hosts addresses, and wildcards such as *.my.domain
or 129.17.* are supported. The keyword <span   class="emphasis"><em>unknown</em></span>
matches hosts that cannot be resolved using DNS. The first rule
that matches is the one performed. Lines may not be broken.</p><p>In the examples given in this article, the following
conventions will be used: .internal.net will represent your
internal network. ftp.server.internal.net will represent a ftp
server internal to your network. www.server.internal.net will
represent a www server internal to your network.
compute.server.internal.net is a compute server internal to your
network. trusted.external.net is an external network that you
trust. bastion.host.internal.network will represent your bastion
host's IP address.</p><p>An important point is that these rules are not associated
with a network interface. If you write rules for a service to allow
your internal private network to have special access rights, you
must ensure that those IP addresses could only have been received
from your internal network. IP spooling can be used to pretend to
be a host on your internal network and take advantage of your
rules. This can be prevented by using screening routers to block
packets claiming to be from the internal network when they arrive
on the external network connection. Often your Internet provider
can implement this type of rule in the router that feeds your
site.</p><p>The first line of <a href="1204l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3</a>
will exec in.fingerd if the requesting host is a member of
trusted.external.network. The second line will match all others and
cat a message of your choice. This might be a &ldquo;fake&rdquo; finger
output to mislead attackers or a simple explanation that the
service is unavailable. Netacl is often used for permissions on
services that you are not proxying but can also be used to switch
among the proxy or the real service based on the origin of the
connection. This feature will be discussed in more detail
later.</p><p>The netperm-table also contains configuration information for
all of the proxies, as shown in <a href="1204l4.html" target="_self">Listing
4</a>. The format is similar to the netacl format, and each
rule can contain multiple lines. These options will be discussed in
more detail for each proxy later.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22ce580.0x23c7aa8"></a>Providing a Network Authentication
Service</h2></div></div><p>Authsrv is the authentication server for the firewall
toolkit. The authentication server is optional but allows multiple
types of authentication to be managed in a consistent manner.
Support for the authsrv daemon's authentication by is built into
all of the proxies in the firewall toolkit, and can be selectively
enabled in the netperm-table on a per-proxy or even
per-<b  >permiti-hosts</b> basis.</p><p>Authsrv has support for many different types of
authentication, including internal plain-text passwords, and
several forms of <span   class="bold"><b>strong</b></span>
authentication using one time passwords compatible with Bellcore's
S/Key, Security Dynamic's SecurID, Enigma Logics' Silver Card, and
Digital Pathways' SNK004 Secure Net Key. In our example, we have
compiled S/Key and its support into authsrv, but the other
mechanisms are similar and their details can be found by looking in
the /usr/src/fwtk/auth directory. S/Key is a challenge-response
one-time password system that will present you with a sequence
number and a key at login time. You must give the sequence number,
key, and your own private pass-phrase to an S/Key calculator, and
it will return a 6 word password. That password will be valid only
for that particular sequence number, and it has the property that
it was created using a non-reversible algorithm, so it is not
possible to easily calculate the next password even if the current
one is known. This type of strong authentication is one of the best
features of using the fwtk.</p><p>To configure the authsrv it must be added to the inetd.conf
so that inetd will start it, as shown in
<a href="1204l5.html" target="_self">Listing 5</a>.</p><p>Since authsrv is not a well known service, an unused port
must be selected and added to the /etc/services file. The fwtk
configuration manual suggests port 7777. The corresponding
/etc/services entry would then be:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# Example services entry
authsrv 7777/tcp
</pre><p>As before, when you change the /etc/inetd.conf file, you must
send a <b  >-HUP</b> signal to inetd to cause it to read
in the changes.</p><p>Configure authsrv itself by setting up its options in the
netperm-table. Authsrv recognizes the <b  >database</b>,
<b  >permit-hosts</b>, <b  >nobugus</b>,
<b  >userid</b>, and <b  >badsleep</b> options.
The database option tells authsrv where to find its database, and
the <b  >permit-hosts</b> can be used to restrict which
hosts can query the authsrv. It is recommended that authsrv be run
on the bastion host so that the database is protected from misuse.
An example config might include the entries shown in
<a href="1204l6.html" target="_self">Listing 6</a> in the
netperm-table.</p><p>In our example, the bastion host is running the authsrv
daemon, and the bastion host is the only host with proxies
requiring authentication by our server. We restrict the authsrv
requests to come <span   class="emphasis"><em>only</em></span> from the bastion host to
prevent unauthorized probing of the database.</p><p>Next, we set up an S/Key-based admin account on our bastion
host. First, the auth database needs to be initialized. The best
way to do this is to run authsrv as root. Then add an admin user
and enable logins for that user by entering the following at the
authsrv prompt:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
authsrv# adduser admin
authsrv# enable admin
</pre><p>Set the protocol to skey, and give the the user wizard
privileges:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
authsrv# proto admin skey
authsrv# superwiz admin
</pre><p>Then you need to set the admin password. S/Key allows your
password to be several words long. Enter your phrase between
quotes:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
authsrv# password admin "my neat password phrase"
ID admin s/key is 664 wa56038
authsrv# exit
</pre><p>The output returned by authsrv after your pass-phrase is the
next sequence number it will use for a challenge and its key. You
can use them to generate one-time passwords, as needed, using the
<span   class="bold"><b>key</b></span> program (read its man page,
found in /usr/src/skey-2.2/key). For example, if you are challenged
with:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
S/Key Challenge: s/key 663 wa56038
</pre><p>run <b  >key 663 wa56038</b> and enter in your
pass-phrase. It will respond with a six-word phrase that you can
enter to authenticate yourself. If you are going to be traveling,
there are Macintosh and DOS versions of the S/Key calculator, or
you can have key print out a list of your next passwords by running
<b  >key -n <i><tt>number</tt></i> 663
wa56038</b>, and it will print out your next
<span   class="emphasis"><em>number</em></span> passwords and their appropriate
sequence numbers.</p><p>There is another program called authmgr which can be used to
remotely administer the authentication database. There are many
features in addition to those shown here, such as groups and group
permissions for users, and the ability to specify authentication on
a per-user, per-time basis. These additional features can be found
in the authd man pages. Finally, there are two utilities called
authdump and authload which allow you to take snapshots of the
current database, for archival or administrative purposes, and then
reload the database.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22ce580.0x23beff0"></a>Configuring and Using the Proxy Services</h2></div></div><p>This section focuses on the configuration and use of the
service proxies for telnet, ftp, http, and SMTP mail. Common
methods for configuring these services are discussed, but each of
them has many options and are very flexible. The man pages for each
of the services should be reviewed to determine if other
configurations might suit your installation better. The proxies for
rlogin and X-Windows are configured similarly to the telnet proxy.
The Generic TCP plug-through proxy can be used for NNTP news
transfers, talk sessions, or any other TCP service a site wishes to
pass through the firewall.</p><p>The telnet proxy is called tn-gw. The tn-gw has many options,
including the <b  >permit-hosts</b> and
<b  >deny-hosts</b> lines as seen on other services, and
a number of message options. The fwtk configuration manual
discusses how to use netacl to allow both telnet service to the
bastion host and the telnet proxy to coexist on the bastion host,
although this is just one of many possible configurations.</p><p>First, use netacl to switch the service based on the origin,
as shown in <a href="1204l7.html" target="_self">Listing 7</a>, which shows
an /etc/inetd.conf entry, and <a href="1204l8.html" target="_self">Listing
8</a>, which shows the additions to the netperm-table.</p><p>When a telnet connection is started, inetd calls netacl.
Netacl looks at the source IP address, and if it is not from the
bastion host, it calls the tn-gw proxy. The tn-gw proxy prints a
denial message and closes, if the source address is unknown, and
will allow a non-authenticated connection to
compute.server.internal.net only from .trusted.external.net.
Connections from the internal net have no restrictions (the
default) on their destinations, and users are allowed to change
their bastion host passwords if they are coming from the internal
network. Additionally, connections from the internal net to the
bastion host itself are allowed. Finally, all other hosts are
allowed to go to any destination other than the bastion host
itself, after they authenticate with the specified authserver. You
might not want to use this setup (allowing unauthenticated access
from any external site is not a good idea) but it presents many of
the options the toolkit offers.</p><p>If a user is on the internal network and wants to have telnet
access to the external network, they <b  >telnet
bastion.host</b> and then type <b  >c
external.host</b> to connect to the external host.</p><p>If a user is on the external network and wants to connect to
an internal host they will have to <b  >telnet
bastion.host</b>, enter their userid and authentication as
required by specific authentication type, and then <b  >c
internal.host</b>.</p><p>Finally, if an administrator wants to connect to the bastion
host from the internal network, they <b  >telnet bastion
host</b>, then <b  >c bastion.host</b>, and netacl
will start the real telnet service on the bastion host.</p><p>Next, we will configure the ftp proxy system. We will assume
your site does not want to provide anonymous ftp service from the
bastion host to the external network. The TIS configuration guide
discusses in more detail how to configure a site that supports
anonymous ftp and the ftp proxy on the same host. Our example will
only have the ftp proxy on the bastion host.</p><p>The inetd.conf file will need to be modified to call the
ftp-gw proxy. Netacl is not used since we are not switching the
service being provided, as we were in the telnet example. The
inetd.conf line is shown in <a href="1204l9.html" target="_self">Listing
9</a>. Then establish the permissions in the netperm-table, as
shown in <a href="1204l10.html" target="_self">Listing 10</a>.</p><p>These lines will print the ftp-deny.txt file and close the
connection if the reverse name lookup fails; internal nodes will be
allowed to ftp through the gateway without authentication, but
<b  >RETR</b> and <b  >STOR</b> transactions
are logged. Additionally, it will allow external nodes to connect
to the internal ftp server after authentication with the
authserver, logging <b  >RETR</b> and
<b  >STOR</b> transactions.</p><p>Users on the internal network will ftp to the bastion host
and enter their destination at the username prompt. To be forwarded
to the site big.archive as user bob, they need to enter
bob@big.archive at the bastion host's username prompt, and it will
forward the connection. Users on the external network will have to
authenticate themselves first and then enter their destination.
This is discussed in more detail in the ftp-gw man page.</p><p>Now, configure the proxy for http. This is similar to the
other proxies and can have a relatively simple configuration.
First, add the line in <a href="1204l11.html" target="_self">Listing 11</a>
to the /etc/inetd.conf file, and then set up the netperm-table
configuration entries shown in <a href="1204l12.html" target="_self">Listing
12</a>.</p><p>This configuration will allow internal hosts to go out to
wherever they want without authentication and allow external hosts
to connect to the www.server.internal.net host without
authentication. Check the http-gw man page for options involving
specific authentication of particular http actions.</p><p>For users on the internal network, we can configure their
proxy-aware web browser to transparently pass through the firewall
http proxy. We will use the Netscape browser as our example. Find
the Network Preferences menu under the Options menu. Under that,
there is a section on proxy configuration. Select manual proxy
configuration and enter the IP address of your bastion host for
each of the proxied services and their respective ports. Now you
can again use normal http addresses, and the browser will do all
necessary requests automatically through the bastion host.</p><p>Our final service to be proxied is SMTP mail. The fwtk comes
with two programs&mdash;smap and smapd&mdash;which serve to reduce problems
with sendmail and insulate it from some attacks. They do use
sendmail, however, so this section will assume that the sendmail
configuration for the bastion host has already been setup and
debugged. Sendmail configuration is well outside the scope of this
article. The Linux Electronic Mail HOWTO can be consulted as
necessary.</p><p>Smap is a minimal SMTP client that is invoked by inetd,
accepts SMTP mail messages, and writes them to a special spool
directory. Smapd is a daemon that replaces sendmail in rc.M (or
whichever boot script starts sendmail in your distribution). Smapd
will look at the spool directory and deliver messages using
sendmail periodically. This time, three changes need to be made.
<a href="1204l13.html" target="_self">Listing 13</a> shows an
/etc/inetd.conf entry to smap, <a href="1204l14.html" target="_self">Listing
14</a> shows how to start smapd from a boot script, and
<a href="1204l15.html" target="_self">Listing 15</a> shows the
netperm-table entries.</p><p>Next, create the /var/spool/inspool directory and make it
owned by uucp. Run <b  >mkdir /var/spool/inspool; chown uccp
/var/spool/inspool</b>. Finally, run sendmail from a cron job
so that it can process any entries that could not be delivered. A
line like:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
0,30 * * * * /usr/lib/sendmail -q &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1
</pre><p>should be added to root's crontab.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22ce580.0x23bfeb8"></a>Final Points and Additional Resources</h2></div></div><p>The TIS Firewall Toolkit is a very flexible and useful
collection of programs for creating bastion hosts. A collection of
examples of how to configure a Linux-based bastion host have been
presented. Many of these programs have additional features, and the
documentation that comes with the toolkit should be read to get the
most out of these programs. Several additional tools, such as a
portscanner and several log summary generators, come with the
fwtk.</p><p>One final step before completing your bastion host is the
removing of any unnecessary programs that may have been installed.
In general, new holes are found every day, so the fewer programs
installed, the better. This includes gcc! Without a compiler, many
hackers are limited in what they can do if they should break in. It
is a good idea to run Tripwire on your system after it is
configured, to provide a safeguard against unauthorized
