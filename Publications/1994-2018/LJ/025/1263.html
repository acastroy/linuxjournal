      Apple and Linux, the Linux server, other architectures,
    Linux Matters and Linux 2.0 announced.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b8e580.0x1c86240"></a></h2></div></div><p>Apple was perhaps one of the last
companies that most Linux developers and users expected to join the
Linux effort&mdash;until Apple's recent joint announcement with the Open
Software Foundation that they were supporting a port of Linux to
the Mach microkernel running on PowerMac computers. This
announcement was treated by Apple as if it were of equal importance
to their announcement of a large price cut on most of their
computers. The announcement was made on the fifth of February at
the Freely Redistributable Software Conference, and made
international news that day and the next.
</p><p>Linux had already been ported to some PowerPC machines before
Apple's work was started; see the Linux/PowerPC web page at
<a href="http://www.linuxppc.org/linuxppc" target="_self">http://www.linuxppc.org/linuxppc/</a>
for the latest information. They have successfully run Linux/PPC on
a Motorola PowerStack computer. The work that the OSF did is
significantly different; instead of porting Linux directly to
PowerMacs, they ported Linux to <span   class="bold"><b>OSF
MK</b></span>, the Open Software Foundation Microkernel, based on
Mach 3. In microkernel parlance, this is creating a Linux
&ldquo;server&rdquo;. While they did that, they also ported OSF MK to the
PowerMac. After completing those projects, porting their Linux
server to OSF MK on the PowerMac took less than three weeks. That
doesn't mean that it is production quality yet, but that is
significantly faster progress than most ports of Linux.</p><p>The Linux server creates other potential advantages, besides
making Linux quickly available on Apple PowerMacs. For instance,
OSF MK has been ported to platforms that Linux has not yet been
ported to, such as Intel i860 and HP PA-RISC. Developers wishing to
port to such platforms may find it easier to port the Linux server
to OSF MK on those platforms than to do a complete port of Linux to
those platforms, or may find it easier to start their port by first
porting the Linux server, and then working on porting the standard
monolithic Linux kernel.</p><p>Just as at DEC, Linux support at Apple is a serious part of
company strategy supported by corporate management. By maintaining
close contact and a friendly relationship with the developers
working on the other Linux/PPC ports (Motorola, Be, FirePower, and
IBM), Apple has assured the Linux community that it is not
attempting to take over Linux development, but instead has become a
contributing member of the community.</p><p>The work has not only contributed to Linux, but also to OSF
MK. Several performance improvements and extensions were made to
OSF MK to improve the performance of the Linux server, which may
also improve the performance of other servers on OSF MK.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b8e580.0x1c86558"></a>But That's Not Linux!</h2></div></div><p>Linux is designed as a monolithic operating system, the
antithesis of a microkernel-based operating system. Many people
have remembered that Linus has said that he is not interested in
making Linux be a microkernel operating system. Doesn't creating a
Linux server violate the whole idea of Linux?</p><p>Not in the least. First of all, the great majority of the
source files were unmodified. Of 909 original files in the Linux
source code, only 43 had to be modified. Second, the source code to
everything, including the drivers in the microkernel, is freely
available, and can be used to develop a monolithic Linux/PowerMac
if there are sufficiently interested developers. Finally, no one is
suggesting that the Linux server should replace the monolithic
version of Linux as the official version.</p><p>For more information, see the web site:

on the sun4c architecture to the point where it is now able to run
all normal SunOS X-based binaries correctly, including Netscape,
and work on the native user environment is proceeding at a rapid
pace.</p><p>On February 17th, David Miller (the leader of the Linux/Sparc
team) announced that he had achieved a shell prompt on the sun4m
architecture; specifically a Sun SparcClassic. (if you don't know
why that is significant, read the series of articles on porting
Linux to the DEC Alpha in <i  >Linux Journal</i> issues
18-21.) On the 20th, he &ldquo;apologized&rdquo; for that &ldquo;lie,&rdquo; announcing
that it now &ldquo;runs all the programs that work on the
sun4c&rdquo;.</p><p>Several other developers, including Miguel de Icaza, are hard
at work developing a full user environment and distribution of
Linux/Sparc. Keep an eye on <i  >Linux Journal</i> and
the comp.os.linux.announce newsgroup if this whets your
appetite.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b8e580.0x1c869d0"></a>Linux in the News</h2></div></div><p><i  >Linux Journal</i> is no longer the only
magazine which covers of Linux. In February,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Byte</em></span> ran a cover story entitled
<span   class="bold"><b>Linux Matters</b></span>, which explained
that Linux isn't just inexpensive, it's also worth using.
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Infoworld</em></span> has regularly given Linux reasonable
coverage; In the February 19th issue, Nicholas Petreley's reaction
&ldquo;mimicked the attitude of my 2-year-old daughter at a toy store:
`gimme have it.&rdquo;' Linux has been regularly mentioned in
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Dr. Dobb's</em></span> and <span   class="emphasis"><em>Unix Review</em></span>
for over a year. Of course, we still think that <i  >Linux Journal</i> is the best place to get your Linux information
fix.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b8e580.0x1c86d40"></a>Recent Development</h2></div></div><p>As we announced last month, Linus is preparing to release a
new stable version of Linux, provisionally called Linux 2.0. More
features that will be interesting to our readers include true NFS
caching, made possible by the new &ldquo;page cache&rdquo; which debuted in
the 1.3.51 kernel, SMP on Pentium Pros, VFAT filesystem (Windows 95
&ldquo;long filename&rdquo;) support, APM (Advanced Power Management,
normally used on laptops) capabilities, and disk quotas.</p></div></div>
