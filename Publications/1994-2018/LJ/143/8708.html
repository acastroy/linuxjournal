The first steps toward securing your Web site with the versatile
mod_security Apache module.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbba580.0xcb23a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
What is more important than Web security? No matter how advanced
your firewall, how compartmentalized your network and how strong
your encryption, it all comes crashing down if your Web applications
are vulnerable. On the one hand, there's no substitute for stringent
user-input validation and other secure programming practices. But on
the other hand, the stakes are too high to operate without
<span   class="emphasis"><em>some</em></span>
sort of safety net.
</p><p>
Ivan Ristic has given us just such a safety net: his excellent Apache
module mod_security acts as an application-layer proxy between users and
your Web applications. The mod_security module can stop SQL injection,
cross-site scripting and other input-based Web attacks dead in their
tracks, with only minimal effort on your part, and with no impact at
all on either your Web developers or your users.
</p><p>
In this article, I tell you what you need to know to install and
begin configuring mod_security on your own Apache-based Web server.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbba580.0xcb25b0"></a>
Why You Need mod_security</h2></div></div><p>
Space doesn't permit a comprehensive explanation of the entire range of
threats that mod_security was designed to help mitigate. If you're new
to Web security, your first stop should be the Open Web Application
Security Project (OWASP) Web site (see the on-line Resources), home of the
OWASP Top Ten Most Critical Web Application Security Vulnerabilities. A
reasonable second stop is Chapter 10, &ldquo;Securing Web
Servers&rdquo;, of my
book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Server Security</em></span>, 2nd edition, or Ivan Ristic's book
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Apache Security</em></span>.
</p><p>
For our purposes here, suffice it to say that of the different types
of vulnerabilities in Web servers, by far the most typical is poor or
incomplete user-input validation. In fact, many of the items on the
OWASP Top Ten list are really just subsets of this family of problems;
command injection and cross-site scripting, for example, are types of
user-input abuse. User input, of course, includes not only the URLs
requested in HTTP GET requests, but also the data sent in POST commands.
</p><p>
The mod_security module gives your Apache Web server increased ability
to inspect and process input from Web clients before it's acted on by
the scripts or processes waiting for the input. The mod_security module
even lets you inspect Web server output before it's transmitted back
to clients. I love this feature: it allows you to watch out for server
responses that might indicate that other filters have failed and an
attack has succeeded!
</p><p>
The mod_security module also lets you automatically log events and session
data that Apache wouldn't ordinarily log. This is useful not only for
forensics purposes, but also for fine-tuning your mod_security rules.
If you create stringent mod_security filters that you're worried may
be triggered by legitimate traffic, you can set those filters only to
log rather than actually dropping or redirecting the requests that
trigger them.
</p><p>
But wait, there's more: mod_security works against encrypted Web
traffic too! Because mod_security has access to transaction data before
SSL encryption and after SSL decryption, mod_security can filter HTTPS
traffic just as effectively as it filters HTTP.
</p><p>
Why wouldn't you need mod_security? Arguably, if you have a
&ldquo;brochure-ware&rdquo; Web site that involves no databases or cgi scripts,
serving up instead only static Web pages, mod_security might not be worth
the trouble of setting up. I would suggest, however, that even on such
a server, mod_security still might do some good for you, for example,
in inhibiting certain types of information-gathering attacks. Read on,
and decide for yourself.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbba580.0xcb2920"></a>
Getting and Installing mod_security</h2></div></div><p>
The mod_security module runs on both Apache 1.3 and Apache 2.0. Although
for most Linux distributions, you'll need to install mod_security from
source, Debian has its own binary packages for mod_security.
</p><p>
If you run Debian, install the package mod-security-common, plus
either libapache2-mod-security or libapache-mod-security,
depending on whether you run Apache version 2 or 1, respectively.
Although
Debian's mod_security packages are for mod_security version 1.8.7, rather
than the more-advanced version 1.9, this article is sufficiently basic
to apply equally to versions 1.8.7 and 1.9.
</p><p>
If you run SUSE or Red Hat Enterprise Linux, you need to download
the latest source code from <a href="http://www.modsecurity.org" target="_self">www.modsecurity.org</a> and compile
it using the apsx or apsx2 command (part of SUSE's
apache-devel and apache2-devel packages, respectively,
and RHEL's httpd-devel package). All you need to do, once you've
got apsx or apsx2 installed and have obtained the source code file
mod_security.c, is issue one of these two commands from within
the directory containing mod_security.c:

<pre     class="programlisting">
/usr/sbin/apxs -cia mod_security.c
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbba580.0xcb2b88"></a></h2></div></div><p>
or

<pre     class="programlisting">
/usr/sbin/apxs2 -cia mod_security.c
</pre>
</p><p>
See the ModSecurity User Guide, or the mod_security source code's INSTALL
file, for more information on installing mod_security from source.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbba580.0xcb2d40"></a>
Configuring mod_security</h2></div></div><p>
The mod_security module, like all other Apache modules, is controlled from
httpd.conf in Apache 1.3, or apache2.conf in Apache 2.x. On
the one hand, mod_security's configuration parameters are straightforward
to use and well documented. But on the other hand, as of this writing,
there is no default configuration; the assumption is that you know
enough about your environment and about Web security to create your own
configuration from scratch.
</p><p>
And indeed, only you (and your Web developers) know what sorts of
input are legitimate for the Web applications on your particular
server. However, a minimum default configuration would be nice to
start out with, wouldn't it? Luckily, one <span   class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> provided, in the
ModSecurity User Guide.
</p><p>
The rest of this article consists of a dissection of this minimum
configuration, which should give you a taste of mod_security's power. For
more a complete reference on mod_security configuration parameters and
more-advanced examples, see the on-line Resources
for this article.
</p><p>
Rather than presenting the entire configuration in one imposing list,
let's break it up into manageable chunks. Listing 1 contains some basic
settings.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbba580.0xcb2fa8"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Listing 1. Beginning of mod_security Parameters in
apache2.conf/httpd.conf
</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;IfModule mod_security.c&gt;
	SecFilterEngine On
	SecFilterDefaultAction "deny,log,status:403"
	SecFilterScanPOST On
	SecFilterCheckURLEncoding On
	SecFilterCheckUnicodeEncoding Off
	SecFilterForceByteRange 1 255

</pre></div><p>
The first line in Listing 1 simply checks to see whether mod_security
even has been enabled; if it isn't, the subsequent parameters are ignored. The
parameter SecFilterEngine controls whether mod_security's filtering
engine is enabled. The default value is Off, so you need to
set this explicitly either to On, which causes mod_security to inspect all data,
or DynamicOnly, which turns filtering on but tells mod_security to
ignore requests for static content (specifically, it ignores requests
with null handlers). Note that the DynamicOnly setting may not
behave precisely how you expect; although it can save CPU cycles, some
testing is in order if you use DynamicOnly.
</p><p>
SecFilterDefaultAction is very important. It defines the
default action to take on filter matches. In Listing 1, this is set
both to log the matching request and deny it with a status code 403
message. Obviously, you can specify multiple actions, separated by commas.
</p><p>
SecFilterScanPOST, if set to On, tells mod_security to
inspect not only GET requests, but POST payloads as well.
</p><p>
Setting
SecFilterCheckURLEncoding to On causes hexadecimal-encoded values
within URLs to be checked for valid values (0-9, A-F).
</p><p>
SecFilterCheckUnicodeEncoding can be set to On if your
Web server understands Unicode and uses UTF-8 encoding.
</p><p>
Finally,
SecFilterForceByteRange specifies the range of allowable ASCII values
in GET requests and in form data within POST requests.
</p><p>
On to our next set of parameters&mdash;Listing 2 shows some settings related
to logging.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbba580.0xcb33c8"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Listing 2. Logging-Related Parameters
</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">
SecUploadDir /tmp
SecUploadKeepFiles Off
SecAuditEngine RelevantOnly
SecAuditLog logs/audit_log
SecFilterDebugLog logs/modsec_debug_log
SecFilterDebugLevel 0
</pre></div><p>
SecUploadDir specifies a place for mod_security to store files
uploaded via POST requests for processing, but it won't actually use this
unless SecUploadKeepFiles is set to On. You probably don't
want to enable this feature unless you've got a script, specified by
a SecUploadApproveScript directive, that's ready to scan such
files, for example, a script that invokes ClamAV and can return the results
to mod_security. See the ModSecurity User Guide for more information on
the SecUploadApproveScript parameter.
</p><p>
Setting SecAuditEngine to On, RelevantOnly or
DynamicOrRelevant enables mod_security's powerful logging facility,
which captures much more information than Apache's default logs. On
causes all requests to be logged by mod_security, RelevantOnly
logs only those requests that trigger mod_security filters and
DynamicOrRelevant logs both relevant requests and requests with non-null
handlers. SecAuditLog specifies the file to which mod_security
should write its logs.
</p><p>
SecFilterDebugLog, obviously enough, specifies the file to
which mod_security should log internal debugging information. Setting
SecFilterDebugLevel to 0 turns off debug-logging; if you're actually
having problems with mod_security, or are fine-tuning its configuration,
you can set this to 1 for significant events (which will also be written
to the audit log), 2 for info messages or 3 for still-more-detailed
info messages.
</p><p>
Now, at last, we arrive at the real power of mod_security: customized
filters. Listing 3 shows three such filters.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbba580.0xcb36e0"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Listing 3. Some Custom Filters
</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">
    SecFilterSelective REQUEST_METHOD
    &#8618;"!^(GET|HEAD)$" chain
    SecFilterSelective HTTP_Content-Type
    &#8618;"!(^application/x-www-form-urlencoded$|^multipart/form-data;)"

    SecFilterSelective REQUEST_METHOD "^POST$" chain
    SecFilterSelective HTTP_Content-Length "^$"

    SecFilterSelective HTTP_Transfer-Encoding "!^$"
&lt;/IfModule&gt;
</pre></div><p>
Note the blank lines between filter groups. I inserted these to illustrate
that appending the string chain to the end of a filter links it to the
next one, such that the last filter in the chain will be evaluated only if
the request first matches all prior filters in the chain. In this sense,
chain is a little like an if-then statement.
</p><p>
The first pair of filters in Listing 3 checks to see whether the
request is <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> a GET or a HEAD request; if not, it then checks
to see if the request contains anything <span   class="emphasis"><em>other</em></span> than form data
(<tt  >content-type "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"</tt>) or an uploaded file
(<tt  >encoding-type "multipart/form-data"</tt>), which are the only two types
of encoding mod_security can parse. If both filters match, that is,
the request isn't form data or a file, the request is denied (see
SecFilterDefaultAction in Listing 1).
</p><p>
Note that our actual filter values
(<tt  >"!^(GET|HEAD)$"</tt> and
<tt  >"!(^application/x-www-form-urlencoded$|^multipart/form-data;)"</tt>)
are regular expressions. It's impossible for you to create your own custom
filters unless you're comfortable with regular expressions; if you aren't,
you may want to see Jeffrey Friedl's book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Mastering Regular
Expressions</em></span>,
2nd edition (O'Reilly Media, 2002).
</p><p>
The second pair of filters in Listing 3 first checks to see if the request
is a POST request. If so, it then checks to see whether the HTTP parameter
Content-Length is set to null; if so, the request is rejected. POST
requests are supposed to have proper lengths; if the length is null,
this almost certainly suggests an attack of some kind.
</p><p>
Our last example filter, which unlike the first two is a single-line
filter, protects us from non-null values for the HTTP parameter
Transfer-Encoding. In other words, we <span   class="emphasis"><em>want</em></span> Transfer-Encoding to be
set to null in HTTP requests, because the most common thing to set this
to is chunked, which is practically never necessary but has
been associated with attacks in the past.
</p><p>
Finally, we end with an &lt;/IfModule tag to indicate that we're done
specifying mod_security parameters. In practice, the statements in
Listings 1&ndash;3 would be in a single contiguous block; I split them
into three groups only for readability.
</p><p>
If you prefer to maintain your mod_security settings in a special file,
such as mod_security.conf, you can use an include statement
within httpd.conf or apache2.conf, for example:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Include /etc/apache2/mod_security.conf
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbba580.0x10ac068"></a>
Enabling mod_security</h2></div></div><p>
Once you've configured mod_security in httpd.conf or
apache2.conf, you're ready to enable it. In the case of Apache 1.x,
your httpd.conf needs to contain the line:

<pre     class="programlisting">
LoadModule security_module libexec/mod_security.so
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbba580.0x10ac1c8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
and possibly also:

<pre     class="programlisting">
AddModule mod_security.c
</pre>
</p><p>
If you run Apache 2.x, your apache2.conf file needs the line:

<pre     class="programlisting">
LoadModule security_module modules/mod_security.so
</pre>
</p><p>
This is true unless you run Debian and installed its mod_security deb
packages, in which case you need to run only the following command
(as root) from a command prompt:

<pre     class="programlisting">
a2enmod mod-security
</pre>
</p><p>
Once mod_security is enabled, you need to restart Apache in order to
load the module. After you do this, be sure to test your Web
applications to make sure you didn't Denial-of-Service attack yourself
via your mod_security configuration!
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbba580.0x10ac4e0"></a>
Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
With that, you should be ready to explore some more-advanced filters that
watch specifically for requests that your site shouldn't expect to see. I
strongly encourage you to take this next step; although I think this article
should have given you a good starting point, you can find examples of
much more powerful filters in the &ldquo;ModSecurity For Apache User
Guide&rdquo; and
other documents on the modsecurity.org Web site. Good luck, and stay safe!
