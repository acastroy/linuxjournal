Scalix and Zimbra offer promising e-mail solutions that exploit Ajax to
offer rich Web clients.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x253c580.0x26342f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Traditionally, there have been two paths to choose from when considering
mail servers. The Redmond path was some variety of Microsoft Exchange
Server with Outlook as the client, and possibly POP3/IMAP and Web mail
as a backup when out of the office.
</p><p>
The other path, the path of the penguin, was Sendmail or Postfix, or
possibly a more obscure mail transport agent (MTA) with POP3 and IMAP
as the connection to the mail client of your choice. If you wanted Web
mail, you'd use a package such as SquirrelMail running under Apache. There
were, of course, other choices, such as Lotus Notes, but by and large, most
e-mail installations used one of these two solutions.
</p><p>
Recently, the e-mail landscape has changed dramatically. For one thing,
rich client tools such as Gmail and Yahoo Mail have shown the promise of
Ajax (Asynchronous JavaScript And XML), taking Web mail from a standby
of last resort for travelers to a fully usable replacement for an e-mail
application such as Outlook or Evolution. More significantly, several
companies either have reached or are very close to the Holy Grail of
open-source e-mail, complete Exchange compatibility.
</p><p>
I'm sure there are many die-hard Linux folks out there who are silently
saying, &ldquo;who cares?&rdquo; But the reality is that in most
corporate-IT
environments, Outlook and Exchange are a well-entrenched aspect of the
company mentality. And, it's hard to blame companies for clinging to
them.
The terrible twosome are full of useful features, such as meeting and
calendar integration, that make them highly useful. On the other hand,
it would be difficult to find a Windows sysadmin willing to describe
administering an Exchange server as a pleasurable experience.
</p><p>
At last, these beleaguered MCSEs have a choice that doesn't involve
dumping Outlook and training their employees to use an entirely new
mail system. Projects such as OpenExchange, Zimbra and Scalix promise
the ability to phase out Windows-based Exchange servers without the end
users noticing.
</p><p>
Two of these projects, Scalix and Zimbra, are particularly promising
because they include highly functional Ajax clients as part of their
offerings. In this article, we look at the two, head to head.
</p><p>
Zimbra is an open-source project with a proprietary network edition,
which includes features such as product support, clustering and, in the
future, Outlook connectivity via MAPI. If you can make do without these
features, you're free to run the open-source edition and get support
in the forums. The network edition isn't cheap though, running you
$28 US/user with a 500-user minimum (or $1,500 US for a 50-user small-business
license). Significantly, Zimbra is still in beta, although it's well
along in the development cycle.
</p><p>
Scalix, in comparison, is fully closed source. It offers two different
versions, a community edition and an enterprise edition. As with Zimbra,
the enterprise edition will cost you money, and it comes with support. The
difference is that the Scalix community edition provides all the
functionality of the enterprise edition. However, the advanced features, such as MAPI compatibility (which lets you use Outlook directly with the
mail server for calendar and contact management), are available only for
25 users. After that, you'll be paying $60/user.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x253c580.0x26346b8"></a>
Installation Quirks</h2></div></div><p>
We tested both products under Fedora Core 4. For Zimbra, that and Red Hat
Enterprise Linux 4
are your only official Linux choices (at least for a supported, binary
install). Scalix offers those distributions as well, but adds several
flavors of SUSE to the supported list. Both products install without
much hair pulling; you answer a few simple questions (at least, simple
if you're familiar with setting up mail servers), and the installation
scripts do the rest.
</p><p>
At this point, I need to mention one of the irritating quirks of
Zimbra. It installs its SMTP, POP3, IMAP and HTTP/HTTPS servers in
high-numbered ports, and then uses iptables to map to them. So, for
example, port 80 gets mapped to port 7070, where Zimbra runs its Web-mail
client. This can come as a nasty surprise if you install Zimbra on a
host with an existing Web server.
</p><p>
By comparison, Scalix keeps all its network ports off existing Web
services, although it does take over mail-related ports such as SMTP
and IMAP, but that's what you'd expect a mail server to do.
</p><p>
Scalix has its own dangers for the unwary. You had better be familiar
with LDAP and how it specifies distinguished names. Scalix is all about
LDAP. To be fair, Scalix is trying to operate as a drop-in replacement for
Exchange, and Exchange makes heavy use of LDAP in its Active Directory
architecture. So this isn't an unexpected development. However, for a
sysadmin familiar with Sendmail doing a first-time install of Scalix,
a close reading of the documentation is in order.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8722f1.large.jpg"><img src="8722f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Both products come with a Web-based administration interface.
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x253c580.0x2634a80"></a>
Configuring the Products</h2></div></div><p>
Both Scalix and Zimbra offer command-line and Web-based configuration
tools. And in both cases, you can do much more from the command line than
you can from the Web. The philosophy seems to be that the Web should
be used for ordinary day-to-day operations, such as adding a new user,
and the command line is for more complex or less frequently used ones.
</p><p>
One headache both products share is that they have a ton of these
command-line programs. Zimbra has 74 programs you can use to control its
operation, and Scalix has 341 (yep 341) programs in its bin directory,
and they are so closely named that you may go mad trying to remember
the differences. For example, try figuring out whether you should be using
omdelapppdl or omdelapppdln. As I said, a close reading of the manual
is in order before you try anything fancy.
</p><p>
Zimbra comes configured with SpamAssassin and ClamAV already
installed. Scalix supports any Milter-based spam and antivirus tools. It
wasn't that difficult (with a little help from the very responsive
support board when I made a stupid mistake) to install them.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x253c580.0x2634c38"></a>
You've Got Mail</h2></div></div><p>
There's no question that the Zimbra Web-mail interface is both more
featureful and colorful. For example, put your mouse over a date and you
see the calendar for that date. Mouse over an e-mail address, and you see
the contact information for that person. Mouse over a Web address, and you
see a thumbnail of the site. Unfortunately, it's still a bit glitchy,
especially under Firefox. This is not a good thing for a product that
wears an open-source pedigree so proudly. Hopefully, these issues will
be resolved before the final release.
</p><p>
What Zimbra is currently lacking, however, is any kind of direct Outlook
support. Even though the Web site claims Zimbra will interface directly
with Outlook, this is in fact a TBA feature. So at least for the time
being, Zimbra is available only via its Web interface or by IMAP/POP3.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8722f2.large.jpg"><img src="8722f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Zimbra offers mind-boggling feature-rich Web mail.
</p></div></div><p>
By comparison, Scalix is almost pedestrian in appearance on the
Web. If you don't look carefully, you could swear that you're using
Outlook. That is probably by design, as Scalix wants to
replace Exchange seamlessly. You can do pretty much everything via the Web interface
that you can do directly from Outlook, except for anything having to do
with mail filtering.
</p><p>
It's when you add the Scalix plugin to Outlook that Scalix really
shines, however. I use Exchange on a daily basis at my workplace, and I am now
using Scalix for my personal e-mail outside of work. Honestly, there's
no practical difference between the two if you use Outlook. The mail-filtering options are a little different, but you really have to look
hard to see where the two diverge. Among the more useful features that it
shares in common with Exchange is the ability to define filtering rules
that run directly on the server. And, because ActiveSync talks to Outlook,
you can sync your PDA to your calendar, mail and contacts.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8722f3.large.jpg"><img src="8722f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Scalix: any resemblance to Microsoft Outlook is purely
coincidental.
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x253c580.0x26351b8"></a>
Which to Choose?</h2></div></div><p>
If you're trying to pick one over the other, I'd have to recommend that
you start by trying each of them out, because they both have free community
editions. Zimbra is probably more of a one-click setup than Scalix, and
it definitely involves less in-depth knowledge of things like LDAP. It also
has a sweet Web interface that should only get better as it is further
developed. On the other hand, it is still in beta as of this writing,
and lacks Outlook connectivity.
</p><p>
Scalix shows all the signs of an Enterprise-facing solution. It's
less intended for casual users setting up a personal server than for
a departmental or corporate environment with many users and complex
requirements. That being said, it wasn't that much of a strain to get
it set up for my personal domains. But for me, the killer feature is the
Outlook connectivity (and especially the free 25 licenses). Until clients
such as Evolution become better integrated with PDAs and other groupware
technologies, many of us are going to be stuck with Outlook as a mail
client, and only Scalix is offering a free solution that everything can
talk to.
