A few simple configuration tweaks could save you sleepless
nights over whether or not someone might crack your SSH server.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x229b580.0x23932f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Chances are, if you are the owner or administrator of a Linux machine,
you access it remotely from time to time, if not constantly. Be
it a workstation at home, a co-located server or a hobby machine, if
you are accessing Linux remotely, there is a good chance that you
are using the OpenSSH server on the remote machine with some type of
SSH client locally. (If you are not, you probably should be.) Although
it is true that the OpenSSH server and clients do a tremendous job at
encrypting the traffic that passes between systems, it also is true that
any d&aelig;mon listening for connections is a door handle
waiting to be turned by the black hats, the evildoers or the crackers.
The less-desirable folks in these
situations are, as the title states, demons seeking d&aelig;mons, a person or
group of people that usually are up to no good seeking listening d&aelig;mons
that, depending on the configuration of the machine, may or may not be
secure. Hackers can be defined as people who have relatively benign motives
for breaking into a system. Crackers often are thought of as hackers
with malicious intent. Neither the former nor latter is welcome on my
machines. In this article, I expand
on the basic OpenSSH configuration and cover ways to improve
the security of the SSH d&aelig;mon to offer more protection to
your machines. If you have a machine
that suffers a compromise, your machine may be helping to spread your
unpleasantness to others as well.
The Internet is one of the largest insecure data routes on the face of
our planet.
</p><p>
OpenSSH provides the means for secure communication over insecure
channels. The file sshd_config is the ruling party in the game of
secure shell configuration. The sshd_config file consists of multiple
options that can be changed to help improve the security of the listening
d&aelig;mon. Although it may seem that because it is a remote access tool
it should be secure right out of the box, this is
hardly the case. For the most part, a default installation of the OpenSSH
server will provide you with a relatively secure default configuration
but one that can be improved substantially by the machine's administrator.
</p><p>
When planning for remote access initially, it is suggested that you
consider
three major things for the access of your machines:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Who will be allowed access to the machines?
</p></li><li><p>
How will this access be provided?
</p></li><li><p>
From where will this access be allowed?
</p></li></ol></div><p>
We are going to assume that
we will be using the OpenSSH server to provide remote access. This
leaves us with the questions of who will be allowed remote access and from where
they will be allowed. For some, this may be simple; perhaps the machine
supports only a single user and remote access is carried out from a
single domain. For others, this can be quite a challenge when multiple
users that travel frequently are the machine's users.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x229b580.0x2393768"></a>
Who Is on the Invite List for This Devilish Party?</h2></div></div><p>
The first and foremost person on a Linux machine is the root user. This
is universally known, and it also should be universally known that if you need
to have remote root access to a machine, there are many better ways to
access as root than simply using SSH and logging in as root. If you think
about the fundamentals of a brute-force attack attempt, it is obvious
that the most relevant account that will be attacked is the root
account. One need not guess whether the
account is present; it is there. The sshd_config file lets us
specify that root is not allowed to log in remotely at all through the
PermitRootLogin directive.
</p><p>
I fully believe that the saying &ldquo;an ounce of prevention equals a
pound of cure&rdquo;
is highly accurate when dealing with remote-use accounts. Two
options allowed in the sshd_config file, UsersAllow and UsersDeny, are
more than an ounce of prevention, and although it may be one extra step
when adding an account, modifying the UsersAllow for each account added
provides that pound of cure that you may (thankfully) never need to
seek. To expand on the UsersAllow directive, you cannot specify
only particular users, but you also can specify particular users at specific hosts. So, if
in advance you know exactly who will need to log in and from where, the
minimal time overhead associated with adding these directives to the
sshd_config file provides the peace of mind for you to know you are
allowing remote access for only specific accounts from specific machines. Valid
users can be retrieved from the /etc/passwd file in standalone machines
or from the corresponding files in NIS or LDAP environments. Listing
1 is an example of parsing the previous month's security files to verify
which accounts have logged in successfully using SSH.

Monitoring Those Demons and Keeping Them in Their Place</h2></div></div><p>
Keeping a watchful eye on the demons seeking d&aelig;mons is relatively easy
and the (expected) default setup should be confirmed in the configuration
file. With the SyslogFacility set to AUTH, your sshd will log (via
syslog) to (paths and filenames may vary depending on distribution)
/var/log/messages and /var/log/secure. It is highly recommended that
a program such as Psionic's logwatch be used to monitor your system
logs. Logwatch will take care of parsing the logs, and you will
be able to decipher the sshd authorized logins as well as failures.
There is a distinct difference
between an invalid user and an authentication failure. An authentication
failure is a failure that occurs on an account that is present on the
machine, and an invalid user is exactly that. This can become relatively
important when you are choosing account names as well as contemplating
who will be on the AllowUser and DenyUser lists. For example,
you may not have an actual person named amanda using your machine, but you
are using the amanda open-source backup program. This said account, if
not added to the DenyUser specification, will trigger an authentication
failure rather than an invalid user flag. Although not necessarily
required,
I add the system accounts that are active to the DenyUsers list just to
be on the safe side. The most recent log entries from sshd scans show
that the system accounts have in fact been added to the probe list
(Listings 2 and 3).

Because user names have been mentioned, it is now appropriate to
discuss the possibility of the demons (the evildoers)
having one of the two credentials required for a login. In the event
of a Web server hosting personal accounts or from e-mail headers, it is
relatively easy to determine a user name on a particular machine. With
this, the demon has half of the user name/password combination, and if the
scanner goes beyond simply scanning common accounts and passwords, it is
easy to take the sshd scan one step further and begin brute-force attempts
at those accounts that already have been determined to exist on a machine.
</p><p>
There is no need to re-invent the protocol, only the need to improve
the current configuration. OpenSSH provides a strong end-to-end encryption method for networked machines. Updates continuously
are released to the code to address any insecurities that may come about. One
of the most relevant releases is the change from SSH v1 to SSH v2. Both
version 1 and 2 sshd servers have their own keys. In other words, with
SSH1 and SSH2, neither private nor public keys intermix. These
keys are independent of each other. Just as the keys are independent of
each other, so are the protocols, and it is possible through the Protocol
directive in the configuration to allow either protocol 1, protocol 2
or both. SSH1 is depreciated but is still in use in many organizations
and applications. It is advisable to check your sshd_config file, and if
you are not dependent on SSH1, disable this and run only protocol
2 on your server. This eliminates any chances of falling victim to an
insecurity associated with version 1.
</p><p>
Earlier, while you were perusing your password file to build your user
list,
you probably noticed that there is an sshd user with a home directory
of /var/empty and a name listed as Privilege-separated SSH. If this
user does not exist, the following is of particular importance, and
you will want to look further into running sshd in privilege-separated
mode. Privilege separation in sshd is a multipart process that entails
the sshd process of creating a privileged monitor process, which creates
an
sshd process with the privileges of the user. This user-owned process in
turn spawns the shell process. The privilege separation process is run
via chroot and is restricted to the /var/empty directory. For those
of you familiar with running processes in a chroot environment, this
privilege separation is the same. It allows protection to the listening
d&aelig;mon if a buffer overflow or similar
compromise is discovered. The /var/empty directory should be root-owned,
empty and it should not be world- or group-writable.
If an sshd user does not exist, privilege separation will
not work, and systems that lack mmap or anonymous memory mapping
compression must be disabled.
</p><p>
Consider a situation where a machine has a minimal amount of users that
are accessing it through SSH. Quite possibly, you own a machine that is
accessed only by a couple of accounts, and then su or sudo is used for
administrative purposes. Consider also the scripts that often are run to
seek the machines that are running an SSH server. Although it is possible
that the scripts may do a full-system port scan to expedite the scanning
and identify possible victims, a specific port (22 in the sshd case) is
often the only port scanned, and if found open, it is expanded upon. The
logical alternative to this, especially in machines with minimal users
logging in, is to run sshd on an alternate port. Specifically, in the
sshd_config file, one of the very first options is the port. By changing
the port from 22 to an alternate port, you can write off a good amount of
the scripts that are scanning for open port 22. This is such a trivial
configuration change, but it is one that will result in a drastic lessening of
brute-force attempts (Listing 4).

Given even the slowest typist on the planet, what would be the expected time
to allow them to enter a password? Assuming an eight-character password,
would it be eight seconds? Give them two seconds a character, and they have
a hearty 16 seconds. Allow them 20 seconds of network latency, and we are
at just more than 30 seconds, which seems like a more than generous amount of
grace time. This is often surpassed with the default sshd configuration,
though with the LoginGraceTime sometimes set as high as 120 seconds. This
is the maximum amount of time that the server allows for a successful
login. Ask yourself, if one were to knock on your house door and you were
behind it, what would the maximum amount of time for deciding
whether to let this person or people in? Coupled with this, we have another
unique login directive named MaxStartups. This MaxStartups directive can
be a very powerful deterrent when fighting the SSH scanners. MaxStartups
specifies the maximum number of concurrent unauthenticated connections
to the SSH d&aelig;mon. Note that this means unauthenticated connections.
Therefore, if a script were running, trying to brute-force its way into
the machine, and the script was able to fork processes, it could launch
multiple (maybe even hundreds) of login attempts almost simultaneously. A
good rule of thumb is to use one-third the number of your total remote users
with a maximum setting of 10.

Initiating the Changes</h2></div></div><p>
There is little to be considered to implement the changes
mentioned. The default configuration is merely a guide, and it is the
administrator's responsibility to expand on the guide and harden the sshd
configuration. Prior to making the changes, it is highly recommended that
you temporarily start sshd on an alternate port to provide yourself
with a back door should you misconfigure the primary sshd and lose
the connection. When issuing a restart on sshd, it is possible to make
a mistake in the configuration file, which will result in the d&aelig;mon
failing to restart (if it is first stopped). Doing <tt  >ssh -p
&lt;alternate port&gt;</tt>
will allow a second d&aelig;mon to run and provide you with a secondary secure
connection should the first one fail due to a configuration error. We
are after all, working remotely, and if we lose the SSH d&aelig;mon without
an alternate, physical access to the console will be required to make
further modifications. Even though it may seem obvious, it is worth
mentioning that you must issue a SIGHUP or restart the SSH
d&aelig;mon for any changes to take place. To expand further on the idea of
a second port being opened, it is possible to add a startup script for
a second sshd to run with an alternate sshd_config file that specifies
no options other than a single-user account from a single source. This
essentially allows you to guarantee yourself access from a (presumed)
secure machine if the initial d&aelig;mon is ever shut down.

Summarizing the Chase</h2></div></div><p>
For Linux systems administrators, it really comes down to you or
a group of people against the world. You are on one end, providing access
to your machine, and on the other end is a world of network-connected
people, many of whom would like to have access to your machine. Usually
the tools that are used to exploit the SSH d&aelig;mon are built with the
default configurations in mind. It is the low-hanging fruit
that is often the target, and it is your job to know your local
environment and needs to remove that low-hanging fruit before it gets
picked by others. A compromised machine causes not only havoc within your
environment, it also presents a risk for the other multimillion or
billion computers connected worldwide. OpenSSH provides an outstanding
tool for remote access. Comparing the tool to a crescent wrench is a
fair analysis. Both the wrench and OpenSSH are delivered with a wide
range of capabilities. Just as you will need to adjust a crescent wrench
to make the most of it, adjusting the default configuration of OpenSSH
will maximize your remote-access capabilities while also providing a
more secure environment.
