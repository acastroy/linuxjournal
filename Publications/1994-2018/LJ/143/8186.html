How to get started with GNOME monkeyshines using the open-source .NET
system Mono.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d63580.0x1e5b2f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Mono is an open-source implementation of the .NET development platform,
a powerful and now open development platform. Mono contains a number
of components: a Common Language Infrastructure (CLI) virtual machine,
a C# compiler and a set of class libraries. Mono implements the C#
language and runtime environment according to ECMA standards 334 and
335, respectively.
</p><p>
Mono&mdash;which is the word for monkey in Spanish&mdash;provides various class
libraries, including an open-source implementation of the .NET Framework
SDK. In this article, however, we discuss one of Mono's brightest
assets: its GNOME support, in the form of Gtk#.
</p><p>
Gtk# is a .NET language binding for the Gtk+ toolkit and various other
GNOME libraries. More than a simple wrapper, Gtk# provides a powerful
platform for developing GUI software in the GNOME environment. Gtk#'s
language bindings utilize good object-oriented principles and C#-style
design to make GNOME development easy and natural, yet flexible and
powerful.
</p><p>
In this article, we investigate the construction of a simple C#
application, starting with a trivial &ldquo;Hello, World&rdquo; application and
building it into a basic Wikipedia search tool. Our only dependencies
will be Mono and Gtk#. Packages are available for most
distributions&mdash;see
the on-line Resources.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d63580.0x1e5b500"></a>
Hello, World!</h2></div></div><p>
Let's start by constructing the most basic Mono application possible,
which prints &ldquo;Hello, World!&rdquo; to the console:

<pre     class="programlisting">
using System;

class first {
    public static void Main (string[] args)
    {
        Console.WriteLine ("Hello, World!");
    }
}
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d63580.0x1e5b660"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Fire up your favorite editor, enter this code and save it as
first.cs. We can then compile the program into an executable image
with the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ mcs first.cs
</pre>
</p><p>
Finally, we can run it via the following command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ mono first.exe
Hello, World!
</pre>
</p><p>
This application implements the first class. Every application
needs an entry point, an initial function inside of the class for the Mono
runtime to jump to and begin the program's execution. As with C and C++,
this is the Main function. The prototype of this function is:

<pre     class="programlisting">
public static void Main (string[] args)
</pre>
</p><p>
In our program's Main, we invoke a single function, WriteLine,
which is found inside the Console class. This function, similar
to printf(), writes a line of text to the console. It can be used
to output the values of variables too:

<pre     class="programlisting">
int x = 5;
String s = "wolf";

Console.WriteLine ("x={0} s={1}", x, s);
</pre>
</p><p>
This gives us:

<pre     class="programlisting">
x=5 s=wolf
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d63580.0x1e5ba80"></a>
Hello, World! in Color</h2></div></div><p>
We do not, however, have to confine our &ldquo;Hello, World!&rdquo; to the console;
with Gtk#, we can build a trivial GUI dialog to hoist our message onto
the world:

<pre     class="programlisting">
using System;
using Gtk;

class Two {
    static void WindowDelete (object o, DeleteEventArgs args)
    {
        Application.Quit ();
    }

    static void InitGui ()
    {
        Window w = new Window ("My Window");

        HBox h = new HBox ();
        h.BorderWidth = 6;
        h.Spacing = 6;
        w.Add (h);

        VBox v = new VBox ();
        v.Spacing = 6;
        h.PackStart (v, false, false, 0);

        Label l = new Label ("Hello, World!");
        l.Xalign = 0;
        v.PackStart (l, true, true, 0);

        w.DeleteEvent += WindowDelete;
        w.ShowAll ();
    }

    public static void Main (string[] args)
    {
        Application.Init ();
        InitGui ();
        Application.Run ();
    }
}
</pre>
</p><p>
As before, enter the code via your favorite editor. This time, save
it as two.cs. To compile this program, we need to tell the Mono
compiler that we want to use the Gtk# assembly:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ mcs two.cs -pkg:gtk-sharp
</pre>
</p><p>
Running it, however, is the same:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ mono two.exe
</pre>
</p><p>
The application creates a small window, titled My Window, and
writes &ldquo;Hello, World!&rdquo; into the window (Figure 1). The window is a
GtkWindow, the label a GtkLabel. Gtk lays out windows via
boxes. Boxes are invisible widgets&mdash;existing solely for the purpose
of layout&mdash;into which other widgets are packed. The arrangement
of widgets within a box determines the physical layout of the widgets
within the window. Although it is possible in Gtk to arrange widgets
using tables, most programmers prefer boxes for their flexibility and
power&mdash;plus, once you get the hang of them, they are not difficult to use.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="8186f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. My Window
</p></div></div><p>
Gtk provides two types of boxes: vertical and horizontal. A vertical box,
called a vbox, defines the vertical arrangement of widgets&mdash;vboxes
arrange widgets into columns. A horizontal box, known as an hbox,
defines the horizontal arrangement of widgets, by arranging them into
rows. Widgets are packed into boxes, boxes are packed into other boxes,
and the boxes are added to windows.
</p><p>
A new hbox is created via:

<pre     class="programlisting">
HBox h = new HBox ();
</pre>
</p><p>
And a new vbox is created via:

<pre     class="programlisting">
VBox v = new VBox ();
</pre>
</p><p>
The new objects representing the boxes have various properties that
one can set to manipulate the look and feel of the box. In our previous
example, we set two properties on the hbox:

<pre     class="programlisting">
h.BorderWidth = 6;
h.Spacing = 6;
</pre>
</p><p>
Here, we set the border of and the spacing around the hbox to six
pixels each. This provides a net spacing of 12 pixels around the
hbox. Coincidentally, for purposes of aesthetics and consistency, the
GNOME HIG (Human Interface Guideline) dictates a minimum spacing of
12 pixels between widgets&mdash;thus the six and six pixels in this example
are perfect.
</p><p>
To add a box to a window, the Add() member function is called on
the window in question and provided to the box:

<pre     class="programlisting">
w.Add (h);
</pre>
</p><p>
To pack a widget into a box, the PackStart() member function is
called on the box in question:

<pre     class="programlisting">
public void PackStart (Widget child,
            bool expand,
            bool fill,
            uint padding)
</pre>
</p><p>
In our example, we did:

<pre     class="programlisting">
v.PackStart (l, true, true, 0);
</pre>
</p><p>
This call packs our label into our vbox. If the expand parameter is
true, the widget child expands to fill all available space
within the box. If the fill parameter is true, the widget
consumes all of its space for rendering; otherwise, if false,
the widget uses superfluous space for padding. The padding
parameter allows for the addition of extra spacing around the widget,
within the box, beyond any padding already provided.
</p><p>
Starting our application is simple. We perform three simple steps:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Application.Init ();
InitGui ();
Application.Run ();
</pre>
</p><p>
Application.Init() initializes Gtk# and the application's
GUI. It should be one of the first functions that a Gtk# application
invokes. After executing this function, applications set up their GUI,
create and arrange their widgets, and draw the initial windows and
other UI elements. In our program, we do this in the InitGui()
function. Once everything is complete and ready to roll, the program
calls Application.Run() and the race is off. Our main window pops
up because we exposed it, back in InitGui(), via:

<pre     class="programlisting">
w.ShowAll ();
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d63580.0x1e5c5d8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
This exposes the window and all widgets packed therein. Thus, once the
application invoked Application.Run(), our UI elements appear.
</p><p>
While executing, the program's responses are handled by the behavior of
widgets. Some widgets behave in predetermined ways, not requiring the
programmer to write any code manually. Most of the time, however, the
programmer wants to handle events personally. This is done by writing an
event handler, using the incredibly useful C# events feature,
that Gtk# invokes in response to widget interaction.
</p><p>
In our last example, we have one such event handler. We want our
application to exit when the user clicks the close box on the main
window, so we need to handle the associated event, which is called
DeleteEvent. This is done by writing the event handler:

<pre     class="programlisting">
static void WindowDelete (object o, DeleteEventArgs args)
{
    Application.Quit ();
}
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d63580.0x1e5c7e8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
And adding it as an event handler:

<pre     class="programlisting">
w.DeleteEvent += WindowDelete;
</pre>
</p><p>
The function Application.Quit() causes Gtk# to destroy the UI,
shut down and terminate the application. Consequently, when the user
clicks the close box on the main window, our application gracefully exits.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d63580.0x1e5c9a0"></a>Building a Better Example</h2></div></div><p>
Let's turn now to building a more complete&mdash;dare I say
useful&mdash;application: a tool for searching Wikipedia. To be sure, we will
not build anything fancy, but we can implement something fun. Let's
look at building a simple window, with a text-entry widget. We will
allow the user to type a search query into the window and click a button
(Figure 2). The application then launches the user's Web browser
and looks up the search term on Wikipedia. We build the whole thing,
including the GUI and code to launch the Web browser, in only a handful
of lines.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="8186f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. The Fancy GUI
</p></div></div><p>
We can construct this new application by building on our last example,
adding new widgets and the requisite features. Surprisingly, thanks to
Gtk#, the additional code is not very much!
Here we go:

<pre     class="programlisting">

using System;
using Gtk;

class Example {
    public static Entry search_entry;

    public static void ButtonClicked (object o, EventArgs args)
    {
        String s = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Search?search=";
        s += search_entry.Text;
        s += "&amp;go=Go";
        Gnome.Url.Show (s);
    }

    static void WindowDelete (object o, DeleteEventArgs args)
    {
        Application.Quit ();
    }

    static void InitGui ()
    {
        Window w = new Window ("Wikipedia Search");

        HBox h = new HBox ();
        h.BorderWidth = 6;
        h.Spacing = 6;
        w.Add (h);

        VBox v = new VBox ();
        v.Spacing = 6;
        h.PackStart (v, false, false, 0);

        Label l = new Label ("_Search:");
        l.Xalign = 0;
        v.PackStart (l, true, false, 0);

        v = new VBox ();
        v.Spacing = 6;
        h.PackStart (v, true, true, 0);

        search_entry = new Entry ();
        search_entry.ActivatesDefault = true;
        l.MnemonicWidget = search_entry;
        v.PackStart (search_entry, true, true, 0);

        v = new VBox ();
        v.Spacing = 6;
        h.PackStart (v, true, true, 0);

        Button b = new Button ("Search");
        b.CanDefault = true;
        w.Default = b;
        v.PackStart (b, true, true, 0);

        b.Clicked += ButtonClicked;
        w.DeleteEvent += WindowDelete;
        w.ShowAll ();
    }

    public static void Main (string[] args)
    {
        Application.Init ();
        InitGui ();
        Application.Run ();
    }
}

</pre>
</p><p>
We need to add a new assembly, gnome-sharp, to our compiler command
line. Assuming you name this program three.cs, you would perform
the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ mcs three.cs -pkg:gtk-sharp -pkg:gnome-sharp
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d63580.0x2167b80"></a></h2></div></div><p>
And now run it via:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ mono three.exe
</pre>
</p><p>
This third and final program contains a few new widgets&mdash;buttons, labels
and text entries&mdash;but follows the same basic structure as our second
program. If we work backward, from the last box outward to the first,
we can get a good feel for the layout of the UI elements without even
seeing a screenshot.
</p><p>
The other big difference is a new event, Clicked. We define a
function and add it as an event handler:

<pre     class="programlisting">
b.Clicked += ButtonClicked;
</pre>
</p><p>
We made the text-entry widget, search_entry, public, and thus our
new event handler can grab the contents of the search entry when the
user presses the button via search_entry.Text.
</p><p>
In ButtonClicked, we grab this text, construct the Wikipedia URL
required for searching for the text, and use the Gnome.Url.Show()
function to open the user's preferred Web browser (a global GNOME setting)
and send it off to our URL.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d63580.0x2167e98"></a>
Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Although it is impressive to implement so much in so little, the real boon
is that this is a C-like language, not a scripting language. C# retains
much of the power and performance of C and adds powerful object-oriented
programming constructs.
</p><p>
Let me be frank. I am a C programmer. I spend most of my days hacking the
kernel. Higher-level languages are not my cup of tea. Indeed, I am no fan
of C++ or Java. Yet, having spent time with C#--working on Beagle, among
other C# endeavors&mdash;I am thoroughly impressed. C# is an elegant language
that readily makes clear an obvious facet: it is quite well designed.
</p><p>
In Mono, we have a free and open C# compiler, runtime and family of
libraries, supported by a vibrant Open Source community. Although excellently
paired with GNOME development, Mono is a smart tool for many jobs.
