GnuPG does a lot more than just encrypt and decrypt e-mail and
attachments.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22a5580.0x239d298"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Have you wondered about using cryptography, but found it too
confusing? Are complicated software packages, passphrases, keys, key
rings, certificates and fingerprints too daunting?
</p><p>
You don't need all that. With no prior experience and nothing to remember,
GnuPG can do basic and immediately useful cryptography. GnuPG even may
be installed on your Linux system already.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22a5580.0x239d3f8"></a>
GnuPG and OpenPGP</h2></div></div><p>
The GnuPG is the GNU Project's implementation of the OpenPGP
standard. Also known as the Gnu Privacy Guard, it is a sophisticated
public key cryptosystem with more than 70 command-line options, plus
an internal command-line and menu environment. It has been ported to
several operating systems and has precompiled binaries available from
the GnuPG Web site (see the on-line Resources). Like all GNU software, it can be used freely under
the GNU General Public License.
</p><p>
The OpenPGP standard, RFC 2440, is based on the Pretty Good Privacy
system developed by Phil Zimmermann in 1991. OpenPGP is also the basis
for commercial products on even more operating systems. An OpenPGP
system is the most common file encryption system you will encounter.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22a5580.0x239d558"></a>
Getting Started</h2></div></div><p>
First, let's begin with some GnuPG features that don't need
a passphrase. After that, we'll choose a passphrase and use it to
encrypt something.
Note that GnuPG is the name of the software, but the name of the command
is <tt  >gpg</tt>.
</p><p>
Make sure GnuPG is installed and in your path:

<pre     class="programlisting">
gpg --version
</pre>
</p><p>
You should get something like this:


<pre     class="programlisting">
gpg (GnuPG) 1.4.1
Copyright (C) 2005 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY.

redistribute it under certain conditions.
See the file COPYING for details.

Home: ~/.gnupg
Supported algorithms:
Pubkey: RSA, RSA-E, RSA-S, ELG-E, DSA
Cipher: 3DES, CAST5, BLOWFISH, AES, AES192, AES256, TWOFISH
Hash: MD5, SHA1, RIPEMD160, SHA256, SHA384, SHA512
Compression: Uncompressed, ZIP, ZLIB, BZIP2
</pre>
</p><p>
The version number, date and other details may vary. The examples shown in
this article should work for most current and future versions of GnuPG.
</p><p>
Now, type:

<pre     class="programlisting">
gpg /dev/null
</pre>
</p><p>
You might get something like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
gpg: /home/you/.gnupg: directory created
gpg: new configuration file `/home/you/.gnupg/gpg.conf'
 &#8618;created
gpg: WARNING: options in `/home/you/.gnupg/gpg.conf'
 &#8618;are not yet active during this run
gpg: keyring `/home/you/.gnupg/secring.gpg' created
gpg: keyring `/home/you/.gnupg/pubring.gpg' created
gpg: processing message failed: eof
</pre>
</p><p>
This is perfectly normal the first time you run GnuPG. If it doesn't
happen, it simply means you've run GnuPG before, or your .gnupg directory
already exists.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22a5580.0x239da28"></a>
Binary File Shields</h2></div></div><p>
Most e-mail programs support file attachments, but command-line e-mail
programs, such as /bin/mail, don't. Sometimes it's more convenient to
keep all the data in the message body. But binary files must be ASCII-encoded to prevent them from being corrupted in transit.
</p><p>
You may have tried to use uuencode and found it confusing or that it didn't
work. Not all systems have a command-line MIME encoder. However, GnuPG
has an ASCII-encoding option very similar to MIME, but without all
the complexity, overhead and features.
</p><p>
To wrap a file in PGP ASCII armor, type:

<pre     class="programlisting">

$ gpg --enarmor &lt; filename.bin &gt; filename.txt

</pre>
</p><p>
To unwrap a file already in PGP ASCII armor, type:

<pre     class="programlisting">

$ gpg --dearmor &lt; filename.txt &gt; filename.bin

</pre>
</p><p>
Warning: despite the name, the OpenPGP ASCII armor has <span   class="emphasis"><em>absolutely
no security</em></span>. If you do want security and data compression, see
the
Quick and Clean Encryption section below and use a good passphrase.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22a5580.0x239dd98"></a>
Better Checksums</h2></div></div><p>
Do you suspect a file you just received is corrupted? Traditionally, the
<tt  >sum</tt> or <tt  >cksum</tt> command is run over the file before
and after it was sent and the outputs are compared. But there are three
different incompatible versions of these commands, and even the same
version can produce completely different output on different machines
due to processor endian issues. Even worse, sometimes they won't even
detect corrupted files. By chance alone, even when they are compatible,
they sometimes will produce the same output for different files. The
32-bit output of the sum and cksum commands is simply
too small for reliability, much less security. The popular SSH v1
CRC-32 compensation attack is the same vulnerability.
</p><p>
You could use <tt  >md5sum</tt> instead, but there are different versions
of this command. Each version has slight differences in formatting
of filenames, whitespace and hexadecimal case. These differences
in format prevent <tt  >diff</tt> from running cleanly. In addition, there
are known security vulnerabilities in the MD5 hash algorithm used by
md5sum. And, sometimes md5sum isn't even installed.
</p><p>
GnuPG avoids these problems, because it produces the same output regardless
of operating system or processor architecture. GnuPG also supports newer
and more secure algorithms:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ gpg --print-md sha1 filename
filename: E83A 42B9 BC84 31A6 6450  99BE 50B6 341A 35D3 DCEB
</pre>
</p><p>
It also will take multiple files:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ gpg --print-md sha1 *.txt
test.txt: E0D6 3F44 4253 CED5 9205  4047 4AA6 4E0F FD0F 130D
test2.txt: 32AC 34F9 B7AF 1972 C015  E5EE 456E 89BD CC3C 7246
</pre>
</p><p>
If you still need MD5, that's available too:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ gpg --print-md md5 filename
filename: 26 E9 85 5F 8A D6 A5 90  6F EA 12 12 83 C7 29 C4
</pre>
</p><p>
The more recent GnuPG versions also support much more secure hash
algorithms, such as SHA-512:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ gpg --print-md sha512 filename
filename: FC37410D 9336DD60 22AEB6A2 A42E82F1 2EA3470D 4982E958 B35C14A0
          CF381CD2 3C4CBA35 BE5F11CB 05505ED2 DBF1C7A0 397EFF75 007FAEBB
          30B43B30 6514990D
</pre>
</p><p>
By the way, you can validate these --print-md examples by creating a file
called filename containing the single line: <tt  >The Linux Journal</tt>.
</p><p>
Your hash values should have exactly the same hexadecimal value as those
in this article if the contents of the file is the same.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22a5580.0x239e420"></a>
Quick and Clean Encryption</h2></div></div><p>
Want to encrypt a file, but don't know where to start? Here's a quick
and clean introduction to file encryption using GnuPG:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ gpg -c test.txt
Enter passphrase:
Repeat passphrase:
</pre>
</p><p>
When encrypting, GnuPG asks for a passphrase twice, just like when
you set a new password. The new encrypted file has the same name,
but with the extension .gpg added. The original file is left intact.
</p><p>
The -c stands for conventional encryption, also known as symmetric
encryption. Normally, GnuPG defaults to public key encryption, but we
haven't generated or loaded any public keys, so for now we have to stay
with conventional.
</p><p>
This type of encryption is most useful only if you want to decrypt your files, but you don't trust where your files are stored. For
example, easily lost or stolen storage can be protected with this
type of encryption. This type of encryption is especially useful for
off-site backups.
</p><p>
To extract the encrypted file, simply type:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ gpg filename.gpg
</pre>
</p><p>
GnuPG automatically detects that the file is encrypted with a
passphrase and asks for that passphrase. Then it writes the decrypted
data to a file with the same name but without the .gpg extension. As
with encrypting, the encrypted file is left intact. If you want the
output file to be written to a different filename, use standard
redirection, exactly as with the --dearmor example. Note that both input
and output redirection must be used, or GnuPG becomes confused:

<pre     class="programlisting">

$ gpg &lt; filename.gpg &gt; filename.txt

</pre>
</p><p>
If you want someone else to decrypt the file, you have to tell
this person the passphrase without leaking the passphrase to anyone else. A
simple and straightforward way to do this is in person. That might seem not very
useful, as the original file also could be given in person. But that
passphrase can now be reused safely multiple times on different files
in the future. Just like passwords, however, passphrases should be changed
regularly. Never reuse a passphrase with other people, unless you want
them to decrypt all of the files you ever encrypted with that
passphrase.
</p><p>
Note: this warning is normal when using passphrase encryption in
GnuPG. This can be avoided with public key encryption:

<pre     class="programlisting">
gpg: WARNING: message was not integrity protected
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22a5580.0x239e8f0"></a>
Passphrases</h2></div></div><p>
The passphrase is a secret that keeps the other secrets, which makes it
the most important part of GnuPG security. Unfortunately, in practice,
passphrases
are also the weak part. This is because creating good passphrases is
difficult, and remembering them is even more difficult.
</p><p>
I highly recommend Diceware, but if it doesn't appeal to you, take a
look at the Wikipedia article (see Resources) or the passphrase Web pages recommended by
your favorite Web search engine.
</p><p>
Regardless of what method you choose, a simple guide to passphrase
security is that longer is usually better (Table 1).
</p><div class="table"><a name="N0x22a5580.0x239eaa8"></a><p class="title"><b>Table 1.
Password and passphrase strengths compared with estimated time to
crack.</b></p><table     summary="Table 1.&#10;Password and passphrase strengths compared with estimated time to&#10;crack." border="1"><colgroup><col><col><col><col><col></colgroup><thead><tr><th>Type</th><th>Length</th><th>Bits</th><th>Total Bits</th><th>Time to Crack</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Single word of any language</td><td>8 characters</td><td>24</td><td>24</td><td>Seconds</td></tr><tr><td>Random mono-case letters</td><td>8 characters</td><td>4.7</td><td>37</td><td>Minutes</td></tr><tr><td>Random mono-case letters</td><td>16 characters</td><td>4.7</td><td>75</td><td>Decades</td></tr><tr><td>base64 [A-Za-z0-9+/=]</td><td>10 characters</td><td>6</td><td>60</td><td>Months</td></tr><tr><td>base64 [A-Za-z0-9+/=]</td><td>20 characters</td><td>6</td><td>120</td><td>Uncrackable?</td></tr><tr><td>Completely random printable</td><td>6 characters</td><td>6.5</td><td>40</td><td>Minutes</td></tr><tr><td>Completely random printable</td><td>8 characters</td><td>6.5</td><td>52</td><td>Hours</td></tr><tr><td>Completely random printable</td><td>12 characters</td><td>6.5</td><td>78</td><td>Decades</td></tr><tr><td>Completely random printable</td><td>15 characters</td><td>6.5</td><td>97</td><td>Centuries</td></tr><tr><td>Completely random printable</td><td>20 characters</td><td>6.5</td><td>130</td><td>Uncrackable?</td></tr><tr><td>Diceware passphrase</td><td>2 words</td><td>12.9</td><td>26</td><td>Seconds</td></tr><tr><td>Diceware passphrase</td><td>4 words</td><td>12.9</td><td>51</td><td>Hours</td></tr><tr><td>Diceware passphrase</td><td>6 words</td><td>12.9</td><td>78</td><td>Decades</td></tr><tr><td>Diceware passphrase</td><td>8 words</td><td>12.9</td><td>120</td><td>Uncrackable?</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>
The time estimates in Table 1 are wide, because money and time can be
traded evenly.
Computing power keeps getting cheaper, so time to crack keeps
getting shorter. Cracking costs start at free and go up.
</p><p>
If you cannot remember a GnuPG passphrase, the data encrypted with
that passphrase is probably gone forever. There are no
known back doors in GnuPG nor any way to recover a lost passphrase short
of guessing. How long it takes depends on how good the passphrase was. A
good 20-character passphrase could take billions of years to guess, even
using all current and future computers.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22a5580.0x2397490"></a>
Generate a Passphrase</h2></div></div><p>
Here's a quick hack for generating a very secure passphrase using GnuPG
itself. The passphrase will not be easy to remember or type, but it will
be very secure. The hack generates 16 random binary bytes using GnuPG
then converts them to base64, again using GnuPG. The final sed
command strips out the headers leaving a single line that can be used
as a passphrase:

<pre     class="programlisting">
gpg --gen-random 1 16 | gpg --enarmor | sed -n 5p
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22a5580.0x23975f0"></a>
Encrypted Tarballs</h2></div></div><p>
Instead of using gzip to compress tarballs, use GnuPG. The tarballs will
end up being about the same size, but they also will be encrypted. By the
way, don't bother trying to gzip or otherwise compress any encrypted
files. Encrypted data is usually incompressible. This is because data
compression and encryption are closely related mathematically. Because
of this, most cryptosystems, GnuPG included, automatically compress before
encryption. There is also a slight gain in security by compressing.
</p><p>
You will be prompted for a passphrase twice, just like when encrypting before:

<pre     class="programlisting">
tar -cf - these files here | gpg -c &gt; these-files-here.tgp
</pre>
</p><p>
To extract the files, enter the password entered above:

<pre     class="programlisting">

gpg &lt; these-files-here.tgp  | tar -xvf -

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22a5580.0x26aadf8"></a>
Automating GnuPG</h2></div></div><p>
If you want to use GnuPG in a script and don't want to be prompted for
the passphrase, put the passphrase in a file called passphrase.txt,
and use this to encrypt:

<pre     class="programlisting">

[$ cat passphrase.txt | gpg --passphrase-fd 0 -c &lt; filename.txt &gt; filename.gpg

</pre>
</p><p>
Note: decrypting is nearly identical, simply drop the -c and switch the files around:

<pre     class="programlisting">

$ cat passphrase.txt | gpg --passphrase-fd 0 &lt; filename.gpg &gt;
filename.txt

</pre>
</p><p>
If you're going to e-mail the encrypted file, perhaps for off-site
backup, add the -a option to turn on ASCII armor. The net
effect is the same thing as --enarmor used earlier, but it includes
encryption. This also produces smaller files than uuencoding or MIME,
because by default, GnuPG compresses data before encryption.
</p><p>
To finish off the hack, we also mail the encrypted file at the same
time. Note the use of -o - to force GnuPG's output to stdout:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ cat passphrase.txt | gpg --passphrase-fd 0 -ac -o - filename.txt | mail user@example.com
</pre>
</p><p>
By the way, putting the passphrase in a file can be extremely
dangerous. Anyone who obtains a copy of that passphrase file can then
decrypt any file it has ever encrypted. Someone even could create
new files with the same passphrase, resulting in secure and undetectable
forgery. Make sure your passphrase file, indeed the entire computer,
has the security you expect.
</p><p>
Automating tasks inherently requires cutting humans out of the loop,
so this security weakness is difficult to avoid. However, GnuPG can help
even here by using public key encryption.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22a5580.0x26ab1c0"></a>
GnuPG Troublehacking</h2></div></div><p>
Do you have an OpenPGP-encrypted file, but no key ring and no
idea what to do with it? Perhaps someone sent you an encrypted file
and assumed you would know what to do. Maybe he or she doesn't know what to
do either.
</p><p>
If the file has either a .pgp or .gpg extension, you can try decrypting
it with GnuPG. Also, check the file with a text editor to see if it
contains something like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
-----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----
Version: GnuPG v1.2.5 (GNU/Linux)

jA0EAwMCwg21r1fAW+5gyS0KR/bkeI8qPwwQo/NOaFL2LMXEYZEV9E7PBLjjGm7Y
DGG4QnWD5HSNOvdaqXg=
=j5Jy
-----END PGP MESSAGE-----
</pre>
</p><p>
If it does, it's an ASCII-armored PGP-encrypted file.
</p><p>
This particular file is a real encrypted file containing the same value as
used in the --print-md examples above and is encrypted with a passphrase
of the same value.
</p><p>
Simply running GnuPG on an unknown file produces some useful
information. If it prompts you for a passphrase, you'll need to get
(or guess) the passphrase used to encrypt the file:

<pre     class="programlisting">
gpg unknown_file
</pre>
</p><p>
If it's not an OpenPGP file, you'll get something like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
gpg: no valid OpenPGP data found.
gpg: processing message failed: eof
</pre>
</p><p>
If you get something else, however, maybe the file is encrypted with
a public key that you don't have. The file also could be corrupted. A
common mistake is to send binary files through e-mail or FTP transfer
in ASCII mode.
</p><p>
GnuPG has a special diagnostic option to help troubleshoot these
problems. The OpenPGP message format is internally formatted as packets;
the --list-packets option dumps out information about those packets:

<pre     class="programlisting">
gpg --list-packets unknown_file.gpg
</pre>
</p><p>
In addition to the standard information, this option also prints
the full key ID of the public key that the file is encrypted with,
if any, and what algorithms were used. It could be that the file was
encrypted with a PGP 2.x public, sometimes called a legacy key. PGP
2.x predates the OpenPGP standard, so the standard GnuPG cannot decrypt
it. Most PGP implementations made in the past several years are usually
OpenPGP-compatible, so merely asking the sender to generate a compatible
OpenPGP-encrypted file should do the trick.
</p><p>
There also are several different cryptographic algorithms supported by
OpenPGP. Most have only some of these algorithms implementationally. Use
<tt  >gpg --version</tt> to see what might be missing.
</p><p>
Details on the packet format, such as the internal algorithm numbers, can
be found in the OpenPGP standard RFC 2440.
</p><div class="table"><a name="N0x22a5580.0x26ab7f0"></a><p class="title"><b>

GnuPG mostly uses long command-line options, but some options also have
short single-letter options from the original PGP. For example, -v is
--verbose, not --version.

Learning More</h2></div></div><p>
There are several good introductions to using the more common features
of GnuPG, such as the GnuPG MiniHOWTO by Brenno de Winter at the GnuPG
Web site (see Resources). They explain in detail how to use the more common public key
cryptography features of GnuPG.
</p><p>
The GnuPG mailing lists are also very useful and fully archived on the
GnuPG Web site. Werner Koch, the GnuPG lead developer, frequently posts
to the mailing lists and is of invaluable help.
