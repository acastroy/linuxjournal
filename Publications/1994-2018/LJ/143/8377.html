We wrap up the single sign-on series with CUPS printing, SSH and firewall
rules.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc03580.0xcfb2f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Welcome back for the last article on using your single sign-on and
corporate directory infrastructure. What we've covered so far is how
to set up the infrastructure and how to plug various types of clients
running different operating systems in to that infrastructure. The majority
of that work benefits your users in enabling them to sign on only once,
after which they can use a variety of resources, such as storage shares,
printers, e-mail and more.
</p><p>
This month, we cover methods to use Kerberos and LDAP to make your
job easier. As always, the sample programs and other files are available
from the on-line Resources.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc03580.0xcfb450"></a>
Unified Printing Made Easy</h2></div></div><p>
No matter what size your shop is, printing is always a
necessity. Unfortunately, printing also can be one of the most error-prone
processes as well, especially in a heterogeneous environment. Luckily,
the CUPS (Common UNIX Printing System) Project has been established. The
goals of CUPS are to provide a standards-based printing solution and to
provide unified printing for UNIX-based systems. Today, it's the default
printing system for most Linux distributions as well as Apple OS X.
</p><p>
Setting up a basic print server using CUPS is simple. To get a basic
understanding of CUPS and a working install, you should read Colin Topliss'
article &ldquo;Centralized Printing Using CUPS&rdquo; (see Resources). Make sure to configure the CUPS server on one of your
Samba servers if you want to enable Windows clients to print. We
cover how to do this shortly.
</p><p>
The first thing to do after setting up your print server is enabling
encryption using SSL. You should create a certificate signing request,
or CSR, and sign it with your CA. Save the certificate and key in
/etc/ssl/cups as cups-cert.pem and cups-key.pem, respectively. Also,
make sure that they're owned by the user that cupsd uses, usually lp,
and that the permissions are set properly on the private key, 0400. Next,
make some changes to /etc/cups/cupsd.conf:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ServerCertficate /etc/ssl/cups/cups-cert.pem
ServerKey /etc/ssl/cups/cups-key.pem
</pre>
</p><p>
Save your changes and restart cupsd.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc03580.0xcfb6b8"></a>
Keeping Track of Your Print Resources</h2></div></div><p>
One of the most difficult tasks of print management is keeping track
of all the printers to manage. Gone are the days when all the printers
existed in a central location. Now printers, more than likely, are
scattered around the office, attached to people's workstations, and
whatnot. Worse, the fact that these printers are different makes and
models increases the challenge of organizing them.
</p><p>
The CUPS Web site (see Resources) states that LDAP support is
scheduled for inclusion in version 1.3. Version 1.1 is currently stable,
and 1.2 has been in testing for some time now. However, this needn't stop
us from using LDAP as a way to inventory all the printers in the office
and even provide a way to automate printer addition to a CUPS server.
</p><p>
The IETF has been thinking about this and has developed RFC 3712,
&ldquo;Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP): Schema for Printer
Services&rdquo;. I've taken the liberty of converting this RFC into an
actual schema for use with OpenLDAP and included it in the on-line
Resources. Include this schema in your slapd.conf file and restart
slapd. Now we can add information about our printers:

<pre     class="programlisting">
dn: ou=printers,o=ci,dc=example,dc=com
objectClass: organizationalUnit
ou=printers

dn: printer-name=pr-laser,ou=printers,o=ci,dc=example,dc=com
objectClass: top
objectClass: printerAbstract
objectClass: printerService
objectClass: printerIPP
printer-name: pr-laser
printer-location: A101
printer-info: laserjet.ppd
printer-more-info: http://www.hp.com
printer-make-and-model: HP LaserJet
printer-uri: socket://pr-laser.example.com
</pre>
</p><p>
Most of these are self-explanatory, but printer-info and printer-uri might
need a little explaining. We use the printer-info attribute to
specify the PostScript printer definition, PPD, to use for this printer,
in this case laserjet.ppd. The printer-uri attribute is used to define
the URI to contact the printer. The socket:// device is usually used
for HP JetDirect connections to a printer. To find all the devices
your print server supports, use the lpinfo command, which is usually
kept in /usr/sbin:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# /usr/sbin/lpinfo -v
network socket
direct hal
network http
network ipp
network lpd
direct scsi
serial serial:/dev/ttyS0?baud=115200
direct usb:/dev/usb/lp0
network smb
</pre>
</p><p>
Your output may vary depending on what options were enabled when CUPS
was compiled.
</p><p>
You now have a printer listed in LDAP, but what can you do with it
as CUPS doesn't support LDAP? At the very least, you have
a central place for keeping track of all your printers and their
capabilities. I've written a small Perl script that queries LDAP for
all the printers in the directory, and then creates a script that can
be used to add all the printers to a CUPS server. It doesn't do much,
but it gives you a start on how you can use LDAP to supplement CUPS and
make management a bit more tractable. If you decide to use some of the
attributes, such as printer-sides-supported, printer-finishings-supported
and printer-media-supported, you could easily extend the script to
call lpoptions to set printer-specific settings automatically as well.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc03580.0xcfba28"></a>
Printer Clients</h2></div></div><p>
One of the great things about CUPS is that the default settings for
it allow it to discover other CUPS servers and the printers served by
them. That means for Linux and OS X clients to use your new server,
it's as easy as starting cupsd, waiting about 30 seconds, and you're off
and running. Luckily, it's not much harder to get Windows clients up
and running either, using Samba. Following are the required changes to
the smb.conf file:


<pre     class="programlisting">
[global]
        ...
        load printers = Yes
        printing = cups
        printcap = cups
        printer admin = root

[printers]
        comment = All Printers
        path = /var/spool/samba
        browseable = no
        public = yes
        guest ok = yes
        writable = no
        printable = yes

[print$]
        comment = Printer Drivers
        path = /etc/samba/drivers
        browseable = yes
        guest ok = no
        read only = yes
        write list = root
</pre>
</p><p>
The parameters in the global section enable CUPS printing support. The
printers section makes all the printers listed in the printcap file
automatically available to Windows clients. The print$ section turns on
automatic driver download, or Point 'n' Print, for Windows clients. What
this means is that Windows clients won't be required to install print
drivers for each printer they install. When they initially connect to
the printer, clients will download and install a set of generic CUPS
print drivers, removing the need for the user or the administrator to
worry about Windows print drivers. Save your changes and restart Samba.
</p><p>
Before Point 'n' Print is a reality, there are still a few more things
to do. First, you should download the most recent stable CUPS drivers,
version 1.1.16 as of this writing, from the Easy Software Products FTP
server to your CUPS/Samba server. Untar the bundle and run the install
script, cups-samba.install. If the installer puts the cups.hlp file
in /usr/share/drivers, move it into /usr/share/cups/drivers with the
rest of the drivers. Next, make sure the print driver share directory,
/etc/samba/drivers, exists. Finally, you need to add the drivers to the
Samba share. If you've removed the root Samba user out of LDAP, you'll
need to re-add it for these next two steps, as you need to be a uid 0
user. Refer to Part III of this series [February 2006] if you're not sure how to do this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# smbclient //localhost/print\$ -Uroot -c 'mkdir
 &#8618;W32X86; put /etc/cups/ppd/pr-laser.ppd
 &#8618;W32X86/pr-laser.ppd; put
 &#8618;/usr/share/cups/drivers/cupsdrvr.dll
 &#8618;W32X86/cupsdrvr.dll; put
 &#8618;/usr/share/cups/drivers/cupsui.dll
 &#8618;W32X86/cupsui.dll; put
 &#8618;/usr/share/cups/drivers/cups.hlp
 &#8618;W32X86/cups.hlp'
#  rpcclient localhost -Uroot -c 'adddriver
 &#8618;"Windows NT x86" "pr-laser:cupsdrvr.dll
&#8618;:pr-laser.ppd:cupsui.dll:cups.hlp:NULL:RAW:NULL"'
</pre>
</p><p>
These two commands refer specifically to the printer we
added to LDAP above, pr-laser. You need to run these two commands for
each printer served by your CUPS server that you want Windows clients
to access. Adding these commands to the printer creation script might
be a good idea if you have many printers.
</p><p>
Now, if you browse to your Samba/CUPS server from a Windows client,
you'll see a Printers and Faxes share. If you choose that share, you'll
see all the printers served via CUPS. If you right-click on a printer
and choose Connect..., it automatically downloads and installs the
drivers and connects to the printer, making it available to print from
that client. That's it!

Automating LDAP and Kerberos Administration</h2></div></div><p>
Up until now, LDAP administration has been done by hand-editing LDIF
files and using the command-line OpenLDAP tools. Craig Swanson and Matt
Lung give some
excellent pointers in their &ldquo;OpenLDAP Everywhere Revisited&rdquo; article
(see Resources) to some GUI utilities for managing LDAP, but they overlooked one that
I think needs mentioning, GQ. Although GQ is not in active development,
the 1.0 beta1 version has proved to be stable and extremely useful. If
GQ keeps segfaulting, though, you probably need to apply a patch to util.c
(see Resources). One of the great things about GQ is its support of SASL
authentication. This allows us to make modifications to LDAP using
the GUI. In addition, I've found that browsing the schema has shown me object
classes and attributes I probably would never have found otherwise.
</p><p>
If you've been a sysadmin for more than five minutes, you know the power
of scripting common tasks. LDAP administration can be rather wordy,
so being able to script those common tasks is invaluable. Both Perl and
Python have very powerful LDAP modules. You've already been introduced
to the Perl interface from last month's article's smb-create-password.pl and
smb-new-machine.pl, but Python's LDAP modules are just as useful. Perl
also has interfaces for Kerberos and SASL. Instead of going into an
API description of each of these modules, I'm going to show you how
to use them while also showing you new and different ways to use LDAP
and Kerberos.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc03580.0xcfbea0"></a>
Managing Users and SSH Keys</h2></div></div><p>
Included in the Resources is an OpenSSH schema. One of the first uses
of this schema you might think of is keeping public keys of hosts in
one location, a kind of known_hosts directory. In fact, that is why
this schema was created. Future versions of OpenSSH will be able to
use name service switch, NSS, to look up host keys instead of always
requiring a local file containing them all. This is great because you'll
no longer need to push and pull known_hosts files when hosts are added
or removed, but unless you've patched your versions of OpenSSH, it's not
that useful yet.
</p><p>
At the Computation Institute, we have a large cluster that many outside
collaborators use. The cluster has its own network home directories, so
it doesn't mount the central NFS ones. We also didn't want password-based
logins where passwords are transmitted over the wire. Normally, this would
be a fine time to enforce GSSAPI-based authentication, except we don't
have control over the collaborator's desktop. So, I asked a colleague of
mine to write a script to automate creating the user's home directory
and adding a user's SSH key to her .authorized_keys file if she provided
one. Because Python is his language of choice, the mkhomedirs.py script
was born.
</p><p>
Here's how it works. When users are granted access to the cluster, they
are
put into the cluster-users netgroup, which is also served from LDAP. The
mkhomedirs.py script, run every hour from cron, checks the list of current
users in the cluster-users netgroup to see which ones don't have home
directories. When it finds a user without a home directory, it creates
one and copies over necessary files, such as those from /etc/skel. Once
the user provides an SSH key, the key is added to the user's sshPublicKey
attribute in LDAP. The mkhomedirs.py script also checks to see which users
don't have a ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file. If a user doesn't have that
file and has a key in LDAP, it creates the file and adds the key to it,
allowing the user to log in. This script doesn't impose the restriction
that a user's authorized_keys file must contain only those keys that are
in LDAP, but it would be trivial to add that functionality. A common
trick in a cracker's toolbox is to add his or her SSH key to another user's
authorized_keys file. If you require all keys in a user's authorized_keys
file to be in the directory, you can send off warnings when an unknown
key has been added to a user's authorized_keys file.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc03580.0xcfc058"></a>
Automatic Firewall Rules Generation</h2></div></div><p>
Another way you might use LDAP is to create iptables rules
for your hosts automatically. We achieve this by enumerating all the services for a
host and all the networks that are allowed to access that service in
LDAP:

<pre     class="programlisting">
dn: cn=login,ou=hosts,o=ci,dc=example,dc=com
objectClass: top
objectClass: ipHost
cn: login
ipHostNumber: 192.168.1.2

dn: cn=sshd,cn=login,ou=hosts,o=ci,dc=example,dc=com
objectClass: top
objectClass: ipService
cn: sshd
ipServicePort: 22
ipServiceProtocol: tcp
ipServiceProtocol: udp
description: SSH Daemon

dn: cn=all-local,cn=sshd,cn=login,ou=hosts,o=ci,
&#8618;dc=example,dc=com
objectClass: top
objectClass: ipNetwork
cn: all-local
ipNetworkNumber: 192.168.1.0
ipNetmaskNumber: 255.255.255.0
description: Local Network
</pre>
</p><p>
Next, we need something that will traverse all the hosts and give us
iptables rules for each one. In the on-line Resources, I've provided a
script I've written, create-iptables.sh, which does exactly that. It
depends on several Perl modules to which I've provided links in the
Resources. What it does, briefly, is copy a
prefix file for each host that has some rules that apply for all hosts and sets
up the chains we use in the script. Next, it makes sure that all the
IPs the host uses are allowed to connect back to the host. It then
traverses the services, opening holes for those networks listed for each
service. Finally, it appends the default rule set, which is to drop all
packets. All the scripts are written to the directory iptables-scripts,
and all previous scripts are saved to iptables-backups. You should create
these directories before running the script. These scripts can then be
pushed out to the proper hosts and run to keep host rules up to date.
</p><p>
You could easily modify this script to generate other pieces, such as
/etc/hosts.allow and network device ACLs for added security. Another
use for this type of directory structure is to generate custom scans
for nmap or nessus to eliminate false positives.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc03580.0xcfc268"></a>
More LDAP Uses</h2></div></div><p>
The last example I've included is generating a dhcpd.conf file for your
DHCP server. This script requires that the hosts in LDAP be members of
both the ipHost and ieee802Device object classes and have their
macAddress and ipHostNumber attributes assigned. It's not a very
sophisticated script, in that it won't make sure that a host's IP is
valid. It also won't handle a host that has multiple IPs or multiple
subnets served by the same DHCP server.
</p><p>
There is a patch for ISC's DHCP server to add support for getting
information directly out of LDAP, but I prefer to wait for patches to
be vetted and included in the main distribution before use on production
servers. For those who are curious, I've included a link in the Resources.
</p><p>
Many more applications are including LDAP support directly, or there are
patches available. There is an LDAP sdb back end for BIND 9 for storing
zone info in LDAP, and sudo has the ability to get sudoers information
from LDAP. However, remember, if there's something you want to do with
LDAP for your organization that requires new attributes or object classes,
you can contact IANA to be assigned your own OID for use.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc03580.0xcfc420"></a>
Extending Kerberos Use</h2></div></div><p>
Up until now, we've been dealing with extending the use of LDAP, but there
are more ways we can make use of Kerberos as well.
One important piece
in your organization for which you might want single sign-on enabled is
authenticating for Web resources. Many modern browsers, such as IE 6.0,
Mozilla, Firefox and Safari, already (or can be made to) support GSSAPI
negotiation. To make use of this, you can install and enable the Apache
mod_auth_kerb module. It can negotiate ticket-based authentication for
single sign-on or present the user with a traditional user name/password
box and authenticate the user to the KDC.
</p><p>
One other extension of Kerberos has come in the form of NFSv4. Version
4 of NFS has included stronger security as part of the protocol. It has
ACL support and can use a user's Kerberos credentials for access and
rights. The CITI group at the University of Michigan is spearheading the
Linux implementation of NFSv4 and has links to all the patches you'll
need for the user-space tools. Recent 2.6 kernels come with support for
NFSv4 and rpcsec_gss, but some distributions don't enable the support
by default. The necessary packages can be emerged on Gentoo systems, and
the support is fully there in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.

Wrapping Up</h2></div></div><p>
We've come a long way in this series of articles. You should have
a scalable directory and single sign-on environment. We've gone over
how to integrate heterogeneous clients into the infrastructure. Lastly,
we've covered how you, the sysadmin, can more easily manage and leverage
your LDAP and Kerberos environments.
