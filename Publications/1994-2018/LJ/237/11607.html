<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #237, January 2014</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
A recent bug hunt by kernel developers ended up identifying a long-standing
bug in <span   class="bold"><b>GCC</b></span>. The indications were there from the start, but it took some
investigation to nail it down.
</p><p>
Originally, <span   class="bold"><b>Fengguang Wu</b></span> reported a kernel
oops, and used &ldquo;git bisect&rdquo; to
identify the specific patch that revealed the problem. It was an
optimization suggested by <span   class="bold"><b>Linus Torvalds</b></span>
and implemented by <span   class="bold"><b>Peter Zijlstra</b></span> that
aimed at freeing up a hardware register by using the &ldquo;asm
goto&rdquo; instruction
in the kernel's <span   class="bold"><b>modify_and_test()</b></span> functions.
</p><p>
The first indication that the problem might boil down to a compiler bug was
that the patch just seemed correct to folks. Neither Peter nor Linus were
able to see anything wrong with it, so they suggested trying to reproduce
the oops on kernels compiled with different versions of GCC, and Linus
suggested disabling &ldquo;asm goto&rdquo; directly to see if that had any effect.
</p><p>
At first, Fengguang found that earlier compilers made no difference. He'd
started off using GCC 4.8.1, but 4.6.1 also produced a kernel that would
reproduce the oops. But as Linus suspected, disabling &ldquo;asm
goto&rdquo; in the
kernel code did fix the problem. After a while, Fengguang also discovered
that the older GCC version 4.4.7 also produced a working kernel, because
that compiler had no support for &ldquo;asm goto&rdquo;.
</p><p>
Gradually, other folks began to be able to reproduce the problem on their
own systems. Originally, the issue seemed to affect only 32-bit Linux
systems, but ultimately, Linus was able to reproduce the problem on his own
64-bit system. It was harder to trigger on a 64-bit system, but it boiled
down to being the same problem. As the scope of the problem began to reveal
itself, Linus remarked, &ldquo;It makes me nervous about all our
<span   class="emphasis"><em>traditional</em></span>
uses of asm goto too, never mind the new ones.&rdquo;
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Jakub Jelinek</b></span> opened a <span   class="bold"><b>Bugzilla</b></span> ticket against GCC, and folks started
thinking about workarounds for the kernel. Even after GCC got a fix for
this particular bug, it wouldn't do to allow the kernel to miscompile on
any version of GCC, if it possibly could be avoided.
</p><p>
A workaround did end up going into the next Linux kernel release candidate,
and a fix went into GCC 2.8.2. Shortly afterward, <span   class="bold"><b>Greg Kroah-Hartman</b></span> also
adopted the kernel workaround in the 3.11.x stable tree.
</p><p>
The reason the kernel needed a workaround in spite of the fact that a real
fix went into GCC was because the kernel needs to support the widest
possible dispersion of host systems. Anyone, anywhere, with any particular
hardware setup, using any particular versions of the various development
tools, should be able to build and run the kernel. In some cases that ideal
can't be reached, but it remains an ideal nonetheless.
</p><p>
Traditionally, software could mount a filesystem only after registering it
with the kernel, so the kernel would know its name and a bit about how to
manage it. This has been true even for internal filesystems like <span   class="bold"><b>ia64</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>pfmfs</b></span>, <span   class="bold"><b>anon_inodes</b></span>, <span   class="bold"><b>bdev</b></span>, <span   class="bold"><b>pipefs</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>sockfs</b></span>. But, <span   class="bold"><b>Al
Viro</b></span> recently said
there was no longer any reason to require registration for these
filesystems, and he submitted a patch to take out the requirement.
</p><p>
First of all, he and Linus Torvalds agreed that there probably isn't any
user code that actually looks up those filesystems in the registry. There's
just no reason anyone would want to.
</p><p>
As Al explained on the mailing list, there used to be a need to
register all filesystems. But about a decade ago, the <span   class="bold"><b>kern_mount()</b></span> call
changed to take only a pointer to the filesystem, rather than needing to
look it up by name.
</p><p>
Ever since then, the need to register these internal filesystems has been
minimal. The only remaining dependency was a single data structure
initialized by <span   class="bold"><b>register_filesystem()</b></span> that was needed by all filesystems.
But, Al said that even this dependency was eliminated a couple years ago,
when the data structure was optimized no longer to need
register_filesystem(). By now, Al said, &ldquo;there's no reason to register the
filesystem types that can only be used for internal mounts.&rdquo;
</p><p>
With this change, <span   class="bold"><b>/proc/filesystems</b></span> would no longer list internal
filesystems. And as Linus pointed out, those filesystems wouldn't reliably
be listed anywhere on the system. Even <span   class="bold"><b>/proc/modules</b></span>, Linus said, would
list those filesystems only if they'd been compiled as modules.
</p><p>
So, with some mild trepidation, Linus accepted the patch. If no one howls,
it'll probably stay.

I really don't understand folks who use songs as their ringtones. Isn't
it annoying or confusing when the song comes on the radio? If it's your
favorite song, don't you get desensitized to it when you listen to the CD
(or digital equivalent of CD)? Nevertheless, you probably hear dozens
of ringtones every day. Those probably vary from &ldquo;super
annoying&rdquo; to
&ldquo;what a cool ringtone&rdquo;. With Zedge, you can be the person annoying
your fellow subway passengers&mdash;or making them jealous.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11607androidf1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Screenshot from the Google Play store
</p></div></div><p>
Zedge is a free app in the Google Play store, and the ringtones (and
notification sounds and alarm sounds) are completely free as well. I
currently use the &ldquo;WHAAAT?!?!??!&rdquo; sound from the minions on
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Despicable Me</em></span>
as a notification sound (which is <span   class="emphasis"><em>clearly</em></span> super cool
and not annoying).
My ringtone, which I hear much less often than in years past, is one I
made myself from pasting together sound clips from <span   class="emphasis"><em>Star Trek the Next
Generation</em></span>. Somehow, my homemade ringtone ended up on Zedge. I know
it's mine, because I pasted together sounds that don't actually occur
together on the show. I'm terribly proud of my ringtone, and if you'd
like to hear it for yourself, search for &ldquo;Incoming Subspace
Signal&rdquo;,
it should pop right up. If <span   class="emphasis"><em>Star Trek</em></span> isn't up your alley, there are
thousands of other options from which to choose. With Zedge, installing them
is simple and, of course, free.
</p><p>
Due to its incredible selection, seamless integration
and amazing price tag, Zedge is this month's
Editors' Choice winner. Check it out today

<h2 class="title">Blu-ray Encryption&mdash;Why Most People Pirate Movies</h2>

I get a fair amount of e-mail from readers asking how a person could do
&ldquo;questionable&rdquo; things due to limitations imposed by DRM. Whether it's how
to strip DRM from ebooks, how to connect to Usenet or how to decrypt
video, I do my best to point folks in the right direction with lots of
warnings and disclaimers. The most frustrating DRM by far has been with
Blu-ray discs.
</p><p>
Unless I've missed an announcement, there still isn't a
&ldquo;proper&rdquo; way for
Linux users to watch Blu-ray movies on their computers. It's hard enough
with Windows or Macintosh, but when it comes to Linux, it seems that
turning to the dark side is the only option. In the spirit of freedom, let
me
point you in the direction of &ldquo;how&rdquo;, and leave it up to you to
decide whether it's
a road you want to travel.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11607blurayf1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
When ripping a movie from Blu-ray, I know of only one program that can do
the job. MakeMKV is a cross-platform utility that will extract the full,
uncompressed movie from most Blu-ray discs. Unfortunately, you have to
download the source code and compile it. You need both the binaries
and the source download files, and then follow the included directions for
compiling the software. Yes, it's a bit complex.
</p><p>
Once you compile MakeMKV, you should be able to use it to extract the
Blu-ray disc to your computer. Be warned, the file is
<span   class="emphasis"><em>enormous</em></span>, and you'll
most likely want to compress it a bit. The tool for that thankfully
is much easier to install. Handbrake has been the de facto standard video
encoding app for a long time, and when paired with MakeMKV, it makes
creating playable video files close to painless. I won't go through the
step-by-step process, but if the legally questionable act of ripping a
Blu-ray disc is something you're comfortable doing, <a href="http://www.makemkv.com" target="_self">www.makemkv.com</a> and
<a href="http://www.handbrake.fr" target="_self">www.handbrake.fr</a> are the two software packages you'll want to explore.

Back in the mid-1990s, a college friend (hi Russ!) and I would
put our old 8088 computers to work rendering ray-traced images for
days&mdash;literally. The end result would be, by today's standards, incredibly
low resolution and not terribly interesting. Still, the thought of a
computer system creating realistic photos from nothing more than math
equations was fascinating. As you probably already guessed, Russ and I
weren't terribly popular.

All these years later, the same ray-tracing software we used back then

<h2 class="title">Taking Fractals off the Page</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Joey Bernard</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #237, January 2014</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Fractals are one of the weirder things you may come across when studying
computer science and programming algorithms. From Wikipedia:
&ldquo;A fractal is a mathematical set that has a fractal
dimension that usually exceeds its topological dimension and may fall
between integers.&rdquo; This is a really odd concept&mdash;that you could have
something like an image that isn't made up of lines or of surfaces, but
something in between. 
The term fractal was coined by Benoit Mandelbrot
in 1975. 
</p><p>
A key property of fractals is that they are self-similar. This
means if you zoom in on a fractal, it will look similar to the
way the fractal looked originally. The concept of recursion also
is very important here. Many types of fractal algorithms use recursion to
generate the values in the given set. Almost everyone has seen computer
generated images of classic fractals, like the Mandelbrot set or the
Cantor set. One thing about all of these classic images is that they are
two-dimensional (or actually greater than one and less than two-dimensional,
if you want to be pedantic). But there is nothing that forces this to be
the case. Fractals can be any dimension, including greater than two. And
with modern 3-D graphics cards, there is no reason why you shouldn't be
able to examine these and play with them. Now you can, with the software
package Mandelbulber (<a href="http://www.mandelbulber.com" target="_self">www.mandelbulber.com</a>).
</p><p>
Mandelbulber is an experimental, open-source package that lets you render
three-dimensional fractal images and interact with them. It is written using
the GTK toolkit, so there are downloads available for Windows and Mac
OS X as well as Linux. Actually, most Linux distributions should include
it in their package management systems. If not, you always can download
the source code and build it from scratch. 
</p><p>
If you want some inspiration
on what is possible with Mandelbulber, I strongly suggest you
go check out the gallery of images that have been generated with this
software. There are some truly innovative and amazing images out there, and
some of them include the parameters you need in order to regenerate the
image on your own. The Mandelbulber Wiki provides a large amount of information
(<a href="http://wiki.mandelbulber.com/index.php?title=Main_Page" target="_self">wiki.mandelbulber.com/index.php?title=Main_Page</a>). When you are done reading this
article, check out everything else that you can do
with Mandelbulber.
</p><p>
When you first start up Mandelbulber, three windows open. The
first is the parameters window (Figure 1). Along the very top
are the two main buttons: render and stop. Below that is a list of 12
buttons that pull up different panes of parameters. You get an initial
set of default parameters that will generate a 3-D version of
the classic Mandelbrot set. Clicking on the render button will start
the rendering process. If you have multiple cores on your machine,
Mandelbulber will grab them to help speed up the calculations. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11607mandelf1.large.jpg"><img src="11607mandelf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. The main window gives you all parameters that control the
generation of your fractal.
</p></div></div><p>
The
rendered plot will be drawn in its own window (Figure 2).
The third window shows you some measures of how the rendering
progressed (Figure 3). You get two histograms describing the
number of iterations and the number of steps. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11607mandelf2.large.jpg"><img src="11607mandelf2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. This is what the default 3-D fractal looks like.
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11607mandelf3.large.jpg"><img src="11607mandelf3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Histograms of the Rendering Progression
</p></div></div><p>
To generate new images,
more than 70 examples are included with the installation of Mandelbulber
that you can use as starting points. Clicking on the button Load example
pulls up a file dialog where you can load one of them. For example,
you could load &ldquo;menger sponge.fract&rdquo;. Clicking the render button will
generate a 3-D Sierpinski sponge (Figure 4). Although
technically, the set is only one topological dimension that encloses zero
volume (aren't fractals weird?).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11607mandelf4.large.jpg"><img src="11607mandelf4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. A Sierpinski sponge has infinite surface area and zero
volume.
</p></div></div><p>
What can you change in Mandelbulber? Clicking on the fractal button
pulls up the pane where you can set the parameters for the fractal
itself (Figure 5). You can select from several different
types of fractal formula types, such as mandelbulb, quaternion or menger
sponge. You can set several options, depending on exactly which fractal type
you choose. For example, if you select the iterated function system (IFS),
you then can click on the IFS tab to set several different parameters. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11607mandelf5.large.jpg"><img src="11607mandelf5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. There are several different fractal types from which to choose.
</p></div></div><p>
One
of the issues is coming up with truly unique, yet aesthetically pleasing,
sets of equations with which to experiment. To help in this regard, Mandelbulber
has a hybrid option in the list of fractal types. When you select this
option, you then can choose the hybrid button and set up to five different
fractal equations (Figure 6). With this option, you can create
very complex and sophisticated fractals to render.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11607mandelf6.large.jpg"><img src="11607mandelf6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. You can create a hybrid system made from a mix of
up to five different fractal types.
</p></div></div><p>
Mandelbulber doesn't just generate static images of these higher
dimensional fractals. There is an option to generate animations of how
these images change when some parameter is swept over. To start, you
need to click on the Timeline button at the bottom of the view
pane. This pulls up a timeline window where you can set the parameters
used to generate your animation. The record button puts parameters
into the actual keyframe number (Key no. field on the right). It then
loads and renders the next keyframe if it is not the last keyframe. 
</p><p>
Then, you can add new keyframes with the &ldquo;insert after&rdquo; button or delete
keyframes with the Delete button. To modify a given keyframe, you can
double-click it to set the parameters, and then you can click on record to
render the keyframe. 
</p><p>
Interpolation between the keyframes is handled by
Catmull-Rom splines. Once you have the keyframes handled, you will need
to render the full animation. Clicking on the Animation button in the
main window brings up the parameters you can set. These include
things like the number of frames to render from the keyframes, as well
as the start and end frame numbers. You then can click on the Render
from key-frames button to generate the animation. On my netbook, this
is a pretty long process. For image generation, you also have control
over camera position, lighting and shader options. You should be able
to generate the exact image or animation that you want.
</p><p>
If you are looking to generate some amazing 3-D landscapes
or unique shapes for something science-fictiony, you definitely
should check out Mandelbulber&mdash;just be prepared to lose several hours as you
start playing with all of the parameters available.

<h2 class="title">Make Peace with pax</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">James K. Lowden</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #237, January 2014</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
pax is one of the lesser known utilities in a typical Linux
installation. That's too bad, because pax has a very good feature set,
and its command-line options are easy to understand and remember.
pax is an archiver, like tar(1), but it's also a better version of cp(1) in
some ways, not least because you can use pax with SSH to copy sets
of files over a network. Once you learn pax, you may wonder how you
lived without it all these years.
</p><p>
pax has four modes: list, read, write and copy. Reading and writing
are controlled by the <tt  >-r</tt> and
<tt  >-w</tt> options, repectively. In combination,
<tt  >-rw</tt>, pax acts a little bit like <tt  >cp
-R</tt>. If neither is used, pax lists
the contents of the archive, which may be a file, device or a pipe.
</p><p>
By default, pax operates as a filter: it reads from standard input and
writes to standard output, a feature that turns out to be very useful.
But usually these days, the target is an archive file, the familiar
tarball. Let's start by creating one:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ cd /tmp
$ mkdir paxample
$ touch paxample/foo
$ pax -wf paxample.tar paxample
</pre>
</p><p>
The <tt  >-w</tt> option means &ldquo;write&rdquo;&mdash;that
is, create an archive. The <tt  >-f</tt> option
provides the name of a file to which to write the archive. If desired, pax
can gzip or bzip the file at the same time:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ pax -wzf paxample.tar.gz paxample
</pre>
</p><p>
Like most tar implementations, pax, by default, uses the Posix ustar file
format. Because pax was born of a desire to unify archive file
formats, many other formats also are supported, but in practice, they're
seldom used. Likely as not, any .tar.gz file you download from the
Internet actually will be a ustar archive:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ pax -wzf paxample.tar.gz paxample
$ file paxample.tar*
paxample.tar:    POSIX tar archive
paxample.tar.gz: gzip compressed data
</pre>
</p><p>
The first thing you nearly always want to know about any archive is
what's in it. Listing the contents is the default action in the
absence of either a <tt  >-r</tt> or <tt  >-w</tt>
option:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ pax -f paxample.tar
paxample
paxample/foo
</pre>
</p><p>
Note that the archive retains the directory name you specified
on the command line. That comes into play later when you read it.
</p><p>
To read an archive, use <tt  >-r</tt>:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ mkdir t
$ cd t
$ pax -rf ../paxample.tar
</pre>
</p><p>
What did that do? Let's look at the source and target directories:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ cd /tmp
$ find paxample t # traverse both trees
paxample
paxample/foo
t
t/paxample
t/paxample/foo
</pre>
</p><p>
When pax read the paxample.tar archive, it created files in the current
directory, t. Because the archive included a directory name, paxample,
that directory was re-created in the output.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Copying Sets of Files</b></span>
</p><p>
To my mind, pax's <tt  >-r</tt> and <tt  >-w</tt>
options make more sense than their <tt  >-x</tt>
and <tt  >-c</tt> equivalents in tar&mdash;reason enough to switch.
But, pax can do more
than tar: it can copy files too:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ rm -rf t
$ pax -rw paxample t
$ find t
t
t/paxample
t/paxample/foo
</pre>
</p><p>
Unlike cp(1), pax is an archive utility. Its job isn't to make copies,
but to archive files. When pax creates a file, it preserves the file's
metadata from its input. The form of the input doesn't matter. In this
case, the input isn't from an archive, it's the file itself:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ls -l paxample/foo t/paxample/foo
-rw-r--r--  1 jklowden  wheel  0 Sep 22 15:45 paxample/foo
-rw-r--r--  1 jklowden  wheel  0 Sep 22 15:45 t/paxample/foo
</pre>
</p><p>
Yes&mdash;two identical files with two identical timestamps. The
permission bits and ownership can be controlled too, if desired. Take
that, cp(1)!
</p><p>
Perhaps you don't want to re-create the directory, or perhaps you want to change it
in some way. One option is not to mention the input directory on the
command line, but instead provide filenames:

<pre     class="programlisting">

$ rm -rf t/paxample/
$ (cd paxample/ &amp;&amp; pax -rw * ../t/)
$ find t
t
t/foo

</pre>
</p><p>
That's usually easiest. But if you need something more sophisticated,
the <tt  >-s</tt> option rewrites the path&mdash;actually, any
part of the filename&mdash;using a regular expression:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ rm -rf t/*
$ pax -rw -s ':paxample:my/new/path:g' paxample/ t
$ find t
t
t/my
t/my/new
t/my/new/path
t/my/new/path/foo
</pre>
</p><p>
The <tt  >-s</tt> option is handy, for instance, when unpacking a tarball
that doesn't have version information in the directory name.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>What Could Go Wrong?</b></span>
</p><p>
If you give the wrong filename to write, you just get an archive by the
wrong namemdash;no harm no foul. If you mistype an input archive filename
though, you'll find yourself in 1985:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ pax -rf paxample.whoopsie
pax: Failed open to read on paxample.whoopsie (No such file 
or directory)

ATTENTION! pax archive volume change required.
Ready for archive volume: 1
Input archive name or "." to quit pax.
Archive name &gt;
</pre>
</p><p>
This is an idea that outlived its usefulness before it was
implemented. You could type in the filename here, again, without
readline support or tab completion. Well, at least it says what to
do:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Archive name &gt; .
Quitting pax!
</pre>
</p><p>
How exciting!
</p><p>
As mentioned previously, pax uses standard input and standard output by
default. That <span   class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> a feature, but the first time you forget to provide
a filename, you may think pax is very, very slow:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ pax  -r paxample.tar
</pre>
</p><p>
Oops! No <tt  >-f</tt>. Also no message and no prompt. pax is ignoring
the archive filename argument and reading standard input, which in this
case, is the keyboard. You could type ^D, for end-of-file, but that forms
invalid input to pax. Better to send up a smoke signal:

<pre     class="programlisting">
^C
pax: Signal caught, cleaning up.
</pre>
</p><p>
It's even worse the first time you accidentally write to standard
output while it's connected to your terminal. You heard it here
first: don't do that.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Putting Standard Input to Work</b></span>
</p><p>
Standard input and standard output do have their uses, and here
pax really comes into its own. For one thing, you can verify the effect
of the <tt  >-s</tt> option without creating an archive or the
files:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ pax -w -s ':paxample:my/new/path:g' paxample/ | pax
my/new/path
my/new/path/foo
</pre>
</p><p>
Absent the <tt  >-f</tt> option, <tt  >pax -w</tt>
writes to standard output. So rewrite the
pathname with <tt  >-s</tt>, and pipe the output to pax again, this time using its
&ldquo;list&rdquo; mode, with neither the <tt  >-r</tt> nor
<tt  >-w</tt> option. By default, pax reads from
standard input and, in &ldquo;list&rdquo; mode, prints the filenames on the
terminal.
</p><p>
That can save a lot of time, not to mention a mess on the disk, when
there are thousands of files.
</p><p>
Suppose you want to copy the paxample directory to another machine.
One approach would be to create a tarball, copy to the target, log in to
the target and unpack the tarball:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ pax -wf paxample.tar paxample
$ scp paxample.tar oak:/tmp/
paxample.tar             100%   10KB  10.0KB/s   00:00
$ ssh oak
oak[~]$ cd /tmp
oak[tmp]$ pax -rf paxample.tar
oak[tmp]$ ls paxample/
foo
</pre>
</p><p>
But there's a much easier way. Invoke pax on both machines, and connect
the output of one to the input of the other:

<pre     class="programlisting">

$ pax -w paxample | ssh oak 'cd /tmp/ &amp;&amp; pax -r &amp;&amp; find paxample'
paxample
paxample/foo

</pre>
</p><p>
<tt  >pax -w</tt> writes to standard output.
<tt  >ssh</tt> reads standard input and
attaches it to whatever utility is invoked, which of course in this
case is pax again. <tt  >pax -r</tt> reads from standard input and creates the
files from that &ldquo;archive&rdquo;.
</p><p>
pax is one of the lesser known utilities in a typical Linux
installation. But it's both simple and versatile, well worth the time
it takes to learn&mdash;recommended.

Plex is one of those applications I tend to write about a lot. It's not
because I get any sort of kickback or even a discount, but rather
it's just an incredible system that keeps getting better. 
For this piece, I want to talk about PlexWeb, which functions much like the Android app
I've mentioned before, but works completely inside a Web browser&mdash;almost
any Web browser, on any operating system.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11607plexf1.large.jpg"><img src="11607plexf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
You can access PlexWeb by surfing to <a href="http://my.plexapp.com" target="_self">my.plexapp.com</a> and logging in
with your free account. (If you have a static IP at home, you also
can connect directly to your home server by bookmarking the URL generated
by plexapp.com.) You will be redirected to your home server, and you'll
be able to transcode and stream your movies to any computer, anywhere.
</p><p>
I freely admit that I wish Plex was open source. Thankfully, however,
its proprietary code does't mean Linux users are excluded. Whether you're
using the Plex app on your Android device, installing Plex Home Theater
on your Linux machine or even streaming video to your Aunt Edna's
Web browser while visiting over the holidays, Plex is an incredible tool
that keeps getting better. PlexWeb is free, but if you're interested
in experiencing the latest and greatest Plex has to offer, a PlexPass
subscription will get you access to features like Cloud Sync before
anyone else gets to see them! To get started with Plex, visit the
Web site at <a href="http://www.plexapp.com" target="_self">www.plexapp.com</a>.
