Innodisk's FlexiArray SE108 and HD224 Storage Appliances</h2></div></div><p>
The secret to the performance advances in Innodisk's FlexiArray line of
storage appliances is the company's novel FlexiRemap Technology, which deals
with the challenges of I/O performance, data endurance and affordability.
FlexiRemap, notes Innodisk, innovates in software and firmware, creating a
new category of Flash-collaborating storage appliances (in contrast to
Flash-aware or Flash-optimized) that deliver sustained high IOPS, even for
random write operations. Innodisk's first storage appliances to leverage
this technology, the new FlexiArray SE108 and HD224, are designed to provide
cost-effective performance for high-performance computing, cloud computing
and I/O bound server applications. Typical application areas include cloud
computing, virtualization and HPC. The slim SE108
offers up to 2TB of storage in a 1U-rackmount package; the HD224 provides
up to 8TB in a 2U-rackmount unit, with 8x 10GbE SFP+ interfaces. Both
units offer redundant hot-swappable SSDs and power modules.

Magic Software Enterprises' Magic xpi Integration Platform</h2></div></div><p>
With most core enterprise systems in place, organizations of all sizes are
looking to business process integration and automation to increase
operational efficiency and competitiveness. The updated Magic xpi
Integration Platform from Magic Software Enterprises is a cloud-ready

AdaCore's GNAT Programming Studio</h2></div></div><p>
&ldquo;Usability&rdquo; is the word that best captures the essence of the new
version 6.0 release of AdaCore's GNAT Programming Studio (GPS) graphical
IDE. This &ldquo;major engineering effort&rdquo; features a significantly
revised and cleaner user interface that eases program navigation and
editing. The revised look and feel, which exploits the latest Gtk+/GtkAda
graphical toolkit, is supported by a new relational database at the heart
of the GPS engine, making code navigation much more efficient. GPS 6.0 also
brings improved performance and new functionality, including language
support for SPARK 2014, syntax highlighting and tool tips for Ada 2012 and
SPARK 2014 aspects, editor enhancements and a number of additions to the
scripting API.

Rahul Singh's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Kali Linux Social Engineering</em></span> (Packt Publishing)</h2></div></div><p>
The new book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Kali Linux Social Engineering</em></span> by Rahul Singh exists to help
you master the social engineering toolkit, or SET, found in the
security-focused Kali Linux distribution. With Singh's book in hand,
readers can learn how security can be breached using social-engineering
attacks, as well as attain a very unique ability to perform a security
audit based on social engineering attacks. Starting with attacks using
Kali, this book describes in detail various Web site attack vectors and
client side attacks that can be performed through SET. This book covers
some of the most advanced techniques that currently are being utilized by
attackers to get inside secured networks, covering phishing (credential

Jack Moffitt and Fred Daoud's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Seven Web Frameworks in Seven
Weeks</em></span> (Pragmatic
Bookshelf)</h2></div></div><p>
There's something to the &ldquo;Seven in Seven Weeks&rdquo; concept in the tech
books from Pragmatic Bookshelf. The latest addition in this practical
series is Jack Moffitt and Fred Daoud's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Seven Web Frameworks in Seven
Weeks: Adventures in Better Web Apps</em></span>. Whether you need a new tool or merely
a dose of inspiration, this work explores your options and gives you
sufficient exposure to each one, along with tips for
creating better apps. The authors cover frameworks that leverage modern
programming languages, employ unique architectures, live client-side
instead of server-side or embrace type systems. Covered frameworks include
Sinatra, CanJS, AngularJS, Ring, Webmachine, Yesod and Immutant. The
breakneck evolution of Web apps demands innovative solutions, and this
survey of frameworks and their unique perspectives is designed to inspire
and promote new thinking for dealing with daily programming challenges.

Stackinsider Deployment-as-a-Service Cloud Platform</h2></div></div><p>
Stackinsider's approach to OpenStack is packaging it as
a Deployment-as-a-Service (DaaS) cloud platform, which the company says is the
first of its kind to be public and free. Designed to make OpenStack
technology adoption significantly easier and faster than conventional
approaches, the Stackinsider DaaS approach consolidates and streamlines key
OpenStack distributions and real-world applications for a wide range of
uses. DaaS has integrated all popular IaaS deployment toolchains including
RDO, FUEL, Puppet, DevStack and Chef. Some popular applications like Moodle
and SugarCRM also are provided for PaaS prototyping. This public DaaS cloud
is available for download at Stackinsider's Web site.

JetBrains' PhpStorm</h2></div></div><p>
For JetBrains, developing a new version of the PhpStorm IDE for PHP means
more than keeping on top of the latest changes in Web languages. It is also
about supporting and integrating modern tools and popular frameworks, not
to mention removing obstacles on the road to productive Web development. Of
course, the new PhpStorm 7 supports the latest PHP 5.5 with improved PHP
syntax coloring, new refactorings, code inspections and quick-fixes.
Support also has been added for various front-end Web technologies, such as
different JavaScript templates, Web Components and modern stylesheets.
Built-in tools for Vagrant, SSH console and local terminal and Google App
Engine for PHP have been added too. Finally, support has been enhanced for
various frameworks, including Drupal, Symfony2 and others.
