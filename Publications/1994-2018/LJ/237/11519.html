Classical cryptography provides security based on unproven
mathematical assumptions and depends on the technology available to
an eavesdropper. But, these things might not be enough in the near future to
guarantee
cyber security. We need something that
provides unconditional security. We need quantum cryptography.

Imagine you want to send a message to your friend, and you don't
want others to be able to read the message. You lock your message in a box
using a key and send the box to your friend. Your friend also has
a key to unlock that box, so he easily can open the box and read the
message. In general, this is the technique used by cryptographic
algorithms. Locking the message in the box is like encryption, and
unlocking the box is like decryption. Before sending the message to the
receiver,
the data is encrypted using an encryption algorithm and a secret key. On
the receiver side, the encrypted data is decrypted using the reverse
encryption algorithm. 
</p><p>
Classical cryptographic algorithms mostly rely on
mathematical approaches to secure key transmission. The security they
offer is based on unproven assumptions and depends on the technology
available to an eavesdropper. But, rapidly growing parallel
and quantum technologies may be a threat to these classical cryptography
techniques in the near future. One of the solutions to these threats is quantum
cryptography. 
</p><p>
What is quantum cryptography? Quantum cryptography is
a complex topic, because it brings into play something most people find
hard to understand&mdash;quantum mechanics. So first, let's focus on some basic
quantum physics that you'll need to know to understand this article.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d0a580.0x1e024b8"></a>
Simple Quantum Physics</h2></div></div><p>
Quantum, in physics, is a discrete natural unit, or packet of energy,
charge, angular momentum or other physical property. Light, for example,
appears in some respects as a continuous electromagnetic wave, but on
the submicroscopic level, it is emitted and absorbed in discrete amounts or
quanta. These particle-like packets (quanta) of light are called photons,
a term also applicable to quanta of other forms of electromagnetic energy,
such as X rays and gamma rays. 
</p><p>
One unique thing about quanta is that they
can exist in all of their possible states at once. This also applies
to photons. This means that in whatever direction a photon can
spin&mdash;say,
diagonally, vertically and horizontally&mdash;it does so all at once. Quantum
of light in this state is called unpolarized photons. This is like
someone moving north, south, east, west, up and down all at the same
time. This property is called superposition. One thing you should
keep in mind is that measuring something that is in its superposition
causes it to collapse into a definite state (one of all the possible
states). Figure 1 should help describe superposition.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11519f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Necker Cubes
</p></div></div><p>
Looking at Figure 1, you can identify one of four possibilities:
either both squares are protruding forward or both are backward, or one
is forward and the other is backward. Each time you look at the diagram, only
one possibility is true. In a sense, all four options exist together,
but when you look at the diagram, it collapses into just one. This is
the essence of quantum superposition. 
</p><p>
Through the use of polarization
filters, you can force the photon to take one of its states, or technically,
polarize it. If you use a vertical polarizing filter, some photons will
be absorbed, and some will emerge on the other side of the filter. Those
photons that aren't absorbed will emerge on the other side with a vertical
spin. Thus, you can polarize the photons to your required orientation using
suitable filters.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11519f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Polarizing Photons
</p></div></div><p>
The foundation of quantum physics is the unpredictability factor. This
unpredictability is pretty much defined by Heisenberg's Uncertainty
Principle. This principle says that certain pairs of physical properties are
related in such a way that measuring one property prevents the observer
from knowing the value of the other. But, when dealing with photons for
encryption, Heisenberg's Principle can be used to your advantage. When
measuring the polarization of a photon, the choice of what direction to
measure affects all subsequent measurements. The thing about photons is
that once they are polarized, they can't be measured accurately again,
except by a filter like the one that initially produced their current
spin. So if a photon with a vertical spin is measured through a diagonal
filter, either the photon won't pass through the filter or the filter
will affect the photon's behavior, causing it to take a diagonal spin. In
this sense, the information on the photon's original polarization is lost.

Figure 3. Effect of Various Basis on Polarized Photons
</p></div></div><p>
In the diagram in Figure 3, I have used the wrong basis for the last two cases,
and you
can see that I have changed the polarization of two photons.

Quantum Information</h2></div></div><p>
The bit is the fundamental concept of classical computation and classical
information. Quantum computation and quantum information are built
upon an analogous concept: the quantum bit, or qbit for short. Just
as a classical bit has a state of either 0 or 1, a qbit is like a bit,
but it is in superposition between 0 and 1. Two possible states for a
qbit are the states &ldquo;|0 &gt;&rdquo; and &ldquo;|1 &gt;&rdquo; . This notation is called Dirac
notation. A qbit can be fully expressed as: a|0 &gt; +b|1 &gt; with
a<sup  >2</sup> + b<sup  >2</sup> =
1. When we measure a qbit, we get a 0 with probability
a<sup  >2</sup> and 1 with
b<sup  >2</sup>. 
</p><p>
Now consider a quantum computer with two qbits. There are four
possible states: |00 &gt;, |01 &gt;, |10 &gt; and |11 &gt;, and its superposition is
a|00&gt;+b|01&gt;+c|10&gt;+d|11&gt;, where a<sup  >2</sup>,
b<sup  >2</sup>, c<sup  >2</sup> and
d<sup  >2</sup> are the probabilities
of finding two qbits in any of the four states. In a quantum computer,
the two bits are in all possible states at one time. So it is possible
to add a number to the two bits, which means we can add the number to
00,01,10,11 and compute the result at the same time. This ability to
operate on all states at one time makes it so powerful. 
</p><p>
Here the number of
parallel operations depends on the number of qbits used. If N number
of qbits are used, then 2<sup  >N</sup> operations can be
done in parallel, and this
inherent parallelism makes quantum computers so fast. But the question is,
how do you encode a photon as a qbit? We know a photon has its own spin
in all possible directions. As in certain digital systems, we consider +5
volts as 1 and 0 volts as 0, and we can use the spin property of a photon to encode
a photon as a qbit. We can use the photon's spin in a particular direction
as 1 and the spin in the other direction as 0&mdash;say, a photon with vertical spin
will be considered as 1 and a photon with an angular spin as 0.

Quantum Cryptography</h2></div></div><p>
Before starting to describe what quantum cryptography is, let me introduce 
three names I use throughout this article: Alice,
Bob and Eve. Alice is sending the message, and Bob is receiving the message.
Eve is in between them, trying to intercept the message. What
Eve does is somehow collect the secret key to the message and decrypts
it. Now, if Alice somehow can send the key of the message to Bob without
any interception, she can send the message without problems.
</p><p>
Now, let me
discuss the BB84 protocol. It is based on the name of the inventors
Charles Bennet and Gilles Brassard, and it was invented in 
1984. Quantum cryptography follows two steps. The first one is sending the
secret key, and the second step is sending the message. Here, Alice and
Bob make use of two fundamentally different communication channels:
a classical channel and a quantum channel. A classical channel is something
that you use on the Internet to transfer data. In a classical channel, Eve can
observe the bit-stream without affecting the data. But, a quantum channel
is something different. It is capable of sending information in terms of
quantum, and Eve can't observe the data without affecting the data. In the BB84
protocol, the secret key is sent through the quantum channel, but the message is
sent through the ordinary channel but encrypted by the secret key. The first
step is called Quantum Key Distribution (QKD). In this step, Alice and Bob
use the quantum channel for communication. 
</p><p>
First, let's imagine there
is no Eve between Alice and Bob. Let's assume that Alice is using two types of
polarizer: one is a diagonal polarizer (X) and one a rectilinear polarizer (+). In
a rectilinear basis, a photon with a spin &ldquo;|&rdquo; (that is, up to down ) is considered
as 1, and a &ldquo;-&rdquo; (that is, left to right) is 0. In a diagonal
basis, a photon
with a spin &ldquo;/&rdquo; is considered as 1, and &ldquo;\&rdquo; is 0.
The diagram shown in Figure 5 should help you understand how I'm 
representing photons as binary values. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11519f5.large.jpg"><img src="11519f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. Binary Encoding of Photons in My Examples
</p></div></div><p>
Now Alice has a key, and for each bit, she will select a random basis
(either diagonal or rectilinear) to encode the bit
to send. Nobody, not even Bob, knows what basis Alice is using. Bob will
receive the encoded qbits, and Bob will use random basis to decode the
qbits. If he uses the same basis, he will get the exact bit that 
Alice sent; otherwise, there is a 50% chance that he will get a wrong
bit.
For example, if Alice uses a diagonal basis to encode 1, and Bob also
uses diagonal basis to decode that, then he will get a 1. If he uses a
rectilinear basis, then there is a 50% chance that he will get a 1 and a 50%
chance of getting 0. As Bob is also using random basis, there's a 50% chance
that he will use the
right basis (that is, he will use the basis that Alice used) and will decode
50% of qbits exactly, and for the 50% wrong basis, he will decode 25% of qbits
exactly, and that means Bob will decode 75% of qbits exactly. 
</p><p>
Alice and Bob will
exchange the basis they used for each bit using the normal channel without
revealing their bits. They can check for which bits they both used
the same basis, and those bits will be used as the secret key. Consider
the example shown in Table 1 where Alice is sending the secret key 100101.
</p><div class="table"><a name="N0x1d0a580.0x1e039b0"></a><p class="title"><b>Table 1. Alice Sending the Secret Key 100101</b></p><table     summary="Table 1. Alice Sending the Secret Key 10010111519t1.qrk" border="1"><colgroup><col><col><col></colgroup><thead><tr><th>&nbsp;</th><th>Alice</th><th>Bob</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Basis used</td><td>+,X,+,+,X,X</td><td>+,+,+,X,+,X</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>
In this case, Bob will decode the key as 1,0/1,0,0/1,0/1,1. Because Bob has
used some wrong basis to measure the qbits, he may get a 0 or 1 randomly
on those cases. Then, they will exchange their basis with others, and
they will find that in positions 2, 4 and 5, Bob used the wrong basis. So
they will use the rest of the bit (1st, 3rd and 6th bit) string as the secret
key&mdash;that is, 
101. The rest is simple, just encrypt the message using that key and
send it. 
</p><p>
The situation becomes critical when Eve comes
into action. As they are connecting using the public channel, it is quite possible
that Eve will intercept the communication. In this case, as with the previous
case,
Alice encodes the bit information using any basis and sends it to
Bob, but now Eve intercepts the qbits. Like Bob, Eve also has a decoder of the
qbit. But Eve also doesn't know the basis Alice is using, so like
Bob, she also randomly uses basis to decode the qbits. There is a 50% chance
that Eve will use the right basis, and a 50% chance she will use the wrong
basis. For the correct 50%,
the photon's spin direction will not be affected, but for the wrong 50%,
the photon's spin direction will be changed. For the 50% of qbits for which
Eve used the right basis, Bob will use a 25% right basis and 25% wrong basis, and
for the right 25% of qbits, he will get a 25% right qbit, and for the wrong 25%
basis Bob used, he will get 12.5% of qbits correct just due to probability. That
means from the first 50% for which Eve used the right basis, Bob will get 37.5%
correct qbits. For the rest of the 50%, again Bob will use 25% right and 25% wrong
basis. From this, Bob will get 12.5% and 12.5% due to probability, which
means he will get 25% right qbits. So when Eve is between them, Bob will
have 37.5 + 25 = 62.5% accuracy. 
Figure 6 demonstrates this calculation.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11519f6.large.jpg"><img src="11519f6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. Accuracy Calculation for Bob When Eve Is Intercepting
</p></div></div><p>
In Figure 6, the node with &ldquo;**&rdquo;, like C**, represents the nodes where Bob
decoded the qbits correctly, and the node with &ldquo;*&rdquo;, like F*,
represents the
nodes where Bob decoded the qbits incorrectly. One question that may arise is
why does Bob get 12.5% accuracy (in E,L) when he used the wrong
basis? Remember that when you use a wrong basis to
decode a qbit, there is a 50% chance that you will get a 0, and a 50% chance
that you will get a 1. 
By this logic, Bob will have 12.5% accuracy from D. Similarly,
in the case of I, when Bob has used the correct basis (with respect to Alice's
basis) but Eve already has changed the polarization of the qbits using the
wrong basis, Bob has a 50% chance of being right and a 50% chance of being wrong. 
</p><p>
So overall, Bob gets 12.5% right qbits in I and 12.5% wrong qbits in J. Now they will
match the basis they used for each qbit, and they will use the bits where
Bob used the correct basis, and they will throw out the bits for which
Bob used the wrong basis. Now they need to check whether Eve is listening.
For that purpose, they will use a subset of the matched key (after
throwing out the bits for which Bob used wrong basis) and compare with others
using the normal channel. Bob will have 100% accuracy if Eve is not there;
otherwise, Bob will have 75% accuracy in the basis comparison. If the accuracy is
100%, they will discard the set of bits they used for matching, and
the rest of the bit string will be used as the key to encrypt the message. If 100%
accuracy is not observed, they will try again to get a key using QKD.
</p><p>
In Table 2, Alice is sending a key of &ldquo;01101011&rdquo; to Bob 
using two types of polarization as stated above.
</p><div class="table"><a name="N0x1d0a580.0x21fc548"></a><p class="title"><b>Table 2. Alice Sending a Key of 01101011 to Bob Using Two Types
of Polarization</b></p><table     summary="Table 2. Alice Sending a Key of 01101011 to Bob Using Two Types&#10;of Polarization11519t2.qrk" border="1"><colgroup><col><col><col><col><col><col><col><col><col></colgroup><tbody><tr><td>Alice's basis</td><td>+</td><td>X</td><td>+</td><td>+</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>X</td></tr><tr><td>Alice's data</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Eve's basis</td><td>+</td><td>+</td><td>X</td><td>+</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>+</td></tr><tr><td>Eve's data</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Bob's basis</td><td>+</td><td>+</td><td>+</td><td>X</td><td>+</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>X</td></tr><tr><td>Bob's data</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>
Now Alice and Bob will compare their basis, and they will find that Bob has
guessed the 1st, 3rd, 7th and 8th basis correctly. So they will throw out
the bits for the remaining positions&mdash;that is, the 2nd, 4th, 5th and
6th. Now the key is
&ldquo;0011&rdquo;. They will choose the first two bits for matching, and then they
will find that their second bit in the key is different, which means Eve
is between them. Then they will repeat the same procedure again until
they get a 100% key match. When they get a key, they easily
can encrypt the message using the key and send it via the public network.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d0a580.0x21fdc50"></a>
Limitations</h2></div></div><p>
In practice, the quantum channel also will be affected by noise, and it
will be hard to distinguish between noise and eavesdropping.
</p><p>
If Eve wants, she can intercept the quantum channel just to not allow
Alice and Bob to communicate.
</p><p>
No amplifiers are used on the optical fiber carrying the quantum
signal. Such devices would disrupt the communication in the
same way an eavesdropper does. This implies, in turn, that QKD's range
is limited.
</p><p>
Following the no-cloning theorem, QKD can provide only a 1:1
connection. So the number of links will increase N(N &ndash; 1)/2, as
 N represents the number of nodes.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d0a580.0x21fdeb8"></a>
Research</h2></div></div><p>
Researchers have been developing such systems for more than a
decade. The DARPA Quantum Network, which became fully operational in BBN's
laboratory in October 2003, has been continuously running in six nodes,
operating through the telecommunications fiber between Harvard University,
Boston University and BBN since June 2004. The DARPA Quantum Network is
the world's first quantum cryptography network, and perhaps also the
first QKD system providing continuous operation across a metropolitan
area (<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0503058" target="_self">arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0503058</a>).
</p><p>
NIST performs core research on the creation, transmission, processing and
measurement of optical qbits. It demonstrated high-speed QKD systems
that generate secure keys for encryption and decryption of information
using a one-time pad cipher, and extended them into a three-node quantum
communications network (<a href="http://w3.antd.nist.gov/qin/index.shtml" target="_self">w3.antd.nist.gov/qin/index.shtml</a>).
</p><p>
Toshiba's Quantum Key Distribution System delivers digital keys for
cryptographic applications on fiber-optic-based computer networks based
on quantum cryptography. In particular, it allows key distribution over
standard telecom fiber links exceeding 100km in length and bit rates
sufficient to generate 1 megabit per second of key material over a
distance of 50km&mdash;sufficiently long for metropolitan coverage
(<a href="https://www.toshiba-europe.com/research/crl/qig/quantumkeyserver.html" target="_self">https://www.toshiba-europe.com/research/crl/qig/quantumkeyserver.html</a>).
</p><p>
The current status of quantum cryptography in Japan includes an inter-city
QKD testbed based on DPS-QKD, a field test of a one-way BB84 system over
97km with noise-free WDM clock synchronization, and so on (&ldquo;Toward New
Generation Quantum Cryptography&mdash;Japanese Strategy&rdquo; by Nukuikita,
Koganei).
</p><p>
The 973 Program and 863 program of China have funded support to the
QKD research (Post-Quantum Cryptography: Third International Workshop,
Pqcrypto 2010, Darmstadt, Germany, May 25&ndash;28, 2010,
Proceedings, 1st ed.).
</p><p>
In Europe, the SEcure COmmunication based on Quantum Cryptography (SECOQC,
2004&ndash;2008) project was funded for the same reason
(http://vcq.quantum.at/publications/all-publications/details/643.html).
</p><p>
In 2004, ID Quantique was the first in the world to bring a quantum key
distribution system to a commercial market. ID Quantique's QKD product
was used in conjunction with layer 2 Ethernet encryption to secure
elections in Geneva. Other companies, like MagicQ, QinetiQ and NEC, also
are working in this field. Companies claim to offer or to be developing QKD
products, but limited information is publicly available. However, it's 
likely that the situation will evolve in the near future
