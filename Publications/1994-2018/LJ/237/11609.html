Script auteur Dave Taylor explores smart ways to use ImageMagick and Bash
to copyright and watermark images in bulk.

Let's start with some homework. Go to Google (or Bing) and search
for &ldquo;privacy is dead, get over it&rdquo;. I first heard this from Bill
Joy, cofounder of Sun Microsystems, but it's attributed to a number of
tech folk, and there's an element of truth to it. Put something on-line
and it's in the wild, however much you'd prefer to keep it under
control.
</p><p>
Don't believe it? Ask musicians or book authors or film-makers. Now,
whether the people who would download a 350-page PDF instead of paying $14
for a print book are hurting sales, that's another question entirely,
but the Internet is public and open, even the parts that we wish
were not.
</p><p>
This means if you're a photographer or upload images
you'd like to protect or control, you have a difficult task ahead of
you. Yes, you can add some code to your Web pages that makes it impossible
to right-click to save the image, but it's impossible to shut
down theft of intellectual property completely in the on-line
world.
</p><p>
This is why a lot of professional photographers don't post images
on-line that are bigger than low-resolution thumbnails. You can imagine
that
wedding photographers who make their money from selling prints (not shooting
the wedding) pay very close attention to this sort of thing!
</p><p>
Just as people have learned to accept poor video in the interest of candor
and funny content thanks to YouTube, so have people also learned to accept
low-res images for free rather than paying even a nominal fee for license
rights and a high-res version of the photograph or other artwork.
</p><p>
There is another way, however, that's demonstrated by the stock
photography companies on-line: watermarking.
</p><p>
You've no doubt seen photos with embedded copyright notices, Web site
addresses or other content that mars the image but makes it considerably
harder to separate it from its original source.
</p><p>
It turns out that our friend ImageMagick is terrific at creating these
watermarks in a variety of different ways, and that's what I
explore in this column. It's an issue for a lot of content
producers, and I know the photos I upload constantly are being ripped
off and reused on other sites without permission and without acknowledgement. 
</p><p>
To do this, the basic idea is to create a watermark-only file and then blend
that with the original image to create a new one.
Fortunately, creating the new image can be done programmatically with the
<tt  >convert</tt> program included as part of ImageMagick.
</p><p>
Having said that, it's really mind-numbingly complex, so I'm going
to start with a fairly uninspired but quick way to add a watermark using
the <tt  >label:</tt> feature. In a nutshell, you specify what text you want,
where you want it on the image, the input image filename and the output
image filename.
Let's start with an image (Figure 1).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11609f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Original Image, Kids at a Party
</p></div></div><p>
You can get the dimensions and so forth of the image with
<tt  >identify</tt>, of
course:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ identify kids-party.png
kids-party.png PNG 493x360 493x360+0+0 8-bit 
 &#8618;DirectClass 467KB 0.000u 0:00.000
</pre>
</p><p>
You can ignore almost all of this; it's just the size that you care about,
and that's shown as 493x360.
</p><p>
Now, let's use <tt  >composite</tt> to add a simple label:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ composite label:'AskDaveTaylor.com' kids-party.png \
  kids-party-labelled.png
</pre>
</p><p>
Figure 2 shows the image with the label applied.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11609f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Label Added, No Styling
</p></div></div><p>
That's rather boring, although it's effective in a rudimentary sort
of way. Let's do something more interesting now, starting by
positioning the text centered on the bottom but also adding space below the
image for the caption:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ convert kids-party.png -background Khaki \
 label:'AskDaveTaylor.com' \
 -gravity center -append party-khaki.png
</pre>
</p><p>
Here I've added a background color for the new text (khaki) and
tapped the complicated but darn useful <tt  >gravity</tt>
capability to center the text within the new <tt  >append</tt>
(appended) image space.
Figure 3 shows the result.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11609f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Caption against a Khaki Background
</p></div></div><p>
I'm not done yet though. For the next example, let's actually
have the text superimpose over the image, but with a semi-transparent
background.
</p><p>
This is more ninja ImageMagick, so it involves a couple steps, the first
of which is to identify the width of the original source image.
That's easily done:

<pre     class="programlisting">
width=$(identify -format %w kids-party.png)
</pre>
</p><p>
Run it, and you'll find out:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ echo $width
493
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, let's jump into the <tt  >convert</tt> command again, but
this time,
let's specify a background color, a fill and a few other
things to get the transparency to work properly:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ convert -background '#0008' -fill white -gravity center \
  -size ${width}x30 caption:AskDaveTaylor.com \
  kids-party.png +swap -gravity south -composite \
  party-watermark.png
</pre>
</p><p>
I did warn you that it'd be complex, right? Let's just jump to the
results so you can see what happened (Figure 4). 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11609f4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Improved Semi-Transparent Label
</p></div></div><p>
You can experiment with different backgrounds and colors, but for now,
let's work with this and jump to the second part of the task, turning
this into a script that can fix a set of images in a folder.
The basic structure for this script will be easy actually:

<pre     class="programlisting">
for every image file
   calculate width
   create new watermarked version
   mv original to a hidden directory
   rename watermarked version to original image name
done
</pre>
</p><p>
Because Linux is so &ldquo;dot file&rdquo;-friendly, let's have the script
create a &ldquo;.originals&rdquo; folder in the current folder so that it's
a nondestructive watermark process.
Here's the script:


<pre     class="programlisting">
savedir=".originals"
mkdir $savedir

if [ $? -ne 0 ] ; then
  echo "Error: failed making $savedir."
  exit 1
fi

for image in *png *jpg *gif
do
 if [ -s $image ] ; then   # non-zero file size
    width=$(identify -format %w $image)
    convert -background '#0008' -fill white -gravity center \
       -size ${width}x30 caption:AskDaveTaylor.com \
       $image +swap -gravity south -composite new-$image
     mv $image $savedir
     mv new-$image $image
    echo "watermarked $image successfully"
  fi
done
</pre>
</p><p>
You can see that it translates pretty easily into a script, with the
shuffle of taking the original images and saving them in
.originals.
</p><p>
The output is succinct when I run it in a specific directory:

<pre     class="programlisting">
watermarked figure-01.png successfully
watermarked figure-02.png successfully
watermarked figure-03.png successfully
watermarked figure-04.png successfully
</pre>
</p><p>
Easily done.
</p><p>
You definitely can go further with all the watermarking in ImageMagick, but
my personal preference is to tap into the reference works that already
are on-line, including this useful, albeit somewhat confusing, tutorial:
<a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/annotating" target="_self">www.imagemagick.org/Usage/annotating</a>.
</p><p>
However you slice it, if you're going to make your images available on-line
in high resolution, or if they're unique and copyrighted intellectual
property, knowing how to watermark them from the command line is a darn
helpful skill.
