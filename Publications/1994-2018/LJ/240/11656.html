Linux can't be understood in terms of hierarchy. Neither can the Internet.
That's because both are examples of heterarchy at work.

<span   class="emphasis"><em>Flatland</em></span>, an 1880 novella by Edwin A. Abbott, is about a world with just
two dimensions, inhabited by lines and polygons
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatland" target="_self">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatland</a>). Trouble starts when a
sphere shows up.
</p><p>
For business, the same kind of trouble started when Linux and the Internet
showed up in the mid-1990s. No matter how useful Linux and the Internet
prove to be, business still has trouble getting its head around a virtual
world composed of end points that are all autonomous, self-empowered and
at zero functional distance from each other. The best geometric figure for
that world is a giant hollow sphere composed of boundless smarts on its
outside&mdash;the nodes of its network&mdash;and no controlling entity in
the middle.
</p><p>
Business can't see that sphere when its head stays inside the flat triangle
we call hierarchy (<a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hierarchy" target="_self">www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hierarchy</a>). Even complex hierarchies, such as those of giant
corporations, governments and military organizations, are depicted as
two-dimensional and roughly triangular org charts
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organizational_chart" target="_self">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organizational_chart</a>), all flat as a
whiteboard.
</p><p>
The word <span   class="emphasis"><em>hierarchy</em></span> is older than English. Born as the Greek
<span   class="emphasis"><em>hierarch&#275;s</em></span> (&ldquo;leader of sacred
rites&rdquo;,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarch" target="_self">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarch</a>), it
evolved into Latin (<span   class="emphasis"><em>hierarchia</em></span>,
<a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hierarchia#Latin" target="_self">en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hierarchia#Latin</a>) and then through French into the Middle
English <span   class="emphasis"><em>jerarchie</em></span> before arriving at its present English spelling in the
14th century. The current (February 7, 2014) edit
of Wikipedia's hierarchy
article adds this technical jive to the dictionary definition (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hierarchy&amp;oldid=594383135" target="_self">en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hierarchy&amp;oldid=594383135</a>):
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Abstractly, a hierarchy can be modeled mathematically
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model" target="_self">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model</a>) as a rooted tree
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rooted_tree#rooted_tree" target="_self">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rooted_tree#rooted_tree</a>): the
root of the tree forms the top level, and the children of a given vertex
are at the same level, below their common parent. However, a rooted tree
does not allow for items to be &ldquo;at the same level as&rdquo; one another, since a
tree prohibits cycles. To accommodate this, a hierarchy can be modeled
using a graph (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(mathematics)" target="_self">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(mathematics)</a>) or a
pre-order relation (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preorder" target="_self">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preorder</a>) on the set of items. Alternatively,
items of like type can be grouped together, and the hierarchy can be
modeled using a partial order relation
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_order#Formal_definition" target="_self">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_order#Formal_definition</a>) on the set of sets-of-like-items.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Got root? If so, you're at the top of a hierarchy like the one described in
that paragraph, and possess power that fans down through directory paths.
But your power is over your own system&mdash;one node on the surface of
that giant sphere.
</p><p>
The Linux kernel itself is produced by a hierarchy that Kernel.org
describes as &ldquo;Linus Torvalds with assistance from a loosely-knit team of
hackers across the Net&rdquo; (<a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/linux/README" target="_self">https://www.kernel.org/doc/linux/README</a>). At the top is Linus, above a few dozen
maintainers (<a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/linux/MAINTAINERS" target="_self">https://www.kernel.org/doc/linux/MAINTAINERS</a>).
Below that are any number of patch submitters. Yet the
purpose of that hierarchy in kernel space is to support the absence of
hierarchy in userspace. Unlike operating systems from Apple, Microsoft and
Google (which bases Android on Linux), Linux serves no corporate agenda
(<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/linux-now-slave-corporate-masters" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/content/linux-now-slave-corporate-masters</a>),
meaning it belongs to no hierarchy. The same goes for the Internet in which
Linux was born and throughout which it continues to grow and evolve.
</p><p>
Even though it supports an infinite variety of hierarchies, the Internet is
not hierarchical. Instead, like Linux, it belongs to a far less
talked about class of organizational being: heterarchy
(<a href="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/heterarchy" target="_self">www.thefreedictionary.com/heterarchy</a>). Derived from the
Greek <span   class="emphasis"><em>heteros</em></span> (other, different) and
<span   class="emphasis"><em>arche</em></span> (sovereignty), heterarchy has
relatively few examples, none of which make full sense in hierarchical
terms.
</p><p>
Adriana Lukas (<a href="http://www.mediainfluencer.net/biography" target="_self">www.mediainfluencer.net/biography</a>)
explains, &ldquo;Heterarchy poses an alternative to hierarchy
itself, rather than another evolutionary stage of hierarchy. One comes from
scarcity and the other from abundance.&rdquo; Business and government are both
built in hierarchical forms to manage scarcities. Meanwhile, virtual worlds
created by digital technologies and the Internet's protocols are abundant
beyond full reckoning, and as alien to scarcity-based mentalities as a
sphere to a polygon.
</p><p>
To help get our heads around this sphere, here are Adriana's &ldquo;Five laws of
heterarchy&rdquo;, with brief explanations of each:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Collapse of functions at the node level.</b></span>
&ldquo;For a heterarchy to exist and
persist, each node has to be able to perform certain base functions,
meaning no hard-wired distinctions or divisions of role and functionality
among the nodes.&rdquo;
</p></li><li><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Freedom and ability to bypass, that is, to choose a different path and thus
avoid obstacles, control and imposition of hierarchy via
backdoor.</b></span> &ldquo;An
example of this is John Gillmore's
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gilmore_(activist)" target="_self">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gilmore_(activist)</a>) familiar statement, 'The Net interprets
censorship as damage and routes around it'&rdquo;
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gilmore_(activist)#Internet_censorship" target="_self">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gilmore_(activist)#Internet_censorship</a>). 
</p></li><li><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Decentralized and distributable resources.</b></span>
&ldquo;This is the difference between
having to go to the post office to make a phone call and the ability to
make a call at home or on your mobile phone. This law is important because
having to use a centralized resource, apart from restricting nodes'
autonomy, opens up opportunities for control of that resource and
imposition of a hierarchy.&rdquo;
</p></li><li><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Abundance of resources or at least abundance of the most important resource
that enables to create and maintain the network.</b></span> &ldquo;Don't try to build a
heterarchy around a scarce resource, because once that resource is
controlled, heterarchy disintegrates. An example of an abundant resource is
information online. Digital format makes information duplicable and
therefore abundant.&rdquo;
</p></li><li><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>The marginal cost of communication needs to be zero
or near zero.</b></span> &ldquo;This is
important because in a peer-to-peer network it takes many more information
exchanges to negotiate transactions.&rdquo;
</p></li></ol></div><p>
She also says &ldquo;asymmetrical balance appears to be a general feature of
peer-to-peer/heterarchical networks&rdquo;, and provides two examples to explain
what she means:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
TCP/IP turns any server into an originator, relaying party or recipient of
a message. The relationships between nodes are not symmetrical, but each
server at any time can perform any role. Hence the term asymmetrical
balance.
</p><p>
BitTorrent is another example&mdash;once a user starts downloading a file, he
or she is automatically uploading it too, that's the inbuilt balance. But
the downloads and uploads are not reciprocal: a different set of nodes are
providing files for me to download and different set of nodes are
downloading from me, so it's asymmetrical.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Adriana credits <span   class="emphasis"><em>World of Ends</em></span>
(<a href="http://worldofends.com" target="_self">worldofends.com</a>) with influencing some of her thinking on
heterarchy, which is still in a formative stage. <span   class="emphasis"><em>World of
Ends</em></span> in turn was
influenced by thesis #7 of <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Cluetrain Manifesto</em></span>
(<a href="http://cluetrain.com" target="_self">cluetrain.com</a>): &ldquo;Hyperlinks subvert
hierarchy&rdquo;, which was coined by David Weinberger (<a href="http://hyperorg.com" target="_self">hyperorg.com</a>). Hyperlinks, Adriana says,
are heterarchical, exemplifying all five of her laws. As a kind of
corollary to David's thesis, Adriana adds, &ldquo;Networks dissolve
hierarchy.&rdquo;
</p><p>
I suspect that the laws of both hierarchy and heterarchy apply throughout
nature, and often dissolve each other. We see this happening live in higher
education today. On the hierarchical side, universities value the abundance
of knowledge in the world, yet organize knowledge sharing within
hierarchical systems that are thick with command, control and costs. On
the heterarchical side, universities are having their hierarchical gears
stripped
(<a href="http://www.shirky.com/weblog/2014/01/there-isnt-enough-money-to-keep-educating-adults-the-way-were-doing-it" target="_self">www.shirky.com/weblog/2014/01/there-isnt-enough-money-to-keep-educating-adults-the-way-were-doing-it</a>) by the ability of pretty much anybody to learn pretty much
anything by connecting to published knowledge (and other people), across
the vast heterarchy of the Internet. (The challenges and opportunities here
are expressed in the title of David Weinberger's latest book, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Too Big to
Know: Rethinking Knowledge Now That the Facts Aren't the Facts, Experts Are
Everywhere, and the Smartest Person in the Room Is the Room</em></span>,
<a href="http://www.toobigtoknow.com" target="_self">www.toobigtoknow.com</a>.) The room is a
heterarchy.
</p><p>
I also believe freedom thrives in heterarchy. Consider the freedoms listed
in The Free Software Definition
(<a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html" target="_self">https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html</a>) and how well they align with Adriana's
five:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
The freedom to run the program, for any purpose (freedom 0).
</p></li><li><p>
The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your
computing as you wish (freedom 1). Access to the source code is a
precondition for this.
</p></li><li><p>
The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor (freedom
2).
</p></li><li><p>
The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others
(freedom 3). By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to
benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for
this.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
These are embodied in the General Public License (GPL,
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html" target="_self">https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html</a>), which Linux adopted
in the beginning (with Version 2,
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html" target="_self">https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html</a>). That was 24 years ago. Today business
still has trouble grokking free software and the GPL, because nothing in
either suggests ways to manage scarcity. From the standpoint of hierarchy,
the fact that Linux has floated $trillions in economic activity is
irrelevant. When positive externalities are external to the model framing
one's view, they remain out of sight.
</p><p>
The same is true of the Internet. The difference is that nearly all of us
access the Internet through ISPs that make it scarce to some degree. Thus,
by controlling pathways in the network (and violating Adriana's fourth
law), ISPs dissolve some of the Internet's virtues as a heterarchy, and
with it the capacity of the Internet to float $trillions in economic
activity, rather than mere $billions for ISPs alone.
</p><p>
It helps to recall that the Internet was not born as a &ldquo;telecommunications
service&rdquo; or an &ldquo;information service&rdquo; (the US legal classifications for
telephony and cable) or even a &ldquo;service&rdquo; at all. It is a state of
connectedness made possible by protocols that were not created for billing
purposes. Instead they were created&mdash;whether their authors knew it or
not&mdash;in compliance with the laws of heterarchy.
</p><p>
It is interesting that ways have been found to make Linux scarce to some
degree, through cloud service providers, such as Amazon and Rackspace. One
appeal of these services is that, as Jamie Zawinski once put it, &ldquo;Linux is
only free if your time has no value&rdquo; (<a href="http://www.jwz.org/doc/linux.html" target="_self">www.jwz.org/doc/linux.html</a>). Time is scarce for all of us, even
when we operate in heterarchies. Yet operating Linux in clouds has become
cheaper and cheaper. It is now reasonable to assume that, at some point,
the marginal cost of cloud computing and storage will get so close to zero
that the fifth law of heterarchy will apply, along with the other four.
</p><p>
And maybe that will happen with the Internet as well, in due time. Once the
economic benefits of cheap access to the free and open Internet become
fully obvious, business will rush toward the same equilibrium between
hierarchy and heterarchy.
</p><p>
But we'll reach that stage a lot faster if we get our collective heads out
of the triangles in Flatland and wrapped around the vast spheres of
achievement and opportunity floating in our midst. Understanding heterarchy
should help with that.
