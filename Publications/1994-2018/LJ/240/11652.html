<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #240, April 2014</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Recently, someone suggested rewriting Linux in <span   class="bold"><b>Perl</b></span> as a way to improve the
design and make it more organized and uniform. In particular, the person said that
Linux relied on the <span   class="bold"><b>big kernel lock</b></span> (BKL) longer than other free OSes like
<span   class="bold"><b>FreeBSD</b></span>.
</p><p>
It's fun to speculate on who might have posted that. Clearly, he or she knows enough
about Linux development to know what the big lock was, and that other OSes had
it for less time, but the person is so full of bile against Linux that he or
she would
snipe that an interpreted language would be faster. Let's see...what big
software company employs people to work on Linux because it hates Linux?
</p><p>
Anyway, <span   class="bold"><b>Theodore Ts'o</b></span> had an interesting, and actually relevant, response. He
said, &ldquo;Linux had the BKL longer because it has had SMP longer than its
competitors. Linux got rid of the last of the BKL in mid-2012. As of 2013,
FreeBSD, NetBSD and OpenBSD still have the giant lock (BSD's equivalent of the
BKL) in some of their subsystems.&rdquo; And he added, &ldquo;Linux has had much better
scalability than the *BSD's for much of the past couple years, with SGI
using Linux on systems with hundreds of processors, and with people using
Linux on 32 and 64 processors systems for the past decade. In contrast,
FreeBSD was boasting in 2013 of improving its 16 processor
scalability.&rdquo;
</p><p>
He also remarked that his favorite was when someone &ldquo;suggested porting BSD 4.3
to Emacs LISP, so that you could run your entire system under GNU
Emacs.&rdquo;
</p><p>
It's fun to think about all the different trolls that have appeared through the
years. But actually, there are some pretty valid reasons for proprietary OS
companies to be bitter. Linux may not dominate the desktop, but it still
powers millions upon millions of servers that help make the Internet what it
is. And, those servers represent massive amounts of lost revenue for
proprietary OS companies.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Victor Porton</b></span> wanted to improve the security
of the <span   class="bold"><b>SELinux sandbox</b></span>, and
started a discussion on how to do that. The problem was that hostile code
could break out of the sandbox too easily, primarily by spawning child
processes. He wanted the sandbox to keep better track of child processes by
adding an ID to each process. In his vision, the ID could not be abandoned
and would allow the sandbox to reap all child processes after the parent
terminated.
</p><p>
There was a lively discussion. Someone suggested that <span   class="bold"><b>cgroups</b></span> (Linux Control
Groups) could use their resource-limiting features to constrain processes
within the sandbox. But <span   class="bold"><b>Andy Lutomirski</b></span> objected, saying that cgroups was
already a horrible failure, and was getting worse, not better.
</p><p>
Andy suggested using the spanking-new <span   class="bold"><b>subreaper</b></span> to accomplish his goal. The
subreaper, introduced in Linux 3.4, tracked process ancestry and delivered
child-process exit status to the nearest living ancestor of that process, even
if the child process' immediate parent already had terminated.
</p><p>
According to Andy, the subreaper could implement a new command to kill all
descendants of a given process. This would ensure that no process could slide
undetected out of the sandbox's grasp.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Joshua Brindle</b></span> also suggested using a
<span   class="bold"><b>seccomp filter</b></span> for sandboxed processes.
Seccomp filters could restrict the system calls a given process could use.
Joshua suggested that processes in the sandbox be restricted from using any
system calls that might allow them to escape. Unfortunately, this wouldn't
work for Victor's particular use case, which required the sandbox to
span a network successfully.
</p><p>
Ultimately, Victor found no more appealing solution than the cgroups idea, and
he offered a thorough description of how he wanted to proceed in that
direction. The discussion ended there, but probably at least one of the
various approaches to the SELinux sandbox will result in improved security.
</p><p>
There's been some question regarding the status of the <span   class="bold"><b>2.6.34 stable tree</b></span>.
Apparently, <span   class="bold"><b>Aaro Koskinen</b></span> noticed that it
hadn't been updated in a while, and <span   class="bold"><b>H.
Peter Anvin</b></span> confirmed that it had been more than a year since the
last update&mdash;during which time the 2.6.32 stable series had seen a new release. Peter said,
&ldquo;I'm worrying if people think that security patches are still being backported
if in fact they aren't.&rdquo;
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Paul Gortmaker</b></span>, the 2.6.34.x tree maintainer, replied that there was another
release in the works that would come out within a couple weeks, &ldquo;with a focus
on just clear CVE like fixes and hence a relatively smaller queue size (i.e.,
nothing like 200 patches etc.)&rdquo;. But he added that the tree would shortly
reach its end of life and would not receive any more updates beyond that
point.

I never have a Twitter app crash in the middle of a Tweet. That wouldn't
be too terrible to deal with. No, for me, it seems my e-mail application
decides to crash after I've spent 20 minutes thumbing out a reply while
sitting in a crowded airport. If you've ever lost a love letter, term
paper, shopping list or world-class Facebook post, Type Machine is the
perfect app for you.
</p><p>
It costs $1.99 in the Google Play Store, and automatically keeps track
of the last text typed in every native Android application. It has some
great features that satisfy even the most privacy-concerned individuals:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
No unnecessary permissions.
</p></li><li><p>
Supports a PIN number to lock typing history.
</p></li><li><p>
Apps can be blacklisted so no input is recorded.
</p></li><li><p>
History is pruned automatically.
</p></li><li><p>
Password fields are never recorded.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
The best part about Type Machine is that it works automatically in the
background, and you never need to think about it&mdash;until you do.

(Screenshot from the Google Play Store)
</p></div></div><p>
I'll admit, the thought of installing a keystroke logger on my
own device was a little creepy at first. I've never read the
&ldquo;this app requires these permissions&rdquo; screen more carefully
than when installing Type Machine. That said, I've had it only a
couple days, and I've already used it to retrieve a Twitter update
that got lost amid a program crash. If you have a particularly
crash-prone phone, or if you just prefer not to risk the possibility
of a lost e-mail, check out Type Machine in the Google Play store:

The de facto standard for port scanning always has been the venerable
Nmap program. The command-line tool is indeed very powerful, but I've
only ever seen it work with Linux, and every time I use it, I need to
read the man page to figure out the command flags.
</p><p>
Windows users have been able to use the &ldquo;Angry IP Scanner&rdquo; tool for quite
some time, and recently, the program (since version 3) has become truly
cross-platform. If you need to scan for open ports on a specific host
or on an entire network, the Angry IP Scanner (or just ipscan) tool is
fast, robust and, of course, open source.

<h2 class="title">Numerical Python</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Joey Bernard</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #240, April 2014</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
For the past few months, I've been covering different software packages
for scientific computations. For my next several articles, I'm going to be
focusing on using Python to come up with your own algorithms for
your scientific problems. Python seems to be completely taking over the
scientific communities for developing new code, so it is a good idea to
have a solid working knowledge of the fundamentals so you can build
solutions to your own problems. 
</p><p>
In this article, I start with NumPY (<a href="http://www.numpy.org" target="_self">www.numpy.org</a>).
My next article will cover SciPy, and then I'll look at some of the more complicated modules
available in the following article.
</p><p>
So, let's start
with the root module from which almost all other
scientific modules are built, NumPY. Out of the box, Python
supports real numbers and integers. You also can create complicated data
structures with lists, sets and so on. This makes it very easy to write
algorithms to solve scientific problems. But, just diving in naively,
without paying attention to what is happening under the hood, will lead
to inefficient code. This is true with all programming languages, not
just Python. Most scientific code needs to squeeze every last available
cycle out of the hardware. One of the things to remember about Python is
that it is a dynamic language where almost all functions and operators are
polymorphic. This means that Python doesn't really know what needs to be
done, at a hardware level, until it hits that operation. Unfortunately,
this rules out any optimizations that can be made by rearranging
operations to take advantage of how they are stored in memory and
cache. 
</p><p>
One property of Python that causes a much larger problem is
polymorphism. In this case, Python needs to check the operands of
any operator or function to see what type it is, decide whether this
particular operand or function can handle these data types, then use the
correct form of the operand or function to do the actual operation. In
most cases, this is not really an issue because modern computers have
become so fast. But in many scientific algorithms, you end up applying
the same operations to thousands, or millions, of data points. A simple
example is just taking the square of the first 100,000 numbers:

<pre     class="programlisting">
import time
a = range(100000)
c = []
starttime = time.clock()
for b in a:
   c.append(b*b)
endtime = time.clock()
print "Total time for loop: ", (endtime - starttime)
</pre>
</p><p>
This little program uses the <tt  >range</tt> function to create a list of the
first 100,000 integers. You need to import the <tt  >time</tt> module to get access
to the system clock to do timing measurements. Running this on my desktop
takes approximately 0.037775 seconds (remember always to make several
measurements, and take the average). It takes this much time because
for every iteration of the loop, Python needs to check the type of the
b variable before trying to use the multiplication operator. What can
you do if you have even more complicated algorithms?
</p><p>
This is where NumPY comes in. The key element that NumPY introduces
is an N-dimensional array object. The great flexibility of Python
lists, allowing all sorts of different types of elements, comes at a
computational cost. NumPY arrays deal with this cost by introducing
restrictions. Arrays can be multidimensional, and they must all be the
same data type. Once this is done, you can start to take some shortcuts
by taking advantage of the fact that you already know what the type of
the elements is. It adds extra overloading functions for the common
operators and functions to help optimize uses of arrays. 
</p><p>
All of the
normal arithmetic operators work on NumPY arrays in an element-wise
fashion. So, to get the squares of the elements in an array, it would
be as simple as <tt  >array1 * array1</tt>. 
</p><p>
NumPY also uses external standard,
optimized libraries written in C or FORTRAN to handle many of the actual
manipulations on these array data types. This is handled by libraries
like BLAS or lapack. Python simply does an initial check of each of the
arrays in question, then hands them as a single object to the external
library. The external library does all of the hard work, then hands back
a single object containing the result. This removes the need for Python
to check each element when using the loop notation above. Using NumPY,
the earlier example becomes:

<pre     class="programlisting">
import numpy
import time
a = numpy.arange(1000000)
starttime = time.clock()
c = a * a
endtime = time.clock()
print "Total time used: ", (endtime - starttime)
</pre>
</p><p>
Running this toy code results in an average run time of 0.011167 seconds
for this squaring operation. So the time is cut by one third,
and the readability of the code is simplified by getting rid of the loop
construct.
</p><p>
I've dealt only with one-dimensional arrays so far, 
but NumPY
supports multidimensional arrays just as easily. If you want to define
a two-dimensional array, or a matrix, you can set up a small one with
something like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
a = numpy.array([[1,2,3,4], [2,3,4,5]])
</pre>
</p><p>
Basically, you are creating a list of lists, where each of the sub-lists
is each of the rows of your matrix. This will work only if each of the
sub-lists is the same size&mdash;that is, each of the rows has the same number
of columns. You can get the total number of elements in this matrix,
with the property <tt  >a.size</tt>. The dimensions of the matrix are stored in
the property <tt  >a.shape</tt>. In this case, the size is 8, and the shape is
(2, 4), or two rows and four columns. What shape did the array in the
earlier example have? If you go ahead and check, you should see that
the shape is (1000000). The other key properties of these arrays are:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
ndim: the number of dimensions.
</p></li><li><p>
dtype: the data type of the elements.
</p></li><li><p>
itemsize: the size in bytes of each element.
</p></li><li><p>
data: the buffer that stores the actual data.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
You also can reshape arrays. So if you wanted to take the earlier example
of the first 100,000 integers and turn it into a three-dimensional array,
you could do something like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
old_array = numpy.arange(100000)
new_array = old_array.reshape(10,100,100)
</pre>
</p><p>
This will give you a new 3-D array laid out into a 10x100x100 element cube.
</p><p>
Now, let's look at some of the other functions available to apply to
arrays. If you remember from earlier, all of the standard arithmetic
operations are overloaded to operate on arrays one element at a time. But,
most matrix programming languages use the multiplication element to mean
matrix multiplication. This is something to keep in mind when you start
using Python. To get a true matrix multiplication, you need to use the
<tt  >dot()</tt> function. 
If you have two matrices, A and B, you can multiply
them with <tt  >numpy.dot(A, B)</tt>. 
</p><p>
Many of the standard mathematical functions,
like cosine, sine, square root and so on, are provided by NumPY and are
called universal functions. Just like with the arithmetic operators,
these universal functions are applied element-wise across the array. In
science, several common functions are used. You can get
the transpose of a matrix with the object function
<tt  >a.transpose()</tt>. If
you need to get the inverse of a matrix, there is the module function
<tt  >inv()</tt>, so you would execute
<tt  >numpy.inv(a)</tt>. The trace is also a module
function, given by <tt  >numpy.trace(a)</tt>. 
</p><p>
Even more complicated
functions are available. You can solve systems of equations with NumPY. If
you have a matrix of coefficients given by a, and a vector of numbers
representing the right-hand side of your equations given by y, you can
solve this system with <tt  >numpy.solve(a,y)</tt>. In many
situations, you may
be interested in finding the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of a given
system. If so, you can use <tt  >numpy.eig(array1)</tt> to get
those values.
</p><p>
The last thing I want to look at here is a class that provides even more
shortcuts, at the cost of more restrictions. Matrices (2-D arrays) are
so prevalent that NumPY provides a special class to optimize operations
using them as much as possible. To create a new matrix, say a 2x2 matrix,
you would write:

<pre     class="programlisting">
A = numpy.matrix('1.0, 2.0; 3.0, 4.0')
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, you can get the transpose with just <tt  >A.T</tt>. Similarly, the inverse
is found with <tt  >A.I</tt>. The multiplication operation will do actual matrix
multiplication when you use matrix objects. So, given two matrix objects
A and B, you can do matrix multiplication with <tt  >A*B</tt>. The solve function
still works as expected on systems of equations that are defined using
matrix objects. Lots of tips and tricks available on the NumPY
Web site, which is well worth a look, especially as you start out.
</p><p>
This short introduction should get you started in thinking of Python as
a viable possibility in &ldquo;real&rdquo; numerical computations. The NumPY module
provides a very strong foundation to build up complex scientific
workflows. Next month, I'll look at one of the available modules,
SciPY. Until then, play with all of the raw number-crunching possibilities
provided by NumPY.

<h2 class="title">Pro Video Editing with Pitivi</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #240, April 2014</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Several decent video editors are available on the Linux
platform. Kdenlive, OpenShot, Cinelerra and Pitivi are those that come to
mind as &ldquo;big players&rdquo; in an admittedly small market. I've used them all
through the years, with varying levels of success. A frustration of mine is
that invariably, I end up using a proprietary video editing suite like
iMovie or Final Cut Pro when I have to do a larger project. As an open-source enthusiast, that doesn't settle well with me.
</p><p>
Although I'm honestly not sure Pitivi is the best choice for Linux-based
video editing, I truly can say that its current fundraising push is
impressive. The &ldquo;kickstarter&rdquo; concept is old hat by now, but that doesn't
mean a well-planned campaign isn't still a great idea. The Pitivi team is
trying to raise enough money to put serious coding time into the program
and get to the 1.0 release. That's only the first step of the journey,
however, because after the solid 1.0 foundation is complete, future
features will be added according to contribution and user-base voting.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11652pitivif1.large.jpg"><img src="11652pitivif1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
I'm confident to say that Pitivi is currently a great choice for video
editing on Linux. If the fundraising campaign works out well, it
soon may be the clear leader in stability and functionality. Thanks
to the combination of an incredible product plus a game plan to get
even better, Pitivi is this month's Editors' Choice. If you want to
be a part of Pitivi's future, check out the fundraiser page at
<a href="http://fundraiser.pitivi.org" target="_self">fundraiser.pitivi.org</a>. If you want to test the program
itself, you can download it today for your favorite distribution at

<h2 class="title">Speed Test for Nerds</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #240, April 2014</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Most people with Internet access in their houses have visited a speed-test
Web site to make sure they're getting somewhere close to the speed
they're overpaying for. I'm paying more than $100 a month for my
business-class connection from Charter, so on a regular basis, I make sure I'm
getting the advertised speed. (I seldom get the advertised speed, but
the margin of error is acceptable. I guess.)
</p><p>
One of the frustrations with Internet speed tests is that most of them
require Adobe Flash to work. Even those sites that don't require Flash
do require a rather robust (and frivolous) GUI that I find annoying at
best. If you're anything like me, you'd like a simple command-line tool
that gives you your speed. If you're truly like me, that last sentence
just sparked notions of automated scripts e-mailing results via timed
cron jobs at different times during the day. Welcome to the club; we're
all nerds here.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11652speedf1.large.jpg"><img src="11652speedf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
Thankfully, my friend Charlie K. (I won't use his last name,
because I didn't ask him if I could) posted a link on Google
Plus to the speedtest-cli program. The project is on GitHub at
<a href="https://github.com/sivel/speedtest-cli" target="_self">https://github.com/sivel/speedtest-cli</a>, and to get the Python-based
program, simply do this:


<pre     class="programlisting">
# wget -O speedtest-cli \ 
  https://raw.github.com/sivel/speedtest-cli/master/speedtest_cli.py
# chmod +x speedtest-cli
</pre>
</p><p>
Then execute the script <tt  >./speedtest-cli</tt> to get your results. There are
advanced options as well, but a simple execution of the script will provide
your speed results. You can see the results of my supposed 80/5 business
connection in the screenshot.
