My first Linux-based project at work was a Web-based LAMP
(Linux/Apache/MySQL/Perl) stack that provided engineering reports
and analysis for my department. Over time, that evolved into
Tomcat/MySQL/Java (which doesn't acronym nicely at all) and moved
past my department to the whole facility, and eventually to several
different manufacturing locations. As my user count increased, so
grew the expectation of 24x7 uptime, and I needed to get serious about
redundancy for my single database instance.
</p><p>
MySQL's built-in replication option seemed like a logical choice,
as it seemed easy to configure and would provide an additional level
of redundancy. I was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was to enable
replication, and after two years of use in production, my only regret
is that I didn't implement it sooner.
</p><p>
This article is written based on the 5.5 version of MySQL, but it also will work
for 5.6. Although 5.6 reached &ldquo;generally available&rdquo; status in February
2013, there are still a <span   class="emphasis"><em>lot</em></span> of 5.5 installations out there in
production. 
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbf6580.0xcee510"></a>
What Is Replication?</h2></div></div><p>
MySQL's replication is a way for one or more slave servers to stay in
sync with a single master server. At a high level, this is accomplished
by having the master log all database changes to a local file. Each
slave knows its master log filename and position within that file,
and routinely queries the master for any new changes. As changes are
found, the slave modifies its copy of the database and moves its master
log file pointer accordingly. This means the slaves will process
changes in the same order as executed on the master, although each slave
may be at a slightly different position in the change log.
</p><p>
Replication is quite different from clustering. Replication can be
enabled in the standard MySQL server installation (&ldquo;MySQL Community
Edition&rdquo;) by enabling a few control file options, but clustering
requires installing an entirely different product (&ldquo;MySQL Cluster&rdquo;).
In clustering, a set of machines synchronize reads and writes across
all the machines in the cluster&mdash;all machines in the cluster are
essentially identical. In replication, all writes occur solely on the
master. Reads can be performed on any machine, with the understanding
that a slave may be slightly behind the master. In my experience,
slave machine delays are typically less than a second.

Benefits of Replication</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Impact-Free Database Backups:</b></span>
</p><p>
Replication alone is <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> a backup strategy. From personal
experience, I can assure you that silly SQL mistakes on the master will
propagate to your slaves faster than you ever thought possible, but
replication <span   class="emphasis"><em>can</em></span> ensure that the process of making backups won't
affect your master server. Creating a quality database backup is a
resource-intensive operation, and it usually requires a write lock for
the duration of the backup in order to ensure consistency. Prior to
configuring replication on our system, our production server would
use MySQL's mysqldump tool to create backups at 6am and 6pm.
This worked well at first, but as users requested more types of data
and longer retention windows, the amount of backup time passed the
point where users would accept write interruption. The increased I/O
load during backups also would degrade normal application performance,
further annoying our users.
</p><p>
After introducing clustering, the entire backup process can be moved onto
one of the slaves. The slave can be write-locked for the whole backup
process with no write or I/O impact to the master. Once the slave is
finished creating the backup, it releases the write lock and quickly
catches back up to the master.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Batch Reporting and Load Balancing:</b></span>
</p><p>
With the rising popularity of data-mining techniques, it's entirely
possible that you may want to start using your operational, near real-time
database to do some hefty batch reporting. Though these types of reports
typically don't require write locks during processing, enough of them can
degrade performance while they're crunching data. Prior to implementing
replication, we manually scheduled batch jobs to run at traditionally
low usage time slots, but this was error-prone and became significantly
more complex as we started supporting users from other time zones.
</p><p>
After implementing replication, we have offloaded all of these batch
reports to a data-mining server with its own MySQL slave instance.
Batch reports and data mining now can be scheduled at the user's
convenience, not just when the server is idle.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Direct End-User Access:</b></span>
</p><p>
One of the downsides of making a really awesome database is that
eventually other folks will want to get their fingers into that database
too. Each additional user increases the base system load and the risk
that their queries may misbehave. You could develop a bunch of Web
services and insist that they use those instead of directly querying
the database, but that is a lot of extra work, even more maintenance
and slows down innovation. On the other hand, giving even the most
experienced users direct access could lead to SQL mistakes that stress
the database. MySQL has a nice facility for limiting user queries with
resource limits, but even that doesn't guarantee zero impacts to your
coveted production database.
</p><p>
After replication, you can offload this read-only traffic to one of
your slaves. It's even possible to let the end users create their own
MySQL with very little input required on your end.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Hot Failover Capability:</b></span>
</p><p>
Once you have replication configured, you can start to leverage the
hot failover capabilities built in to MySQL's Connector/J JDBC driver.
With a properly structured URL, the JDBC infrastructure automatically
can sense that the master database is down and failover to the slave in
read-only mode. Once the master database comes back up, connections
automatically will start using the master again&mdash;no application
outage required. For applications where the bulk of operations are
reads, this can be a real lifesaver! Enabling this failover option
is incredibly simple, as shown in the following JDBC URL example:
jdbc:mysql://master.mydomain.org,slave1.mydomain.org:3306/MYDATABASE.
</p><p>
Although the default options probably are sufficient for most cases, there
are plenty of more advanced options for fine-tuning. See the Connector/J
documentation for more information.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbf6580.0xcef0c0"></a>
Configuring Replication</h2></div></div><p>
Hopefully, you're sold on the benefits that replication can provide and
are ready to start.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Replication Types:</b></span>
</p><p>
The first important configuration decision is choosing between the three
main replication strategies offered by MySQL: statement-based (SBR),
row-based (RBR) or mixed-based replication (MBR). In MySQL 5.5,
SBR is the default.
</p><p>
At a high level, you can think of statement-based replication as simply
copying any SQL statements that modify content on the master (insert,
update, delete and so on) to a log file. For example, if the master sees
<tt  >DELETE FROM ME.FOO WHERE BAR=1</tt>, it puts that SQL in the replication
command logs. This logging style has been in use the longest and
usually will result in smaller log files than RBR. It is possible,
however, to write non-deterministic SQL that will cause RBR to fail.
Some obvious examples would be updating a field to a random number
(<tt  >UPDATE ME.FOO SET BAR=RAND();</tt>) or deleting the first X rows of a table
with no order specified.
</p><p>
Row-based logging takes a very different approach. Instead of logging
the raw SQL, the master instead will log changes to specific rows.
For example, an <tt  >UPDATE ME.FOO SET BAR=1 WHERE BAR&gt;5;</tt> on the master
actually would be logged as many different unique row-level change
events (imagine commands like: <tt  >set BAR=1 where ROW_ID=4</tt>,
<tt  >set BAR=1 where
ROW_ID=14</tt> and so on). This technique protects you from ambiguous SQL
like the RAND() and unordered delete examples above but at the cost of
larger log files.
</p><p>
In mixed-based mode, the server will switch between statement or
row-based logging based on the type of statement. For example, <tt  >DELETE
FROM FOO</tt> is best done as an SBR type command, while row-level updates
or non-deterministic statements would be more efficient as RBRs.
</p><p>
This article has more of the gory details:
<a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/replication-sbr-rbr.html" target="_self">dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/replication-sbr-rbr.html</a> (and some
additional pros and cons). I chose SBR because it's easier to understand;
I didn't have any of the weird conditions where SBR doesn't work well,
and the smaller log size was appealing.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Master Configuration:</b></span>
</p><p>
If you're setting up MySQL from scratch, install the rpm or debs as usual. 
(Be sure to run <tt  >mysql_secure_installation</tt> to make your installation a bit more secure. 
While writing this article, I used the Employees test database and creation
script from this url: <a href="https://launchpad.net/test-db" target="_self">https://launchpad.net/test-db</a>. The employees-db-full file has both the data and the database creation scripts. 
Don't forget to uncomment the bind-address line to make the database server
listen to more than just localhost.)
</p><p>
Adding replication to the master is pretty basic: the only required
entries are the server-id (a unique, nonzero integer&mdash;1 is a good
choice) and the binary log name pattern. I've included two lines to
help auto-expire old replication logs and two additional lines suggested
for the InnoDB table type.
</p><p>
Here's an example of configuring the master's [mysqld] section of my.cnf:


<pre     class="programlisting">
[mysqld]
...
#Assign a unique server-id non-zero integer to each machine. 
server-id=1 
log-bin=mysql-bin.log		#Enables the log
#Log size/time limits
expire_logs_days = 14		
max_binlog_size = 100M
#These next 2 lines are recommended for InnoDB tables 
#(now the default)
innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit=1
sync_binlog=1 
</pre>
</p><p>
It's probably a good idea to have replication use a dedicated ID and
password, so create an ID and give it &ldquo;REPLICATION SLAVE&rdquo; authority:


<pre     class="programlisting">
you@master:~$ mysql -u $SQLID -p
mysql&gt; CREATE USER 'replid'@'%.mydomain.org' IDENTIFIED BY 'replpw';
mysql&gt; GRANT REPLICATION SLAVE ON *.* TO 'replid'@'%.mydomain.org';
mysql&gt; FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
</pre>
</p><p>
That's it! Once configured, restart the master, and you should start
to see mysql-bin.### files being created as changes are made to
the tables.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Creating a Master Snapshot:</b></span>
</p><p>
If you have existing data on the master (a likely situation), you'll
need to make a one-time snapshot for a known master log file and log
file position, so that the slaves will have a precise point from which to start.
</p><p>
Warning: this will lock all writes while mysqldump is creating the backup,
so perform this step during an acceptable maintenance window!
</p><p>
Step 1: open up a MySQL client connection to the master, write-lock the
database, and get the master log position. Leave this client connection
open until the backup is complete:


<pre     class="programlisting">
mysql&gt; FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK;
mysql&gt; SHOW MASTER STATUS;
+------------------+----------+--------------+------------------+
| File             | Position | Binlog_Do_DB | Binlog_Ignore_DB |
+------------------+----------+--------------+------------------+
| mysql-bin.000274 | 43891079 |              |                  |
+------------------+----------+--------------+------------------+
</pre>
</p><p>
Note both the file and position somewhere safe, and leave this client
connection open until the database dump is complete.
</p><p>
Step 2: from a different terminal on the master, use mysqldump to create a
database backup: 

<pre     class="programlisting">
you@master~:$ time mysqldump -u $SQLID -p --events
 &#8618;--all-databases --master-data &gt; masterdump.sql
</pre>
</p><p>
The <tt  >--master-data</tt> option automatically records the master log file
and position from the master and will set these values on the slave when
imported. If you create a snapshot without this option, you'll need
to record the master filename and position via <tt  >SHOW MASTER
STATUS</tt>
in the MySQL client connection from step 1. The <tt  >--events</tt> flag is needed
to suppress a relatively new warning in MySQL 5.5.30 and up.
</p><p>
Step 3: once the database backup is complete, exit the MySQL client connection
from step 1 to release the read lock.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Slave Configuration:</b></span>
</p><p>
Perform a normal MySQL installation on the slave machine, but add the
following to the mysqld section of my.cnf:


<pre     class="programlisting">
[mysqld]
...
server-id=2 #Use a UNIQUE ID for each slave. Don't repeat server-ids
</pre>
</p><p>
Restart the MySQL server on the slave, then open a MySQL client connection
to the slave and set the master hostname, user ID and password:


<pre     class="programlisting">
you@slave1:~$ mysql -u $SQLID -p
mysql&gt; CHANGE MASTER TO MASTER_HOST='master.mydomain.org';
mysql&gt; CHANGE MASTER TO MASTER_USER='replid';
mysql&gt; CHANGE MASTER TO MASTER_PASSWORD='replpw';
</pre>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Importing the Master Snapshot:</b></span>
</p><p>
If you have data to import from the master, you either can copy the SQL
dump to the slave and import it there:

<pre     class="programlisting">

you@slave1:~$ mysql --user=$SQLID -p &lt; masterdump.sql

</pre>
</p><p>
Or, if your user ID has remote access, you could load it over the network,
saving a file copy step:


<pre     class="programlisting">

you@master~$ mysql --user=$SQLID -p -h slave1 &lt; masterdump.sql

</pre>
</p><p>
This will take a while. If you haven't used mysqldump before, importing
a backup into a new database takes significantly longer than creating
the backup in the first place. For my database, creating a backup takes
around ten minutes, while creating a new database from that same backup
takes about 75 minutes.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Starting Replication:</b></span>
</p><p>
Once the master and each slave are configured, and you've imported any
existing data, open a MySQL client connection to each slave and start
replication:


<pre     class="programlisting">
mysql&gt; START SLAVE;
mysql&gt; SHOW SLAVE STATUS \G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
               Slave_IO_State: Waiting for master to send event
                  Master_Host: master.mydomain.org
                  Master_User: replid
                  Master_Port: 3306
                Connect_Retry: 60
              Master_Log_File: mysql-bin.000274
          Read_Master_Log_Pos: 44915942
               Relay_Log_File: slavename-relay-bin.000263
                Relay_Log_Pos: 44916088
        Relay_Master_Log_File: mysql-bin.000274
             Slave_IO_Running: Yes
            Slave_SQL_Running: Yes
...snip...
        Seconds_Behind_Master: 0
...snip...
             Master_Server_Id: 1
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
</pre>
</p><p>
If <tt  >Master_log_file</tt> or
<tt  >Read_Master_Log_Pos</tt> is not specified, you
may have forgotten the <tt  >--master-data</tt> option to
<tt  >mysqldump</tt>.
The <tt  >Read_Master_Log_Pos</tt> should match or be larger than the position you
recorded when creating the initial dump.
</p><p>
The most important lines above are:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
<tt  >Slave_IO_Running: Yes</tt>
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >Slave_SQL_Running: Yes</tt>
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >Seconds_Behind_Master: 0</tt>
</p></li></ul></div><p>
If either <tt  >Slave_IO</tt> or <tt  >Slave_SQL</tt> are
<tt  >No</tt>, something went wrong with
replication. Check the MySQL logs. <tt  >Seconds_Behind_Master</tt> can fluctuate,
but in my experience, it's almost always zero once you reach steady state.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbf6580.0x10e91a8"></a>
Replication Tips and Tricks</h2></div></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Temporary tables:</b></span> temporary tables created using the
<tt  >TEMPORARY</tt>
keyword are excluded from replication automatically. If your application
has pseudo-temporary tables that you don't want replicated, you'll have
to use a configuration option to exclude them by a table name pattern.
As an example, my application has many large user datasets that are just
inputs to data-mining queries. Although they need to stay around longer
than the length of just one session, they don't need to be present in
any backups or even for hot failover. To exclude tables like TMPTBL_1,
TMPTBL_FOO from replication, update the master's my.cnf file with the
following option:
<tt  >replicate-wild-ignore-table=MYSCHEMA.TMPTBL%</tt>.
</p></li><li><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Don't modify the slaves:</b></span> if you alter the slave tables in a way
that would make a subsequent SQL command on the master fail on the slave,
replication will <span   class="emphasis"><em>stop</em></span>. For example, if the master gets the SQL
statement <tt  >DROP TABLE MYSCHEMA.FOO</tt> and table FOO doesn't exist on
the slave, replication will fail. In my two years of using replication,
this type of self-inflicted error has been the only thing I've seen that
breaks replication.
</p></li><li><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Monitoring the slaves:</b></span> write a script to monitor the response
of <tt  >SHOW SLAVE STATUS</tt> on each of your slaves, checking to make
sure <tt  >Slave_IO_Running</tt> and
<tt  >Slave_SQL_Running</tt> are both <tt  >Yes</tt> and that
<tt  >Seconds_Behind_Master</tt> is something you're comfortable with.
</p></li><li><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Monitoring the master:</b></span> Connector/J's hot failover capability is a
great feature. Don't forget to disable that for any monitoring scripts
though. At my first planned outage, all my database health-monitoring
scripts happily failed over to the slave machine!
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbf6580.0x10e99e8"></a>
What's Coming Next?</h2></div></div><p>
Although this article was written using MySQL 5.5, version 5.6.10 reached
generally available (GA) status in February 2013. Version 5.6 brings
some interesting new choices, including Delayed Replication: a slave can
now be told to stay a deliberate amount of time behind the master. This
could be interesting and provide a chance to recover quickly from an
accidental delete or update. It also includes Global Transaction Identifiers (GTIDs):
GTIDs would eliminate the need to tell each slave the master log file and
log file position. Instead, the server assigns each modifying statement
a time-ordered ID so the slave just needs to know the ID of the last
transaction it processed. This should simplify slave setup and
snapshot synchronization further.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
MySQL enterprise-level replication features are easy to configure and can
help solve a wide range of performance, reliability and data security
problems. Although each application's database needs are different, I hope
that covering the benefits I've seen will encourage you to give it a
try on a database of your own.
