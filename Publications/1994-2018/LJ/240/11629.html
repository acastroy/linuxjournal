HPC and lightweight virtualization with Linux-based
containers.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x170c580.0x18042a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Linux-based container infrastructure is an emerging cloud technology
based on fast and lightweight process virtualization. It provides
its users an environment as close as possible to a standard Linux
distribution. As opposed to para-virtualization solutions (Xen) and
hardware virtualization solutions (KVM), which provide virtual machines
(VMs), containers do not create other instances of the operating system
kernel. Due to the fact that containers are more lightweight than VMs,
you can achieve higher densities with containers than with VMs on the
same host (practically speaking, you can deploy more instances of containers
than of VMs on the same host). 
</p><p>
Another advantage of containers over
VMs is that starting and shutting down a container is much faster than
starting and shutting down a VM. All containers under a host are running
under the same kernel, as opposed to virtualization solutions like Xen
or KVM where each VM runs its own kernel. Sometimes the constraint of
running under the same kernel in all containers under a given host can
be considered a drawback. Moreover, you cannot run BSD, Solaris, OS/x
or Windows in a Linux-based container, and sometimes this fact also
can be considered a drawback.
</p><p>
The idea of process-level virtualization in itself is not new, and
it already was implemented by Solaris Zones as well as BSD jails quite a
few years ago. Other open-source projects implementing process-level
virtualization have existed for several years. However, they required
custom kernels, which was often a major setback. Full and stable support
for Linux-based containers on mainstream kernels by the LXC project is
relatively recent, as you will see in this article. This makes containers
more attractive for the cloud infrastructure. More and more hosting and
cloud services companies are adopting Linux-based container solutions. In
this article, I describe some open-source Linux-based container
projects and the kernel features they use, and show some usage examples.
I also describe the Docker tool for creating LXC containers.
</p><p>
The underlying infrastructure of modern Linux-based containers
consists mainly of two kernel features: namespaces and
cgroups. 
There are six types of namespaces, which provide per-process
isolation of the following operating system resources: filesystems
(MNT), UTS, IPC, PID, network and user namespaces (user namespaces
allow mapping of UIDs and GIDs between a user namespace and the global
namespace of the host). By using network namespaces, for example,
each process can have its own instance of the network stack (network
interfaces, sockets, routing tables and routing rules, netfilter rules
and so on). 
</p><p>
Creating a network namespace is very simple and can be done
with the following <tt  >iproute</tt> command: <tt  >ip netns
add myns1</tt>. With the <tt  >ip netns command</tt>, it
also is easy to move
one network interface from one network namespace to another, to monitor
the creation and deletion of network namespaces, to find out to which
network namespace a specified process belongs and so on. Quite similarly,
when using the MNT namespace, when mounting a filesystem, other processes
will not see this mount, and when working with PID namespaces, you will
see by running the <tt  >ps</tt> command from that PID namespace only
processes that were created from that PID namespace.
</p><p>
The cgroups subsystem provides resource
management and accounting. It lets you define easily, for example, the
maximum memory that a process may use. This is done by using cgroups VFS
operations. The cgroups project was started by two Google developers,
Paul Menage and Rohit Seth, back in 2006, and it initially was called 
&ldquo;process containers&rdquo;. Neither namespaces nor cgroups intervene in critical
paths of the kernel, and thus they do not incur a high performance penalty,
except for the memory cgroup, which can incur significant overhead
under some workloads.

Linux-Based Containers</h2></div></div><p>
Basically, a container is a Linux process (or several processes) that
has special features and that runs in an isolated environment, configured
on the host. You might sometimes encounter terms like Virtual Environment
(VE) and Virtual Private Server (VPS) for a container.
</p><p>
The features of this container depend on how the container is configured
and on which Linux-based container is used, as Linux-based containers
are implemented differently in several projects. I mention 
the most important ones in this article:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
OpenVZ: the origins of the OpenVZ project are in a proprietary server
virtualization solution called Virtuozzo, which originally was started
by a company called SWsoft, founded in 1997. In 2005, a part of the
Virtuozzo product was released as an open-source project, and it was
called OpenVZ. Later, in 2008, SWsoft merged with a company called
Parallels. OpenVZ is used for providing hosting and cloud services,
and it is the basis of the Parallels Cloud Server. Like Virtuozzo, OpenVZ 
also is based on a modified Linux kernel. In addition, it has command-line
tools (primarily <tt  >vzctl</tt>) for management of containers,
and it makes use of templates to create containers for various Linux
distributions. OpenVZ also can run on some unmodified kernels, but with a
reduced feature set. The OpenVZ project is intended to be fully mainlined
in the future, but that could take quite a long time.
</p></li><li><p>
Google containers: in 2013, Google released the open-source version of
its container stack, lmctfy (which stands for Let Me Contain
That For You). Right now, it's still in the beta stage. The lmctfy project
is based on using cgroups. Currently, Google containers do not use the
kernel namespaces feature, which is used by other Linux-based container
projects, but using this feature is on the Google container project roadmap.
</p></li><li><p>
Linux-VServer: an open-source project that was first publicly released
in 2001, it provides a way to partition resources securely on a host. The
host should run a modified kernel.
</p></li><li><p>
LXC: the LXC (LinuX Containers) project provides a set of userspace
tools and utilities to manage Linux containers. Many LXC contributors
are from the OpenVZ team. As opposed to OpenVZ, it runs on an unmodified
kernel. LXC is fully written in userspace and supports bindings in
other programming languages like Python, Lua and Go. It is available
in most popular distributions, such as Fedora, Ubuntu, Debian and more.
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 (RHEL 6) introduced Linux containers as a
technical preview. You can run Linux containers on architectures
other than x86, such as ARM (there are several how-tos on the Web for
running containers on Raspberry PI, for example).
</p></li></ul></div><p>
I also should mention the libvirt-lxc driver, with which you can
manage containers. This is done by defining an XML configuration file
and then running <tt  >virsh start</tt>, <tt  >virsh
console</tt>
and <tt  >visrh destroy</tt> to run, access and destroy the container,
respectively. Note that there is no common code between libvirt-lxc and
the userspace LXC project.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x170c580.0x1804e58"></a>
LXC Container Management</h2></div></div><p>
First, you should verify that your host supports LXC by running
<tt  >lxc-checkconfig</tt>. If everything is okay, you can create a container by using
one of several ready-made templates for creating containers. In lxc-0.9,
there are 11 such templates, mostly for popular Linux distributions. You
easily can tailor these templates according to your requirements, if
needed. So, for example, you can create a Fedora container called fedoraCT
with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
lxc-create -t fedora -n fedoraCT
</pre>
</p><p>
The container will be created by default under
/var/lib/lxc/fedoraCT. You can set a different path for
the generated container by adding the <tt  >--lxcpath PATH</tt> option.
</p><p>
The <tt  >-t</tt> option specifies the name of the template to be used,
(<tt  >fedora</tt> in this case), and the
<tt  >-n</tt> option
specifies the name of the container (<tt  >fedoraCT</tt> in this
case). Note that you also can create containers of other distributions
on Fedora, for example of Ubuntu (you need the
<tt  >debootstrap</tt>
package for it). Not all combinations are guaranteed to work.
</p><p>
You can pass parameters to <tt  >lxc-create</tt> after adding
<tt  >--</tt>. For example, you can create an older release of
several distributions with the <tt  >-R</tt> or
<tt  >-r</tt>
option, depending on the distribution template. To create an older Fedora
container on a host running Fedora 20, you can run: 

<pre     class="programlisting">
lxc-create -t fedora -n fedora19 -- -R 19
</pre>
</p><p>
You can remove the installation of an LXC container from the filesystem
with: 

<pre     class="programlisting">
lxc-destroy -n fedoraCT
</pre>
</p><p>
For most templates, when a template is used for the first time,
several required package files are downloaded and cached on disk under
/var/cache/lxc. These files are used when creating a new container with
that same template, and as a result, creating a container that
uses the same template will be faster next time.
</p><p>
You can start the container you created with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
lxc-start -n fedoraCT
</pre>
</p><p>
And stop it with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
lxc-stop -n fedoraCT
</pre>
</p><p>
The signal used by <tt  >lxc-stop</tt> is SIGPWR by default. In order to use SIGKILL
in the earlier example, you should add <tt  >-k</tt> to
<tt  >lxc-stop</tt>:

<pre     class="programlisting">
lxc-stop -n fedoraCT -k
</pre>
</p><p>
You also can start a container as a d&aelig;mon by adding
<tt  >-d</tt>, and then log
on into it with <tt  >lxc-console</tt>, like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
lxc-start -d -n fedoraCT
lxc-console -n fedoraCT
</pre>
</p><p>
The first <tt  >lxc-console</tt> that you run for a given container
will connect you to tty1. If tty1 already is in use (because that's
the second lxc-console that you run for that container), you will be
connected to tty2 and so on. Keep in mind that the maximum number of
ttys is configured by the <tt  >lxc.tty</tt> entry in the container
configuration file.
</p><p>
You can make a snapshot of a non-running container with: 

<pre     class="programlisting">
lxc-snapshot -n fedoraCT
</pre>
</p><p>
This will create a snapshot under /var/lib/lxcsnaps/fedoraCT.
The first snapshot you create will be called <tt  >snap0</tt>; the
second one will be called <tt  >snap1</tt> and so on. You can 
time-restore the snapshot at a later time with the <tt  >-r</tt>
option&mdash;for
example: 

<pre     class="programlisting">
lxc-snapshot -n fedoraCT -r snap0 restoredFdoraCT
</pre>
</p><p>
You can list the snapshots with: 

<pre     class="programlisting">
lxc-snapshot -L -n fedoraCT
</pre>
</p><p>
You can display the running containers by running:

<pre     class="programlisting">
lxc-ls --active
</pre>
</p><p>
Managing containers also can be done via scripts, using scripting
languages.
For example, this short Python script starts the fedoraCT container: 

<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/usr/bin/python3

import lxc

container = lxc.Container("fedoraCT")
container.start()
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x170c580.0x17fc870"></a>
Container Configuration</h2></div></div><p>
A default config file is generated for every newly created
container. This config file is created, by default, in
/var/lib/lxc/&lt;containerName&gt;/config, but you can alter that
using the <tt  >--lxcpath PATH</tt> option. You can configure various
container parameters, such as network parameters, cgroups parameters,
device parameters and more. 
Here are some examples
of popular configuration items for the container config file:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
You can set various cgroups parameters by setting values to the
<tt  >lxc.cgroup.[subsystem name]</tt> entries in the config file.
The subsystem name is the name of the cgroup controller. For example,
configuring the maximum memory a container can use to be 256MB is done
by setting <tt  >lxc.cgroup.memory.limit_in_bytes</tt> to be
256MB.
</p></li><li><p>
You can configure the container hostname by setting
<tt  >lxc.utsname</tt>.
</p></li><li><p>
There are five types of network interfaces that you can set with
the <tt  >lxc.network.type</tt> parameter:
<tt  >empty</tt>,
<tt  >veth</tt>, <tt  >vlan</tt>,
<tt  >macvlan</tt> and
<tt  >phys</tt>. Using <tt  >veth</tt> is very common in order
to be able to connect a container to the outside world. By using
<tt  >phys</tt>, you can move network interfaces from the host network
namespace to the container network namespace.
</p></li><li><p>
There are features that can be used for hardening the security of
LXC containers. You can avoid some specified system calls from being
called from within a container by setting a secure computing mode,
or <tt  >seccomp</tt>, policy with the
<tt  >lxc.seccomp</tt>
entry in the configuration file. You also can remove capabilities
from a container with the <tt  >lxc.cap.drop</tt> entry. For example,
setting <tt  >lxc.cap.drop = sys_module</tt> will create a container
without the CAP_SYS_MDOULE capability. Trying to run
<tt  >insmod</tt>
from inside this container will fail. You also can define Apparmor and
SELinux profiles for your container. You can find examples in the LXC
README and in <tt  >man 5 lxc.conf</tt>.
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x170c580.0x17fd318"></a>
Docker</h2></div></div><p>
Docker is an open-source project that automates the creation and
deployment of containers. Docker first was released in March 2013
with Apache License Version 2.0. It started as an internal project by a
Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) company called dotCloud at the
time, and now called Docker Inc. The initial prototype
was written in Python; later the whole project was rewritten in Go,
a programming language that was developed first at Google. In September
2013, Red Hat announced that it will collaborate with Docker Inc. for Red
Hat Enterprise Linux and for the Red Hat OpenShift platform. Docker
requires Linux kernel 3.8 (or above). On RHEL systems, Docker runs on
the 2.6.32 kernel, as necessary patches have been backported.
</p><p>
Docker utilizes the LXC toolkit and as such is currently available only
for Linux. It runs on distributions like Ubuntu 12.04, 13.04; Fedora
19 and 20; RHEL 6.5 and above; and on cloud platforms like Amazon EC2,
Google Compute Engine and Rackspace.
</p><p>
Docker images can be stored on a public repository and can be downloaded
with the <tt  >docker pull</tt> command&mdash;for example,
<tt  >docker pull
ubuntu</tt> or <tt  >docker pull busybox</tt>.
</p><p>
To display the images available on your host, you can use the <tt  >docker
images</tt> command. You can narrow the command for a specific type
of images (fedora, for example) with <tt  >docker images
fedora</tt>.
</p><p>
On Fedora, running a Fedora docker container is simple; after installing
the <tt  >docker-io package</tt>, you simply start the docker
d&aelig;mon
with <tt  >systemctl start docker</tt>, and then you can start a Fedora
docker container with <tt  >docker run -i -t fedora
/bin/bash</tt>.
</p><p>
Docker has git-like capabilities for handling
containers. Changes you
make in a container are lost if you destroy the container, unless you
commit your changes (much like you do in git) with <tt  >docker commit
&lt;containerId&gt; &lt;containerName/containerTag&gt;</tt>. These images can be
uploaded to a public registry, and they are available for downloading
by anyone who wants to download them. Alternatively, you can set a private Docker
repository.
</p><p>
Docker is able to create a snapshot using the kernel device mapper
feature. In earlier versions, before Docker version 0.7, it was done
using AUFS (union filesystem). Docker 0.7 adds &ldquo;storage plugins&rdquo;, so
people can switch between device mapper and AUFS (if their kernel supports
it), so that Docker can run on RHEL releases that do not support AUFS.
</p><p>
You can create images by running commands manually and committing the
resulting container, but you also can describe them with a Dockerfile.
Just like a Makefile will compile code into a binary
executable, a Dockerfile will build a ready-to-run container image from
simple instructions. The command to build an image from a Dockerfile is
<tt  >docker build</tt>. There is a tutorial about Dockerfiles and
their command syntax on the Docker Web site.
For example, the following short Dockerfile is for installing the
<tt  >iperf</tt> package for a Fedora image:

<pre     class="programlisting">
FROM fedora
MAINTAINER Rami Rosen
RUN yum install -y iperf
</pre>
</p><p>
You can upload and store your images for free on the Docker public
index. Just like with GitHub, storing public images is free and just
requires you to register an account.

The Checkpoint/Restore Feature</h2></div></div><p>
The CRIU (Checkpoint/Restore in userspace) project is implemented
mostly in userspace, and there are more than 100 little patches scattered in
the kernel for supporting it. There were several attempts to implement
Checkpoint/Restore in kernel space solely, some of them by the OpenVZ
project. The kernel community rejected all of them though, as they were too
complex.
</p><p>
The Checkpoint/Restore feature enables saving a process state
in several image files and restoring this process from the point at which it was
frozen, on the same host or on a different host at a later time. This
process also can be an LXC container. The image files are created
using Google's protocol buffer (PB) format. The Checkpoint/Restore
feature enables performing maintenance tasks, such as upgrading a kernel
or hardware maintenance on that host after checkpointing its applications
to persistent storage. Later on, the applications are restored on that
host. 
</p><p>
Another feature that is very important in HPC is load balancing
using live migration. The Checkpoint/Restore feature also can be used for
creating incremental snapshots, which can be used after a crash occurs. As
mentioned earlier, some kernel patches were needed for supporting CRIU; here
are some of them:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
A new system call named <tt  >kcmp()</tt> was added; it compares
two processes to determine if they share a kernel resource.
</p></li><li><p>
A socket monitoring interface called <tt  >sock_diag</tt> was added
to UNIX sockets in order to be able to find the peer of a UNIX domain
socket. Before this change, the <tt  >ss</tt> tool, which relied on
parsing of <tt  >/proc</tt> entries, did not show this information.
</p></li><li><p>
A TCP connection repair mode was added.
</p></li><li><p>
A <tt  >procfs</tt> entry was added
(/proc/PID/map_files). 
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Let's look at a simple example of using the <tt  >criu</tt> tool.
First, you should check whether your kernel supports Checkpoint/Restore,
by running <tt  >criu check --ms</tt>. Look for a response
that says
<tt  >"Looks good."</tt>
</p><p>
Basically, checkpointing is done by: 

<pre     class="programlisting">

criu dump -t &lt;pid&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
You can specify a folder where the process state files will be saved by
adding <tt  >-D folderName</tt>.
</p><p>
You can restore with
<tt  >criu restore &lt;pid&gt;</tt>.

Summary</h2></div></div><p>
In this article, I've described what Linux-based containers are, and I briefly
explained the underlying cgroups and namespaces kernel
features. I have discussed some Linux-based container projects,
focusing on the promising and popular LXC project. I also looked at
the LXC-based Docker engine, which provides an easy and convenient way
to create and deploy LXC containers. Several hands-on examples showed
how simple it is to configure, manage and deploy LXC containers with
the userspace LXC tools and the Docker tools.
</p><p>
Due to the advantages of the LXC and the Docker open-source projects, and
due to the convenient and simple tools to create, deploy and configure LXC
containers, as described in this article, we presumably will see more and
more cloud infrastructures that will integrate LXC containers instead
of using virtual machines in the near future. However, as explained in
this article, solutions like Xen or KVM have several advantages over
Linux-based containers and still are needed, so they probably will not
disappear from the cloud infrastructure in the next few years.
