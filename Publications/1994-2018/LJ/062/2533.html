    An introduction to the Linux data manipulation

language, <span   class="bold"><b>awk</b></span> has had a reputation
of being overly complex and difficult to use. This column
demonstrates its usefulness without getting hung up on the
complexity.
</p><p>Scripting languages such as the UNIX shell and specialty
tools like awk and <span   class="bold"><b>sed</b></span> have been a
standard part of the UNIX landscape since it became commercially
available. In 1982, &ldquo;real programmers&rdquo; used C for everything.
Tools such as sed and awk were viewed as slow, large programs that
&ldquo;hogged&rdquo; the CPU. Even applications that performed structured
data processing and report-generation tasks were implemented in
fast, compiled languages like C.</p><p>Part of my motivation for writing this article comes from
observing that, even today, most system administrators and
developers are either uninformed about or intimidated by utilities
like awk and sed. As a result, tasks that should be automated
continue to be performed manually (or not at all), or duller tools
are used instead.</p><p>Admittedly, both awk and sed are rather peculiar
tools/languages. Both recognize traditional UNIX &ldquo;regular
expressions&rdquo;&mdash;powerful, but not trivial to learn. Both tools seem
to offer too many features&mdash;quite often providing several ways of
performing the same task. Therefore, mastering all the features of
awk and sed and confidently applying them can take awhile&mdash;or so it
may seem. First impressions notwithstanding, you can quickly and
effectively apply these tools once you understand their general
usefulness and become familiar with a subset of their most useful
features. My intent is to provide you with enough information and
example code for getting jump-started with awk. You can read about
sed in April's &ldquo;Take Command: Good Ol' sed&rdquo; by Hans de
Vreught.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>sed</b></span> and awk are two of the
most productive tools I have ever used. I rely on them quite
heavily to implement a wide range of tasks, the implementation of
which would take considerably longer using other
tools/languages.</p><p>I will assume you have heard of or worked with some of the
more significant sub-systems of Linux and that you have an
understanding of how to use the basic features of the shell command
line, such as file I/O and piping. Familiarity with a standard
editor such as <span   class="bold"><b>vi</b></span> and a working
knowledge of regular expressions would also be useful. Many Linux
commands, including <span   class="bold"><b>grep</b></span>, awk and
sed, accept regular expressions as part of their invocation, so you
should at least learn the basics.</p><p><a href="2533s1.html" target="_self">A Word about Regular
Expressions</a></p><p>My coverage of the awk tool is limited to an introductory
foundation. Many advanced features are offered by awk (gawk and
nawk) but will not be covered here.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15ed580.0x16e59d0"></a>General Overview</h2></div></div><p>The meaning behind the name of this tool is not terribly
interesting, but I'll include an explanation to solve the mystery
of its rather uncommon name. <span   class="bold"><b>awk</b></span>
was named after its original developers: Aho, Weinberger and
Kernighan. <span   class="bold"><b>awk</b></span> scripts are readily
portable across all flavors of UNIX/Linux.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>awk</b></span> is typically engaged to
reprocess structured textual data. It can easily be used as part of
a command-line filter sequence, since by default, it expects its
input from the standard input stream (stdin) and writes its output
to the standard output stream (stdout). In some of the most
effective applications, awk is used in concert with
sed&mdash;complementing each other's strengths.</p><p>The following shell command scans the contents of a file
called <b  >oldfile</b>, changing all occurrences of the
word &ldquo;UNIX&rdquo; to &ldquo;Linux&rdquo; and writing the resulting text to a file
called <b  >newfile</b>.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ awk '{gsub(/UNIX/, "Linux"); print}' oldfile \&gt;\
newfile
</pre><p>Obviously, awk does not change the contents of the original
file. That is, it behaves as a stream editor should&mdash;passively
writing new content to an output stream. This example barely
demonstrates anything useful, but it does show that simple tasks
can be implemented simply. Although awk is commonly invoked from a
parent shell script covering a grander scope, it can be (and often
is) used directly from the command line to perform a single
straightforward task as just shown.
</p><p>Although awk has been employed to perform a variety of tasks,
it is most suitable for parsing and manipulating textual data and
generating formatted reports. A typical (and tangible) example
application for awk is one where a lengthy system log file needs to
be examined and summarized into a formatted report. Consider the
log files generated by the
<span   class="bold"><b>sendmail</b></span> daemon or the
<span   class="bold"><b>uucp</b></span> program. These files are
typically lengthy, boring and generally hard on a system
administrator's eyes. An awk script can be employed to parse each
entry, produce a set of category counts and flag those entries
which represent suspicious activity.</p><p>The most significant characteristics of awk are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>It views its input as a set of records and
fields.</p></li><li><p>It offers programming constructs that are similar
(but not identical) to the C language.</p></li><li><p>It offers built-in functions and variables.</p></li><li><p>Its variables are typeless.</p></li><li><p>It performs pattern matching through regular
expressions.</p></li></ul></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>awk</b></span> scripts can be very
expressive and are often several pages in length. The awk language
offers the typical programming constructs expected in any
high-level programming language. It has been described as an
interpreted version of the C language, but although there are
similarities, awk differs from C both semantically and
syntactically. A host of default behaviors, loose data typing, and
built-in functions and variables make awk preferable to C for
quick-prototyping tasks.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15ed580.0x16e63c8"></a>awk Invocation</h2></div></div><p>At least two distinct methods can be used to invoke awk. The
first includes the awk script in-line within the command line. The
second allows the programmer to save the awk script to a file and
refer to it on the command line.</p><p>Examine the two invocation styles below, formatted in the
typical man page notation.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
awk '{
awk -Fc -f <span   class="emphasis"><em>script_file</em></span> [<span   class="emphasis"><em>data-file-list</em></span> ...]
</pre><p>Notice that <span   class="emphasis"><em>data-file-list</em></span> is always
optional, since by default awk reads from standard input. I almost
always use the second invocation method, since most of my awk
scripts are more than 10 lines. As a general rule, it is a good
idea to maintain your awk script in a separate file if it is of any
significant size. This is a more organized way to maintain source
code and allows for separate revision control and readable comment
statements. The <b  >-F</b> option controls the input
field-delimiter character, which I will cover in detail later. The
following are all valid examples of invoking awk at a shell prompt:
<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ls -l | awk -f
$ awk -f
$ awk -F: '{ print $2 }'
$ awk {'print'} <span   class="emphasis"><em>input_file</em></span>
</pre>


As you will see through examples, awk programming is a process of
overriding levels of default actions. The last example above is
perhaps the simplest example of invoking awk; it prints each line
in the given input file to standard output.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15ed580.0x16e67e8"></a>The Language</h2></div></div><p>If you acquire a thorough understanding of awk's behavior,
the complexity of the language syntax won't appear to be so great.
To provide a smooth introduction, I will avoid examples that take
advantage of regular expressions (see &ldquo;A Word About Regular
Expressions&rdquo;). <span   class="bold"><b>awk</b></span> offers a very
well-defined and useful process model. The programmer is able to
define groups of actions to occur in sequence before any data
processing is performed, while each input record is processed, and
after all input data has been processed.</p><p>With these groups in mind, the basic syntactical format of
any awk script is as follows:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
BEGIN {

}
{

}
END {

}
</pre><p>The code within the <b  >BEGIN</b> section is
executed by awk before it examines any of its input data. This
section can be used to initialize user-defined variables or change
the value of a built-in variable. If your script is generating a
formatted report, you might want to print out a heading in this
section. The code within the <b  >END</b> section is
executed by awk after all of its input data has been processed.
This section would obviously be suitable for printing report
trailers or summaries calculated on the input data. Both the
<b  >END</b> and <b  >BEGIN</b> sections are
optional in an awk script. The middle section is the implicit main
input loop of an awk script. This section must contain at least one
explicit action. That action can be as simple as an unconditional
print statement. The code in this section is executed each time a
record is encountered in the input data set. By default, a record
delimiter is a line-feed character. So by default, a record is a
single line of text. The programmer can redefine the default value
of the record delimiter.
</p><p>The following input data text will be assumed in each of the
following examples. The content of the data is somewhat silly, but
serves the exercise well. You can imagine it representing a produce
inventory; each line defines a produce category, a particular item
and an item count.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
fruit: oranges 10
fruit: peaches 11
fruit: plums 11
vegetable: cucumbers 8
vegetable: carrots
fruit: tomatoes 2
</pre><p>We will start off very simply and quickly work into something
non-trivial. Notice that I make a habit of always defining each of
the three sections, even if the optional sections are stubbed out.
This serves as a good visual placeholder and reminds the programmer
of the entire process model even if certain sections are not
currently useful. Be aware that each of the examples could be
collapsed into shorter scripts without any loss of functionality.
My intent here is to demonstrate as many awk features as possible
through these few examples.
</p><p><a href="2533l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1.</a></p><p>Look at the example script in Listing 1 and try to relate it
to its output:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
fruit: oranges 10
fruit: peaches 11
fruit: plums 11
fruit: tomatoes 2
</pre><p>By default, an input record is a line-feed terminated section
of text, so if the input contains six lines, the implicit main loop
marked by the <b  ># (1)</b> comment executes six times.
The awk source-code comments are specified with a # character&mdash;the
interpreter ignores characters from the # to the end of the line
(same comment style as the UNIX shell). The built-in variable
<b  >$0</b> always contains the entire current record
value (see built-in variable table below). The line below the (1)
marker checks to see if the current input record is an empty line.
If it is, awk goes on to read the next input record. Each field
within a record is assigned to an ordered
variable&mdash;<b  >$1</b> through
<b  >$<i><tt>N</tt></i></b> where
<span   class="emphasis"><em>N</em></span> is equal to the number of fields in the
current record. What determines a field? Well, the default field
separator is any &ldquo;white space&rdquo;&mdash;a space or tab character. The
field separator character can be redefined. The line below the
<b  ># (2)</b> comment will print out the entire record
if the first field is set to <b  >fruit:</b>. So, when
looking at the output produced by Script 1, all lines of type
<b  >fruit</b> are displayed.
</p><p><a href="2533l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2.</a></p><p>Take a look at the example script in Listing 2 and try to
relate it to its output below. The only noticeable enhancement is
the data summary at the end&mdash;stating how may of the total units
were of type <b  >fruit</b>.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
fruit: oranges 10
fruit: peaches 11
fruit: plums 11
fruit: tomatoes 2
4 out of 5 entries were of type fruit:.
</pre><p>This time, we made use of the two optional
<b  >BEGIN</b> and <b  >END</b> sections of the
awk script. The group of statements preceded by the <b  >#
(1)</b> comment initialize some programmer-defined variables:
<b  >FCOUNT</b>, <b  >COUNT</b> and
<b  >TYPE</b>&mdash;representing the number of
<b  >fruit:</b> records encountered, the total number of
records and the produce-category name. Notice that the line
preceded by the <b  ># (3)</b> unconditionally increments
the record counter (also note that syntax is borrowed from the C
language). The section of code preceded by the <b  >#
(4)</b> comment now references the <b  >TYPE</b>
variable instead of a literal string, and increments the
<b  >FCOUNT</b> variable. The next section of code makes
use of the <span   class="bold"><b>printf</b></span> built-in
function (works just as the C-library printf does, but differs a
bit syntactically) to print out a sub-count and a total count.
</p><p><a href="2533l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3.</a></p><p>Look at the example script in Listing 3 and try to relate it
to its output. Notice that the only records displayed are those
which were flagged as an error and those indicating a supply
shortage. The summarization at the end of the output now includes
additional information. Output from Listing 3:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Parsing inventory file "input_data"
Bad data encountered: vegetable: carrots
Short on tomatoes: 2 left
4 out of 5 entries were of type Fruit.
1 out of 5 entries were of type Vegetable.
0 out of 5 entries were of type Other.
1 out of 5 entries were flagged as bad data.
1 out of 5 entries were flagged in short supply
</pre><p>In this third example, we make further use of the two
optional <b  >BEGIN</b> and <b  >END</b>
sections. Once again, the <b  >BEGIN</b> section
initializes some programmer-defined variables. It also prints out a
heading that indicates the name of the input file (the built-in
variable <b  >FILENAME</b> is referenced). Notice the new
code section preceded by the <b  ># (3)</b> comment. The
<b  >NF</b> variable is a built-in that always contains
the number of fields contained in the current record. Since white
space is still our field delimiter, we would always expect three
fields. This code section flags and displays a record that is
deemed bad data. Also, a counter maintaining the number of errors
is incremented. Since records deemed invalid are useless, the
program then goes on to process the next input record. The code
section preceded by the <b  ># (5)</b> comment was
altered to maintain additional counts based on the produce category
type.
</p><p>Now let's assume a system administrator is asked to determine
the proportions certain shell interpreters are being used with the
choices of the standard Bourne Shell, the Korn Shell and the C
Shell. The script will provide a breakdown of usage by total count
and percentages and flag the instances where a login shell was not
applicable or not assigned to a system user. Examine the script in
Listing 4&mdash;it satisfies our requirement. Relate the code to its
output in Listing 5.</p><p><a href="2533l4.html" target="_self">Listing 4.</a></p><p><a href="2533l5.html" target="_self">Listing 5.</a></p><p>The first thing worth noticing in the Listing 4 script is the
assignment to the built-in variable <b  >FS</b>&mdash;the
input field delimiter. Entries in the /etc/passwd file are made up
of colon separated fields. Field 7 indicates which program (shell)
is run on behalf of that user at login time. Entries with an empty
field 7 are printed out, then the summary report is printed.</p><p>Thus far, we have reviewed awk's behavior through several
small examples of code. The features demonstrated provide a working
foundation. You have seen the execution flow of an awk process. You
have seen built-in and user-defined variables being manipulated.
And you have seen a few built-in awk functions applied. As with any
high-level language, one can be very creative with awk. Once you
get comfortable, you will want to put it to more sophisticated use.
Most Linux systems today offer the features of
<span   class="bold"><b>nawk</b></span> (new awk), which was
developed in the late 1980s. nawk and GNU's
<span   class="bold"><b>gawk</b></span> make it possible to do the
following within an awk script:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Include programmer-defined functions.</p></li><li><p>Execute external programs and process the
results.</p></li><li><p>Manipulate command line arguments more
easily.</p></li><li><p>Manage multiple I/O streams.</p></li></ul></div><p><a href="2533t1.html" target="_self">Table 1.</a>
</p><p><a href="2533t2.html" target="_self">Table 2.</a></p><p>As a reference, Tables 1 and 2 define the most common
built-in variables and functions. Also, note that the following
operators each have the same meaning in awk as they do in C (refer
to the awk man page):</p><p><b  >* / % + - = ++ -- += -= *= /= %=</b></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15ed580.0x1ae0718"></a>Conclusions</h2></div></div><p>Scripting languages and specialty tools that allow rapid
development have been widely accepted for quite some time. Both awk
and sed deserve a spot on any Linux developer's and administrator's
workbench. Both tools are a standard part of any Linux platform.
Together, awk and sed can be used to implement virtually any text
filtering application&mdash;such as perform repetitive edits to data
streams and files and generate formatted reports.</p><p>The most current reference book for both awk and sed is the
O'Reilly release <span   class="emphasis"><em>awk and sed</em></span> by Dale Dougherty
and Arnold Robbins. Also see <span   class="emphasis"><em>Effective AWK
Programming</em></span> by Arnold Robbins (SSC). For an immediate
on-line synopsis on your Linux system, use the
<span   class="bold"><b>man</b></span> command as follows:</p><p>I hope the information provided here is useful and encourages
you to begin or expand your use of these tools. If you exploit what
awk and sed offer, you will most certainly save development time
and money. Those who know how to quickly apply sharp tools to
seemingly complex problems are handsomely rewarded in our field.
