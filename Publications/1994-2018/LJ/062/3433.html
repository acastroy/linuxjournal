    Mr. Jacobowitz talks about standards with representatives of
    the various distributions by e-mail and at the LinuxWorld
    Expo.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21f9580.0x22f1450"></a></h2></div></div><p>With all of the recent debate about
standardization and the future of Linux standards, it's natural to
wonder where the major Linux distributions and other key industry
players stand on the subject. So, to find out, <i  >Linux Journal</i> posed the following question: &ldquo;What stance does
your organization take on the subject of Linux standards and the
growing standardization issue?&rdquo; We received some very interesting
responses with quite a variation in length from the major vendors.
Here they are, in no particular order.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21f9580.0x22f15b0"></a>Red Hat Software, Donnie Barnes</h2></div></div><p>We at Red Hat are generally in favor of good standards that
speak to existing as well as future problems. History has shown
that adherence to standards can be very important and failing to do
so can cause fragmentation that leads to a very unhealthy situation
for all players involved. We do our best to make sure we adhere to
useful standards such as the FHS (Filesystem Hierarchy
Standard).</p><p>New standards for Linux are evolving, and we are working hard
to be a part of that evolution. Standards are very important in
maintaining compatibility across all Linux distributions.
Compatibility is important to keep independent software vendors
(ISVs) from seeing Linux as a fragmented mess that can't be
supported. ISVs are important because they bring the applications
to Linux. Applications are important because they bring users to
Linux. As you can see, it's a trickle-down effect that has large
implications.</p><p>That said, we are working hard to make sure the evolving
standards are good ones. Bad standards can also be very harmful. So
far, the Linux community has been very good at working out good
standards. With a responsible community effort from all players, I
fully believe the Linux community can maintain that trend. If so,
you can expect Red Hat to participate fully with the standards that
are created.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21f9580.0x22f1768"></a>Caldera Systems, Ransom Love</h2></div></div><p>Thank you for the opportunity to respond on Caldera Systems'
feelings about Linux Standard Base (LSB). Everyone probably has a
slightly different definition of what they think LSB is and what it
should be. I will take the liberty of telling you what I think it
should be. LSB's main objective should be to solve the problem
facing commercial ISVs. LSB should be an effort that would enable
commercial software developers to port once and have their
applications run on all major Linux distributions. If it does not
solve this problem, Linux will have a major problem in the not too
distant future. Nearly every ISV we have spoken to wants to remain
&ldquo;distribution agnostic&rdquo;, but they do not want to support four or
more versions to accommodate Linux. The current answer seems to be
one of three options: publish the source code to the application
and allow the community to support the different versions, pick a
kernel version and a library version and allow the Linux providers
to offer patches, or just pick one of the distributions to
support.</p><p>I will address the problems with all three of these ideas.
First, publish the source code to the application. This will work
in some cases but not in the majority. Some of these industry
players have millions if not billions of dollars tied up in
proprietary software and hardware that will not allow them to
publish their solutions. They do and will continue to support Linux
and the open-source effort, but their board of directors, attorneys
and stockholders will not allow them to publish source code at this
time and may never allow it. Publishing the source opens up
significant liabilities. Netscape published the browser source only
to outsource it to another company. Publishing source has to be
done after significant thought and consideration.</p><p>As to the second option of allowing the ISV to pick a version
of the kernel and library, what if Oracle picks one and Informix
picks another? Or if Corel and Oracle pick different versions and
the customer cannot run one of these solutions without searching
the Internet to find patches? How will Linux compete against
Microsoft when they've claimed to be a one-stop shop? The
commercial customer loses because he must know his way around to
find the patches and fixes on the Internet. Even VARs and Systems
Integrators who are technical enough to do so cannot afford to
spend the time.</p><p>The third option is to port to just one distribution. This
seems counterintuitive to the Linux and Open Source community that
believes in choice. However, there are those who would support this
option to solve the problem. The major concern with porting to only
one distribution is you lose out on the innovations being made by
others who are targeting different markets. Some of the leading
distributions have targeted the developer as the principal
customer, as developers have made up the majority of those
purchasing Linux until now. Features like time-to-market are of
vital interest to the developer. Packages are gathered from many
different sources around the Internet to ensure the quantity and
timeliness of delivery, and little concern is given to ensure that
source and binaries match. After all, the developer knows enough to
make it work.</p><p>Commercial concerns cannot deal with more than two releases a
year, so time-to-market is not a feature but a liability. Caldera
Systems has been focusing on the commercial or business market from
its inception and has built features like self-hosting into the
distribution. Self-hosting is the discipline to match all source to
the binaries. It allows the commercial entity to set all of the
compilation parameters for the entire distribution, maximizing
performance and support options while limiting security and
liability concerns. All the packages are tested and integrated as a
single whole. Distributions focused on the developer may choose to
take the time to add more packages which appeal only to the
developer, or release a technology before it is stable so that
developers have easier access to it. The bottom line is that the
Linux community and the business customer will lose options and
choice if a single distribution is used as the reference platform.
Some ISVs may choose one and some another. The only real answer is
for the Linux community and the current providers of Linux to
collaborate.</p><p>Linux and the whole Open Source community have a great
opportunity to become significant players in the commercial
environment if they remain open-minded. If Linux and the Open
Source community can make it easy for commercial players to
interact with Open Source without incurring legal liabilities or
major costs, Linux will be a significant player and the customer
will win.</p><p>LSB can be a major step toward solving this problem and
showing the industry that Linux is different, not only because it
is published under an open-source license, but because its
providers have vision. If the major Linux distribution providers
can collaborate and support a common kernel and library version as
well as the basic interfaces that enable an ISV to port once to
Linux and support all Linux providers, everyone wins. If the Linux
providers are irresponsible and choose not to cooperate but
continue on with their own agendas, Linux is not as likely to
fragment, but will fall significantly short of its potential to be
the predominant computing platform, open source or otherwise, in
the industry.</p><p>Linux is not as likely to fragment, as its cousin UNIX did in
the OSF/UNIX International debacle, because it is Open Source.
However, being Open Source will not completely solve the problem
either. The premise that the best open-source technology always
wins is not true. GNOME and KDE are prime examples. KDE is
excellent technology that has matured faster than GNOME. The main
reason GNOME was started was because the Qt libraries KDE depends
on were not Open Source. Since Troll Tech has now published the
libraries under an accepted open-source license, all concerns about
KDE should be over. Instead, a significant public relations effort
has begun to continue to spread uncertainty and doubt on KDE.
Technologically, it is superior in all cases and is more mature.
Why would someone persist in promoting false information about KDE?
Because they have invested time, money and energy in GNOME and the
KDE developers do not have the funds to fight back. Again, the Open
Source community is not immune to the influences of the almighty
dollar.</p><p>Clearly, if Linux is to achieve its potential as a major
industry alternative, we cannot rely upon Open Source alone. All of
the industry players must act responsibly. Caldera Systems has
always wanted Linux to be a viable commercial alternative, so we
believe the only real answer is to support LSB.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21f9580.0x22f1b30"></a>Pacific HiTech, TurboLinux, Scott Stone</h2></div></div><p>Pacific HiTech will take an active role in the development of
Linux standards and will make compliance with the adopted standards
a design goal of all our Linux products. We believe a well-defined
set of Linux standards is important so that ISVs can more easily
port their applications to the Linux operating system without
worrying about distribution compatibility.</p><p>I'd like to see them develop to the point where any compliant
distribution will have the same shared libraries available and the
same basic file-system structure. Some people have suggested that a
standard package manager would also be important, but I'm not
necessarily sure that's true&mdash;for example, .deb and .rpm can both
provide a system in which a given third-party application could
work, provided that the shared libraries and path structure are the
same. What I <span   class="emphasis"><em>would</em></span> like to see is a common
system for &ldquo;registering&rdquo; applications so that desktop managers
and other programs would have a standard method of determining what
is installed on the system.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21f9580.0x22f1ce8"></a>Slackware, Patrick Volkerding</h2></div></div><p>Slackware is waiting to see what the proposed standards are
before we commit to complete compliance, but I do think the effort
is a step in the right direction for Linux. I'd really like to see
a list of standard version numbers to use when building shared
libraries&mdash;that should be a simple first step in getting binary
compatibility among the distributions back on track. However, the
standards should probably not go into such detail that all
distributions end up looking cut from the same cookie cutter. It is
the different design philosophies which make different Linux
distributions appeal to different kinds of users. It'll be
interesting to see how these issues are balanced.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21f9580.0x22f1df0"></a>Debian, Nils Lohner</h2></div></div><p>The general stance of Debian is that standardization is a
good thing. Dale Scheetz is a Debian developer and actively
involved in the LSB work. LSB is also an SPI-supported project. As
Linux continues to grow, it will become more and more important for
vendors producing software to know it will run on a number of
different distributions without requiring distribution-specific
versions. The growth of Linux will be greatly helped by
applications being ported to run on it, and this growth must be
supported as much as possible.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21f9580.0x22f1ef8"></a>Debian, Wichert Akkerman</h2></div></div><p>Debian has been involved in the LSB project from the
beginning. One of our developers, Dale Scheetz, is working on the
LSB right now. We've been talking with Red Hat since before LSB so
that we can develop binary compatibility between the distributions.
The important system libraries should be fully compatible across
all distributions. We don't want to see the kind of
incompatibilities suffered by users of 16-bit MS Windows software
when they upgraded to 32-bit MS Windows. Debian is currently
working to adopt the File Hierarchy System, but we feel a few
issues remain to be resolved. Debian is happy to help create
standards and compatibility with the other distributions; the LSB
is one of the methods we are using to make this happen.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21f9580.0x22f2000"></a>SuSE, Marc Torres</h2></div></div><p>SuSE has been a member of the Linux community since 1992, and
we have people dedicated to and working on the LSB project. We are
proud to be active members of this project. We are hoping to see
some sort of minimum library standards because that is what our
customers want. ISVs need that kind of standard to work
efficiently. Hardware vendors deserve a standard in order to
certify their hardware across distributions.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21f9580.0x22f2108"></a>Stampede Linux, David Haraburda</h2></div></div><p>It's my personal opinion that standardization is good thing.
But like always, too much of a good thing can be a bad thing. It
really all depends on which aspect of the Linux system you want to
standardize, and how much. Where do you begin and where do you
stop? If we standardize the file system layout, packaging and user
tools, is anything left? I'm not sure of LSB's plan&mdash;but from my
reading, it doesn't look like they have a well-laid-out plan quite
yet. Standardizing file locations is a great idea; I know it would
solve half of the problems I encounter. I read somewhere LSB plans
on having a standard packaging system. That is a tricky subject for
me to even personally comment on&mdash;we have a lot of plans for our
Stampede Linux Packaging system (SLP). There are some features the
standard may not include that we'd like to have. Obviously, we can
contribute to the project ourselves, but if the majority doesn't
like our idea, then it won't go in. The great thing about Linux is
that if you don't like something, you can't complain. Don't use it,
find something else, hack the source code, or start a whole new
project. If a situation like this arises, the user who wants a
feature can no longer search for another package; he must try and
somehow convince the authors to add it.</p><p>At this time, two extremes are apparent: one is &ldquo;everyone
does their own thing, their own way&rdquo; and the other is &ldquo;everyone
does what the standard says&rdquo;. I'd like to think we aren't at
either of these extremes right now. That fine line between them
needs to be found, and when someone finds it, I'll be able to
comment further.</p><p>Currently, with the information we have, Stampede's stance is
neutral, but this could easily change. It could change tomorrow,
next week, next month or next year (just like any Linux-related
project). For now, I will try to keep a close eye on what goes on
and keep others of the Stampede development team informed. It will
be much easier to make a decision once a clearly defined set of
rules has been set.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21f9580.0x22f22c0"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>Well, there you have it&mdash;the positions of the major
distributions on the topic of Linux standards. As you can see, all
positions have one major theme in common: a serious concern for the
future of Linux Standards and a desire to see standards work for
every user.</p></div></div>
