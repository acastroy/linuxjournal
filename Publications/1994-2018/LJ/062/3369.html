    A look at the new traffic control code in the kernel and how
    it aids in bandwidth management.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x111a580.0x12123f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>The success of the Internet is attributed
mainly to the simplicity and robustness of the protocol that ties
it together, IP (Internet Protocol). Lately, everyone wants to run
on IP. Major drivers include telephone companies wishing to replace
traditional circuit-switched voice networks by carrying voice on IP
networks, and multi-site corporations wanting to replace their
dedicated connections with virtual private networks (VPNs) over
shared IP networks.
</p><p>However, IP suffers a small handicap. Unlike protocols such
as ATM, it treats everyone equally. All data that goes through IP
networks is equally forwarded on a <span   class="emphasis"><em>best-effort</em></span>
basis. What if I was willing to pay $2 more a month so customers
could get my web pages loaded about half a second faster? What if I
was willing to pay a little more so I could have a coherent audio
conversation, across the Internet, with someone across the
Atlantic? In both instances, those particular willing-to-pay-more
packets will have to be treated <span   class="emphasis"><em>more fairly</em></span>
for this to work, thus, IPs equality for all fails. Now, the new
big buzzword is here: <span   class="emphasis"><em>Quality of Service</em></span>
(QoS), that is, trying to streamline IP to meet these new
requirements. Although not a new concept per se, QoS has gained
more momentum lately due to the interest of large corporations in
using IP.</p><p>QoS means different things to different people. An order of a
burger and fries at McDonald's is cheaper than at a fancy
restaurant, where you are served a glass of water and lots of
courtesy before your order arrives. You pay more at the restaurant
for the <span   class="emphasis"><em>QoS</em></span>. Someone might argue that the QoS
is better at McDonald's because you get served faster. Another
analogy is the airline model, where the same plane has economy and
first-class customers. In simplistic terms, one can define QoS as
paying <span   class="emphasis"><em>more</em></span> to get <span   class="emphasis"><em>better</em></span>
service. As such, it is a good way for the Net to be
self-sustaining.</p><p>An implication embedded in this is that the socialist days of
the Internet are over. Socially, the advent of IP-QoS is already
being blamed for introducing a caste system on the Internet: the
&ldquo;bit-haves&rdquo; and &ldquo;bit-have-nots&rdquo; are becoming reality.</p><p>The ability to divvy up bandwidth owned by a service provider
for QoS is referred to as &ldquo;bandwidth management&rdquo;. Several
techniques have been proposed and implemented over the years. The
Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) has in the past proposed
integrated services, via RSVP, which is host driven. RSVP has
failed to take off as a widely deployed standard, mainly due to
scalability issues. Currently, the IETF is pushing a new solution
known as differentiated services (diffserv), which gives more
control of bandwidth management to network owners. This article
will not delve into the details of the two techniques. The good
news is that both are currently supported in Linux.</p><p>The unsung hero of the new 2.1.<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> Linux
traffic control (TC) code (and much more) is Alexey Kuznetsov
(kuznet@ms2.inr.ac.ru). Alexey invested a great deal of thought in
the design in order to make it extremely flexible and
extensible.</p><p>What I describe is just the tip of the iceberg of the
possibilities presented by Linux traffic control, without going
deep into detail. The intended scope is to show via a simple
example how one could unleash the power of Linux traffic
control.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x111a580.0x1212978"></a>Primitive Bandwidth Management</h2></div></div><p>The TC features give ISPs the ability to manage (or carve)
their bandwidth as they see fit. In the past, there have been other
less-organized ways of doing this. The ISP could bandwidth-limit
the customer's access rate by selling services based on interface
capabilities, e.g., 28.8 vs. 56Kbps modems or 1 vs. 3Mbps xDSL
modems.</p><p>Another more innovative but less ambitious (relative to TC)
way of rate-limiting bandwidth is to use Alan Cox's shaper device.
The shaper device is first attached to an already configured
network device (e.g., Ethernet) using the
<span   class="bold"><b>shapecfg</b></span> utility, which is also
used to configure the shaper's speed. The next step is to use the
<span   class="bold"><b>ifconfig</b></span> utility to configure the
shaper to have the same IP address as the device to which it is
attached. The final step is to map the packets to be treated by the
shaper; this is known as <span   class="emphasis"><em>classification</em></span>. This
is done using the common <span   class="bold"><b>route</b></span>
command, pointing the route in which the packets are to be
conditioned to the shaper. The advantage of the shaper is that it
also runs on the 2.0.<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> kernels (included from
2.0.36 onwards and available as a patch for earlier kernels). The
shaper's limited classification capabilities can be enhanced in the
2.0.<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> kernels by using Mike McLagan's
(mmclagan@linux.org) patch to allow routes to be specified by
source/destination pairs. The new TC capabilities encompass shaping
as well as a great deal more.</p><p>Another technique to enable bandwidth management is to use
the multi-routing table capabilities implemented by Alexey
Kuznetsov. Linux 2.2 has a new feature that allows a single Linux
box to have multiple routing tables. In essence, one could have a
special routing table for a higher-paying customer and redirect
their traffic through higher-bandwidth or less congested devices
(e.g., to a T3 rather than an ISDN line, both of which are headed
the same way). Perhaps the best-kept secret in Linux bandwidth
management is that the Apache web server has a bandwidth limiting
module, <span   class="bold"><b>mod_throttle</b></span>, to rate
limit individual users as defined in a config file. For details,
see http://www.bigrock.com/~mlovell/throttle/.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x111a580.0x1212d98"></a>2.1.<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> Traffic
Control</h2></div></div><p>The Linux TC conditions packets after the next hop has been
decided, i.e., after the forwarding code has decided which
interface the packet will go out on. This means that only outgoing
packets are subjected to the TC. The TC consists of three building
blocks.</p><p>The <span   class="bold"><b>queueing discipline</b></span> can
be thought of as the traffic/data-packet manager for a device. It
<span   class="emphasis"><em>encapsulates</em></span> within it the two other major TC
components and controls how data flows through them. Only one such
managing component can be attached to a device. Currently, a few
device queueing disciplines are available to manage devices,
including class-based queueing (CBQ), Priority and CSZ
(Clark-Shenker-Zhang). An example configuration with CBQ will be
shown later.</p><p>The <span   class="bold"><b>class(es)</b></span> are managed by
the device queueing discipline. A class consists of rules for
messaging data owned by that class. For example, all data packets
in a class could be subjected to a rate limit of 1Mbps and allowed
to overshoot up to 3Mbps between the hours of midnight and 6AM.
Several queueing disciplines can be <span   class="emphasis"><em>attached</em></span>
to classes, including FIFO (First-In-First-Out), RED (Random Early
Detection), SFQ (Stochastic Fair Queueing) and Token Bucket. If no
queueing discipline is attached to a device, basic FIFO is used. In
the example shown later, no specific class queueing disciplines are
attached, thus defaulting to simple FIFO. CBQ, CSZ and Priority can
also be used for classes and allow for subclassing within a class.
This shows how easily very complex scenarios using TC can be built.
The queueing disciplines managing classes are referred to as class
queueing disciplines. Generally, the class queueing discipline
manages the data and queues for that class and can decide to delay,
drop or reclassify the packets it manages.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Classifiers</b></span> or filters
describe packets and map them into classes managed by the queueing
disciplines. These normally provide simple description languages to
specify how to select packets and map them to classes. Currently,
several filters (depending on your needs) are available in
conjunction with TC, including the route-based classifier, the RSVP
classifier (one for IPV4 and another for IPV6) and the u32
classifier. All of the firewalling filters can be used subject to
their internal filtering tags. For example,
<span   class="bold"><b>ipchains</b></span> could be used to classify
packets.</p><p>The TC code resides in the kernel and the different blocks
can be compiled in as modules or straight into the kernel.
Communication and configuration of the kernel code or modules is
achieved by the user-level program
<span   class="bold"><b>tc</b></span> written by Alexey. The
interaction is shown in Figure 1. The tc program can be downloaded
from
ftp://linux.wauug.org/pub/net/ip-routing/iproute2-current.tar.gz.
You will need to patch it for glibc, if you are using a glibc-only
system. The patches are available in the same directory. Note that
the package also includes the <span   class="bold"><b>ip</b></span>
and <span   class="bold"><b>rtmon</b></span> tools.</p><p><a href="3369f1.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 1.
Configuration of Kernel Code with TC</b></span></a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x111a580.0x1213478"></a>TC Features</h2></div></div><p>TC is very flexible: you decide what you want to configure as
a service. An ISP that offers virtual servers with different QoS
levels is a good example of the power of Linux traffic control.
Note that similar services can be applied within an intranet. The
traditional offer differentiator when ISPs sell virtual,
web-server, hosting services is disk space. For $5 more a month,
you could get an additional 100 megabytes of disk space for your
hosted web server. Other ISPs differentiate services based on
access to other services, such as Realvideo and SSL, from your web
pages. Still others base it on how many hits your web pages get and
such things. With Linux traffic control in place, a new dimension
is added to differentiating services. This presents many new
opportunities for differentiating services offered to your
customers. For example, if you offer virtual web hosting, you could
offer four different packages:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Service Level Agreement (SLA) 1: cost
$5/month&mdash;visitors to customers' virtual servers can get up to
250Kbps coming out of the server.</p></li><li><p>SLA2: cost $7/month&mdash;250Kbps, which can overshoot
to 1Mbps between the hours of midnight and 6AM.</p></li><li><p>SLA3: cost $9/month&mdash;250Kbps, which can overshoot
to 1Mbps when bandwidth is available at any time of the day.</p></li><li><p>SLA4: cost $50/month&mdash;up to 1Mbps of high-priority,
low-latency bandwidth suitable for video and audio delivery (as
well as IP telephony), with extra filters to give very low
bandwidth to low priority visitors (e.g., those who get their
services free).</p></li></ul></div><p>A wide range of creative services could be offered. The
time-of-day features could easily be added by using
crontab-activated scripts to change configurations.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x111a580.0x12138f0"></a>Example</h2></div></div><p>The following is an example of a Linux box with two virtual
servers (web, FTP, etc.) and how an ISP can sell them as two
separate packages based on the maximum bandwidth one gets when
visiting those two virtual servers.</p><p>Kernel Compile</p><p>I'll assume you know how to compile the kernel and add
network and aliasing support. I used kernel 2.1.129 and a few other
patches at the time of this writing. Linux 2.2 pre1 had just come
out, but the patches had not made it in yet. By the time you read
this, 2.2 will be out and everything I used will be
included.</p><p>The first challenge is the clock source. In order to
accurately determine bandwidth measurements, you need a very
fine-grained clock. In Linux, the clock runs at a frequency of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>HZ</em></span>, defined to be 100 for the ix86, i.e., 100
clock ticks per second which translates to a granularity of 10ms
for each clock tick. On Alphas, <span   class="emphasis"><em>HZ</em></span> is defined
as 1000, giving a granularity of 1ms. I would not suggest changing
the value of <span   class="emphasis"><em>HZ</em></span> in the code. The TC clock
sources are adjusted by editing the file /include/net/pkt_sched.h
under the kernel tree and modifying the line which defines
<b  >PSCHED_CLOCK_SOURCE</b>. To start, I suggest leaving
the clock source alone until you get comfortable with running other
things. The default clock source, PSCHED_JIFFIES, will work fine on
all architectures. Use PSCHED_CPU on high-end Pentiums and Alphas.
The most precise and expensive clock source is PSCHED_GETTIMEOFDAY.
Use this if you have a truly high-end Pentium II or Alpha. Do not
try to use it on a 486.</p><p>Next, compile the kernel. Select
<b  >Kernel/User&nbsp;netlink&nbsp;socket</b> and
<b  >Netlink&nbsp;device&nbsp;emulation</b> to allow use
of <span   class="bold"><b>netlink</b></span> so that tc can talk to
the kernel. The second option is a backward compatibility option
and may be obsolete now that 2.2 is out, so don't worry if you
don't see it. Next, compile in all the queueing disciplines and
classifiers. Although each can be selected as a module, I compiled
them straight in. The selections are QoS or fair queueing, CBQ
packet scheduler, CSZ packet scheduler, the simplest PRIO
pseudoscheduler, RED queue, SFQ queue, TBF queue, QoS support, rate
estimator, packet classifier API, routing-tables-based classifier,
U32 classifier, special RSVP classifier and special RSVP classifier
for IPv6.</p><p>Go through the normal procedure of compiling and installing
the kernel.</p><p>Compiling and Setting Up TC</p><p>If you use glibc as I do (Red Hat 5.2), you will need to
apply the glibc patch. A glibc patched source for
<span   class="bold"><b>tc</b></span> is included
(tc-glibc-patched.tgz). The major catch is to change the Makefile
to point to where the kernel include file is. Typing
<b  >make</b> should then cleanly compile tc and ip for
you. The ip-routing directory contains patches with names
iproute2-*.glibc2.patch.gz. Get the latest one to match with the
current tc. I downloaded
iproute2-2.1.99-now-ss981101.glibc.patch.gz at the time of this
writing.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x111a580.0x120a808"></a>tc Setup</h2></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3369f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. CBQ Tree Diagram
</p></div></div><p>Figure 2 shows the simple scenario we are going to set up.
Two leaf nodes are emanating from the root. IP address 10.0.0.10
(classid 1:1) and 10.0.0.11 (classid 1:2) are aliases on device
eth0. They all share the same parent&mdash;classid 1:0 (the root node).
Again, the intent is to show what one can do without going into
fine details or building a complex TC setup. With some
modifications, one can build more interesting setups with multiple
devices.</p><p>The general recipe for setting up the QoS features is to
first attach a <span   class="bold"><b>qdisc</b></span> to a device.
In the sample script, this is achieved by the line</p><pre     class="programlisting">
qdisc add dev eth0 root handle 1: ...
</pre><p>Next, define your classes. This allows you to discriminate
between the different traffic types going out. In the sample
script, this is achieved by the lines which start with
<pre     class="programlisting">
tc class add dev eth0 parent 1:0 classid X:Y ...
</pre>


In the sample script, a one-level tree is shown. However, one can
build a multiple depth tree. Basically, a child node (as shown in
Figure 2) inherits from a parent and is then further
resource-restricted by the class definition. For example, the root
class 1:0 owns the device's bandwidth. The child node 1:1 cannot
have more than 10Mbits allocated to it, but is restricted to 1Mbps.
Eventually, the leaf nodes get packets sent to them based on the
classifier mapping packets to them. This is quite similar to the
UNIX directory and file tree structures. You can think of non-leaf
nodes as directories and leaf nodes as files.
</p><p>Finally, define your packet-to-class mappings to tell your
classifier which packets to send to which class. You must define
the classes for this to make sense. First, attach a classifier to
the proper class. In the sample script, this is achieved by the
construct which starts with the line</p><pre     class="programlisting">
filter add dev eth0 parent 1:0 protocol ip ...
</pre><p>Next, define the packet-to-class mappings that will be used.
In the sample script, this is defined in the constructs that define
the matching criteria (such as <b  >match ip src
...</b>). Always map packets to leaf classes.
</p><p>If you follow this recipe and substitute the right syntax for
the different queueing disciplines and filters, you will get it
right. The appropriate details are in the options.</p><p><a href="3369l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1.</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x111a580.0x120aee8"></a>Testing the Setup</h2></div></div><p>In our setup, we have two virtual web servers on a single
Linux machine. The setup script (Listing 1) includes some commented
sample IP-aliasing examples using the supplied ip utility. The ip
utility is feature-loaded and not in the scope of this article. IP
addresses 10.0.0.10 and 10.0.0.11 are attached (aliased on) to
device eth0 in the example.</p><p>To test, use <span   class="bold"><b>ftp</b></span> to get to
another machine on the network. First, use ftp to get to IP address
10.0.0.10, where you should observe a rate of approximately 1Mbps.
Quit that ftp session and start another one to 10.0.0.11, where you
should observe a throughput of approximately 3Mbps.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x111a580.0x120b0a0"></a>Final Word</h2></div></div><p>These are very exciting times for Linux. As far as I know,
Linux is the most sophisticated QoS-enabled OS available today. The
closest second is probably BSD's ALTQ, which lags quite a bit
behind the sophistication, flexibility and extensibility found in
Linux TC. I am not aware of any such functionality in Microsoft
products (perhaps someone could provide pointers if they exist).
Sun Solaris does have a CBQ and RSVP combo they sell as a separate
product. I predict a huge increase in the use of Linux servers as a
result of the many features available with TC. Alexey has taken
Linux to a new level.</p><p>Support for the IETF diffserv features is also in Linux. The
work extends the TC to add the most flexible diffserv support known
today. Diffserv support was made possible through efforts by Werner
Almesberger (who also wrote LILO, Linux-ATM and more) and myself.
