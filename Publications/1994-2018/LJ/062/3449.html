    Mr. Lerner continues his look at building a simple,
    integrated mail system that can be accessed using a web
    browser.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1351580.0x1449450"></a></h2></div></div><p>Last month, we looked at a simple CGI
program (read-mail.pl) that allows us to view our e-mail from
within a web browser. This program takes advantage of the fact that
most e-mail today is delivered to a &ldquo;post office&rdquo; server, from
which it is downloaded by a user's mail-reading program. Mail
clients use the POP3 protocol to retrieve messages from a post
office server, which means our program can retrieve a user's mail
by connecting to a server and retrieving one or more messages.
</p><p>read-mail.pl is good enough for basic purposes, in that it
makes it possible to retrieve mail from any web browser in the
world. However, while it makes it possible to read e-mail messages,
it does not provide any mail-sending capabilities. True, many web
browsers include such a capability&mdash;but many, such as Netscape
Navigator, do not.</p><p>This month, then, we will take a look at how to send mail via
the web. Between read-mail.pl (from last month) and send-mail.pl
(in this article), we will have a simple, integrated mail system
that allows users to perform all rudimentary tasks from any web
browser.</p><p>Sending mail based on the contents of an HTML form was one of
the first uses to which CGI programs were put, back in 1993 when
CGI and HTML forms first arrived on the scene. As we will see,
sending e-mail is not particularly difficult from within a CGI
program. However, we will look at issues related to security as
well as what we would need to do to turn these simple programs into
a full-fledged Hotmail competitor.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1351580.0x1449660"></a>Basic Mail Sending</h2></div></div><p>Sending e-mail from within a program is normally quite
straightforward, particularly if you are using Perl. You open a
pipe to a mail-sending program, and send it the headers and data
for the message you want to send. For instance, here is a simple
program that sends a short &ldquo;hello, world&rdquo; message to my address,
reuven@lerner.co.il:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#!/usr/bin/perl -w
use strict;
use diagnostics;
my $mailprog = '/usr/lib/sendmail';
my $recipient = 'reuven@lerner.co.il';
open (MAIL, "|$mailprog $recipient")
die "Cannot open $mailprog: $! ";
print MAIL "From: nobody\n";
print MAIL "To: $recipient\n";
print "\n";
print MAIL "Hello there!\n";
close MAIL;
</pre><p>There are several things to notice about this program. First
of all, we set <b  >$mailprog</b> to
&ldquo;/usr/lib/sendmail&rdquo;, the default name and location of the mail
transfer agent (MTA) on Linux systems. If your copy of sendmail is
in another location or if you are using a program other than
sendmail, you will need to change the value of
<b  >$mailprog</b>.
</p><p>Similarly, mail is sent to a single address, what is defined
in <b  >$recipient</b>. We will discuss the issue of
recipients later, when we look at the issue of program security.
Keep in mind that restricting the number of recipients to which the
program will send e-mail reduces the possibility that your program
will be turned into a mail gateway by spammers or others interested
in sending anonymous mail.</p><p>We open a connection to <b  >$mailprog</b> using
Perl's <span   class="bold"><b>open</b></span> function, which allows
us to write to a program's standard input (STDIN) by treating the
program name as a file name, and by prefacing the program's name
with a | character. Anything we print or write to that file handle
will be treated as if it were sent to the program's STDIN. Any
output from the program is ignored.</p><p>Finally, notice how we insert a new line character between
the final header and the message body. As with HTTP, SMTP (the
&ldquo;simple mail transfer protocol&rdquo; used for most mail transfer on
the Internet) requires a blank line between the header and any
data. This allows the receiving program to identify which lines are
headers and which are in the body.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1351580.0x1449ad8"></a>Mail::Sendmail</h2></div></div><p>Those of us who have been sending mail from within Perl
programs were delighted when the
<span   class="bold"><b>Mail::Sendmail</b></span> module, written by
Milivoj Ivkovic, was released to CPAN (the Comprehensive Perl
Archive Network, based at http://www.cpan.org/). This module
provides a portable method for sending mail from within a Perl
program, but also provides a layer of abstraction between your
program and the underlying mail system.</p><p>It is important to understand how the mail-sending mechanism
works on your computer, particularly when it comes time to debug
problems with sending or receiving e-mail. However, being able to
send mail with three or four lines of Perl from a package
maintained and updated independently of your program makes it
possible to write shorter, more reliable programs. I have begun
using Mail::Sendmail in all of my programs that send e-mail, and I
suggest you do so as well, unless you have good reason to stick
with the old system described above. One possible reason not to use
Mail::Sendmail is if your program will be installed on a system
without this package and on which you could not expect it to be
installed. Given the ease with which packages can be downloaded and
installed from CPAN, however, this should not deter you in a
serious way.</p><p>The Mail::Sendmail module, like all other modules, must be
imported at the top of any program that uses it with a
<b  >use</b> statement:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
use Mail::Sendmail;
</pre><p>If you have not installed the module, or if it is not
installed in one of the directories named in
<b  >@INC</b> (the path through which Perl searches when
importing modules), Perl will fail with a fatal error.
</p><p>After Mail::Sendmail is imported, sending a message becomes a
two-step process. In the first stage, define a hash in which the
keys are the headers and contents of the message. Specify the
message body with the <b  >Message</b> (or
<b  >Body</b> or <b  >Text</b>) key. For
example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
my %mail = (To =&gt; $recipient, From =&gt; $sender,
  Message =&gt; "Hello, there!");
</pre><p>You can then send the mail using the statement:
<pre     class="programlisting">
sendmail %mail;
</pre>


The sendmail function is imported into the current name space
automatically with the <b  >use Mail::Sendmail</b>
instruction. Mail::Sendmail defines many other functions as well,
but none of these are imported into the default name space unless
you explicitly request it.
</p><p>As you can see, the above code is significantly shorter and
easier to understand than what we did first. The fact that it is
more portable and easier to maintain are nice additional
benefits.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1351580.0x144a160"></a>Moving to the Web</h2></div></div><p>Now that we have seen how to send mail from within our
program, we can concentrate on how to create a simple mail-sending
facility from within a CGI program. Listing 1 shows an initial stab
at send-mail.pl, which is a CGI wrapper around the above
functionality.</p><p><a href="3449l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1.</a></p><p>As you can see from the top of the program, send-mail.pl
imports a large number of modules before it gets down to business.
It uses <b  >strict</b> and
<b  >diagnostics</b> to ensure our variables are lexicals
(i.e., temporary variables defined with <b  >my</b>),
only hard references are used, and barewords are not considered
subroutine calls. (Bareword is a Perl term for a word in which its
use in a program is unclear. Originally, any such words were simply
prohibited. Now that subroutines can be called without a leading
&amp;, barewords are interpreted as subroutines. This can confuse
programmers and lead to buggy programs, so it is usually best to
avoid them.)</p><p>Then, because this is a CGI program, we import the CGI.pm, a
module which provides us with all the CGI functionality we could
imagine, useful for receiving user input and sending output to a
web browser. We also import
<span   class="bold"><b>CGI::Carp</b></span>, which provides us with
improved messages in the web server's error log. By importing the
<b  >fatalsToBrowser</b> symbol from CGI::Carp, we also
ensure that fatal error messages are sent to the user's browser, as
well as the error log. Normally, a fatal error in a CGI program
results in an incomprehensible numeric error message on the user's
browser. While the output from <b  >fatalsToBrowser</b>
might not seem much more useful or comprehensible to a
non-programmer, it is not as scary as a set of numeric codes. Also,
it makes the program much easier to debug than it would be
otherwise.</p><p>Finally, we import Mail::Sendmail as described
previously.</p><p>Other than retrieving three HTML form parameters
(<b  >sender</b>, <b  >recipient</b> and
<b  >message</b>) and using them in the invocation of
<span   class="bold"><b>Mail::Sendmail::sendmail</b></span>, this
program contains little you have not seen before. We do want to
ensure the mail is sent before reporting it has been, so we use
<span   class="bold"><b>die</b></span> to exit with a fatal error; it
will end the program after printing an error message to the user's
browser and the error log.</p><p>We can determine if the mail was sent by checking the return
value from the &ldquo;sendmail&rdquo; subroutine. If it returns
<b  >true</b>, we know the mail was sent. If it returns
<b  >false</b>, the program stopped before it was sent.
Here is one simple way to accomplish this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
if (sendmail %mail)
{
# Print a message for success
}
else
{
die "Error sending mail: $Mail::Sendmail::error \n";
}
</pre><p>The variable <b  >$Mail::Sendmail::error</b> (i.e.,
the variable <b  >$error</b> inside of the package
Mail::Sendmail) contains a detailed description of why the mail was
not sent. Since the <span   class="bold"><b>sendmail</b></span>
subroutine returns <b  >true</b> when it succeeds and
<b  >false</b> when it fails, the above construct tells
Perl, &ldquo;try to send the mail contained in
<b  >%mail</b>--and if you cannot, exit and print a
message describing why it failed.&rdquo;
</p><p>If the mail is sent successfully, the user is returned a
message indicating the program performed its task. It also prints
the contents of the mail. Giving the user detailed feedback of this
sort is always better than printing a simple &ldquo;success&rdquo; message,
since the user might not be sure which e-mail message is being
referenced.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1351580.0x144ac60"></a>Creating the Form</h2></div></div><p>Now that we have a CGI program capable of sending mail, we
need some way to invoke it. We could pass parameters as name-value
pairs in the URL, but that is difficult and not very user friendly.
We will thus send the name-value pairs using POST, which sends them
to the program's standard input (STDIN). POST input to a program is
generally sent from an HTML form. Here is a sample form that
invokes send-mail.pl:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;HTML&gt;
&lt;Head&gt;
&lt;Title&gt;Send e-mail!&lt;/Title&gt;
&lt;/Head&gt;
&lt;Body&gt;
&lt;H1&gt;Send e-mail!&lt;/H1&gt;
&lt;Form method="POST"
  action="/cgi-bin/send-mail.pl"&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Sender: &lt;input type="text" name="sender"&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Recipient: &lt;input type="text"
  name="recipient"&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Message:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;textarea cols="60" rows="20"
  name="message"&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;input type="submit"&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;/Form&gt;
&lt;/Body&gt;
&lt;/HTML&gt;
</pre><p>This form has three elements, named
<b  >sender</b>, <b  >recipient</b> and
<b  >message</b>. These are the same elements we
retrieved with the <span   class="bold"><b>param</b></span> method in
send-mail.pl. If you modify the names of the parameters in the HTML
form, make sure to modify the program as well, or the form elements
will not be picked up.
</p><p>All HTML form elements are sent as name-value pairs in which
the value is a text string. The CGI program receiving and
interpreting the data does not know, and furthermore does not have
to know, whether the input field was a text field, a text area, a
check box, a radio button or a pull-down menu.</p><p>Indeed, we can even substitute a hidden field&mdash;which does not
appear on the web browser and cannot be changed by the user&mdash;for a
text field, which comes in handy if we want to hard-code a value,
such as that of the recipient. Simply replace the
<b  >recipient</b> line with</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;input type="hidden" name="recipient"
value="reuven@lerner.co.il"&gt;
</pre><p>and all mail will be sent to my address.
</p><p>Similarly, if you want to allow people to send mail to a
number of addresses, but still restrict them somewhat, you can use
a selection list:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;select name="recipient"&gt;
&lt;option value="reuven@lerner.co.il"&gt;Reuven
&lt;option value="eviltwin@lerner.co.il"&gt;Reuven's evil twin
&lt;option value="info@linuxjournal.com.com"&gt;<i  >LJ</i> editor
&lt;/select&gt;
</pre><p>Changing our HTML form in any of these ways requires no
changes to our CGI program. Once again, send-mail.pl expects to
receive a name-value pair in which the name is
<b  >recipient</b> and the value is a valid e-mail
address.
</p><p>With the above form and CGI program in place, we should be
able to send mail to any e-mail address on the Internet.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1351580.0x1441bd0"></a>Preventing Spam</h2></div></div><p>The problem with the above form is it truly allows anyone to
send mail to any address on the Internet. Furthermore, it allows
the sender to pretend to be any address on the Internet. This is
precisely the sort of tool spammers love to exploit. If you were to
put our original version of send-mail.pl on your site, you would
eventually discover someone was using your server and bandwidth to
send their spam.</p><p>Several possible ways can be used to prevent this. One is to
remove the possibility of sending mail to users or domains outside
of a selected list. For instance, we can define a hash where the
keys are approved e-mail addresses:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
my %approved_recipient = ('reuven@lerner.co.il' =&gt; 1,
  'info@linuxjournal.com.com' =&gt; 1);
</pre><p>Using a hash allows us to check the status of any e-mail
address in a constant time interval, regardless of the number of
addresses. If we were to use an array, for example, we would
potentially have to search through the entire array before we could
be sure of an address's status, meaning that the time necessary to
perform such a test would grow in proportion to the number of
elements in the array.
</p><p>We can thus check to see if an address is approved by
inserting the following code:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
if (!$approved_recipient{$recipient})
{
die "Unapproved address \"$recipient\": Mail" .
 " was not sent.\n";
}
</pre><p>A version of send-mail.pl with the above code can be found in
Listing 2 in the archive file
(ftp://ftp.linuxjournal.com/pub/lj/listings/issue62/3449.tgz).
</p><p>We can similarly allow mail to be sent to any address within
a particular domain by putting all of the approved domains inside
an array:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
my @approved_domains = ('lerner.co.il'
       'linuxjournal.com');
</pre><p>We then create a variable, <b  >$match_found</b>,
which defaults to 0:
<pre     class="programlisting">
my $match_found = 0;
</pre>


<b  >$match_found</b> will be set to 1 only if one of the
approved domains matches the domain in
<b  >$recipient</b>. We check this with a short loop:
<pre     class="programlisting">
foreach my $domain (@approved_domains)
{
if ($recipient =~ m/$domain$/)
{
$match_found = 1;
last;
}
}
</pre>


We use <b  >last</b> to break out of the loop when we
find a match, in order to save some time. If you know certain
domains will receive mail more often than others, you should put
them at the beginning of <b  >@approved_domains</b>,
since the earlier an item appears in that array, the sooner the
match will be found.
</p><p>We then send mail only if <b  >$match_found</b> is
true (i.e., non-zero). If <b  >$match_found</b> is 0, we
print an error message:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# If the domain was not approved
else
{
die "Mail was not sent: The recipient's domain " .
 "is not approved.\n";
}
</pre><p>The version of send-mail.pl in Listing 3 in the archive has
these additions.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1351580.0x1442410"></a>Checking for Errors</h2></div></div><p>If we want our program to be robust, we must do more than
check for security violations. We must check for input from the
user that might not affect security, but might lead to bugs or
other unpleasant surprises.</p><p>For instance, if we invoke send-mail.pl directly from a URL,
for example</p><pre     class="programlisting">
http://www.lerner.co.il/cgi-bin/send-mail.pl
</pre><p>the program will report that the mail was sent with a blank
sender, recipient and message. This is bad for two reasons. First,
no mail was sent, since necessary headers were not assigned any
values, so the program is providing us with incorrect information.
Second, we should never get to the point where blank data from the
user is accepted as input for mail.
</p><p>We can prevent this situation by ensuring send-mail is always
invoked with POST, and that <b  >$sender</b>,
<b  >$recipient</b> and <b  >$message</b> are
non-blank. If any of these is equivalent to the empty string, we
exit prematurely from the program, telling the user each must have
a non-blank value. Once again, using die is better in debugging
environments than in production code, simply because of the style
of error message it produces. There is no reason why you could not
forward the user to an error message page, or print a nicely
designed page describing what was missing, rather than simply
dying.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1351580.0x1442780"></a>Competing with Hotmail</h2></div></div><p>Between send-mail.pl and read-mail.pl, we have created a
small system to send and receive e-mail. Is this enough to compete
with Hotmail creating our own small web-based mail service? The
short answer is &ldquo;no&rdquo;, although the longer answer is that it is
probably enough to suit most purposes.</p><p>Part of the problem is these two programs are run using CGI.
While CGI is portable across platforms and languages, it is
inherently slow, requiring the web server to create a new process
each time the program is invoked. While this is more than adequate
for lightly loaded machines, it quickly becomes a performance drain
as the number of hits increases.</p><p>Each HTTP server has developed its own native interface that
allows you to attach your program to the server process. Since
Apache is free software, several such interfaces have been
developed for it, including
<span   class="bold"><b>mod_perl</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>mod_php</b></span>. The former allows you to
write CGI-like programs in Perl, attaching them to the server
process. This means your functionality becomes a subroutine within
the server program, rather than an external program that must be
invoked separately. The speed difference between a program running
under mod_perl and the same functionality in a CGI program is
staggering and should convince just about any die-hard CGI user to
switch to mod_perl.</p><p>A site wishing to compete with Hotmail would probably want to
use mod_perl or a similar server-specific API in order to get the
maximum performance out of its hardware.</p><p>Aside from performance, another issue is where the mail is to
be stored. The programs we have discussed, read-mail.pl and
send-mail.pl, expect the user's mail to be stored on a POP server
elsewhere on the Internet. Hotmail and similar services have their
own POP servers for incoming mail, as well as their own MTAs
(usually sendmail, although other MTAs are apparently better for
high-volume mail servers) running on their systems.</p><p>However, Hotmail will allow you to retrieve mail only from
their own POP servers, while read-mail.pl will allow you to
retrieve mail from any POP server, including one that would
normally not have a web interface. Whether you restrict mail
checking by users to your own system, a number of servers within
your organization or anywhere else is up to you.</p><p>Finally, services such as Hotmail survive due to advertising,
and one of the most popular ways to advertise is to add a short
note to the bottom of each message indicating which web-based mail
service was used to send it. We can easily do that by concatenating
our own footer to the message the user sends with these
instructions:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
my $footer = "-\nBrought to you by ReuvenMail\n";
my $message = $query-&gt;param("message");
$message .= $footer;
my %mail = (To =&gt; $recipient, From =&gt; $sender,
  Message =&gt; $message);
</pre><p>Now everyone will know which mail service you were using when
you sent mail from your web-based system. This functionality is
included in the final version of the program, Listing 3 in the
archive file.
</p><p>Finally, Hotmail has millions of members, which means it is
relying on more than a single computer running Linux for mail
delivery. Operating a single system for sending and receiving mail
is not nearly as hard as creating a large, scalable system. If you
are interested in truly competing with Hotmail, you will need
capital investment and a good knowledge of networking protocols, in
addition to Linux, Apache and the above programs.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1351580.0x1442c50"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>Sending mail from an HTML form is one of the oldest uses of
the CGI standard. Many such programs have been created, although
they have not always been careful to restrict spam or other abuses.
As we have seen, it is possible to get around most of these
problems, but it is important to think about them before putting
your system on-line.</p><p>By combining a simple mail-reading program with a simple
mail-sending program, we can create a basic web-based mail service
that is as open or closed as we desire. Perhaps these programs do
not scale as well as Hotmail, but they do give us some insight into
how that service (and similar ones) work, as well as what we might
need to do with our own programs in order to make them as useful as
possible.</p><p><a href="3449s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
