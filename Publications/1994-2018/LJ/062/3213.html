    This month, the more advanced techniques of naming and event
    services are discussed.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xefc580.0xff48c8"></a></h2></div></div><p>In our last article, we introduced the
concept of distributed programming with CORBA from a high-level
point of view. In order to further flush out the CORBA
infrastructure, we need to detail some of the standard services
that the OMG (Object Management Group) has defined that should be
supplied at least in part by most ORB vendors. Among these are the
Trader Service, the Naming Service, the Event Service, the
Interface Repository and the Implementation Repository.
</p><p>The OMG has defined only the interface to each service while
not attempting to provide an implementation. This means an OMG
Service is actually nothing more than a CORBA interface written in
IDL (Interface Definition Language). If a particular service is not
available within a particular ORB or is not well-implemented, the
developer always has the option of writing a custom implementation
for the interface. In fact, if a vendor is truly CORBA-compliant,
one vendor's implementation of a service can be used with another
vendor's implementation of the ORB. This ability to mix and match
CORBA-compliant implementations allows for flexible approaches to
CORBA solutions. In this article, we will describe two of the most
commonly provided OMG Services: the Naming Service and the Event
Service. Our sample code is written using the feature-rich and
GNU-licensed MICO CORBA implementation and demonstrates how to use
both the Naming and Event Services in C++.</p><p>Last month, we introduced the concept of an IOR
(Interoperable Object Reference), which we said was like a phone
number or mailing address for the remote object. The client
application can use the IOR to locate the remote object and
establish communication. In that article, we handed the client
application the IOR by writing it to a file and passing the file to
the server application at startup. In practice, this is an
inconvenient way to design a system. One of the most common
approaches to solving the problem of locating objects at runtime is
to use the OMG Naming Service. The Naming Service is an interface
to a database where an object's name is associated with its
IOR.</p><p>In order to understand the Naming Service, it is often
helpful to think in terms of the UNIX directory structure. The
Naming Service is comprised of objects called naming contexts. A
naming context can be thought of as a directory within a file
system, ultimately deriving from a common root directory (the
&ldquo;root&rdquo; context). Each name within a naming context must be
unique. Since naming contexts are actually objects, a naming
context can be registered with another naming context. In effect,
this is analogous to creating a subdirectory within another
directory in a file system. The hierarchical structure created by
this method is called a naming graph. In order to simplify finding
objects within a naming graph, the Naming Service allows objects to
be referred to by compound names, which are similar to an absolute
path name in UNIX.</p><p>The name under which an object is registered in the Naming
Service is completely discretional and not required to even
describe the actual object. In the Naming Service, the object's
name is defined by a <b  >NameComponent</b> object. These
<b  >NameComponent</b> objects are then stored in a
particular naming context. The <b  >NameComponent</b>
object actually consists of two parts, an &ldquo;identifier&rdquo; and a
&ldquo;kind&rdquo;. The <b  >NameComponent</b> is represented in
IDL as:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
struct NameComponent {
Istring id;
Istring kind;
};
</pre><p>Returning to the UNIX file system analogy, a UNIX file called
Consumer.C would have an identifier of Consumer and a kind of C. In
the same manner, an object may be stored in a naming context with
an identifier of BusinessObject and a kind of java. The developer
can thus use any naming standard he wishes when defining objects
using the Naming Service.
</p><p>In order for a CORBA client object to use the Naming Service
to find other objects, it must know where to find the naming
service. The preferred method of finding the Naming Service is to
use the OMG method
<span   class="bold"><b>resolve_initial_references</b></span>. Under
most ORB solutions, resolve_initial_references will return the IOR
of the &ldquo;root naming context&rdquo;, or in effect, the root directory
node.</p><p>In simplest terms, when a server application is launched, it
registers or &ldquo;binds&rdquo; objects it wishes to expose with the Naming
Service using compound names. This is accomplished through the bind
and rebind methods. The client application can then look up a
particular object's IOR simply by resolving the object's compound
name, which the client must know. The client application uses the
resolve method to find an IOR from a given compound name. Once the
name has been resolved and the IOR obtained, the application can
narrow (narrowing an object is CORBA terminology for downcasting)
the object reference to resolve the actual object implementation;
from that point on, the object can be used as usual. Later, our
example demonstrates how you might use the Naming Service to
register and locate object implementations.</p><p>Another service with an OMG-defined interface is the Event
Service. The OMG Event Service specification provides for decoupled
message transfer between CORBA objects. The decoupling of
communication provided by the Event Service allows for flexibility
in terms of communication modes and methods. Specifically, it
allows one object (Supplier) the ability to send messages to
another object (Consumer) that is interested in receiving those
messages without having to know where the receiver is or even
whether the receiver is listening. This decoupling provides several
important benefits:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Suppliers and Consumers do not have to physically
handle the communication and do not need any specific knowledge of
each other. They simply connect to the Event Service, which
mediates their communication.</p></li><li><p>Message passing between the Supplier and Consumer
takes place asynchronously. Message delivery does not need to
entail blocking (although a pull Consumer may choose to block if it
wishes&mdash;see below).</p></li><li><p>Event Channels can be set up to be either typed or
untyped (not all ORB implementations support typed events).</p></li><li><p>Event Channels will automatically buffer received
events until a suitable Consumer expresses interest in the events.
Note that this does not imply either persistence or store and
forward capabilities. Generally, an independent queue in the Event
Channel will be devoted to each Consumer. These internal queues are
generally based on a LIFO (last-in first-out) basis, with older
messages disposed when the buffer is full and new messages arrive,
without a Consumer extracting the messages fast enough. Most ORBs
will allow you to set the maximum queue length.</p></li><li><p>Events can be confirmed and can have their delivery
guaranteed, if the vendor has implemented this capability.</p></li><li><p>Suppliers can choose to either push events onto the
channel (<span   class="bold"><b>push</b></span>) or have the channel
request events from them (<span   class="bold"><b>pull</b></span>).
Similarly, a Consumer may request to either synchronously (pull) or
asynchronously (<span   class="bold"><b>try_pull</b></span>) obtain
events from the channel, or have the channel deliver events to them
(push).</p></li><li><p>A one-to-one correspondence between Suppliers and
Consumers is not necessary. There can be multiple Suppliers
connected to a single Consumer via the Event Service, as well as a
single Supplier connected to one or more Consumers.</p></li></ul></div><p>Two primary styles of interaction exist between Suppliers and
Consumers and the Event Channel: Push and Pull.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xefc580.0xff5528"></a>Push Method</h2></div></div><p>In the Push Method, a Supplier will connect to the Event
Channel and initiate a push of an event onto the Event Channel
whenever it is ready to do so. It is the Event Channel's
responsibility to buffer those events until they are delivered to
one or more interested Consumers. In the Push Model, it is the
Supplier that initiates the flow of events to the Event Channel.
When a Supplier wants to connect to an Event Channel, it needs an
object within the Event Channel to &ldquo;pretend&rdquo; it is a Consumer.
This allows the Supplier to simply deliver events to its
&ldquo;Consumer&rdquo;, when in reality, its Consumer is simply a proxy for
the actual Consumer, which is outside the Event Channel. It is to
this proxy &ldquo;Consumer&rdquo; that the Push Supplier pushes events. Thus,
the Proxy object is not a real Consumer, but merely an object
within the Event Channel that provides a delivery mechanism through
which the Supplier can deliver messages.</p><p>A Push Consumer will likewise connect to a &ldquo;proxy&rdquo; object,
a proxy that represents the Push Supplier. When the Event Channel
has a message available, the Push Supplier proxy will deliver
(push) the message to the actual Consumer object. The message path
is from the actual Push Supplier, through its Proxy Push Consumer,
to the Proxy Push Supplier and finally to the Push Consumer itself.
There are other variations of this, as our later example will
show.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xefc580.0xff5688"></a>Pull Method</h2></div></div><p>In the Pull Method, the Event Channel will pull data from the
Supplier. In the Pull Model, it is the Consumer that drives the
delivery of messages. A Pull Supplier will connect to a Proxy Pull
Consumer. Again, as far as the Pull Supplier is concerned, it can
consider this proxy object as a real Consumer that will request
events periodically. An interested Pull Consumer object will then
connect on the other end of the Event Channel to a Proxy Pull
Supplier. When a Pull Consumer is ready to receive an event, it
will initiate either a pull or try_pull call on its Proxy Pull
Supplier, which will in turn query the Proxy Pull Consumer
connected to the actual Pull Supplier, to request another event be
delivered. In this way, the Consumer drives the data, when it is
ready to process another message. Some implementations of the Pull
Method will allow the Proxy Pull Supplier to periodically pull
events from the Supplier at regular intervals in an attempt to keep
a buffer full of events for consumers when they request
delivery.</p><p>The nice thing about the Event Channel abstraction is a
communication does not need to be either entirely Push Model or
Pull Model. A Push Supplier may indirectly connect to one or more
Pull Consumers, and several Pull Suppliers may connect to one or
more Push Consumers. It is the Event Channel logic that allows such
interrelationships disproportionality among objects. It is the
application design that drives the decisions concerning suppliers,
consumers and their numbers.</p><p>Regardless of the relationship among suppliers and consumers,
to establish a connection and deliver events through the Event
Channel the following five steps must be taken:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The client (Supplier or Consumer) must bind to the
Event Channel, which must already have been created by someone,
perhaps the client.</p></li><li><p>The client must get an Admin object from the Event
Channel.</p></li><li><p>The client must obtain a proxy object from the
Admin object&mdash;a Consumer Proxy for a Supplier client and a Supplier
Proxy for a Consumer client.</p></li><li><p>Add the Supplier or Consumer to the event channel
via a connect call.</p></li><li><p>Transfer data between the client and the Event
Channel via a push, pull or try_pull call.</p></li></ul></div><p>When messages are delivered through the Event Channel, they
can be either &ldquo;typed&rdquo; or &ldquo;untyped&rdquo;. Typed messages are those
defined in an IDL which are type-checked at compile time. Untyped
events, the most common, adhere to the standard Event Services
interfaces and are packaged as type <b  >CORBA::Any</b>,
which is a wrapper around all known CORBA types. It is this &ldquo;Any&rdquo;
type that is actually sent from a Supplier Object to a Consumer
Object. The Supplier will construct an Any, and the Consumer, upon
receipt of the message, will derive the true value from the Any
wrapper. This allows for great flexibility in delivering messages,
as a Supplier may pass a string first, a long value second and an
array third, all through packaging the values into an Any. The
example code shows how to create, embed and extract values from Any
types.
</p><p>Our example incorporates both the Naming Service lookup as
well as an implementation of a Supplier and a Consumer interacting
through the use of the Event Service. The Supplier implements the
Push Supplier Model and the Consumer implements the Pull Consumer
Model, thus illustrating that the models do not have to be all of
one type. Listing 1 shows Consumer.C, and Listing 2 shows
Supplier.C. These listings are available by anonymous download in
the file ftp://ftp.linuxjournal.com/pub/lj/listings/issue62/3213.tgz.</p><p>The first step the Consumer must take is to find the root
naming context. This is accomplished by calling
<span   class="bold"><b>resolve_initial_references</b></span> and
then narrowing the returned IOR. The resulting object is the root
naming context we can then use to resolve our Event Service.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
CORBA::Object_var nsobj =
orb-&gt;resolve_initial_references("NameService");
assert(! CORBA::is_nil(nsobj));
CosNaming::NamingContext_var context =
CosNaming::NamingContext::_narrow(nsobj);
assert(! CORBA::is_nil(context));
</pre><p>As we turn to the Event Service sections of the code, we
notice that the first thing the Consumer does after obtaining the
initial context from the Naming Service is resolve and narrow the
EventChannelFactory.
<pre     class="programlisting">
CosNaming::Name name;
name.length(1);
name[0].id =
CORBA::string_dup("EventChannelFactory");
name[0].kind = CORBA::string_dup("factory");
CORBA::Object_var obj;
obj = context-&gt;resolve(name);
</pre>


MICO uses the factory referenced above as a generic CORBA::Object
to create a new Event Channel object by first narrowing the generic
reference, then calling the factory's
<span   class="bold"><b>create_eventchannel</b></span> function:
<pre     class="programlisting">
SimpleEventChannelAdmin::EventChannelFactory_var
        factory;
CosEventChannelAdmin::EventChannel_var event_channel;
factory =
SimpleEventChannelAdmin::EventChannelFactory::_narrow(obj);
event_channel = factory-&gt;create_eventchannel();
</pre>


We then use the Naming Service to bind this newly created Event
Channel object to the name <b  >TestEventChannel</b> via
the Naming Service's bind method. This is done so that the Supplier
will be able to locate this particular Event Channel by the name
<b  >TestEventChannel</b> when needed.
<pre     class="programlisting">
name.length(1);
name[0].id =
CORBA::string_dup("TestEventChannel");
name[0].kind = CORBA::string_dup("");
context-&gt;bind(name,&lt;\n&gt;
CosEventChannelAdmin::EventChannel::
_duplicate(event_channel));
</pre>


Once the Event Channel has been created and named, the Event
Channel object (<b  >event_channel</b>) is used to obtain
a reference to a ConsumerAdmin object through the
<span   class="bold"><b>for_consumers</b></span> function. The
ConsumerAdmin object provides the proxies for the Consumer clients
of the Event Channel. It allows the Consumer to obtain the
appropriate Supplier Proxy. In our case, we use the ConsumerAdmin
object to provide us (a Pull Consumer) with a proxy Pull Supplier.
This allows our Consumer object to act as if it were communicating
directly with a Supplier that expects us to be &ldquo;pulling&rdquo; events
from it. Of course, that's not actually the case. Our Supplier is
really a Push Supplier that pushes events onto the Event Channel.
The proxies decouple the Consumer and Supplier objects and allow
them to function as if they were directly connected, when in fact,
their connection is indirect. Once we have the ConsumerAdmin, we
use it to create our Push Consumer proxy:
<pre     class="programlisting">
CosEventChannelAdmin::ConsumerAdmin_var
Consumer_admin;
Consumer_admin = event_channel-&gt;for_consumers();
...
CosEventChannelAdmin::ProxyPullSupplier_var
proxy_Supplier;
proxy_Supplier =
Consumer_admin-&gt;obtain_pull_Supplier();
</pre>


Once the Consumer has obtained a reference to its Supplier Proxy,
it then notifies the Event Channel of its interest in receiving
events from it through a call to the Proxy's
<span   class="bold"><b>connect_pull_Consumer</b></span> method. An
implementation of the Event Service's Pull Consumer interface is
passed into the proxy_Supplier to make the connection.
<pre     class="programlisting">
proxy_Supplier-&gt;connect_pull_Consumer
(CosEventComm::PullConsumer::_duplicate(Consumer));
</pre>


Once connected, calls can be made on the Proxy Pull Supplier's pull
or try_pull functions. The <b  >PullSupplier</b>
interface is:
<pre     class="programlisting">
interface PullSupplier
  {
    any pull() raises(Disconnected);
    any try_pull(out boolean has_event)
         raises(Disconnected);
    void disconnect_pull_Supplier();
  };
</pre>


In our case, we have the Consumer spawn a worker thread, and we
pass the Pull Supplier Proxy reference to that thread, the one that
actually makes the try_pull call. The try_pull call is an
asynchronous polling mechanism allowing the Consumer to contact the
Event Channel and &ldquo;check for mail&rdquo;. If there is a message in the
Event Channel, that message will be returned as a
<b  >CORBA::Any</b> value, and the try_pull's
<b  >CORBA::Boolean</b> flag <b  >has_event</b>
will be set to true. The try_pull call is thus made from within the
thread's &ldquo;start&rdquo; function in this way:
<pre     class="programlisting">
CORBA::Any* anyval;
CORBA::Boolean has_event = 0;
anyval = proxy_Supplier-&gt;try_pull(has_event);
</pre>


If no event is waiting, the <b  >has_event</b> flag is
set to false and no value is returned; but the call does not block
(as the pull function does), so it returns to the client
immediately. This allows the client to continue doing other work
while periodically checking to see if a new event message is
waiting in the Event Channel's queue.
</p><p>Once the <b  >has_event</b> value is true and an
Any value is retrieved, the Consumer must decide first what type it
is, then extract that value from the Any wrapper in order to use
it. The code to do that uses the Any's overloaded &gt;&gt;=
operator. This strange-looking beast will attempt to extract the
Any into the destination type. If the type contained in the Any is
compatible with the destination type, the value is extracted from
the Any; if not, null is returned. The usual way to check for the
value is to do something like the following:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
if( *anyval &gt;&gt;= shortval )
  {
    cerr &lt;&lt; "Consumer: thread pulled short:
         " &lt;&lt; shortval &lt;&lt; endl;
  }
  else if( *anyval &gt;&gt;= doubleval )
  {
    cerr &lt;&lt; setiosflags(ios::fixed);
    cerr &lt;&lt; "Consumer:
         thread pulled double: " &lt;&lt; doubleval &lt;&lt; endl;
  }
</pre><p>In our case, when we extract the correct type from the Any,
we print it out and immediately begin checking again for events
through our try_pull call.
</p><p>Our Supplier implementation is a bit simpler. After binding
to the ORB, it creates an implementation of a class that implements
the CORBA PushSupplier IDL:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
class PushSupplierImpl :
virtual public CosEventComm::PushSupplier_skel
{
public:
PushSupplierImpl() { }
void disconnect_push_Supplier();
};
...
  PushSupplierImpl * Supplier =
  new PushSupplierImpl();
</pre><p>This class implements the IDL PushSupplier interface, which
has only a single function to implement:
<span   class="bold"><b>disconnect_push_Supplier</b></span>. The
implementation object, PushSupplierImpl * Supplier, will be used
later to connect to the Event Channel and register our interest in
supplying events to the Channel.
</p><p>Just as the Consumer started by finding the root Naming
Context, our Supplier begins by calling
<span   class="bold"><b>resolve_initial_references</b></span>. Using
the IOR returned by resolve_initial_references, the Supplier can
then narrow to the naming context object.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
CORBA::Object_var nsobj =
orb-&gt;resolve_initial_references("NameService");
assert(! CORBA::is_nil(nsobj));
cerr &lt;&lt; "Supplier: successful call to \
resolve_initial_references()" &lt;&lt; endl;
CosNaming::NamingContext_var context =
CosNaming::NamingContext::_narrow(nsobj);
assert(! CORBA::is_nil(context));
</pre><p>Once the name is resolved and narrowed, the Supplier attempts
to retrieve a SupplierAdmin object through a call to the event
channel's <span   class="bold"><b>for_suppliers</b></span> function.
<pre     class="programlisting">
CosNaming::Name name;
name.length(1);
name[0].id = CORBA::string_dup("TestEventChannel");
name[0].kind = CORBA::string_dup("");
CORBA::Object_var obj;
...
obj = context-&gt;resolve(name);
...
CosEventChannelAdmin::EventChannel_var
event_channel;
CosEventChannelAdmin::SupplierAdmin_var
Supplier_admin;
...
event_channel =
CosEventChannelAdmin::EventChannel::_narrow(obj);
Supplier_admin = event_channel-&gt;for_suppliers();
</pre>


Once the SupplierAdmin object is retrieved, its
<span   class="bold"><b>obtain_push_Consumer</b></span> function is
called in order for the Supplier to obtain a Proxy PushConsumer
with which to communicate.
<pre     class="programlisting">
CosEventChannelAdmin::ProxyPushConsumer_var
proxy_Consumer;
...
proxy_Consumer =
Supplier_admin-&gt;obtain_push_Consumer();
</pre>


Once a proxy is obtained, we then need to connect the Supplier to
the proxy through this call:
<pre     class="programlisting">
proxy_Consumer-&gt;connect_push_Supplier(
CosEventComm::PushSupplier::_duplicate(Supplier));
</pre>


This call registers our interest in providing the Event Channel
with events. The IDL interface for the PushConsumer (the
implementation of which <b  >ProxyPushConsumer</b>
inherits) is:
<pre     class="programlisting">
interface PushConsumer
{
void push(in any data) raises(Disconnected);
void disconnect_push_Consumer();
};
</pre>


Once a proxy push Consumer has been obtained, calls may be made on
its push function, passing in a CORBA::Any value. This is done
quite simply:
<pre     class="programlisting">
CORBA::Any any;
any &lt;&lt;=(CORBA::ULong) 555555555;
proxy_Consumer-&gt;push(any);
</pre>


At this point, the Any value is delivered to the Event Channel,
which is responsible for making that event message available to the
try_pull calls of the Consumer, described above. Thus, we have come
full circle in our discussion of the Supplier/Consumer roles in
interacting with the Event Service.
</p><p>Our example was built using the egcs 1.1b C++ compiler and
MICO 2.2.1. In order to build and run the example, once you have
unpacked the tar file, you simply need to update the variable
<b  >MICO_BASEDIR</b> in the Makefile to point to your
base Mico installation, then type <b  >make</b>. This
will build both the Supplier and Consumer. To run the application,
we've provided a simple script that starts the rather lengthy MICO
naming and event services for you automatically, then starts the
Consumer (which creates the Event Channel), then the Supplier. To
run the script, simply type <b  >runit</b>. You will see
the progress of the Supplier writing messages to the Event Channel,
and the Consumer extracting them from the Event Channel; as it does
so, it prints them out. Our Supplier will push, in succession, a
long, a short, a double, a string, and finally another long (the
number 13), which signals to the Consumer that it is finished. At
that point, the Consumer thread exits and the applications are
killed by the runit script.</p><p>Our next article will discuss an implementation of VisiBroker
for Java that can be made available for development of clients and
servers completely on Linux using Sun's JDK.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Resources</b></span></p><p>Home page for the Object Management Group: http://www.omg.org/</p><p>Introduction to CORBA: http://www.omg.org/news/begin.htm</p><p>The Free CORBA Page: http://adams.patriot.net/~tvalesky/freecorba.html</p><p>Java port for Linux: http://java.blackdown.org/</p><p>The CORBA FAQ: http://www.cerfnet.com/~mpcline/Corba-FAQ</p></div></div>
