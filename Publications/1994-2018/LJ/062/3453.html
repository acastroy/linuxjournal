that for the &ldquo;Wrong Date&rdquo; question from Bilal Iqbal, you edited
my answer, changing the meaning. In fact, you reversed the
arguments to the <span   class="bold"><b>ln</b></span> command. The
link should be</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/US/Pacific \
   /etc/localtime
</pre><p>and the <b  >-f</b> option is most likely needed,
since most systems already have a link there. Also, I said &ldquo;a link
like this&rdquo;, not &ldquo;create this link&rdquo;, since the reader specified
his timezone was GMT+5, so telling him to create a link setting his
timezone to GMT-8 isn't exactly what he would want to do. &mdash;Marc

printer because the Zip drive is a parallel port version. The
printer manager does not recognize the printer is connected. I was
able to use the printer before the Zip drive was installed. Is it
possible to use both the zip and the printer? I know I cannot use
it while my zip is mounted, but when I unmount the drive, would it
be possible? &mdash;Smileyq, smileyq0@mindspring.com</p><p>Rebuild the kernel, defining lp and zip support as modules.
When you wish to use the printer, unload the zip module (if loaded)
and load the lp module, so you can use the printer. When you wish
to use the zip drive, unload the lp module (if loaded) and load the
zip module. That's it. &mdash;Paulo Wollny, paulo@wollny.com.br</p><p>According to the Zip Drive mini HOWTO, question 7.1

it should be possible. You will need a newer kernel (2.2.x) or
you'll need to upgrade the ppa driver in your current kernel source
and recompile it. Since RH 5.2 isn't fully compatible with the
2.2.x kernels, you may be better off recompiling your current
kernel, and you can find the ppa driver on David Campbell's page:

been experimenting with it. Last night I accidentally ran
<span   class="bold"><b>mkfs.msdos</b></span> on my Windows 98 FAT32
partition (/dev/hda1) thinking it was a command to mount an MS-DOS
partition under Linux, but of course, it nuked my drive, created an
MS-DOS partition over it, and I lost everything on my drive! I am
writing to you in hopes that you know of a way that I can salvage
the information still on my drive. The mkfs.msdos command erases
only the FAT sector when it creates a new file system, right? So,
shouldn't all the information still be there? Thank you in advance
for any assistance. &mdash;Jon Verville, theverv@hotmail.com</p><p>That's a rough accident. The short answer is there's little
you can do. Yes, the information is still there, but the FAT tables
tell the system where to look for different pieces of a file, and
if your file system is fragmented, it could be very difficult to
recover anything.</p><p>However, it would be worth trying a few recovery tools, such
as Norton's Disk Doctor if only to salvage some of your data before
you reinstall Windows. You may be able to save something from your
disk if you touch &mdash;Chad Robinson, chad.robinson@brt.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2464580.0x255c870"></a>Linux vs. IRIX</h2></div></div><p>Normally, I am an IRIX user. Recently, I bought a
dual-Pentium machine and installed Linux SuSE 5.3. on it. I can't
figure out if my second processor is recognized; there seems to be
no command like <span   class="bold"><b>hinv</b></span> in IRIX. Any
suggestions? Is there any document comparing IRIX and Linux
commands? &mdash;Tobias Knaute, tobias.knaute@charite.de</p><p>First, you have to make sure your kernel is compiled with SMP
support; this is not the default for most distributions. Then check
your /proc/cpuinfo file which contains the information for all CPUs
found during boot time.</p><p>In order to take full advantage of your dual processor
machine, I'd suggest you use the 2.2.4 kernel version, which is the
latest at this time. &mdash;Mario Bittencourt, mneto@buriti.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2464580.0x255ca80"></a>Removing xeyes</h2></div></div><p>I installed xeyes in the KDE menu and while trying to remove
it, it multiplied. Is there any way to close it? It has no resize
window and every method of stopping or interrupting doesn't prevent
it from returning on bootup. I have searched the man pages for a
key combination to kill them to no avail &mdash;Edward Spadacene,
espada@mbox.kyoto-inet.or.jp</p><p>You can close xeyes by clicking the right mouse button on it
and choosing &ldquo;Close&rdquo; from the pop-up menu that appears. Next time
you start KDE, xeyes will not be run. &mdash;Scott Maxwell,

on-line games. In particular, I need to set up the following
ports:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>An initial outbound TCP connection on port
47624</p></li><li><p>Subsequent connections of inbound and outbound TCP
and UDP ports 2300-2400</p></li></ul></div><p>I am using IP masquerading. My firewall is an ipforwarding
one, i.e., not a proxy firewall. Any help you can give me would be
greatly appreciated. &mdash;Neil Shanks, neilshanks@home.com
</p><p>Unless you set up additional firewalling rules, there is no
way to allow the outbound packet on port 47624. Outbound UDP and
TCP connections in the 2300-2400 range will work fine, and the
masquerading machine will open a reverse connection to gateway back
inbound packets if they come back on the same port. If they don't,
you may have some luck with the
<span   class="bold"><b>ipautofw</b></span> packet forwarder which
you can get at
ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/Linux/PEOPLE/Linus/net-source/firewall/ipautofw.tar.gz.

applications that can be made to work through IP masquerading,

hours) and the Quake 2 for Linux demo. When I went looking for the

did not ask for a specific location to place them, so I assumed
there was a default location. Am I wrong? &mdash;Robert Gray,

you could offer would be greatly welcomed. &mdash;Jabe Pitts,
Jabe.Pitts@cwix.com</p><p>Your system is probably fine&mdash;this is a boot loader issue.
Boot loaders need to know where the kernel is located, and by
restoring your tape, you overwrote the kernel, which moved it to a
