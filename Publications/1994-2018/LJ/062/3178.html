latest hot computer topic for businesses. In the boardroom, it is
often an even hotter topic than the Internet. ERP describes a class
of computer systems that attempts to manage all aspects of an
enterprise's operations. The basic structure of a typical ERP
system is shown in Figure 1. Note that this diagram is highly
generalized; actual ERP implementations differ wildly from vendor
to vendor, and even from installation to installation. As you can
see from the diagram, ERP systems cover an enormous scope, so they
are very large software systems. They also tend to be relatively
monolithic, which is their main selling point. This is also the
feature that worries IS workers the most, and the feature that
might make a Linux user scratch her head.
</p><p><a href="3178f1.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 1.
Typical ERP System</b></span></a></p><p>Frankly, ERP systems are typically sold with a pair of
rose-colored glasses as an accessory. A gentleman I spoke to, who
works at an enormous international beverage company, told me how
the firm was sold an ERP system. The salesmen for a leading ERP
vendor took the CEO to a demo room, with projection monitors
showing simulated real-time charts of all of the company's
operations and finances. The salesmen told the executives that with
this product, they could have their fingertips on all of their
company's data. The sale was closed at that point. Now, years later
and a scandalous sum over budget, the company has little choice but
to complete the installation. The IS staff is completely
disillusioned, but apparently not the executives, who are still
waiting for the magic cockpit to go on-line. This story is all too
typical. ERP systems are sold mostly at the executive level, and
skeptical IS staff have little to say other than the narrowest,
technical implementation details. Furthermore, the process of
putting together an ERP system is such an enormous undertaking and
commitment that once the project is begun, there is no backing out
without disastrous financial and operational results.</p><p>Where does Linux fit into this rather alien world? Many Linux
professionals will find themselves caught up in an ERP installation
at some point in their career, since ERP systems are selling very
well these days. But Linux makes the hapless IS professional think
of a more fundamental issue: what brought about the whole ERP
trend?</p><p>If you look at the history of computer software systems, you
will notice that the industry has not treated business very well.
Competition among traditional software vendors often involves wars
to promote one data format or process over another, with the
reasoning that the success of proprietary data formats accelerates
the market share of proprietary applications. Many departments
bought computer systems to serve their particular operational
needs. The accounting department got machines and software that run
the most effective accounting software. The technical support
department got systems that manage incoming calls and problem
resolution. The marketing department often got Macintoshes for the
graphics and layout software.</p><p>These individual packages served each department well enough,
but it's a small leap of business sense to deduce that the real
gains in productivity would come if the various departments could
exchange data. Suppose quality assurance could recognize a defect
trend from the technical-support data and tighten testing, or that
the accounting department could verify purchase orders for raw
materials directly from manufacturing resource-planning systems
which would determine how much of a product to manufacture from
marketing's sales projections. However, when CEOs tried to
implement such interactions, they quickly ran into barriers of
differing data formats, conflicting business rules and physically
disconnected systems. When they went to the vendors of departmental
systems for help, they typically didn't get far. Not only would it
be prohibitively expensive for each vendor to integrate with every
other system out there, but vendors imagined a competitive
advantage to not doing so.</p><p>The furor over software standards is a recent phenomenon.
Historically, software standards have been very slow to emerge,
motivated more by temporary alliances for market share than by any
real desire for interoperability. The typical solution for
interoperability was to buy entirely from one vendor. Manufacturing
companies have very specialized needs for data exchange, so about a
decade ago, a few smart companies started offering manufacturers a
suite of software that handled all aspects of their operations with
the assurance that information would be compatible between
departments. This was the birth of ERP. Since then, pioneers such
as SAP and Baan have grown prodigiously. From roots in
manufacturing, they now sell to almost every major industry. Other
companies, sensing profit, have joined the ranks of ERP vendors:
PeopleSoft from the human resource world, Oracle from the RDBMS
world and JD Edwards from the financial systems and business
services world.</p><p>Now, most Linux users might see all of this as a huge
over-correction: organizations can't get departmental computers to
collaborate, so they scrap them all in favor of supersystems from
single vendors that claim to do all of the organization's data
processing. Linux users are accustomed to standards and a culture
of software collaboration, but these trends are only now slowly
beginning to permeate the rest of the software industry.</p><p>The entire ERP trend does pose some tough questions for Linux
advocates. First of all, Linux's infiltration into enterprise has
often come at the departmental level, usually on departmental web
servers. As more companies adopt ERP systems and insist that
internal and public web content feed into the same enormous data
stream, Linux may be harder to push in the workplace. Also, for
Linux to move from the web server to the application server
environment, it will often need to go head-to-head with an ERP
module&mdash;a battle for which Linux is politically
ill-equipped.</p><p>Linux is just an operating system, and being UNIX-compatible
should theoretically not be far from running ERP systems, which
usually have commercial UNIX ports. Many hints and whispers have
been reported on Slashdot.org and elsewhere that various ERP
vendors have development versions of their server modules running
on Linux. This is to be expected and follows from the interest of
so many DBMS vendors in Linux, but again, it doesn't address an
issue that is of as much importance to the Linux community as the
running platform. The culture of Linux, promoting distributed
systems, narrow scope for applications and standards-driven
collaboration between applications is under stealthy attack by the
ERP approach. This is a very important issue for Linux and
open-systems advocates to address, because ERP vendors are almost
as wealthy and resourceful as Microsoft and just as anxious to
press their proprietary systems. It is in the interest of ERP
vendors to continue making it attractive for customers to buy all
of their major information systems from them. On the other hand,
Linux users typically insist on buying or downloading various
software packages for various purposes and expecting them to work
well together. This conflict is most apparent in small-to-medium
businesses, which are the latest target of ERP vendors, but
probably the most likely to gain from the open and distributed
systems approach. This so-called &ldquo;mid-market&rdquo; is comprised of
companies with $250 million to $500 million (US) in annual
revenues.</p><p>ERP vendors are pushing the myth that an enterprise needs a
massive system running on a tight cluster of machines for effective
computing. The Internet is but one recent development that proves
distributed computing can be just as productive as highly
centralized computing. Departmental systems are increasingly
feasible in the age of Intranets, driven by such interoperability
standards as XML, CORBA and LDAP. Databases are now almost all
reliably SQL, a more recent phenomenon than one might imagine, and
many domain areas are developing forms and process standards for
Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and other initiatives.</p><p>Make no mistake about it; Linux does have some definite
short-comings for enterprise computing. Some are only in
perception, such as the 2GB file-size limit. This, of course,
applies only to 32-bit systems, such as Intel x86 platforms. Major
database vendors already know how to work around this limitation,
but Linux on Intel gets most of the press and many people in a
decision making capacity read pundit columns that complain of the
supposed limitation. Even if one sets miseducation aside, there
also need to be more fundamental processes, standards and drivers
at the system and server-device level for mirroring, redundancy and
fail-over because an enterprise system must be bullet proof, even
by Linux's high standards. Intel's recent attention to Linux
provides a much-needed boost towards addressing such
high-availability issues.</p><p>DBMS vendors are also an important part of this process.
Enterprise computing, whether using single-source ERP or
distributed information systems, is all about data management. DBMS
vendors can take leadership in tweaking Linux into an
&ldquo;enterprise-class&rdquo; operating system. Their researchers can
provide kernel patches, and they have the means and need to test
enormous transaction loads. As a true open-source advocate, I take
a moment to mention PostgreSQL, which is an open-source database.
It still doesn't support some features typical in enterprise-class
systems, but its feature set is tremendously robust, and a good
argument against detractors who like to consider open-source
efforts as good only for hobbyists.</p><p>It is not the specific applications that Linux is lacking. We
don't need a group to get together and write an open-source
resource planning application. What Linux needs is the basic
underpinnings: the infrastructure for such applications. Its
current momentum will surely envelop many vendors of vertical
applications, and such applications better served by the
open-source model will naturally tend in that direction. For
instance, Linux needs attention from developers of middleware and
transaction-processing systems. These systems have been
standardized enough that they could reasonably support open-source
projects, and they are an integral part of the ERP equation.
Another area of importance is business rules.</p><p>One reason ERP installations are so precarious is they
usually involve business-process reengineering. ERP systems are
complex enough as they are. If they had to encompass all the
company rules, policies and customs of every business out there,
their complexity would be practically infinite. Instead, each ERP
vendor has picked its own set of &ldquo;best practices&rdquo;, business rules
which it believes to be most effective and has enshrined these in
its systems. If a company wants to adopt an ERP system, it must
reform its own business processes to those of the ERP system. This
usually involves a major effort in paper shuffling, training and
testing. Many CEOs, who feel their companies have chaotic or
non-existent business logic, seek to implement ERP just for the
reengineering process. In fact, this is often painful and
resource-intensive.</p><p><a href="3178f2.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 2. Linux
ERP System</b></span></a></p><p>If a company has good operational practices, it does not need
to go through the pain of remodeling itself in some other's image.
Very often, a company's unique approach to business is part of its
competitive edge. This is a strong argument for decentralized
computing. If Linux is to use this argument, it will have to
provide a powerful system for managing business rules and
incorporating them into enterprise systems, as described in Figure
2. Note that once broken down to the departmental level, Linux has
the capability and competitiveness to host all of the functions
displayed. What is needed is the applications to fill in the
blanks. The enterprise-class databases are coming, but the
data-exchange management and executive information systems are a
tougher proposition. For vendors to prepare such systems for Linux,
a solid framework for business rules would probably have to be in
place. This may sound easy enough to implement, but in its purest
form, it is one of the holy grails of computer science. Research
efforts ranging from graph theory to artificial intelligence have
sought good ways to enshrine arbitrary business rules (or even just
common-sense rules) into a computing framework. A system that could
handle enterprise-class computing would need the ability to analyze
business objects and apply various operations and constraints on
them, as well as check pre-conditions, post-conditions and
invariants. This is an area where the great problem-solving ability
displayed by distributed developers such as Linux's can make
strides.</p><p>There is no doubt, however, that those of us in the Linux
community face tremendous financial interests in an entrenched
industry if we decide to compete. ERP is a very profitable
business, in contrast to the plummeting margins in shrink-wrap
software. ERP systems are pushed by the companies that write the
software, consulting companies (including the consulting arms of
the big six accounting firms) and hardware/systems interests such
as Hewlett-Packard and IBM (see &ldquo;An Unlikely Ally&rdquo;). These same
companies provide reengineering and customization services. The
frenzied marketplace ensures that consultants can often command
$200 to $300 US per hour. The total cost for ERP installations
ranges from $100,000 for the smallest organizations with the least
reengineering effort required (often called &ldquo;accelerated&rdquo;
implementation) to as high as $500 million for large multinational
firms. Note that I mention customization with regard to the
implementation effort. ERP installations often demand as much
effort in customization as is required to write the information
systems from scratch using off-the shelf DBMS, middleware and
design tools. ERP vendors encourage customers to customize as
little as possible, so as not to break everything when the APIs
change, but the reality is that every business has its quirks which
necessitate customization.</p><p>Much of the recent effort in the Linux world has gone toward
making Linux a feasible desktop replacement. To observers of modern
enterprise-wide computing, this seems almost like misplaced energy.
Intranets and other such developments are slowly turning front ends
into commodities, and the real power is shifting from the client
back to the server, although the server does not have to be as
monolithic as a mainframe. It is important for Linux developers to
turn their attention to the infrastructure which is increasingly
being demanded by enterprise-class computing and the executives who
demand it.</p><p>Many will argue it is not important for Linux to prove itself
in this market, but if you believe in the superiority of
collaborative computing, you should recognize that this ideal has
the potential to be snuffed out by sheer misguided politics and
economics. If we want that server in the corner of the data center
to ever run anything besides Apache and Samba, we might want to
channel some of the boundless Linux energy to the
enterprise.</p><p>Linux users face an interesting dilemma. A sector of the
market that has traditionally neither interested nor challenged us
is beginning to shape trends that could affect the future of
computing, as much from a cultural as from a technological view. To
ensure the encouraging growth of Linux and the associated
improvements in business attitudes toward information technology,
developers would best address some of the needs of enterprise
computing. Commercial developers will certainly fill in the gaps.
Then perhaps the promise offered by the client/server movement,
more flexible and decentralized computing, will stand in a little
less danger from huge, single-source ERP systems.</p><p><a href="3178s1.html" target="_self">An Unlikely Ally</a></p></div></div>
