    Mr. Tharan tells us how to use the PPR spooler for large
    networks.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1125580.0x121d4a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>PPR is a PostScript printer spooler. It
allows users to queue jobs for printing on different PostScript
printers. A single host can be the printing spooler for a whole
department or even a campus. It is well suited for managing a large
number of printers.
</p><p>Its main advantage over traditional printing servers, such as
the System V LP or the Berkeley LPD, is that PPR is able to use
every feature of the PostScript standard or the Adobe Document
Structuring Conventions (DSC).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1125580.0x121d608"></a>PPR Presentation</h2></div></div><p>While many Linux users are pleased with the
<span   class="bold"><b>lpd</b></span> printing daemon, I found it
was not as easy to use when it came to support four TCP/IP HP 5M
PostScript printers with more than 160 Linux, Macintosh and Windows
computers on my LAN (local area network).</p><p>PPR has been designed specifically for the purpose of
operating PostScript printers, accepting jobs from different
systems such as UNIX (remote or local), Windows with Samba or
Macintosh with AppleTalk. PPR can talk to any PostScript printer
connected via a parallel port, a serial port, AppleTalk or TCP/IP.
It can even talk to a remote lpd server. Beginning with version
1.00 (the first public release), PPR includes a GhostScript
interface which enables it to print on every non-PostScript printer
supported by GhostScript. PPR is therefore very well adapted to a
heterogeneous environment.</p><p>PPR was designed with optimizing the use of PostScript and
the Adobe DSC in mind. As such, PPR is able to stop a job if the
printer indicates that the job contains a PostScript error (a queue
listing will show &ldquo;arrested&rdquo; for that job). Many PostScript
interpreters are &ldquo;cool&rdquo; about the errors one can find in
PostScript files, but a program generating PostScript should be
strict. Remember that PostScript is a programming language. What if
<span   class="bold"><b>gcc</b></span> let you forget a semicolon or
undeclared variables?</p><p>Moreover, for printers that support it, PPR is able to
capture the error messages sent by the printer and process them,
sending a notice to the user or the administrator if something went
wrong. After a job has completed, the user can be notified by
various means: a mail message can be sent if he's a UNIX user; a
WinPopup if he used Samba, and so on, so that batch and queue
printing take their true meanings here.</p><p>If a user submits a non-PostScript file to PPR, it converts
the file to PostScript using a set of tools determined at
installation time. For example, a .tex file will be passed through
LaTeX and <span   class="bold"><b>dvips</b></span> if these programs
are available on the system; a .gif file could be passed though the
<span   class="bold"><b>netpbm</b></span> utilities, etc. Then, PPR
hands the converted file to the printer.</p><p>The queue handling is also well done. Any user can hold or
cancel his job once submitted; any administrator (any trusted user
belonging to a certain access list) can hold, release or cancel a
job. Finally, a job can be moved from one printer to another one if
desired.</p><p>PPR has also support for PPD files (PostScript Printer
Description files), which are a convenient way to describe a
printer's capability in just one file. PPR reads a PPD file and
determines automatically what type of paper the printer can handle,
what sort of bins it can use, and so on. PPD files can be
downloaded from Adobe's FTP site, or you can have generally have
them on the drivers' disk shipped with your printer.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1125580.0x121da80"></a>Installation and Configuration</h2></div></div><p>As of January 1999, the latest version of PPR is 1.40a4 and
Linux is the primary development system. Version 1.31 and later are
stable enough to be used in a production system. PPR uses very
little resources other than the spool area, the size of which
depends on how many users print on the site. We used to run PPR on
a Pentium 66 Linux box which was also serving e-mail and Web. We
have moved to a more powerful machine only because we felt it was
better to separate the printing spool from the mail spool.</p><p>You can find the PPR FAQ at
http:tarzan.trincoll.edu/printing/pprfaq.html and all the
documentation at http:mouse.trincoll.edu/ppr/docs/index.html. They
are written in an easy to understand style.</p><p>Installing PPR is easily done by following the steps
described in &ldquo;Installing and Using PPR&rdquo; which is a beginner's
guide to running PPR. Compiling and installing the program in place
is not difficult. If you plan on using AppleTalk with PPR, you will
need AppleTalk support (either from NetaTalk or CAP, depending on
the platform), and a separate library called NATALI (if you use
Netatalk), shipped with PPR.</p><p>Next comes the configuration process. You may need to add a
user and a group to your system files for PPR to work correctly. An
access list system allows the administrator to delegate some
powers; thus, he can assign some trusted users the task of cleaning
up the printers' queues from time to time, without constantly
requiring the administrator's help. There used to be some UNIX
groups to which one had to belong in order to have PPR privileges,
but this has been phased out in favour of the access list
system.</p><p>Every printer on your network must be defined as well as the
interface to use: <span   class="bold"><b>tcpip</b></span> for TCP/IP
or <span   class="bold"><b>atalk</b></span> for AppleTalk. Then set
some configuration variables, such as selecting a PPD file suitable
for the printer or even adding a comment for the current
printer.</p><p>You can even group printers and define groups. Jobs submitted
to a group will go to the first non-idle printer in the group. The
printers can even be rotated: jobs will be submitted in a
round-robin fashion to each printer in a group.</p><p>Next, you can configure your system for different PPR access
methods. With Samba, for example, the program
<span   class="bold"><b>ppr2samba</b></span> is included which
generates a simple file describing all the PPR-defined printers;
include this file in your smb.conf file.</p><p>To add support for your AppleTalk users, you will have to
launch the <span   class="bold"><b>papsrv</b></span> daemon which
lists the printers on the AppleTalk network and handles jobs sent
to PPR. You can even throw away your lpd server and use
<span   class="bold"><b>lprsrv</b></span> to serve lpd jobs the same
way papsrv does for AppleTalk.</p><p>PPR also allows for quota charging on a per-user basis, if
you are concerned about who is doing what or if you simply want to
charge for every sheet of paper coming out of your expensive
printers.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1125580.0x121e000"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>PPR proves to be useful in a wide variety of configurations
and should not be difficult to adapt to your needs. We use it here
on a daily basis with very little maintenance: the main printing
problems come from the printers themselves.</p><p>Many thanks to David Chappell, the author of PPR, who kindly
