reader completely through the procedure of building a web server,
from planning to disaster recovery. The book comes with a CD
containing Linux, Apache and a multitude of scripts and programs.
The copy I received came with Caldera OpenLinux Lite, but I have
seen bookstore copies with Red Hat Linux. This book provides a
reasonable overview of all issues involved with setting up a web
server. It cannot, of course, cover topics in the same level of
detail as books such as O'Reilly's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Apache</em></span>, but
it was not meant to do so.
</p><p>The author assumes the reader has access to a computer, but
does not assume detailed knowledge of Linux, web servers or the
Internet. A novice should be able to use the information in this
book to set up a web server, and an experienced user will also find
information of value.</p><p>The 21 chapters are grouped into four parts: planning,
installation, maintenance and adding advanced features to your web
server.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb6d580.0xc65ce8"></a>Part I: Planning Your Web Site</h2></div></div><p>Chapters 1 and 2 discuss non-technical issues related to
creating a web site for a business and provide some background
technical information for novices. Chapter 3 sells Linux as the
choice platform for a web server, followed by a discussion of UNIX
and Internet terminology in Chapter 4. Part I can be skimmed (or
skipped) by more advanced users.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb6d580.0xc65df0"></a>Part II: Installing Your Web Server</h2></div></div><p>Chapter 5 reviews hardware requirements, then takes the
reader through the steps of installing Linux. As I had no need to
install an older version of Linux, I did not install anything from
the CD. The book is not a replacement for a detailed installation
guide, but does provide sufficient information so that a novice can
install the software. While sparse (nine pages), the section on
configuring XFree86 is quite well-written and should get most
people through the &ldquo;fun&rdquo; of creating an XF86Config file. However,
it does not provide a troubleshooting guide, so users with
non-standard or &ldquo;problem&rdquo; hardware will need to read the HOWTOs
and Release Notes. One important item missing is a warning that
probing the video hardware may hang the computer. Novices need to
know this, especially after learning that driving the monitor at
too high a frequency can damage it. A brief discussion on network
configuration follows.</p><p>Chapter 6 takes the user through installation and setup of
both Apache and Netscape FastTrack web servers. FastTrack is a
commercial product not included on the CD. Finally, Chapter 7
builds on the basic terminology of Chapter 3 and looks at
connecting to the Internet in more detail. Over 90 pages cover
everything from &ldquo;what being connected means&rdquo; to setting up DNS.
The emphasis is on the requirements and available options for
setting up a commercial web server.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb6d580.0xc65f50"></a>Part III: Maintaining Your Site from Day to
Day</h2></div></div><p>Business issues such as advertising, search engines and
gathering data are discussed briefly in Chapter 8; readers setting
up personal web sites can skip it. Basic HTML is covered in Chapter
9, but not in any great depth. URLs are provided for HTML authoring
tools and other information, but enough detail exists to allow a
novice to create basic pages with tables, links and graphics. This
information is expanded in Chapter 10 to include web site scripts
and forms.</p><p>The rest of Part III (Chapters 11 to 14) covers configuration
of the web server, additional services and collecting statistics.
Chapter 11 is specific to Apache and provides a thorough overview,
but the material is rather dated. (Apache v1.1.1 is included on the
CD.) If you intend to set up a web server, I advise purchasing the
O'Reilly book on Apache and visiting these web sites:
http://www.apache.org/ and http:/www.apacheweek.com/.</p><p>As most people seem to be using Apache, I skipped Chapter 12
which describes configuring Netscape's Fastrack server. Chapter 13
discusses the pros and cons of web site statistics and provides
URLs for web server statistical tools. Finally, Chapter 14 covers
additional services such as FTP, e-mail, gopher and WAIS.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb6d580.0xc66108"></a>Part IV: Adding Advanced Features</h2></div></div><p>A very brief (eight page) introduction to Java and JavaScript
is given in Chapter 15. Version 1.0.2 of the JDK is provided on the
CD, but a list of related web sites would have been helpful as
well. Those interested in Java and/or JavaScript will want to look
for books on those specific topics. Almost as brief, but more
detailed, Chapter 16 discusses gateways (such as e-mail and
database) and provides lists of sites for gateway software. The
novice will be able to learn enough about gateways to understand
what they do and whether one is required. The next chapter gives a
quick overview of application programming interfaces (API) for
Fastrack and Apache. APIs allow the user to extend the capabilities
of the server. More detailed documentation will be required by
those wishing to actually do this.</p><p>Chapter 18 concerns the all-important issue of security. It
begins with a summary of types of attacks, both generic and
web-specific. A checklist of tests to try and files to check gives
the novice a good starting point for reviewing site security. This
is followed by a brief discussion on firewalls. The reader is then
pointed to an on-line firewall FAQ and http://www.yahoo.com to
search for more information.</p><p>The remaining chapters deal with issues of web maintenance,
backup and Linux package upgrading. Chapter 19 includes a list of
HTML validation tools and recommends HTML Analyzer for automated
checking of your web site files. The book finishes with a
description of the CD-ROM files in Appendix A.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb6d580.0xc662c0"></a>CD-ROM</h2></div></div><p>The CD included with my copy of the book contained complete,
but somewhat dated, software. For example, it installs kernel
v2.0.29, Apache v1.1.1 and v1.0.2 of the Java Development Kit.
However, this book is hardly unique in this respect&mdash;users will
generally buy or download the latest releases elsewhere. The
important issue is the CD provides all the software necessary to
install and set up an Apache server on a Linux
2.0.<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> kernel. Some additional tools are
included on the CD including (much to my surprise) Xemacs. I would
like to see Xemacs included on more CD sets.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb6d580.0xc66420"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>The book provides a reasonable overview of the issues and
mechanics relating to implementing a web server. The target
audience is beginner to intermediate-level users. If you are
computer literate but a web novice, this book contains sufficient
detail to enable you to set up a web server. The depth is such that
more advanced people will also find the book useful, but it will
not make someone an expert on Apache or Java. Throughout the book,
URLs are provided so the reader can obtain more information,
documentation or software related to the specific topics being
discussed. This is especially useful given how quickly a printed
book can become dated. If you're interested in what is involved in
setting up a commercial web site, this book is a very good place to
start.</p></div></div>
