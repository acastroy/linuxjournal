and development version of Motif 1.2, 2.0 and 2.1 for Linux x86 and
Linux on Alpha. It includes a bonus suite of Motif widgets for x86.
</p><p>To install the software, you need either an x86 Linux machine
or an Alpha Linux machine with 8MB to 16MB or more of main memory
and between 14MB (for runtime-only) and 80MB (full installation
with all options) of disk space. Both libc5 and glibc versions for
x86 are available, and the manual is very specific, not only on
what levels of other software you need, but also which commands you
use to find out.</p><p>I received one CD-ROM and a draft copy of the manual. The
product certainly didn't suffer from being a pre-production
version, with no glaring errors in the rather nice manual. The
<span   class="emphasis"><em>User's Guide</em></span> primarily covers the installation
and configuring of the runtime environment (MWM, etc). If you want
to do development, you will need to either find documentation
elsewhere or be content with what's on the CD.</p><p>The installation was done on an Alpha station running Debian
2.0 and a Pentium running Caldera OpenLinux 1.2. The installation
on the Alpha went smoothly, with only the text stopping in
mid-sentence in a dialogue box causing any disturbance. The x86
installation went reasonably well also. Metro provides an
easy-to-use GUI installation program, as well as instructions for
doing it on your own. They provide both RPMs and tar archives; I
chose the RPMs. The GUI leads you through the questions on which
versions you want to install, selects the appropriate RPMs and
installs them. Metro runs the RPMs in a text widget which allows
them to display the output text from the RPM. In my case, I had two
package conflicts, xbmbrowser-5.1-1 and Pixmap-2.6-1. These caused
an RPM to fail to install; however, the GUI doesn't scan the
displayed text for errors, so when you move to the next screen,
nothing tells you the installation has failed. I think this is a
flaw in an otherwise great installation, and Metro Link should have
the GUI clearly display whether the installation was successful on
completion.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3211f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div><p>On the x86 system, all of the runtime elements worked,
including MWM (Motif Window Manager) fpanel (like the CDE, common
desktop environment, panel) and the Motif version of an xterm. (See
Figure 1.) They didn't run very well, however; X took around 45% of
the CPU and fpanel 52% while maintaining a load average of just
under two on an otherwise idle machine. Also, fpanel and MWM both
require editing text files to configure them. With KDE and GNOME
making big efforts to provide GUI administration tools for the
desktop, this feature is unlikely to find favour. On the other
hand, this package is unlikely to be attractive to someone who just
wants a CDE-like environment. On the Alpha, MWM and fpanel ran
fine, but the Motif xterm wouldn't run, as Debian didn't have a
libncurses. After linking /lib/libncurses.so.4.2 to
/lib/libtermcap.so.2, it ran fine.</p><p>The demo programs, stored in the /usr/src/motif directory,
built and ran fine on both platforms, as did xmcd.</p><p>The software comes with a bonus package from the KL Group
Inc., for x86 and Motif 2.1 only, a complete and fully functional
but unsupported version of the XRT Professional Developer's Suite
family of Motif widgets. This requires an additional 50MB of disk
space.</p><p>The package comes with a whole swag of PostScript
documentation on disk, with most of the OSF documentation included
for each level of Motif. For 1.2, they include:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>programGuide: OSF/Motif Programmer's Guide</p></li><li><p>programRef: OSF/Motif Programmer's Reference (man
pages)</p></li><li><p>releaseNotes: OSF/Motif Release Notes
(excerpts)</p></li><li><p>styleGuide: OSF/Motif Style Guide</p></li><li><p>usersGuide: OSF/Motif User's Guide</p></li></ul></div><p>Version 2.0 and 2.1 also have the widgetGuide: OSF/Motif
Widget Writer's Guide. Also provided on the CD-ROM are the User's
Guide and the Alpha and x86 READMEs (formatted release notes), all
in PostScript format.
</p><p>Metro Link <span   class="emphasis"><em>Complete!</em></span> is an excellent
package for anyone developing in Motif on Linux. The quality of the
package is high, and I'm confident the few rough edges are due to
the pre-release version I received for review.</p><p>My thanks to Martin Lucina for running this on his
AlphaStation.</p></div></div>
