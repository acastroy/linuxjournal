    A look at the business models in use today and how they
    work.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13f7580.0x14ef500"></a></h2></div></div><p>Open Source is software which has been
freed. It allows bits to be copied and reused endlessly. It allows
inspection of the source code. It allows new innovations to be
built upon old, without having to duplicate past efforts. It is
free software with the emphasis on freedom.
</p><p>This past year has seen an explosive rise in visibility for
this curious market. The computer world at large has gained at
least a limited understanding and respect for its workings. Much of
this attention would have been unimaginable even a year or two
ago.</p><p>During this time, Open Source has been put under heavy
scrutiny. While certain technical benefits are undeniable, every
analysis invariably confronts two simple, critical questions: &ldquo;How
does one make a living on free software?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Who is motivated
to innovate?&rdquo;</p><p>The strength of the answers to these questions will determine
if Open Source will achieve its full potential for the greatest
possible audience. It must be economically viable.</p><p>I will attempt to answer these two questions by surveying the
field of current business models and analyzing their financial
strength. I will also speculate on future innovations that may
alter these dynamics.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13f7580.0x14ef768"></a>Business Models</h2></div></div><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Money rests on the axiom that every man is the
owner of his mind and his effort ... Money permits you to obtain
for your goods and your labor that which they are worth, but not
more ... Money is your means of survival.
</p><p>&mdash;Ayn Rand, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Atlas Shrugged</em></span></p></blockquote></div><p>The obvious challenge of Open Source is that it may be copied
freely, even if purchased initially. So a $10 Linux disc may
legally be used to install one machine or a thousand machines. At
first glance, it would seem no incentive exists to put effort into
improving such a product. Because of this characteristic, Open
Source is often equated with a kind of communism: a system that
offers something for nothing and exploits the labor of others
without rewarding them; in short, a system that is unsustainable
because it causes people's self-interest to conflict with the
greater good.
</p><p>These concerns should not be dismissed out of hand, nor taken
as factual. The truth is much more complicated. Central to these
concerns is the lack of exclusive copyright protections. Copyright
and patent laws are not inherently part of the free market; they
are intended to create limited monopolies for the companies which
own the rights. This is done to reward research and to encourage
innovation.</p><p>Open Source is a voluntary system that waives exclusive
ownership of software in exchange for other benefits. These
benefits include wider adoption, faster collective innovation and a
level competitive playing field. This makes for a frictionless,
dynamic and highly competitive market without the very profitable
&ldquo;vendor lock-in&rdquo; that is facilitated by traditional copyrighted
software.</p><p>Despite the resulting competitiveness, several business
models have proven to be profitable. These models leverage the
unique new possibilities afforded by Open Source, in return for
their sacrifice of certain copyrights.</p><p>What is still unclear is how these models will generate as
much innovation and value as traditional software companies, given
the handicap that a person's work can benefit his competition as
much as it benefits himself. As we'll see, one of the surprising
things about free software is where the innovations have
originated.</p><p>In the following sections, I'll introduce the markets that
are producing innovation and jobs today. These are the research,
service and customization economies and the many business models
that fall into these groups. Nearly all companies are hybrids of
several different business models.</p><p><a href="3318t1.html" target="_self">Table 1.</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13f7580.0x14efc38"></a>The Research Economy</h2></div></div><p>Open-source corporations are important growth engines, but to
date, they have built mostly upon the efforts of others. The
bedrock of the market is the thousands of individual students and
moonlighting professionals who make small and large contributions
every day.</p><p>These developers are not paid for their efforts. They begin a
project with no promises or commitments. They work at their own
pace, use their own judgment and set their own priorities. They are
the university researchers and basement scientists of software,
working together to make their contribution to the world.</p><p>Often, these developers are only learning or honing their
craft, so many projects fail. Yet out of this soup of individual
and group efforts rises some of the best software available
today.</p><p>Through the Internet, these successful efforts can be
instantly copied and put into use world-wide. They can be enhanced
and customized by thousands of others. They can continue to evolve
like an organism, adapting to new software and hardware
architectures as the years go on.</p><p>The first and most unshakable answer to &ldquo;Who will
innovate?&rdquo; is the students and moonlighters, motivated by their
desire to learn and create and inspired by the energy and clarity
of tackling new problems. The profit-oriented market may fail, but
these software research activities will go on. Slowly, surely, they
will continue to add to the body of free software available to the
world.</p><p>Yet despite the best efforts of the students and
moonlighters, their software has common flaws. Development goals
are driven by the author's own needs, resulting in software &ldquo;by
developers, for developers&rdquo;. The threshold at which a developer is
satisfied with ease of use is much lower than for typical users.
These are truly research projects, with all the beauties and warts
that implies.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13f7580.0x14efef8"></a>The Service Economy</h2></div></div><p>In the cases where beauty has outweighed warts, a critical
mass of technical and non-technical users has been built. Apache,
Linux, Perl and many other programs have made this breakthrough to
mass market utility. This expanded base of consumers has driven the
need for many support services built around the software. These
services add polish and value to the base provided by the initial
project.</p><p>No one is required to pay for any services. Given only a Net
connection, they can download what they need and figure everything
out themselves. However, many consumers find their time more
valuable and therefore seek services to make their lives easier.
This is where &ldquo;commercial&rdquo; Open Source steps in to distribute the
software, provide technical support and educate users.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Distribution</b></span></p><p>The Internet is great for downloading small software, but for
larger products it is too slow. Also, finding the software you want
among the jungle of projects on the Web can be difficult.</p><p>From this need rose companies like Red Hat, Caldera, SuSE,
and Walnut Creek. On one convenient CD-ROM, you have an organized
collection of the best available software applications. These
companies are achieving significant revenue and earnings with these
services.</p><p>Opportunities exist for further specialization. LinuxPPC has
made a solid business out of focusing on the PowerPC market. A
small company could take this further by taking one of the most
popular (Dell, Linux, eMachines) PCs and producing a distribution
that is tailored and tuned to that hardware. It could guarantee
that all devices are recognized and install flawlessly. It could
optimize every program to the particular processor used on that
machine. You could imagine Intel co-marketing and co-developing
with a software company to optimize for their latest chips.</p><p>Open Source can be a key in the drive towards mass
specialization of computer products and services. As the overall
size of the market increases, more opportunities will be created in
these small niches and sub-niches. All of this is made possible by
the full access to source code that free software provides.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Technical Support</b></span></p><p>When a single company owns exclusive rights to a software
product, it is obvious where the most informed technical support
comes from: if you buy a Microsoft product, you go to Microsoft for
technical support.</p><p>The fact that Open Source does not have an exclusive support
provider has repeatedly been portrayed as a weakness. This is a
fundamentally flawed notion. Rather, Open Source allows a whole
market of support providers to compete on a level playing field of
equal access to the code.</p><p>Through this heightened competition, the level and quality of
support is capable of rising above the best standards of today's
closed software market.</p><p>Red Hat, LinuxCare and many other companies and individual
consultants have stepped up to serve this market. Early in 1999,
IBM recognized these extraordinary opportunities and announced
Linux support and consulting services. The competition between
these companies will become intense, and customers will be
well-served.</p><p>If open-source support services can achieve their full
potential, it will become a major selling point for corporate users
and consumers. Innovations in providing these services will provide
the foundation for many viable new businesses.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Education</b></span></p><p>O'Reilly &amp; Associates has built a booming book publishing
business which topped $40 million in 1998. More than half of this
revenue was from books about free software topics.</p><p>As the market grows in size, more educational services will
be needed. These are significant opportunities, since any educator,
author or consultant can delve into the inner workings of the code
to produce definitive training materials for a subject. By working
on and teaching about specific areas, a valuable reputation can be
created. (See Table 2, Linux Consultant Survey.) Several of the
most successful consultants built their businesses by being a
recognized world-wide expert in a particular technology.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13f7580.0x14f0630"></a>The Customization Economy</h2></div></div><p>The next step beyond servicing existing software is the
creation of new applications to solve outstanding problems. This
may be in the form of hardware devices that come preconfigured for
a particular need. Or it may be through employees or consultants
who configure and enhance software for particular needs.</p><p>In a world dominated by a single vendor, there are limits to
the innovations a new product can provide because of high prices,
too few features, too many features, logo requirements, etc. Many
interesting new applications are suddenly possible when these
shackles are removed. You just need freedom to customize.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Hardware Bundles</b></span></p><p>Hardware preloads and bundles are some of the most compelling
uses of free software, because the cost of developing or enhancing
free software for the machine can be included in the price of the
hardware.</p><p>One example is the Cobalt Qube (http://www.cobaltnet.com/).
This is a space-age blue 18.4x18.4x19.7cm server appliance running
Linux on a RISC processor. It is a general purpose workgroup server
for e-mail, Web, etc. Having full access to the Linux source code
gave Cobalt the capability to fully customize the software for this
uniquely simple but very powerful hardware platform. (See &ldquo;Cobalt
Qube Microserver&rdquo; by Ralph Sims, October 1998.)</p><p>Another is the Snap! network storage server from Meridian
Data (http://www.meridian-data.com/). It's a fixed-function server
appliance that shares disk space on the network. It is built from
custom hardware combined with open-source software. Consumers don't
need to know it uses free software; they just need to know what it
does. Customers expect the price of network storage to scale with
the price of disk storage, so the hardware and software costs of
using a proprietary software system could have greatly reduced the
attractiveness of the product.</p><p>Obviously, one big advantage is having no per-device software
royalty. This is particularly true for price-sensitive, high-volume
products. In a few years, we may find dozens of companies embedding
open-source operating systems and applications on millions of
small, fixed-function hardware devices.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>IT Professionals</b></span></p><p>Beyond hardware devices, there is a need to customize and
adapt software applications to the exact business processes and
needs of an organization.</p><p>This always requires some custom work. Most medium and large
organizations have a crew of IT professionals whose job is to
customize hardware and software to make the business run more
smoothly. These professionals like to start with the most
functional products possible and customize from there. This has
meant proprietary software in most cases.</p><p>Recently, open-source software has achieved levels of
functionality that match proprietary software in many cases and has
the advantage of not being tied to one vendor for support or
product updates.</p><p>Rather quickly, it may become cost-effective to customize
free software, rather than pay for thousands of licenses of
commercial software on which to build. This shift in the market
will require a growing number of professionals who specialize in
open-source software.</p><p>This is perhaps best reflected in the salaries of IT
Professionals. A 1998 salary survey of 7189 professionals asked
which operating system they primarily used. Of those who reported
Linux as their primary OS, their salary was $61,027 US vs. an
overall average of $60,991. Linux salaries had increased 16.5% from
the previous year, representing the fastest salary increase of any
system (source: Sans Institute).</p><p>In-house staff is not the only option. Again, because of the
freedom to inspect and study the software down to the lowest
levels, a competitive industry is able to grow to serve whatever
needs arise. The resulting alternative to in-house staff is a
competitive market of independent consultants.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Consultants</b></span></p><p>When the cost of the software goes to zero, the value is in
customizing for specific problems. Consultants already make their
living providing these per-hour or per-project services. Open
Source is not a sacrifice; it is an opportunity.</p><p>One example is comprehensive support. Most business want a
single point of contact to take full responsibility for getting a
project done. With closed source, contractors are at the mercy of
bugs and limitations in the operating systems and applications they
purchase. In effect, they cannot guarantee success. They do not
have full control of the technology.</p><p>With Open Source, they have complete access to solve every
problem, no matter what level or layer it occurs in. A small
company with a skilled force of engineers can provide a level of
comprehensive application-to-operating system service that only IBM
or HP or Sun can provide today, and probably at much lower
prices.</p><p>To get an understanding of the size and health of the Open
Source consulting market, those registered in the Linux Consultants
HOWTO were surveyed. They were asked the following
questions:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>How many consultants at your company are involved
with Open Source work?</p></li><li><p>Approximately how much money did your company (or
yourself, if independent) earn in 1998 on Open Source-related work?
(Convert to US dollars)</p></li><li><p>In 1999, based on numbers from recent months, how
much do you expect this to increase/decrease? (as a
percentage)</p></li><li><p>In 1999, do you believe it is possible to make a
living doing Open Source consulting work? (yes/no)</p></li></ol></div><p>This is a very diverse group of VARs, integrators and
consultants. Over 50% are from outside the U.S., where the cost of
living may sometimes be lower. In most cases, open-source work is
just a piece of the total business. While this is certainly not a
scientifically rigorous study, it does give some flavor of the
market.
</p><p><a href="3318t2.html" target="_self">Table 2.</a></p><p>A key point from the survey is the importance of being a
&ldquo;jack of all trades.&rdquo; You must focus on serving the needs of the
customer, including doing work on closed source. In 1998, the
median earnings per consultant on Open Source alone were not enough
to make a living, and only 12.7% of the consultants made more than
the $61,027 salary of IT professionals mentioned above. Business
has picked up dramatically in recent months, however. As a whole,
the consultants were very bullish on the coming year.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3318f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Survey: Distribution of Earnings
</p></div></div><p>In the previous sections, we've covered the current business
models that provide a living for employees, and innovations for
consumers. There are certainly strengths, but the market is still
tiny compared to traditional shrink-wrapped software. Young
companies with new ideas are needed in order to grow the
market.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13f7580.0x14e7d88"></a>Funding New Companies</h2></div></div><p>Capital is the fuel for companies that will serve any new
market. This money may come from the on-going operations of the
business or from banks or investors. What is the current
environment for getting this funding?</p><p>Venture capitalists, the investment partnerships that fund
high-risk/high-return companies, are skeptical so far. Their
analysis of these opportunities keeps coming back to a critical
point: Open Source, by definition, eliminates the barriers of entry
to a market. How can a company build a sustainable market advantage
if their work can immediately be used by a competitor?</p><p><a href="3318t3.html" target="_self">Table 3.</a></p><p>Given this limit on the upside, only a limited number of
open-source companies have received funding. These companies have
identified key factors to protect them from competitors. For Red
Hat, it is a strong brand. For Sendmail, it is having an
open/closed mix in their software product line. For a company like
Cobalt Networks, it is combining closed hardware with open
software. As this market matures, more companies may achieve
profitability and attract investment dollars for everyone.</p><p>Until then, companies must bootstrap themselves. Ironically,
this is feasible because of those same low barriers to entry that
scare off investors. An open-source company can build on the past
efforts of others, meaning less capital is required to start the
company.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13f7580.0x14e8048"></a>Problems to be Solved</h2></div></div><p>In summary, what are the problems that companies must solve
in order to grow the market in new directions?</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The financial motivation for innovation must be
stronger. Most of the current successful business models other than
consultants make money off &ldquo;secondary&rdquo; services, rather than the
software development itself.</p></li><li><p>Open Source is still largely &ldquo;by developers, for
developers&rdquo;. To achieve mass market success, it must become more
customer-driven and consumer-friendly.</p></li></ul></div><p>Traditional software products harness the free market to
solve these issues. Consumers pay to buy a software product if it
meets their needs, which means it must be very polished. Successful
products are profitable for the companies that create them.
Unsuccessful products die off. Through these mechanisms, good
developers make a living and consumers get good choices.
</p><p>Open Source needs to create systems to provide these consumer
checks and balances.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13f7580.0x14e83b8"></a>The Search for Solutions</h2></div></div><p>The business models described throughout this article are by
no means a comprehensive list. This is a young market we are only
beginning to understand. It could yet defy the skeptics and evolve
into something that serves customers better and is financially
strong.</p><p>Part two of this series will explore one particular
possibility in this universe of interesting but unproven ideas&mdash;a
consumer co-op for software contracts. It uses the Web to let
consumers commit funds up front to pay for the development of
specific applications, feature enhancements or bug fixes critical
to them. Resources are pooled, so each person pays only a small
portion of the total cost. It is a system compatible with, and
tailored to, Open Source. I will analyze this idea in detail,
describe an attempt to create a web service which provides the
necessary mechanisms and speculate how this system might affect the
progress of the open-source market.</p><p>With this idea and many others, the open-source market is a
fascinating mix of possibilities and dangers. In recent years, it
has grown from thousands to millions of users. Several profitable
companies are now serving the needs of these consumers.</p><p>The next few years will certainly see continued innovation
from the open-source research community. From the business side, it
remains to be seen whether the current momentum will continue or be
struck down by market realities. It may very well depend on the
innovations created by the upcoming generation of open-source
entrepreneurs. It's a free market. May the best products
win.</p></div></div>
