    How a K-12 school system is using Linux to supply a myriad
    of stable network services to its students and staff.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d4a580.0x1e422f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>The Millbury Public Schools make up a
small school district of just over 1800 students, located in the
heart of Massachusetts. We provide state-of-the-art computing
services to our staff and students as a tool for learning and
research. Linux holds a distinguished position on our network and
supplies many of the network services required by our users. I hope
this article will persuade educators to think of Linux as a viable
and even preferred alternative to conventionally marketed products.
</p><p>Like most public school districts, our computer technology
was exclusively Macintosh-based and required a lot of effort and
attention to keep it working and usable. After some lobbying on my
part, an endeavor was made to bring our technology resources in
line with what was in use in the &ldquo;real world&rdquo;. The argument I
used was not that it was a nightmare supporting a hundred
Macintoshes (it was), but that as an educational system we should
be educating our students on computer systems they would be more
likely to find in the college and business world. The fact that
Apple Computer has been floundering in the marketplace didn't hurt
my argument.</p><p>Coinciding with our migration to an Intel platform was the
availability of a generous grant made by the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts, specifically earmarked toward networking the state's
school systems. This allowed us to set up a district-wide network
and network services that rival those of many businesses. Between
the state's grant and our supportive school committee, which
approved our budget for new PCs, we had sufficient funds to do the
job right.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d4a580.0x1e424a8"></a>The Details</h2></div></div><p>Our network is arranged into 10Base-T workgroups tied into a
central Ethernet switch (collapsed backbone configuration). This
switch is segmented into two networks&mdash;administrative and
student&mdash;providing our first level of network security. The servers
are connected via 100Base-T to the switch. This arrangement allows
us to share network resources without sharing bandwidth. The
central switch creates a smaller collision domain for each
workgroup and keeps traffic on the backbone to a minimum.</p><p>The client machines, which run Windows 95, are Pentium 166MHz
clones with 32MB RAM and 2GB of disk space. We also have a number
of Power Macintoshes remaining in some of our labs. Our three
servers consist of Pentium Pro 200MHz with 128MB RAM and 4GB of
SCSI disk space (soon to be 9+GB). One of these servers is a
Windows NT machine used for applications serving and the other two
are Red Hat Linux-driven for everything else.</p><p>The two Linux servers are set up to supply file and Internet
services to our district. Our first box
(http:www.millbury.k12.ma.us/) is set up as our WWW, FTP, e-mail
and DNS server and resides on the DMZ of our Sonic Interpol
firewall that is in turn connected to an ISDN router. This
firewall/router combination would also have been Linux except for
the fact that the Sonic Interpol offers content filtering. This
helps us protect students from inappropriate web sites on the
Internet&mdash;an essential device when many curious kids are
around.</p><p>The second Linux box, located behind the firewall, was just
recently &ldquo;saved&rdquo; from being an NT machine and operates as a
proxy/cache server, intranet server, file server and has a number
of other small duties. Luckily, NT was so disappointing in
performance and rather unstable that it was &ldquo;born again&rdquo; as a
Linux server. I have not regretted it.</p><p>Since both servers run Samba, I can map drives on the Win95
clients so that the transfer of files to our web site is a breeze.
File sharing is also handled this way. Few users actually realize
they are saving to a network drive, due to the speed of the
transfer.</p><p>As we still have a few remaining Macintoshes on our network,
we could supply AppleTalk services with Linux. We do not at this
time, because these Macintoshes are located in the lower grade
levels and our youngest students do not need most network services.
It would be very easy to set up if it became necessary. Many of our
network services are platform independent.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d4a580.0x1e42768"></a>The Results</h2></div></div><p>Linux running the Squid proxy server (http:squid.nlanr.net/)
has increased the perceived bandwidth of our ISDN by a huge amount.
It is also considerably faster than when it was running NT and
Netscape's Proxy Server. Approximately 50-60% of all our web page
requests are serviced by our in-house proxy server. The increase in
speed resulting in pages coming through from the proxy at Ethernet
speed rather than from the web site at Internet speed has simply
delighted my users. I've found that this service has made the
biggest difference on our network. I almost never hear a complaint
about the Internet being slow.</p><p>Samba (http:samba.anu.edu.au/samba/) is a terrific program,
and once you get used to setting up its configuration file, it is a
charm to use. Setting up users in Linux is more desirable for me
than it is with NT. That, coupled with the lack of additional costs
for NT client licenses, makes Linux all the more attractive. This
cost savings is enough to help pay for staff training in beginning
UNIX system administration.</p><p>This brings me to another point. Nearly all schools operate
under tight fiscal constraints. Linux offers a way to develop
technology without dipping too deeply into the shallow school
budget. Linux even recycles older hardware that can be obtained
through donations from local companies.</p><p>A side effect of all this Linux use is a number of students
have actually become interested in Linux and are setting up their
own boxes at home. One of our technology specialists (a former
Macintosh user) has also fallen in love with the command line after
seeing me use the power of TELNET to add users, check my e-mail and
reconfigure something on the box.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d4a580.0x1e42978"></a>The Future</h2></div></div><p>Now that I have firmly entrenched Linux into our network, I
plan on further purges of Windows NT from our domain. We will be
purchasing additional servers for our workgroups and offices next
year, and where application servers are not required, Linux will be
installed.</p><p>I also hope to recruit more students and introduce them to
Linux. Enlisting a new generation of Linux enthusiasts will only
help drive Linux more firmly into the future.</p><p>I am very grateful to the whole Linux community for their
excellent software. A big thank you is also sent to the Samba team
for their labor in helping me rid our computers of NT wherever
possible. I would also like to applaud the Squid developers for a
top-notch product.</p><p>I would like to hear from anyone who has ideas on how to make
Linux even more attractive and useful in a school environment. I
would also be happy to share my experiences with anyone thinking of
implementing Linux in their school.</p><p><a href="2955s1.html" target="_self">Help carry the Linux
