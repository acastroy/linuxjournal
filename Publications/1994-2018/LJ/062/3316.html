workstations can now find almost everything they need in one place
and no longer have to rifle through mounds of books and technical
articles in numerous magazines. <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Linux
Network</em></span> is chock full of networking gems that reflect
decades of experience and significantly ease the task of creating a
Linux-based network.
</p><p>This book is a &ldquo;primer&rdquo; for individuals or smaller offices
and organizations that typically cannot afford solutions offered by
consultants and proprietary off-the-shelf UNIX servers. Readers
should be aware that the book is specialized for networking, so it
covers only adding or modifying networking options to Linux,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> basic installation of the Linux operating
system and kernel. The book includes Slackware version 3.5 based on
Linux kernel release 2.0.29, and as such, does not discuss
configuration of other distributions such as Red Hat, Caldera, SuSE
or Debian. Of course, other than a few minor exceptions, the
underlying technologies are extremely similar and the discussions
pertain to most Linux distributions.</p><p>The authors provide detailed instructions on how to implement
typical server functions such as FTP, TELNET, e-mail, news, NFS and
SMB file sharing, web server and browsers, proxy server,
&ldquo;gateway&rdquo; router and DNS. They also include some cool tools, such
as details on how to connect to 3Com's 56Kbps telephone line test
system, how to optimize Linux networking for security, how to
effectively use the syslog daemon and other network debugging
tools, and how to configure the point-to-point protocol (PPP)
daemon and dial daemon for &ldquo;dial-on-demand&rdquo; connections to the
Internet. They include a comprehensive networking primer and share
many networking jewels, such as the limitations of the
<span   class="bold"><b>ping</b></span> tool, the differences between
IP masquerading and SOCKS, and scalability estimates in terms of
users and available network bandwidth. One thing they do much
better than many Linux books is include information on how to
configure networking to meet the needs of several different
real-world examples. They also show <span   class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span> of the
Slackware networking configuration options with detailed
descriptions of each choice, whereas most writers include only
those items on the &ldquo;typical&rdquo; installation decision tree, often
without any useful description of the options.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>The Linux Network</em></span> provides almost all of
the tools needed for an administrator to create a networked Linux
workstation, workgroup server, or gateway in either an intranet or
Internet environment. I say <span   class="emphasis"><em>almost</em></span> because it
lacks a few small items, such as detailed alternatives to UUCP mail
service, how to configure Linux and Windows to provide an RS-232
serial port &ldquo;terminal&rdquo; connection to a Linux server, how to
configure a Linux server to allow dial-in modem connections for
remote users, and details on how to implement a Linux DHCP (dynamic
IP allocation) and news server. The latter two items were deemed to
be outside the scope of the book. UUCP is quite limiting, and many
small businesses may have application needs which require remote
dial-in, or call for a simpler &ldquo;network&rdquo; of Windows-based text
terminals connecting to a Linux server, either through a serial
port or a multiport serial card.</p><p>The writing style in <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Linux Network</em></span>
is straightforward and not overly cute, unlike some contemporary
technical writing (with the minor exception of the use of the
pronoun <span   class="emphasis"><em>she</em></span> exclusively to denote
<span   class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span> users and administrators in the book,
taking a needlessly political stand on a moot issue while
simultaneously abandoning centuries of practical English language
custom). The authors include pertinent, useful and interesting
details and elaboration where appropriate. Information is nicely
organized in a logical manner, usually as a series of steps which
show how to install, configure, activate, test and debug networking
software and tools.</p><p>Emphasis on heterogeneous networking solutions using Linux
and Windows is adequate, especially where it involves file and
printer sharing. However, coverage of Windows e-mail and
newsreaders is somewhat out-of-date and limited to Microsoft
Exchange client software. Administrators of Linux networks that
include some Windows desktops in the mix should give serious
consideration to using Microsoft Outlook Express, which receives no
coverage in this book. As with most Linux books, unfortunately,
this one has the usual smattering of Windows-bashing. There seems
to be an overall bias towards the Netscape Internet suite (mail,
news readers and web publishing tools) over Microsoft's (Explorer,
Outlook Express, FrontPage Express), which does make some sense for
companies with both Linux and Windows desktops that want to
standardize applications across both platforms. There also seems to
be a preference for Linux across the enterprise, to include Linux
workstations rather than the more likely Windows desktops.</p><p>The book emphasizes using the Linux server to handle both
local <span   class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span> Internet mail services, primarily
through UUCP connections, which the authors admit is generally
either prohibitively expensive or not available in the
administrator's area. For a typical small office sharing a
dial-on-demand Linux Internet gateway among half a dozen or so
machines and users, a more affordable and graceful solution might
be to use individual Internet e-mail accounts through an Internet
Service Provider, and local Intranet e-mail accounts on the Linux
server (a solution for which Outlook Express excels).</p><p>All in all, <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Linux Network</em></span> is a very
useful book for any administrator who has Linux up and running on a
PC, but is considering the benefits of networking Linux with other
PCs and possibly the Internet. For those people who do not already
have Linux installed, this book should be combined with a good
general purpose Linux book containing detailed basic installation
and configuration instructions. Many people run Microsoft Windows
(Workgroups, 95 or 98) on desktop PCs and want to integrate them
with a Linux workstation or two, or use a Linux server as an
affordable, efficient, &ldquo;open&rdquo; alternative to an expensive,
proprietary NT server. Those people should supplement this book
with a good basic Windows TCP/IP networking book. Actually,
Microsoft's Internet site active server pages and application
wizards make it fairly simple to download, install, configure and
use Microsoft's suite of Internet tools.</p></div></div>
