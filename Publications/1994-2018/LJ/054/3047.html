    Implementing a software location system as a Linux embedded
    application results in a robust, efficient and inexpensive
    system.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x134d580.0x14458c8"></a></h2></div></div><p>An increased interest in location-aware
computer systems has occurred recently. This class of computer
systems is able to react to location changes of people, equipment
or resources. These systems could create a base for applications
such as a &ldquo;follow me&rdquo; computer environment that supports user
mobility around a building. The main part of such a system forms a
location system.
</p><p><a href="3047s2.html" target="_self">Glossary</a></p><p>This article describes our experiences during the
implementation of a selected component of a new ABng (Active Badges
Next Generation) software component for the location system called
Active Badge. The ABng software has been implemented as a CORBA
application using the distributed object paradigm.</p><p>The component of the ABng software that we implemented is
called the poller: it acts as a communication engine between Active
Badge Systems' sensors and the rest of the location system. Its
efficiency and reliability have a substantial influence on system
performance. Despite this strategic role, the poller is a
self-contained, plug-and-play hardware component, easy to install
and inexpensive.</p><p>The main purpose of this paper is to show that the usual
trade-off problems between robustness, efficiency and low price can
be solved by implementation of the poller as a Linux-embedded
application. All consequences of this design decision have been
analyzed in detail to evaluate its advantages and
disadvantages.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x134d580.0x1445b88"></a>The Active Badges Next Generation
Project</h2></div></div><p>The Active Badges system was originally invented and
developed at the Olivetti Research Laboratory in Cambridge, UK, in
1990-92. It uses hardware infrastructure with the key components of
infrared (IR) sensors installed in fixed positions within a
building, and infrared emitters (<span   class="emphasis"><em>active
badges</em></span>) worn by people or attached to equipment. The
sensors are connected by a wired network that provides a
communication path to the controlling device, called a poller. A
poller can be implemented on a PC or a workstation using a software
communication protocol to talk to the active sensors.</p><p>An active badge periodically transmits an infrared message
containing a globally unique code (a badge identifier) using a
data-link layer protocol running over an RS-232/422 network. The
messages sent by the badges are received and queued by sensors. A
poller periodically polls sensors and retrieves badge messages from
the sensor queues. Each message and the identifier of the sensor
that received the message is forwarded to the software part of the
Active Badges system. The software layer maintains a database that
maps sensors to places where sensors are installed, and badges to
the users wearing them or the pieces of equipment to which they are
attached.</p><p>The relation defined between a set of sensors and badge
identifiers is called sighting. Using collected data, the system
can infer where users or pieces of equipment are currently located.
Information about the current locations of users and equipment is
provided to various applications, such as presentation tools that
display location data or applications that use location data to
control the users' environment. The software part of the original
Active Badge system developed at ORL uses the ANSAWare distributed
environment.</p><p>The ABng project goal is the development of a new software
layer of the Active Badge system that will be flexible and
reconfigurable. To satisfy this requirement, ABng uses modern
components and object-oriented technology. The system was developed
in CORBA-compliant environments: Orbix, omniORB and OrbixWeb. It is
based on the object model in which all logical and physical
elements of the Active Badge system (users, locations, sensors,
badges, etc.) are represented as CORBA objects.</p><p><a href="3047f1.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 1. An
Active Badge</b></span></a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x134d580.0x1445ef8"></a>ABng Poller Implementation</h2></div></div><p>In the context of the ABng project requirements,
<span   class="bold"><b>ABng poller</b></span> must be implemented as
a CORBA object. The poller provides two-way communication between
sensors and the rest of the system. It is, in fact, a gateway
between the ABS data-link layer protocol running over an RS-232/422
network and the IIOP implemented over a TCP/IP protocol
stack.</p><p>The poller acts as a CORBA client when it forwards
information from the sensors, and as a CORBA server during
information flow in the opposite direction. Acting as a client, the
poller provides information (mainly the badge identifiers seen by a
given sensor) to all Main Sighting Processors (MSP) registered with
the poller, so that the MSP can update the sighting relation. The
observed/observer design pattern is exploited to organize this
communication. As an example, let's see what happens when a person
wearing a badge (see Figure 2) enters a room containing an IR
sensor. The message containing the identifier, generated by the
badge, is observed by the IR sensor and cached in its local buffer.
When the poller sends the next periodic polling request to the
sensor, the information cached by the sensor is sent back to the
poller. The poller in turn sends this message, with the sensor and
serial network numbers, to all its observers; the MSPs interested
in receiving the information needed for the sighting relation
modification.</p><p><a href="3047f2.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 2. Alex
Laurentowski wearing Active Badge</b></span></a></p><p>Taking the role of a server, the poller provides operations
that forward commands to sensors and badges. In the ABng system,
these commands are issued by a dedicated server called Scheduler.
The badge can play sounds, and turn one of its two LEDs on or off.
This simple feature can be used to notify a person wearing an
Active Badge about events&mdash;for instance, a phone call or an e-mail
arrival. This notification could also include an action based on
information about the person's location, e.g., a call could be
redirected to the nearest telephone.</p><p>The poller server's software interface consists of two parts,
each with its own functionality. The first part of the interface
provides system operations that register MSPs interested in
receiving information for the sighting relation update from the
poller. It will also de-register them when they are no longer
interested. The second part represents the operations corresponding
to the set of commands performed by sensors and badges.</p><p>The ABng system is integrated using two services: a standard
name server implemented according to COS OMG specification and a
server manager. The server manager is a dedicated server providing
a notification mechanism for all servers in the system interested
in server activity. When a new ABng poller is started, it registers
with the name server via the server manager; the server manager
notifies all registered MSPs that a new poller has begun activity.
The server manager also monitors the poller process using a simple
keep-alive protocol. The poller's IOR (Inter-Orb Reference) is
de-registered from the name server when the poller is removed from
the system or when its process dies. This integration mechanism
provides plug-and-play functionality for the ABng poller CORBA
server, supporting self-configuration and automatic binding, which
is crucial in systems with many dependencies between the
objects.</p><p><a href="3047f3.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 3. ABng
Architecture</b></span></a></p><p><span   class="bold"><b>ABng poller</b></span> is a
multi-threaded Linux application, with the main purpose of
collecting sightings from the serial lines and distributing the
received data to registered observers. This application can be
configured to interface with sensors designed by the ORL as well as
with the modified sensors commercially available from Olivetti. The
six serial lines available in the prototype ABng poller can serve
up to about 80 sensors with reasonable response time. When more
sensors are needed, additional pollers must be deployed. The design
of the ABng system places no limitation on the number of pollers;
thus, system scalability is ensured.</p><p>ABng poller is able to cooperate with other parts of the
system via the standard socket services or through the CORBA
interface. This feature enables a smooth transition from the old
ANSAWare-based location system to the CORBA-based ABng. Object
Request Broker functionality is ensured by the omniORB which,
although free, has performance levels hard to beat by the
commercially available CORBA-compliant products including the
industry leader&mdash;Orbix. An important feature of omniORB is its
portability; it runs on most modern operating systems, including
Linux.</p><p><a href="3047f4.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 4. ABng
Poller</b></span></a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x134d580.0x14465d8"></a>Hardware Platform</h2></div></div><p>ABng Poller runs on the PC/104 hardware platform, which was
developed in 1992 in response to a growing need for a more compact
implementation of the PC bus, satisfying the reduced space and
power constraints of embedded control applications. Yet these goals
had to be realized without sacrificing full hardware and software
compatibility with the popular PC bus standard.</p><p>The key differences between PC/104 and the regular PC bus
are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Compact Form-Factor: card size is reduced to 3.6 by
3.8 inches. It has a unique self-stacking bus that eliminates the
cost and bulk of backplanes and card cages.</p></li><li><p>Pin-and-Socket connectors: rugged and reliable 64-
and 40-contact male/female headers replace the standard PC's
edge-card connectors.</p></li><li><p>Lower bus drive current (4 mA): lowers power
consumption to 1-2 watts per module.</p></li></ul></div><p>In the ABng project, we use PC/104 modules manufactured by
Advantech. Products manufactured by Advantech fall into several
groups, from which we use two: Biscuit PCs and PC/104 modules.
Biscuit PCs are a family of small, highly integrated single board
computers designed for all sorts of embedded applications, and are
equipped with the 80x86 processors&mdash;from 386 to 586. Since the ABng
poller runs in a distributed environment, it was crucial to have an
Ethernet controller on-board. Other components, such as a VGA
adapter, printer port or floppy interface, are not necessary but
are quite helpful in early development stages.</p><p>One of the first versions of ABng poller worked on a PCM-4822
Biscuit PC equipped with an AMD 486 processor, NE2000 compatible
network adapter, enhanced IDE interface, two RS-232 ports, keyboard
connector and 4-bit digital I/O interface. All these components,
including 8MB of RAM, fit into a compact 145mm x 102mm
board.</p><p>During the testing period, we found two main drawbacks to the
PCM-4822 board. The board is equipped with a 120MHz 486 processor
that requires an electric fan. As the only mechanical part of the
ABng poller, the fan is the weakest part of the whole design. A
second problem is the lack of a PC/104 interface on the PCM-4822
board. Adding any PC/104 modules requires an additional adapter.
One of our main design goals was to create a robust device of
minimal size, so we couldn't accept moving parts or unnecessary
adapter boards. The solution came from Advantech, with the release
of PCM-4823 boards, equipped with the PC/104 interface and an AMD
586 processor. The CPU has a heat sink attached, so an external fan
isn't necessary.</p><p>To increase the number of sensors supported by the poller, we
had to use a multi-port RS-232 module. The PCM-3640 manufactured by
Advantech, with a price of about $30/port, seems to be a good
choice. The only problem is that IRQ sharing is not implemented, so
four unused interrupt lines have to be allocated for the module to
work.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x134d580.0x1446b00"></a>Linux Piccolo</h2></div></div><p>The operating system platform for the ABng poller is Linux
Piccolo, which has its roots in Red Hat 4.2. To fulfill the
requirements of an embedded system, the size of Linux Piccolo has
been reduced by keeping only the most important components such as
system libraries, system commands, basic daemons such as telnetd,
httpd, perld and necessary configuration files. The size of the
first version of our system was about 25MB of hard-disk space.
During the evolution of the system, its size was reduced to 4MB of
compressed file-system image.</p><p>As Linux Piccolo runs on a diskless PC, two problems had to
be solved: remote booting and root file system mounting. By remote
booting, we mean downloading the Linux image from the boot server
and performing a standard bootstrap procedure. After the kernel is
loaded into memory, it mounts the root file system, which is
crucial for the operation of the system. Without a local hard disk,
the NFS root file system should be used.</p><p>The PCM-4822 board used in the first prototype of the ABng
poller comes with the Remote Program Load (RPL) protocol burned
into its boot PROM. The RPL protocol is supported by the following
operating systems: Windows NT, Novell Netware, Microsoft LAN
Manager and IBM LAN Server. Unfortunately, a Linux implementation
of the RPL protocol does not exist. After an unsuccessful attempt
to find an RPL specification, in order to implement it under Linux,
we've decided to use Windows NT as a boot server. In our
environment it wasn't a difficult decision, because we already had
a Windows NT workstation. In other cases where an NT server isn't
available, the alternative is to change the boot PROM image to
support BOOTP/TFTP. A good place to find network booting solutions
is the German company Imcon (http://www.imcon.de/). Their Boot PROM
supports over sixty Ethernet cards, covering all major brands of
current PCI and ISA cards, as well as many older 8-bit
models.</p><p>After selecting boot protocol and configuring both client and
server sides, two more elements are required: the Linux kernel and
the root file system.</p><p>The kernel for the Piccolo workstation needs the following as
a minimum set compiled in:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>NFS file system support</p></li><li><p>&ldquo;Root on NFS&rdquo; enabled</p></li><li><p>The Ethernet driver for the network card (For
Advantech's Biscuit PCs, the NE2000 driver works fine.)</p></li><li><p>RARP or BOOTP support for NFS-Root depending on
your needs.</p></li></ul></div><p>Additional parameters, such as the station IP address and the
IP address of the NFS server, should be passed to the kernel at
boot time. When <span   class="bold"><b>loadlin</b></span> is used to
boot the kernel, the following command-line options should be
used:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
loadlin zimage nfsroot=/biscuits/piccolo1 \
nfsaddrs=149.156.97.54:149.156.97.58:: \
255.255.255.0:piccolo1:eth0:none
</pre><p>In this example, <b  >/biscuits/piccolo1</b> is the
path of the root file system on the server, 149.156.97.54 is the
station address and 149.156.97.58 is the boot server address. The
rest of the parameters are the network mask, the station name and
the network interface name.
</p><p>As the next step, the root file system of the diskless
station has to be prepared, installed on the NFS server and
exported to the diskless station. The Linux Piccolo file system can
be downloaded from our web site (see
<a href="3047s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a>).</p><p>Another feature of the NFS root approach is the lack of a
swap partition. With no swapping capability and only 8MB of memory
installed, RAM is a very scarce resource; therefore, the number of
processes running should be minimized. Apart from removing
unnecessary applications, the number of
<span   class="bold"><b>getty</b></span> processes has been reduced
by editing the /etc/inittab file. After this thinning treatment,
about 3MB of RAM was left to the ABng poller process.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x134d580.0x143dc28"></a>DiskOnChip</h2></div></div><p>The biggest disadvantage of the NFS root approach is that it
requires both a boot server and an NFS server (which can be
co-located on one physical machine) during both the boot process
and the system operation. This approach is very convenient in the
early stages of the development process, when home directories can
be shared between a development system acting as an NFS server and
the Linux Piccolo host. When the development cycle is over, a
&ldquo;snapshot&rdquo; of the system, along with the required applications,
should be taken and stored in the poller's non-volatile memory. The
poller can then run independently of the NFS server.</p><p>The M-Systems' DiskOnChip2000 is a new generation of
high-performance single-chip flash disks. The DiskOnChip MD2000
provides a flash disk in a standard 32-pin DIP package. Since the
PCM-4823 board we use is equipped with a DiskOnChip socket,
M-Systems' solution seems to be a natural choice. We soon
discovered that there is one serious problem with DoC.
DiskOnChip2000 has built-in TrueFFS (true flash file system)
technology, which provides hard disk compatibility at both the
sector and file level. It works in a variety of operating system
environments such as DOS, Windows 95, Windows CE, Windows NT, pSOS+
and QNX. Unfortunately, Linux is not yet on the list of supported
operating systems. The good news is M-Systems is planning to
support Linux; by the time this article is printed, Linux should be
supported.</p><p>As the deadline for our project neared, we couldn't wait for
the support. The fact that DoC is not supported by Linux does not
mean that Linux cannot be started from it. The solution was to
create a DOS partition on the flash disk containing the Linux
Piccolo kernel and the compressed file system image, and to use
loadlin with the <span   class="bold"><b>initrd</b></span>
capability. <span   class="bold"><b>initrd</b></span>, which stands
for initial RAM disk, enables loading the RAM disk image by the
boot loader. This RAM disk can be mounted as a root file system,
from which applications can be executed. Using the following
command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
loadlin zimage initrd=linpico.gz root=/dev/ram
</pre><p>the compressed kernel
(<span   class="bold"><b>zimage</b></span>) and the compressed root
file system image (linpico.gz) are loaded into memory. After those
two elements are loaded, the kernel is uncompressed and executed.
Code contained in the kernel is then used to uncompress and mount
the root file system. When the file system is mounted, standard
system initialization is performed.
</p><p>Having experience with the NFS-root approach, we decided to
buy a 10MB DiskOnChip. Relying only on the flash disk requires much
more RAM than using an external NFS server. A 32MB RAM module has
been installed on ABng poller. Also, the size of the whole Linux
Piccolo file system should be reduced as much as possible to fit on
the 10MB flash disk. All required files can be copied into the
flash disk using an external floppy or hard drive, or they can be
downloaded through the network.</p><p>To create a file system image, a block device is required. We
use a loopback device for this purpose. The first step is to zero
out the block device in order to achieve a better compression
ratio. Then, the file system is created using the
<span   class="bold"><b>mkfs</b></span> utility. The file system is
then mounted at the temporary mount point and all required files
are copied onto it. The last steps are to unmount the file system
and compress it.</p><p>After each development cycle of the ABng poller application,
the script in <a href="3047l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a> is invoked
on the external Linux server to prepare the Linux Piccolo file
system.</p><p>The biggest drawback of this solution is that no changes can
be written from within Linux. In the case of ABng poller, this is
not a big problem, but for other kinds of applications it might be
unacceptable. In such a situation, flash disks with an IDE
interface may be used. An example of such a flash disk that
performs well under Linux is the SanDisk FlashDrive.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x134d580.0x143e1a8"></a>Conclusions</h2></div></div><p>Linux wasn't chosen just because it is free and very popular
in the academic community. Linux was the best choice for several
reasons. First, we needed a multi-threaded operating system that
could be tailored to our own requirements. With Linux source code
available, this customization could easily be performed. The other
important features of Linux are its mature networking subsystem and
the availability of the CORBA environment. The performance of ABng
poller turned out to be better than expected even with a limited
amount of RAM. The customization and integration of different
components of the system were performed effectively without any
major technical problems. This proves Linux to be an advanced and
open operating system.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x134d580.0x143e2b0"></a>Acknowledgments</h2></div></div><p>This work is supported by Olivetti-Oracle Research
