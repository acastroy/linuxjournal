    This article describes a communications gateway system, why
    Linux was chosen for the implementation and why Linux is an
    excellent choice for similar gateways.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2871580.0x29694a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>In 1996, Pacific Gas &amp; Electric
Company (PG&amp;E) began a project to develop a commercial-grade
advanced sensor to monitor electric lines. The system was simple in
concept: use lots of small cheap units that hang on the electric
lines, each consisting of a few sensor elements, an embedded CPU, a
spread-spectrum radio and a battery. The sensor units would monitor
for certain line conditions; if those conditions occurred, the
sensor would conduct measurements, and then radio the information
to a &ldquo;master&rdquo; radio unit. That master unit would, in turn,
forward the information through a gateway to a server on the
corporate WAN.
</p><p>Server software would analyze the arriving data and, if
warning conditions existed, would alert the electrical system
operators. Other software on the WAN would be capable of monitoring
and performing remote configuration of the wireless sensor network.
This software would use a proprietary wireless networking protocol
to accomplish the control and monitoring&mdash;in effect, tunneling this
protocol within TCP/IP out through the gateway system and
back.</p><p><a href="3030f1.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 1.
Gateway Schematic</b></span></a></p><p>The project was on an aggressive timetable: to put a working
demonstration in the field before winter storms began in the fall
of 1996. Luckily, the underlying sensor technology had already been
developed by the PG&amp;E Research and Development Lab. PG&amp;E
partnered with an outside vendor to develop, test and bring to
market a wireless network of sensors based on this sensor
technology. The total system was to consist of three major parts:
the sensor network, the client software to use the data collected
by the sensors and a gateway providing a reliable link. Linux was
chosen as the operating system for the gateway.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2871580.0x2969768"></a>System Description</h2></div></div><p>The goal of the project was to develop and test sensor
technology and its associated wireless network. R&amp;D had
pioneered the actual sensor design and had conducted field tests of
prototype sensors. To move the technology from prototype to
product, we had to design for manufacturing&mdash;not something with
which a utility company has experience. In addition, developing and
testing a wireless spread-spectrum radio network was beyond our
abilities. Therefore, we partnered with a commercial vendor to help
develop and produce the system.</p><p>The vendor was to integrate our sensor designs with their
radio and to implement the radio network. We would provide full
technical assistance and handle all data collection and analysis
for the initial trials. A fairly substantial software development
effort would also be necessary. The client-side display software
was based on other, related software development efforts, so that
part of the project had a head start. I was a member of the project
development team in R&amp;D and was responsible for the actual
development of the gateway software.</p><p>The wireless sensor network used spread-spectrum radios.
These unlicensed radios are relatively immune to interference, but
require a clear line of sight between transmitter and receiver. The
sensors were designed to hang from power lines. To provide a line
of sight to those sensors and good geographical coverage from a
single master radio, the radio site must be above the level of the
power lines. Thus, the master radio must be on a hilltop or mounted
on a tower to be effective. Either solution poses problems in
getting power and a WAN connection to interface with the master
radio. To add to the challenge, a given site might require more
than one master radio, depending on geography. To &ldquo;look&rdquo; over a
knoll or around a building, we might have to add a second master
radio. Even in those circumstances, we wanted to use only one
gateway system; therefore, each gateway must be able to serve
several master radios.</p><p><a href="3030f2.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 2. The
author (foreground) and Julian Riccomini installing the gateway
system.</b></span></a></p><p>The field trial site for the project was chosen for its
interesting electrical distribution circuits, topography typical of
our electrical service area and a relatively accessible site for a
master radio. The site was several hours away from our office
location at the top of a large, steep hill. The road up the hill
was treacherous even when conditions were dry; in wet winter
months, reaching our equipment location at the top of the hill
would be very difficult. Given the difficulties of physically
reaching the gateway system, it was imperative that it be reliable
and fault-tolerant. The site already had a backup electrical
generator protecting other radio equipment located on the hilltop,
which significantly simplified our power requirements for the
gateway system and master radio. A small UPS added ride-through
capability to protect the systems during voltage sags, and while
waiting for the backup generator to come on-line in the event of an
outage.</p><p>The master radio was custom-developed by the wireless vendor,
but its link to the gateway was limited to a single serial
communications port. No embedded Ethernet or other networking
interface would be included in the radio. The gateway system had
all networking responsibility. To further complicate the matter,
radio antenna requirements forced the master radio to be located
outside, high up on a mast. The computer system was to be located
inside a nearby building. The serial communications cable between
the master radio and the computer system would have to extend about
50 feet. This eliminated standard RS-232 communications, since at
those cable lengths we would never attain the design goal of 56
baud. Also, normal RS-232 communications would not allow us to have
multiple master radios per gateway without adding more serial
ports. To solve the problem, we chose to use RS-485 two-wire
differential communications, which gave us distance, high baud
rates, excellent noise immunity and the ability to expand the link
to multiple drops (supporting multiple radios) if needed.</p><p><a href="3030f3.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 3. Area
overlooked by the gateway system.</b></span></a></p><p>The gateway would require additional functionality for the
field trials. To properly evaluate the data gathered from the
sensors, data had to be recorded somewhere. The system
specifications called for data to be delivered in real time to a
central server that would record it, perform data analysis and, if
necessary, send an alarm to the electrical system operators. Any
failure of the links from the gateway to the WAN or a WAN outage
would break the entire process and risk data loss. In fact, the
times when the most interesting data is collected&mdash;during
storms&mdash;is the very time links are most likely to fail. Obviously,
the gateway must have redundant links and the ability to log sensor
data locally, should all links fail. The hilltop had a direct line
of sight to a local PG&amp;E office and a few spare telephone wire
pairs. For the primary link, we used a commercial spread-spectrum,
point-to-point radio bridge. (Similar radios were already in wide
use in the company as WAN links.)</p><p>Our backup link was ISDN. We chose to use a commercial bridge
to provide automatic switching between the radio and the ISDN
links. While we could have added that capability in our software,
we chose to buy it &ldquo;off-the-shelf&rdquo;, believing the extra cost was
worth the reduction in development time. To provide additional
redundancy, we added a standard dial-up line. This would provide an
alternate path for retrieving data should a WAN outage occur,
severing the link on the network side. As a complete backup, the
gateway would also log all network traffic from the master radio.
Those logs would be kept on the system's hard drive, since we
expected to repair any link failure before recording many megabytes
of data. Of course, we still might have to physically go to the
gateway and perform a manual download, but we wouldn't lose
data.</p><p>As discussed above, the master radio communicated to the
gateway across an RS-485 link. This link used a simple protocol
(similar to HDLC, high-level data link control) to packetize the
proprietary radio network protocol and allow for multiple master
radios when required. The gateway would take the data stream from
the RS-485 link, encapsulate it into a TCP/IP socket connection and
flow it onto the WAN. Data flowing in the other direction would go
back out the RS-485 link to the master radio. On the WAN, a simple
database server would be at the other end point of the protocol
tunnel. The software used by the electrical system operators would
interact only with the server. This modularization was key to
dividing the work among the disparate groups participating in the
development process.</p><p>While designing the system, we always had an eye on
scalability. Each WAN-based server needed to be capable of
supporting multiple wireless network gateways. Successful
completion of the project would mean rolling out several hundred
wireless networks, leading to large database requirements. In
addition, the server software would need to run on hardware not
specifically purchased for this project. All PG&amp;E divisions had
large Sun servers in place for support of other engineering
functions. From both a financial and a space perspective, the idea
of buying and installing new servers just for the wireless sensor
network was rejected. Our new server software had to be portable
across major UNIX platforms&mdash;at a minimum, SunOS and Solaris.
Recall that the server was to be an end point for the protocol
tunnel carrying the proprietary radio network data. The code we
wrote for the server had to be portable to the gateway as well;
writing two versions was not only silly, but also out of the
question given our short development timetable.</p><p>All in all, the bridging system and its associated components
had quite a list of requirements, including the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Speak RS-485 on one side and Ethernet on the
other.</p></li><li><p>Support tunneling the radio network protocol across
a serial communications channel and within TCP/IP.</p></li><li><p>Support a primary, a backup and a dial-up
link.</p></li><li><p>Support automatic data logging locally if those
links failed.</p></li><li><p>Support the ability to extract logs over the
network without disrupting the gateway operations when links were
restored and without disrupting normal operations.</p></li><li><p>Be as reliable as possible to operate in a remote,
occasionally inaccessible location.</p></li></ul></div><p>The server software must be portable across various flavors
of UNIX and reuse as much of the gateway code as possible. To make
matters more exciting, the entire system had to be built, tested
and installed in the field in about six months.</p><p>For much of the system, we chose to use off-the-shelf
technology in order to minimize development time and maximize
reliability. However, to our knowledge, this type of project had
never been done before, and most of the special functionality would
have to be written by us. Without a stable operating system with a
reasonable set of features and tools, we'd never be able to meet
the deadline.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2871580.0x296a2c0"></a>Why Linux?</h2></div></div><p>Linux was immediately considered as an option for the
project, due to positive experiences on an earlier project using
Linux. However, the earlier project did data translations only in a
batch environment in a normal office setup. While that earlier
software was a major project, it was very different from a
mission-essential &ldquo;embedded&rdquo; system. The gateway would be remote
and unattended with no recourse to human intervention if something
went wrong. We were certain Linux could handle the load, but
prudence demanded the evaluation of alternatives. The gateway was
essential to the entire project: without it, we'd have no
performance metrics on how well the radio network of sensors
performed. We needed solid reasons to justify our choice of Linux
for the project.</p><p>As always, there were strong proponents for using a Microsoft
OS. We rejected that approach immediately. Our experience with
Windows NT indicated it still had some stability problems (despite
being far more stable than other Windows platforms). While it is
perhaps a useful desktop and/or server OS, we felt that NT was
unsuitable for remote systems, particularly those without a display
or a keyboard. We were also unhappy with the remote administration
capabilities of NT. Perhaps most importantly, however, the system
was to operate in an environment where it had to boot and run its
software automatically if the watchdog timer ever reset the system.
We had little faith in NT's ability to boot, correct disk problems
and then run properly in this scenario. NT (and all other Microsoft
Windows operating systems) were rejected for these reasons.</p><p>Various DOS-based solutions were also considered. We had
serial port-handling libraries for DOS which we had used
successfully in the past for solving the serial communications
problems. Micro-Controller Operating System
(<span   class="emphasis"><em>mu</em></span>C/OS), a freeware real-time OS available
for many different microprocessors, was evaluated as well.
<span   class="emphasis"><em>mu</em></span>C/OS had similarly good serial port-handling
functions. Both were judged to be stable and reliable for an
embedded application. However, one of the core system requirements
was to allow log and data file extraction without disturbing the
gateway operation. DOS would require some tricky programming to
allow that option due to the uncertainty of some system calls, and
we felt <span   class="emphasis"><em>mu</em></span>C/OS would have trouble with it
under high traffic loads. Portability was another issue&mdash;the
protocol tunnel code had to be easily portable to UNIX. Even if we
could have located an affordable, reliable, TCP/IP stack for either
DOS or <span   class="emphasis"><em>mu</em></span>C/OS, we had serious doubts about our
ability to keep the source code portable. We removed both of those
OS choices from the list.</p><p>We had a lot of choices among UNIX-like operating systems:
QNX, Linux, FreeBSD, Solaris x86 or SCO. Our exposure to the latter
two left us with serious concerns about their performance. None of
the systems we had seen running those operating systems were
particularly fast or responsive, even under fairly light loads. We
also expected to port the gateway computer hardware platform to a
single-board computer (SBC), and we wondered if either of those
operating systems could run successfully on such hardware. We were
certainly doubtful about the availability of RS-485 and watchdog
timer drivers for those systems. We saw little value in choosing
FreeBSD over Linux, since all our experience was with Linux.</p><p>So, our choices were reduced to QNX and Linux. QNX is a
stable, multi-tasking, scalable, reliable, real-time OS that can
easily run on SBCs. It has serial port/RS-485 and watchdog timer
support and full networking support, including TCP/IP. QNX also
enjoys a reputation for good technical support. In short, a good
initial fit was found between QNX and the project's needs. However,
there were also pitfalls. QNX did not support
<span   class="bold"><b>gcc</b></span> (we heard a port was in
progress). The only compiler available was the one provided by QNX,
based on the Watcom C integrated development environment. While
it's probably a good compiler, it meant learning a new tool, and
that translated to time lost in an already short development cycle.
We were already using and familiar with gcc and the other fine GNU
tools. Given the short project &ldquo;time to market&rdquo;, any time lost
from learning the new environment was considered
detrimental.</p><p>That same philosophy extended to QNX in general. As a
sophisticated real-time, micro-kernel OS, a learning curve is
involved to use it well. We asked ourselves if we actually needed a
real-time OS with the extra complexity that would come with it. We
also wondered about portability issues. Having no experience with
QNX, we were quite concerned that we would end up having to write
the code twice: once for QNX and once for our server platform. At
the very least, we were afraid we'd have to spend extra time adding
conditional compiler directives to make the code work in both
environments. In contrast, using Linux practically assured
identical code. The licensing costs of QNX were substantial as
well, in particular, when the full TCP/IP capabilities on every
network node were added. In contrast, a single $50 Red Hat Linux
CD-ROM represented a significant cost savings.</p><p>In the end, low cost, familiarity and availability of GNU
tools tipped the scales in favor of Linux. It met all the project's
key requirements at a tangible cost benefit which was hard to
ignore. In summary, Linux provided:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>A stable, robust, multi-user OS</p></li><li><p>Solid support for TCP/IP networking and serial
communications</p></li><li><p>Ability to run on various single-board and host
computers</p></li><li><p>Familiar, commonly used development tools with
familiar system libraries&mdash;no time lost learning other tools and
systems</p></li><li><p>Code that was completely reusable on other UNIX
platforms to implement the servers for the system</p></li></ul></div><p>As an added advantage, if we ever went into production and
began building hundreds or thousands of gateways, Linux would save
us a significant amount of money because there are no license fees
to use it.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2871580.0x296abb0"></a>Results</h2></div></div><p>The gateway system was in place for more than a year with no
significant downtime and no loss of sensor data. At one point, the
system had 179 days of uptime&mdash;and the only reason it needed to be
rebooted was as a result of troubleshooting a problem with the
network bridge equipment. Linux has proved remarkably stable and
effective, and human intervention has not been needed.</p><p>The system we installed in the field is a bit different than
we originally envisioned. We had some trouble with the single-board
computer we chose, but those problems were related to the on-board
RS-485 hardware, not Linux. It looked grim for a few days as we
fought communications problems and pored over the serial-driver
source code to try to find a fix. Another major plus Linux has over
other OS choices is the full availability of the source code. We
had not expected to need it, but it certainly proved valuable. The
developer of much of the Linux serial driver code, Theodore Ts'o,
personally answered questions by e-mail&mdash;within hours in one case.
While we certainly did not expect that response every time, we've
never gotten that level of support from any commercial
vendor.</p><p><a href="3030f4.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 4. Mary
Ilyin and Julian Riccomini work on the master
radio.</b></span></a></p><p>While resolving the hardware problems on the single-board
computer, we shifted development work to an old 386-40MHz
motherboard we had lying around. We swapped in the hard drive,
added a network card, a watchdog timer card, and an RS-485 port
card and immediately had a working gateway computer. The
single-board computer was a 486-100, but we discovered Linux to be
so efficient with minimal hardware, a faster CPU was not needed. We
never did resolve the strange hardware problem on the single-board
computer. The 386 system worked so well that we stayed with it and
actually used it for the field trials. It worked perfectly. The
incredible range of hardware that Linux supports became another
solid plus that helped us implement a working system.</p><p>The server code also ran reliably. We tested and demonstrated
the software on Sun servers running both SunOS and Solaris;
however, the workhorse for the field system was a Pentium PC
running Linux. The code base for the two systems was identical&mdash;the
only difference was a few lines in the project Makefile. Our
objective of portability was made trivial by Linux's adherence to
open standards.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2871580.0x2961758"></a>So, What Happened to the Project?</h2></div></div><p>The wireless sensor network was a moderate success, although
some technical problems did arise. However, during the middle of
the project, changes in California law introduced more
competitiveness into the state's electric utility industry. The
sensor project had been started by PG&amp;E's Department of
Research and Development. One immediate change in the state's laws
was that R&amp;D funds would be administered differently. As a
result, the company abolished its R&amp;D department and
transferred the project to another department to finish. The
initial phase of the project is now wrapping up, but what steps
will be taken next is still unknown.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2871580.0x2961860"></a>A Hypothetical Approach to the Next Step</h2></div></div><p>Linux has matured since this project began, and it's worth
taking the time to examine how recent Linux developments might
benefit the next stage of gateway design. I would like to emphasize
that the following comments are hypothetical&mdash;if I were to attempt
upgrading and modernizing the gateway system, this is the approach
I would take.</p><p>The next stage would require deploying multiple radio
networks and gateways to serve large geographical areas, and
changes could be made to simplify and improve operations. Gateways
in non-testing situations would not require as much logging of
radio network traffic, so the hard drive, the only moving part in
the system, could be removed.</p><p>Paul Moody has written an excellent new Mini-HOWTO on
embedded Linux (http://users.bigpond.com/paulmoody/). His document
makes adding a flash disk as simple as following a recipe.</p><p>For our field trial, we specifically chose to use external,
discrete network bridging equipment to link to the corporate WAN.
We felt it would be fast to implement and more reliable than
something we wrote ourselves. It wasn't quite plug-and-play
(configuring the bridge proved troublesome), but it was relatively
quick to set up. However, the bridging equipment was the only
source of problems the gateway experienced in nearly eighteen
months of service, so I'm no longer convinced of the superiority of
proprietary network equipment. In contrast, the custom gateway
software performed flawlessly.</p><p>The June 1998 issue of <i  >Linux Journal</i> had
an excellent article on the use of the Sangoma WANPIPE S508 router
card (http://www.sangoma.com/). In addition, Usenet reports from
users include raves about the Spellcaster ISDN cards
(http://www.spellcast.com/). Using those cards in a future system
would integrate all the gateway functionality into one box (with
the exception of a radio for a point-to-point link, if such a link
was needed). The resulting system would be about half the size,
approximately two-thirds cheaper, use half the power, and in all
likelihood, be even more reliable than the present system.</p><p><a href="3030f5.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 5. Mary
Ilyin inspects an antenna on top of the building that hosts the

successfully used in the commercial marketplace and in
mission-critical commercial communication applications. In fact,
Linux may have a place in such applications where perhaps no other
OS can compete.</p><p>Linux is exceptionally well-suited for communications
functions. It's fast, stable, reliable, has built-in TCP/IP
networking, and it uses common, well-known development tools.
Commercial versions of those tools are now available from Cygnus
Solutions (http://www.cygnus.com/). Using loadable modules makes
trimming the system down to a minimum kernel fairly easy to do, and
the whole operating system is Open Source, so there's no limit to
the customization possible.</p><p>Linux runs on many different processors, opening a wide range
of target platforms&mdash;yet applications developed for it can easily
be ported to other UNIX platforms, as required. The number of Linux
ports to small, cheap processors is growing&mdash;Linux even runs on the
Palm Pilot. Commercial technical support for Linux is available
from several companies. Linux developers are getting easier to find
as the popularity of the OS increases, and as more universities use
Linux in their computer science labs. In addition, and perhaps most
important to a commercial venture, is the lack of any license fee
to use Linux. That translates into a significant cost savings for
commercial products. With its technical and financial advantages,
Linux may be the best option for many embedded communications
systems.</p><p>The coming years will see a huge array of new commercial
communications services being offered. PCS systems, new
applications for wireless networks, low-earth orbit satellite
networks, new utility SCADA systems, home and small office
networks&mdash;all of these systems will need to be interconnected in
various ways, and embedded communications systems will be built to
serve these functions. These systems will range from
cable-modem/video-on-demand controllers mounted high on telephone
poles to small black boxes locked away in phone company central
offices to small black boxes that sit behind your PC. I won't be
surprised if many of these next generation systems run
Linux.</p><p><a href="3030s1.html" target="_self">Acknowledgements</a></p></div></div>
