    Mr. Petree brings us up to date on events at Virginia Power,
    telling us about its Linux substation controllers and new
    data monitoring system.

of Linux's success in the real world. Perhaps, after a relaxing
evening hacking a device driver, or building a new kernel, or
trying to memorize the Emacs commands to change fonts in a LaTeX
buffer, you've sat on the edge of the bed, hand on the light switch
and mused to yourself, &ldquo;I wonder what those Virginia Power guys
are up to these days?&rdquo;
</p><p>&ldquo;What's that, dear?&rdquo; your Significant Other murmurs
sleepily (or, depending on your lifestyle, woofs or meows from the
foot of the bed).</p><p>&ldquo;You know, those intrepid fellows who used Linux to build a
distributed data collection and archiving system (<i  >Linux Journal</i> #9, January 1995), and a dial-up SCADA
(supervisory control and data acquisition) system to interface to
their existing SCADA system (<i  >Linux Journal</i>
#10, February 1995).&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;<span   class="emphasis"><em>those</em></span> Virginia Power guys
...&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes. I wonder if they're still using Linux, if it still
meets their needs, and if they're doing anything new and exciting
... &rdquo;</p><p>Well, as one of those Virginia Power guys, I can say quite
happily: are we <span   class="emphasis"><em>ever</em></span>! I guess we've been so
busy coding these past couple of years that we haven't had time to
document what we've been up to, but I'll try to make up for that
lack (at least a little) in this article. I'll describe two new
applications in which we're using Linux&mdash;one already complete,
installed and working wonderfully, and the other which, when
completed, will be one of the largest computer systems of any type
at Virginia Power, and possibly one of the largest systems using
Linux anywhere.</p><p>The first application I'll discuss is a natural outgrowth of
our earlier Linux applications&mdash;especially our dial-up SCADA
system. I won't recount all the details of that system (see
<i  >LJ</i> #10 if you're interested)&mdash;the important
thing to remember is that the dial-up system retrieves status and
analog data <span   class="emphasis"><em>from</em></span> and sends control commands
<span   class="emphasis"><em>to</em></span> remote devices installed in substations and
on pole tops.</p><p>In larger substations, a device called a remote terminal unit
(RTU) is usually employed as the primary remote device. The RTU
serves as a data concentrator, collecting status and analog data
from various other devices in the station and providing a central
location from which the data can be retrieved remotely and to which
control requests can be delivered.</p><p>RTUs are somewhat limited in processing power and
expandability, and usually only interface with a limited number of
other monitoring and control devices. As a result, one of the
current trends in substation design is employing a computer as the
station data concentrator. This approach allows not only greater
flexibility as far as the types and numbers of devices which can be
connected, but also provides a general-purpose software environment
wherein some monitoring and control algorithms can be executed
locally within the substation.</p><p>As you might expect, substation controller systems are
commercially available, many implemented using MS Windows. However,
these systems are expensive, difficult to administer remotely and
contain a plethora of software gingerbread and geegaws (also known
as click-and-drag disease) having nothing to do with monitoring
devices in a substation.</p><p><a href="2286f1.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 1.
Dial-up SCADA System</b></span></a></p><p>In the Operations Engineering group, we realized that our
dial-up SCADA system (see Figure 1) provided the same functionality
as those commercial substation controllers, <span   class="emphasis"><em>if</em></span>
you eliminated the dial-up system and moved the PC and the
translator device out into the substation (see Figure 2). The
translator device is necessary to communicate with our existing
SCADA Master control computers using an ancient bit-oriented
protocol (over 1200bps leased lines, no less). However, these
control computers are due to be replaced with a new computer system
over the next couple of years&mdash;more on that later.</p><p>To cut to the chase, moving PCs to the substations is
<span   class="emphasis"><em>exactly</em></span> what we did. At the time of writing
this article, half a dozen Linux-based substation controllers are
installed and working around the clock, with more in the planning
stages.</p><p><a href="2286f2.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 2.
Substation Controller System Setup</b></span></a></p><p>The basic design of the substation controller is pretty
straightforward. For each type of special equipment which performs
the actual monitoring and control in the substation, a specific
<span   class="emphasis"><em>protocol task</em></span> is written (for compulsive
coders, this is the fun part) which handles all the details of data
retrieval and control execution. The devices which perform the
actual monitoring and control are usually referred to as IEDs
(Intelligent End Devices), since they have a certain amount of
intelligence built into them and sit at the end of the data
retrieval and control path. Some IEDs communicate via serial lines;
others use specialized local area network protocols such as
<span   class="bold"><b>ModBus+</b></span>.</p><p>Another protocol task communicates with the translator
device, which in turn communicates with the SCADA master computer.
A database management daemon coordinates the activities of all
these protocol tasks and also maintains shared memory partitions
which contain the actual data. With all of these components taken
into account, a typical substation controller setup looks like the
one in Figure 3.</p><p><a href="2286f3.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 3.
Substation Controller Design</b></span></a></p><p>In most cases, the substation controller computer is
rack-mounted along with the rest of the equipment in the substation
&ldquo;control house&rdquo; (a small building intended mainly for protection
from the elements). It has no keyboard and no monitor (try
<span   class="emphasis"><em>that</em></span> with your Windows box). All system
administration is performed remotely via dial-up login; database
and program updates are distributed using UUCP. In some cases, the
installation includes a touch-screen monitor to provide a local
operator interface, consisting of an annunciator panel (see Figures
4 and 5) and even an interface for performing device controls (see
Figure 6).</p><p><a href="2286f4.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 4.
Substation Annunciator Panel</b></span></a></p><p><a href="2286f5.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 5.
Substation Panel</b></span></a></p><p><a href="2286f6.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 6.
Substation Controls</b></span></a></p><p>By the way, an <span   class="emphasis"><em>annunciator panel</em></span> is just
a hierarchical display of alarm points, in which an alarm at a
higher level means one or more points at a lower level are in an
alarm state. The annunciator panel initially displays the topmost
level of alarms as a grid of labeled boxes (green if all lower
alarms are normal, red if at least one is in alarm). A substation
technician can touch one of the boxes to display the next lower
level of alarms; each one of <span   class="emphasis"><em>those</em></span> alarms can
consist of additional individual alarms, etc.</p><p>These substation controller systems are highly flexible. If
more serial ports are needed to talk to additional devices, we need
only augment the serial multiport card or add another multiport
card. If new types of devices are to be connected, we need only
write a new protocol task and possibly a new device driver for an
interface card.</p><p>How reliable are these systems? All of our substation
controller systems have functioned extremely well from the moment
they've been powered up in the field. We've had a few application
software bugs and glitches, but the system software has never
failed nor caused us a single problem through thousands of hours of
continuous uptime.</p><p>I stopped worrying long ago about the robustness of Linux&mdash;to
be honest, Linux and its associated tools and support software from
the Free Software Foundation and elsewhere comprise the most
reliable system I have ever used on any hardware platform. I've
heard horror tales from users of other operating systems: blue
death screens, exhausted resource limits, quirky compiler bugs and
so on. I shake my head in rueful irony, then swivel my chair back
to my Linux box to get some work done. I can't imagine putting any
<span   class="emphasis"><em>other</em></span> system out in the middle of the wild and
woolly real world and expecting it to run for weeks and months and
years without fail.</p><p>As far as cost-effectiveness goes, new controller systems
generally cost only as much as the hardware, with sometimes a
little software overhead if a new protocol or device driver needs
to be developed. No commercial system can hope to come even close
to that low a cost&mdash;thanks to the freely distributable nature of
Linux. Since our Operations Engineering group is responsible for
finding cost-effective solutions for power system monitoring and
distribution needs, Linux is just this side of a miracle. In a very
real (albeit small) sense, Linux helps us keep down the cost of
distributing electricity. With every new substation controller
installed, customers who've never even heard of Linux can benefit
from all the hard work and loving craftsmanship the Linux
developers and maintainers have invested in their system.</p><p>These two important points&mdash;reliability and low cost&mdash;lead
naturally into a discussion of our <span   class="emphasis"><em>other</em></span> big
Linux project: a replacement system for the current network of
SCADA Master computers. The SCADA Master computers are the systems
which scan all of the RTUs and IEDs mentioned above (several
hundred at last count). These computers monitor power system
conditions, generate alarms when abnormal conditions are detected,
and provide system operators with summaries of power grid
information, one-line diagrams of substation layouts and control
interfaces for remotely operating breakers, capacitors and other
field devices. The systems also run closed-loop feedback control
programs, which automatically respond (usually via device controls)
to changing system conditions.</p><p>Currently, the SCADA Master computers are a network of six
PDP-11/84 computers which have just about reached the end of their
usefulness&mdash;they've reached their limits for CPU power, installable
RAM and so on. The user interface is a creaky mixture of
specialized keyboards with banks of function keys and a
character-based graphics terminal with unchangeable little symbols
and line segments for drawing substation one-line diagrams. All of
these features were quite new and progressive in the early 1980s,
but are far from flexible enough for the present or foreseeable
future.</p><p>As with our substation controllers, we went the commercial
route first when we started looking for a new SCADA system. We
reviewed the offerings of about a dozen vendors. Alas, since a
SCADA system is similar to a factory automation system or even an
aircraft simulator, many systems we reviewed were derived from
these types of systems. As a result, they contained many features
and add-ons which made no sense for the way our operators used
SCADA; plus, they were expensive; plus, we usually couldn't get
access to source code. (We've been spoiled by Linux.) At least one
vendor offered to put the source code in
<span   class="emphasis"><em>escrow</em></span>&mdash;about as useful as being told how
delicious a chocolate cheesecake is without being offered a
slice.</p><p>Not least of all was the issue of retraining our operations
personnel (not to mention ourselves) on a completely new system.
Monitoring the electric distribution grid is a 24-hour-a-day job,
so we couldn't just shut down shop for a couple of months while we
came up to speed on a new boatload of software. After all, our goal
was to reliably monitor and control the power system, not
necessarily to learn an entirely new way of opening a circuit
breaker or logging an alarm. (Similar to click-and-drag disease is
the curious notion that a new or different way of performing a task
is <span   class="emphasis"><em>automatically</em></span> a better way.)</p><p>We thought long and hard about what we
<span   class="emphasis"><em>really</em></span> needed: a cost-effective, flexible,
scalable, reliable SCADA system replacement that wouldn't require
extensive retraining for ourselves or our system operators, and
that wouldn't include extra software gadgets for which we would
have no use.</p><p>Meanwhile, our Linux systems continued to run quietly day in
and day out: performing dial-up data retrieval, monitoring scores
of devices in substations. The substation controllers, in
particular, were almost embryonic SCADA systems, with data
retrieval, database storage and archiving, and a user interface
with one-line schematics and controls.</p><p>Of course, several important pieces were missing from the
substation controllers which would have to be supplied to turn them
into a full-fledged SCADA system&mdash;but after you've spent enough
time in Emacs, you tend to think you can accomplish anything. So we
examined issues of scalability, figured out exactly what extra
pieces we needed and whether we could develop them on a realistic
schedule, and put together a presentation for our
management.</p><p>Surprisingly (or perhaps not so surprisingly, given our track
record with the other cost-effective Linux systems), our
upper-level management gave us the green light. Suddenly we had
<span   class="emphasis"><em>plenty</em></span> of work to do, with an implementation
target date of December, 1998.</p><p>I can't adequately describe how exciting (and terrifying, in
some respects) this project is. Some of the features of our
design:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>A private high-speed (100 Mbps) wide area network
connecting all our main machines, separated from our corporate
network by a firewall</p></li><li><p>500 MHz DEC Alpha database servers</p></li><li><p>High-speed Intel front-end processors to handle RTU
scanning and database retrieval</p></li><li><p>Multi-headed operator workstations running X</p></li><li><p>A distributed shared-memory database to
transparently share information among all servers and
workstations</p></li><li><p>Three regional operating centers, a duplicate
center at our Grayland Avenue office, scores of workstations, and
many district centers (some connecting via Ethernet, others on
demand via PPP/SLIP)</p></li><li><p>Everything running Linux</p></li></ul></div><p>A general overview of our system, which we've named swSCADA
for SkunkWerx SCADA (smile) is shown in Figure 7.</p><p><a href="2286f7.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 7.
swSCADA Overview</b></span></a></p><p>By the time our implementation is finished (as mentioned
above, our installation begins in December, 1998 with a new system
in the Eastern/Southern regional center, with the remainder of the
centers being phased in by the end of 1999), we will have a network
of around four dozen Alpha and Intel boxes, running 24 hours a day,
7 days a week. This probably isn't the <span   class="emphasis"><em>largest</em></span>
network using Linux systems exclusively, but it certainly puts the
lie to those armchair critics who claim large corporations are
unwilling to use Linux in mission-critical situations. Monitoring
the electric power distribution grid is a mission-critical
situation for a power company, and not only are we
<span   class="emphasis"><em>willing</em></span> to use Linux, we embrace it
wholeheartedly (and admittedly, somewhat evangelically). Its robust
quality and freely distributable nature will save our customers
money, provide them with top-drawer service, and give our
shareholders more of a return on their investment. In today's
bottom-line business environment, <span   class="emphasis"><em>those</em></span> sorts
of arguments matter.</p><p>I was thinking the other day about Linus Torvalds' ultimate
goal for Linux: &ldquo;world domination&rdquo;. As we enter the 21st century,
every light, CD player, television, toaster, PC and hair dryer in
central Virginia and part of North Carolina will be under the
benevolent, watchful eye of vigilant Linux swSCADA systems. That's
not world domination <span   class="emphasis"><em>yet</em></span>&mdash;but it's a
start!</p></div></div>
