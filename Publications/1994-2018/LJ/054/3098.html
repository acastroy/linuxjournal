5.0 mail server, I get a prompt (as I should) for my login and
password. However, when I type my password (or login) wrong,
authentication fails and the server won't let me read mail, but it
will let me send mail. That mail is sent with my name and address
on it, which makes it easy for people to use my account and send
mail using my name. Since I am also the administrator of that mail
server, should I shut down <span   class="bold"><b>imap</b></span>
and <span   class="bold"><b>pop3</b></span>? I don't want my users to
have this problem too.</p><p>I have checked out PAM configuration, and imap uses the same
library (pampwdb.so) as login and other critical services to
authenticate users. So, what can I do to solve this problem and
provide imap and pop3 service? &mdash;Diego A. Puertas Fern&aacute;ndez,
Red Hat 5.0</p><p>There is nothing you can do about it. What actually happens
is that Netscape uses SMTP to send mail, and SMTP doesn't require
any kind of session or login. Netscape (or any other mail client,
for that matter) connects to the
<span   class="bold"><b>sendmail</b></span> running on your server,
gives it your piece of e-mail, and your server relays it to the
Internet. Anyone can send mail as anyone else (especially on a
Windows machine, since it doesn't provide the
<span   class="bold"><b>ident</b></span> service and doesn't return a
result that can be trusted). If you look in e-mail headers, most of
the information (outside of the <b  >Received</b> lines)
can easily be spoofed. &mdash;Marc Merlin,
marc.merlin@magic.metawire.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ce1580.0x1dd9450"></a>Keyboard Troubles</h2></div></div><p>I run a small web-hosting service in San Juan, Puerto Rico.
The keyboard of one of my servers has stopped responding to Linux
boots and I can access it only through TELNET. The server there has
no response from the keyboard. My guess is that it was hacked as
security in my network is just starting to be updated. Can you
please help?</p><p>I've been told that by closing the unused ports I can have a
  more secure environment&mdash;how is that done? &mdash;Frank Nazario, Red Hat
5.0</p><p>The keyboard not working sounds like a hardware problem. Will
the keyboard let you go into the BIOS setup?</p><p>As far as security goes, first of all edit /etc/inetd.conf
and comment out anything you aren't sure you need, then restart
<span   class="bold"><b>inetd</b></span> (with <b  >killall -HUP
inetd</b>). If it turns out you need something you commented
out, just go back in to /etc/inetd.conf and uncomment it, then
restart inetd again.</p><p>Then you'll want to kill any daemons you don't need. Be a
little more careful here&mdash;make sure you don't kill off things like
<span   class="bold"><b>atd</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>crond</b></span>. On the average server, you
can (and should) kill off things like
<span   class="bold"><b>lpd</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>nfs</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>portmap</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>smb</b></span>. Run /usr/sbin/ntsysv (a very
handy utility included with Red Hat 5.x) and uncheck things that
shouldn't be started. Then reboot or do:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
for file in /etc/rc.d/rc3.d/K* ;
do $file stop ;
done
</pre><p>to make sure the things that shouldn't be running
aren't.
</p><p>The other important thing you want to do is keep up with
updates from Red Hat. There have been some pretty major security
holes announced recently, so you'll want to get all the updates on
a regular basis. &mdash;Steven Pritchard, steve@silug.org</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ce1580.0x1dd9a80"></a>Rebel CD-ROM</h2></div></div><p>My ATAPI CD-ROM won't eject or unmount in X&mdash;I get an error
message saying the drive is busy. I tried closing everything but
one X term and made sure the current directory wasn't in the CD,
but it still says it's busy. Quitting X solves this problem. &mdash;John
Vestrum, Red Hat 5.0</p><p>In my experience, this problem has been caused by a CD player
running in a menu/button bar (such as AfterStep's &ldquo;wharf&rdquo; button
bar) or a player that did not exit correctly after being used. Make
sure there are absolutely no audio CD players running anywhere&mdash;if
necessary, disable CD players you may have in a &ldquo;wharf&rdquo; type
button bar&mdash;and see if that helps. &mdash;Erik Ratcliffe,

I need a new modem first so I don't lose WWW access. My current
modem is a &ldquo;Windows only&rdquo; US Robotics Winmodem&mdash;yeah, I know&mdash;but
it was cheap.</p><p>Do I need a new modem, or is there a driver available that
  enables use of this Winmodem under Red Hat 5.0? &mdash;Bill Brower, Red
Hat 5.0</p><p>Sorry, but unfortunately you need a &ldquo;real&rdquo; modem.
By &ldquo;real&rdquo;, I mean one that simply presents a serial interface to
the hardware or plugs directly into a serial port. The problem with
the &ldquo;Winmodem&rdquo; is that it does all the signal processing using
the CPU of the host computer instead of having its own CPU to do
the grunt work. I don't want to debate the relative merits of that
process here, but suffice it to say that I will never
buy a Winmodem nor will anyone I know. &mdash;Donnie Barnes,
redhat@redhat.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ce1580.0x1dd9d98"></a>Poor FTP Speeds</h2></div></div><p>I am getting very poor FTP speeds, but
speeds of remote X applications are fine, 1.5MB/sec. I am using a
Linksys Pocket Ethernet adapter on LPT1 and the de620 driver.
Typing the command <b  >more&nbsp;/proc/dev/net</b> shows
&ldquo;no lost&rdquo;, and
<b  >colls&nbsp;packets...&nbsp;dmesg</b> shows &ldquo;etho:
Page out of sync! Restoring...&rdquo; During FTP testing, I got a few
&ldquo;Illegal Packet size -4! Illegal Packet size 24!&rdquo; messages when I
changed the window size for that route by adding:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
-net xxx.xxx.xxx.0 netmask 255.255.255.0
dev eth0 window X X= default,
8000, 800, 400, ...
</pre><p>The adapter seems to be working well from the X application
testing, but FTP is useless. It starts fine (first set of packets)
and quickly slows to a crawl, never to pass 2MB. Any ideas?  &mdash;James
T. Billups III, Red Hat 5.0
</p><p>All I can think of is that you are running with a
bi-directional printer port. Try changing this port back to
&ldquo;normal&rdquo; (sometimes referred to as SPP) in your CMOS setup, or on
your I/O card if it's not a built-in motherboard-type printer port
and see if that helps. The source code for the de620 driver
includes some comments that indicate this is the mode your printer
port should be in when using this adapter. &mdash;Erik Ratcliffe,
erik@caldera.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ce1580.0x1dda058"></a>Ugly Back Slashes</h2></div></div><p>My question is about /etc/issue. I edited this file to show
the name of my computer and it contains some backslash characters.
I had to write these as \\ (double backslash) because one backslash
is used as an escape character. But, when I access my computer
through TELNET, both backslashes appear and look quite unpleasant.
Is there any way of avoiding this? &mdash;Mihai Bisca</p><p>Your <span   class="bold"><b>getty</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>telnetd</b></span> parse the /etc/issue file
in a different way. Create an /etc/issue.net file to provide a
message for telnetd, while /etc/issue is reserved for local use.
Naturally, this depends on the internals of getty and telnetd, and
yours may be different from mine.  &mdash;Alessandro Rubini,
rubini@linux.it</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ce1580.0x1dda268"></a>Blank Screen</h2></div></div><p>Whenever I try to run X Windows, I get a blank screen after
some disk action. I've tried the S3 server, an S3 card, the SVGA
generic, the VGA generic and the unsupported VGA generic; all give
me the same blank screen. I know my settings are right for
everything else. I can continue working in other VCs, but they are
all blank as well. I know I'm using them, because I get beeps at
the right time, etc. I guess it's a problem with my video settings,
but I've tried everything and can't fix it. &mdash;David Tilleyshort,
Slackware 3.4</p><p>Odds are there is a mismatch between the frequency settings
you have passed in your X configuration and the frequencies
supported by your monitor. Make sure you have the correct frequency
ranges for your monitor in the XF86Config file; check the
documentation that came with your monitor to be sure. If you don't
have the documentation, a good generic set of ranges for a low-end
multi-frequency SVGA monitor are 31-38 horizontal and 50-90
vertical.</p><p>One side note: some &ldquo;green PC&rdquo; monitors actually shut down
after X starts. There may be parameters which can be passed to your
X server to disable this behavior; check the various README files
and documentation on XFree86 Org's web site:
http://www.xfree86.org/. &mdash;Erik Ratcliffe, erik@caldera.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ce1580.0x1dda420"></a>Establishing an ISP Connection</h2></div></div><p>I can establish an ISP connection. I cannot use a browser,
FTP or TELNET. I get an error message like &ldquo;cannot find URL&rdquo;. I
am using Xisp to connect and have made a symbolic link from
/dev/modem to /dev/ttys1. Can you help me?  &mdash;Ric Stattin, Caldera
1.2</p><p>Chances are your name server isn't entered in
/etc/resolv.conf. The format of this file is as follows (from
comments in resolv.conf generated by LISA):</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# possible entries are:
# gethostbyname syscall is used to
# search &lt;list_of_domains&gt; Search list for
# hostname lookup.
#
# nameserver &lt;ip_addr&gt; Define which server to
# contact for DNS lookups. If there are
# multiple nameserver lines (Max=3),
# they are queried in the listed order.
</pre><p>There is also a &ldquo;domain&rdquo; entry (of which you can
have only one). So, a sample resolv.conf file might look like
this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
domain caldera.com
search caldera.com personal.net
nameserver 192.168.1.1
nameserver 192.168.1.126
</pre><p>These entries will need to be changed for individual
setups, of course. The name server IP address will need to be
obtained from your system administrator or ISP. Once you have this
information in the /etc/resolv.conf file, you should be able to
connect to remote hosts by name. &mdash;David M. Brown,

masters on 2-IDE and a Delta as slave on 2-IDE; both drives are
recognized by the kernel as hdc and hdd), I get an error message
which states, &ldquo;mount fs: type 9660 not supported by kernel&rdquo;. I
have tried to modify the /etc/fstab with:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/dev/hdc /mnt/cdrom iso9660 noauto 0,0
/dev/hdd /mnt/cdrom01 iso9660 noauto 0,0
</pre><p>I still get the same error. Can you help me? &mdash;Kim Nielsen,
Red Hat 5.1
</p><p>This is happening because your kernel wasn't compiled to
support the iso9660 file system, and you don't seem to be able to
load the module. Try this first:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
moremagic:~# cat /proc/filesystems
 ext2
 minix
nodev proc
 vfat
nodev autofs
nodev nfs
        iso9660
</pre><p>If you don't see iso9660, you should have an isofs
module (unless you recompiled your own kernel). If typing
<b  >insmod&nbsp;isofs</b> and then mounting your CD-ROM
works, your problem may be that
<span   class="bold"><b>kerneld</b></span> isn't running.
Try:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
moremagic:~# ps auxww | grep kernel[dD]
root 38 0.0 0.3 756 364 ? S 01:15 0:00 /sbin/kerneld
</pre><p>If kerneld is not there, you will need to start it
yourself. &mdash;Marc Merlin, marc.merlin@magic.metawire.com
