    The future of Linux in the SOHO environment.

installment of our three-part series, Migrating to Linux from a
Commercial Operating System. In the first article, I discussed some
of the reasons why many people are switching to Linux as their
desktop OS of choice for common, day-to-day tasks. The second one
covered a few of the essential tasks that the small office/home
office (SOHO) user of Linux should be familiar with, such as
backups, emergency disks and other administrative tasks. In the
final installment of this series, I'll take a look at what the
future holds for non-technical end users who choose to migrate to
Linux as their desktop operating system.
</p><p>First, let's take another look at perhaps the biggest problem
with using Linux as a desktop OS&mdash;the fact that Linux is often
perceived as a &ldquo;hackers only&rdquo; OS. Linux is commonly regarded as a
rough-hewn, not ready-for-prime-time toy, made by and for geeks.
That image scares away a lot of potential end users, especially
those whose first exposure to Linux may be from techie friends or
from people in the IS department where they work.</p><p>For a significant portion of the history of Linux, that image
was basically true. Linux had little to offer the end user. Just
dialing into one's PPP account was a pain, let alone trying to
configure the X Window system to one's taste or writing a complex
document for a demanding client. Now, as simplified installation
and more user-friendly GUI tools are becoming available, that is no
longer the case. Yet the aura of Linux as a hackers' clique
continues to some degree&mdash;perhaps due to inertia or the inherently
decentralized method of disseminating information within the Linux
community.</p><p>What will it take to dispel that myth once and for all? There
is no simple answer. Short of a very well-funded marketing blitz
and concerted information campaign in the popular media (not
likely), it will not happen overnight. Within the Linux community
is a lot of debate as to what constitutes effective advocacy. It is
beyond the scope of this article to address each and every possible
method of advocating Linux and open source software in general.
However, I do feel there are a few things that every Linux end user
can and should do to represent Linux and tout it as a viable
desktop system for SOHO users.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Your successful use of Linux is the
greatest advertising.</b></span> In other words, if you are
successfully using Linux, let people know. If you are ever asked
what version of MS Windows you are using, be frank&mdash;explain that
Windows does not suit your needs, so you are using Linux. Usually,
that statement is followed by something to the effect of &ldquo;Linux?
What's that?&rdquo; That's your opening to describe&mdash;or if you are in
front of your Linux box, show&mdash;to them what Linux is and what it
does. Whenever I go through this speech, I usually get a response
like &ldquo;but I am okay with Windows&rdquo;. For some people, that's true.
But a gentle reminder of how many times they end up rebooting
Windows every week, day or hour may prompt them to ask more
questions. On the other hand, don't be afraid to discuss some of
the trials you have been through with Linux. No one is going to
believe you if you present Linux as the Holy Grail of the computing
world. Linux has its flaws, too. The difference is that there is an
international cadre of conscientious programmers out there working
to smooth out these bumps in Linux.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Support those who develop the software
you use.</b></span> It is important that those who develop software
are rewarded in some capacity. Note that this applies to Open
Source packages as well as commercial products. For many free
software programmers, the reward is in the doing. Commercial
software manufacturers are in it to earn money. Whatever the
rationale and reasoning of the developers, they deserve support. If
you find a piece of Open Source/freeware useful, let the developers
know. Provide them with a bug report or a well-thought-out feature
request. Let others know you are using that software, and share the
URL of where to find it. If you are using a piece of commercial
software, make sure you have registered the product and paid the
licensing fee. Then, send any comments or constructive criticisms
to the publisher. This lets the publisher know that their product
is used and appreciated, and it may lead to more companies porting
their products to Linux.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Help others migrate.</b></span> Here is
perhaps the best way to further Linux in the SOHO market. By
helping newcomers get a Linux system up and running and helping
them find the software tools they need, you'll be directly
expanding the installed base of Linux. This may sound elementary,
but helping another end user get a Linux box up and running
requires a bit of time and effort. When I first dove into Linux, I
wasted hours looking for solutions to problems that another user
with just slightly more experience could have solved in a matter of
minutes. Offer your best advice when asked, and volunteer to help
if needed. That's why Linux exists in the first place&mdash;thanks to
the combined efforts of a volunteer crew of users and
programmers.</p><p>If we all take the above steps (at the very least), we will
continue to see a growth in the number of end users who turn to
Linux as their desktop system of choice. Perhaps the most
impressive action that will lead to increased acceptance of Linux
by end users is the refinement of Linux distributions and wider
marketing of their products. By making distributions more stable,
easier to install and easier to understand, commercial Linux
developers are greatly enhancing ease of use for end users of
Linux. Wider marketing means more exposure and a less mysterious
aura surrounding Linux. These days, you can stroll into several
mainstream software retailers and bookstores and walk out with the
world's most powerful PC operating system for under fifty dollars
(US).</p><p>Still, as a SOHO Linux user, I notice two major weaknesses
working against Linux as a SOHO operating system. Number one is the
support issue. While the Linux community is famous for its
voluntary support resources, we still must contend with what
appears to the end user as a lack of support. Although I don't
claim to be an expert on software marketing, I have noticed a
pattern in the way end users perceive the support services of
software publishers. Basically, it seems to me that few consumers
have much respect for the support behind any software, let alone
free or Open Source products. People do care about technical
support, especially in the early stages of installing and using a
product. Since consumer expectations are very high and their
perceptions of services provided are already very low, any
impression of a lack of support will push many potential Linux
consumers into an &ldquo;I can't buy that&rdquo; mindset.</p><p>The second major weakiness is the limited availability of
end-user applications. While Linux is famous for native ports of
best-in-class software like Apache, few, if any, desktop
productivity applications are available for Linux that you can
honestly say are the best on the market. The recent decision by
Netscape to free the source code to its Communicator 5 product, and
the decision by Corel to port their productivity applications to
Linux, may show more of the corporate world that faith in the
future of Linux is well-founded. Again, the Linux community is
working against appearances and perceptions rather than
realities&mdash;on paper, it looks as if the available pool of SOHO
productivity applications for Linux is rather dry.</p><p>There is much talk about what will be the single (or few)
most important &ldquo;killer application(s)&rdquo; that finally push Linux
into critical mass in the network server market. Oracle, Sybase and
names of other large-scale products are often mentioned. (Oracle
and Informix have both announced ports to Linux.) The issue is a
bit different when we are considering &ldquo;killer applications&rdquo; for
the SOHO market. Most likely, no single product will make Linux
more viable as a desktop solution; instead, it will be the
collection of productivity tools that makes more end users feel
comfortable enough to abandon their commercial OS. Right now, the
compendium of end-user tools is small, but growing.</p><p>Now, I guess one of the key questions to resolve is this: how
can we SOHO end users of Linux do our part to solve the support
issue and encourage the development of more desktop productivity
applications? Honestly, I don't know of any &ldquo;silver bullet&rdquo;
answers.</p><p>The support issue can be addressed by following the three
suggestions made earlier, along with some of the advice from the
second article in this series. Eventually, I believe we need to see
dramatic improvements in several key areas, including but not
limited to documentation, the SOHO end-user support network and
more easily installed and configured software tools.</p><p>As for documentation, it's easy to see why programmers hate
doing it&mdash;it's tedious and may seem peripheral to the real goal of
the project, which is producing the software. However, the
documentation is often the key to selling the software (whether
commercial or Open Source) to potential users. How many times have
you installed a software package, and then been left on your own to
figure out how to use it? If it means users of free software have
to pay for third-party documentation of the program, then so be it.
Remember, the key to success for the SOHO user is usability and
productivity&mdash;whatever gets us there reliably and inexpensively is
good.</p><p>When thinking about the SOHO end-user support network, it is
tempting to point out the obvious&mdash;there is plenty of help
available to end users in the existing support resources. While
that is true, it is also quite tempting to imagine a scenario where
SOHO Linux users have his own support network. Perhaps we need a
new newsgroup, mailing lists and web sites devoted to our
needs.</p><p>Making software easier to install, configure and use is a
mantra being chanted throughout the software development world,
regardless of the OS. One very exciting aspect of the growing Linux
community is that more Open Source developers are turning their
skills and attention toward end-user tools. The GIMP and KDE may be
the best current examples. Such a combined resource pool of
programming talent will naturally produce a host of higher quality
products than can be achieved in the corporate world of tight
deadlines, limited resources and expectations of marketability. I
predict that the next few years will see a wealth of extremely
high-quality, Open Source software tools for the SOHO end
user.</p><p>Can we as SOHO users depend on Open Source developers to
produce all of the software we need to get our work done?
Eventually, maybe so. Right now, some of our needs would be best
met by porting existing software to Linux. Personally, I have a
dozen or so commercial software applications on my list of things
I'd like to see ported to Linux. Every SOHO user can probably name
a few of their own &ldquo;dream ports&rdquo;. How can we encourage the
porting of software? Number one is to follow our earlier point of
rewarding vendors who port their software. Positive feedback and
payment of licensing fees will encourage developers to invest the
time and energy in porting their products to Linux. Another
approach is to visit the Linux Resources &ldquo;Wish List&rdquo; and suggest
software you'd like to see ported to Linux. Your input on the page
(http://www.linuxresources.com/wish/) will help the Linux community
encourage more vendors to port their useful software to
Linux.</p><p>While this series has been far from exhaustive, we've taken a
stab at discussing the issues a SOHO end user needs to consider
when migrating to Linux. The SOHO end user market is not the first
niche one thinks of when examining how Linux will fit into the
future of computing, but the issues of stability and quality that
make Linux the best server platform also apply to the
desktop.</p><p>Are you thinking of migrating to Linux for your personal
desktop needs? I hope this series has helped you make up your mind.
Have you already begun the process of migrating away from MS
Windows or another OS? Then maybe some of the experiences shared
herein can be of value. Are you a software publisher or vendor who
is examining the future of Linux as a potential SOHO environment?
Please rest assured there are non-technically oriented end-user
types who see in Linux an alternative to poorer-quality commercial
operating systems. While we may not be pioneers in the same vein as
Linus Torvalds, we are on the cutting edge of adopting a better,
more reliable way of getting our daily tasks done. Good
luck!</p></div></div>
