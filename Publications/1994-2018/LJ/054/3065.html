    Mr. Saladino gives a quick introduction to EXPECT, a
    program to help you accomplish your remote tasks.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x254d580.0x2645348"></a></h2></div></div><p>As the System Administrator for 18 VAXs
and 6 HP/UNIX machines, I am always looking for an easier way to do
things. One thing I always do is write shell scripts for UNIX and
command procedures for VMS to automate some of my tasks. If I could
run them from one computer, I could administer the world from one
place without logging on to each computer to run each task I have
to perform.
</p><p>I first tried using VAX/VMS command files in order to TELNET
to the other machines. That method was quickly dropped, as the
remote computer's I/O response arrived before my command file could
do an input statement. Logons hung up quickly. I then tried to
TELNET from a UNIX script&mdash;the same thing occurred. This type of
frustration is why an administrator's job is tough.</p><p>Hanging out in a Barnes &amp; Noble bookstore and leaning on
the UNIX shelves is always a good pastime&mdash;you look good, and you
help dust off the books. Leaning is how I discovered
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Exploring EXPECT</em></span>, an interesting title for a
book with a back cover stating &ldquo;automate TELNET, FTP, passwd...&rdquo;.
I bought the book&mdash;yes, I judge a book by its cover
(sometimes).</p><p>The excellent book, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Exploring EXPECT</em></span> by
Don Libes (published by O'Reilly &amp; Associates) contains
everything you need to know about controlling any spawned process.
You can spawn a game and interact with it as easily as a remote
TELNET session. The book is fairly long and very detailed, but
don't be intimidated. There is an easy way to learn to write EXPECT
scripts; I'll get to it shortly.</p><p>To make a long story short, EXPECT is a toolkit for
automating interactive programs, such as TELNET and FTP, written by
Don Libes. EXPECT has to be the greatest asset to system
administrators in all of history. Finally, I can easily write and
execute TELNET logon scripts and do whatever I wish using a script
file from one machine.</p><p>EXPECT reads commands from a script file, spawns a process
like TELNET, sends text from the script file to the TELNET process,
saves every character returned from the TELNET session, and
&ldquo;looks&rdquo; for known character strings that the user &ldquo;expected&rdquo;.
The script can test for different strings and execute different
code based on the results. TELNET scripts can have a lot of
intelligence built into them.</p><p>The first day at work after buying the book, I logged on to
one of my HP/UNIX machines, did a <b  >man expect</b> and
received the message &ldquo;no entry found&rdquo;. After a few more tries, I
made a call to HP. EXPECT and Tcl, the language EXPECT is based on,
are not installed and are not even supplied on the CD-ROM
distribution media from HP. HP recommended I download Tcl and
EXPECT from a web site and install them. I do not like to do this
sort of operation on a production server. After delivering a few
favorite curse words, I went to my desktop Linux system.</p><p>When I installed Linux, I carved out a 1GB partition, did a
full Linux install and dual booted it with MS Windows. A two-minute
reboot, and Linux was up and running. Again, I ran <b  >man
expect</b>. This time, I got a man page&mdash;a very long and
informative man page.</p><p>&ldquo;Introduction EXPECT&rdquo; is a program that &ldquo;talks&rdquo; to other
interactive programs according to a script. Does this mean I have
it? I ran the command</p><pre     class="programlisting">
find / -name expect
</pre><p>and got this result:
<pre     class="programlisting">
/var/lib/LST/installed/expect
/var/lib/LST/contents/expect
/usr/bin/expect
</pre>


Oh yeah, I've got it&mdash;I love Linux!
</p><p>Poking around /usr/bin with the command
<b  >ll&nbsp;|&nbsp;more</b>, I found
<span   class="bold"><b>autoexpect</b></span>. What's autoexpect?
It's not in the book, so I typed
<b  >man&nbsp;autoexpect</b> and received the following
output:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
autoexpect - generate an EXPECT script from watching a session.
</pre><p>This is a cool program. I can run a TELNET or FTP session to
a VAX from Linux, and create an EXPECT script from the session that
I can run any time I wish.
</p><p>Nothing beats actually doing it. I logged on to a VAX with
FTP, <span   class="bold"><b>put</b></span> a file and quit. I copied
the man page for EXPECT to a file, then I put it on a VAX using
FTP.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
man expect | col -b &gt; man_expect.txt
</pre><p>Next, I used FTP to connect to a VAX named ZEUS and put the
file man_expect.txt on that machine.
<pre     class="programlisting">
autoexpect -f test1.exp FTP ZEUS
autoexpect started, file is test1.exp
connected to ZEUS
220 Zeus FTP Server
Name (zeus:vinnie): v12321
Password:
230 User logged in.
Remote system type is VMS.
FTP&gt; put man_expect.txt
 ...
FTP&gt; quit
221 Goodbye.
Autoexpect done, file is test1.exp
</pre>


The file test1.exp is the script created by autoexpect. I can rerun
this script any time I wish simply by typing
<b  >test1.exp</b> at the prompt. Examining test1.exp
shows the details of the two-way conversation between the Linux
machine and the VAX. Every character is saved in either a
<span   class="bold"><b>send</b></span> or
<span   class="bold"><b>expect</b></span> command. Even the password
is saved, so care must be taken with these scripts.
</p><p>I edited my test1.exp script to eliminate the comments. I
also took out all the non-essential expect commands, leaving only
the bare essentials. The script was short and sweet. The whole
concept of EXPECT is quite simple&mdash;send commands as normally typed,
such as the VAX FTP prompt:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
expect -exact "FTP&gt; "
</pre><p>TELNET was easy too, but the script created by autoexpect
would not run. Why? The basic problem of getting two computers to
talk to each other is that they never say exactly the same thing
twice; in particular, time and date character strings are always
changing. Don points this out in the man pages for EXPECT, and
again in his book.
</p><p>When I used TELNET to log in to my VAX, the first thing it
returned to me after the &ldquo;Welcome&rdquo; message was the time and date.
After I did a &ldquo;Directory Listing&rdquo;, the file names and total
number of files were returned. These responses vary with time.
Removing them from the autoexpect scripts causes them to rerun
perfectly every time. I wrote this article as an introduction to
EXPECT, and to show how easy it is to use. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Exploring
EXPECT</em></span> goes into detail on all the different aspects of
EXPECT&mdash;from how it all works, to programming two-way conversations
in EXPECT and how to log selected EXPECT output to a file. Many
things you never thought could be automated can be run while you
sit back and enjoy reading <i  >Linux Journal</i>.</p></div></div>
