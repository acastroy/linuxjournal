was set up as a panel discussion and was held at the Santa Clara
Convention Center (in the heart of Silicon Valley) on the evening
of July 14, 1998. It was hosted by Taos Mountain and the Silicon
Valley Linux Users Group (SVLUG), and was sponsored by them, Intel,
Red Hat, <i  >Linux Journal</i> and VA Research.
Apparently it was considerably more popular than Taos expected;
people stood in line for up to an hour to register, and the free
food and free VA Research/Linux T-shirts ran out. I didn't get a
firm count, but Taos said 850 people had returned their RSVP, and
my estimate is 700 to 900 attended.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3108f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Linus Torvalds and the Panel
</p></div></div><p>The panel was a distinguished group: Jeremy Allison, one of
the lead Samba developers; Larry Augustin, founder of VA Research
and member of the Linux International Board of Directors; Robert
Hart, from Red Hat Software; Sunil Saxena, from Intel's UNIX
Performance Lab; and, of course, The Man himself, Linus Torvalds.
(While I know there are a lot of Linux fans who like to pronounce
&ldquo;Linux&rdquo; with a long &ldquo;i&rdquo; sound (LYE-nucks), and despite the fact
that Linus himself doesn't care how anyone else pronounces it, he
unquestionably did so with a short &ldquo;i&rdquo; as in &ldquo;linen&rdquo;
(LINN-ucks). In Swedish he presumably still pronounces it the third
way, roughly &ldquo;LEE-nooks.&rdquo;) The discussion was moderated by
Michael Masterson of Taos, who traded off questioning duties with
Phil Hughes, all-around hairy guy and publisher of <i  >Linux Journal</i>.</p><p>

</p><p>Linus Torvalds responds to a question from the audience. Ben
Spade, president of the Silicon Valley Linux User Group, serves as
microphone wrangler.
</p><p>I did not have a tape recorder, so answers are paraphrases of
what was actually said. [<span   class="emphasis"><em>Comments in square brackets are
my personal asides.</em></span>]</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x182c580.0x1924d98"></a>Phil Hughes' Questions</h2></div></div><p>1. How much bigger will the Linux market be in 2000?</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Jeremy Allison said 20% to 25% of shipping Intel
systems will have Linux pre-installed.</p></li><li><p>Linus Torvalds said that he's always been bad at
predicting things and basically weaseled out of answering the
question.</p></li><li><p>Sunil Saxena also declined to speculate.</p></li><li><p>Larry Augustin said that Linux would be the #1 UNIX
by 2000.</p></li><li><p>Robert Hart mentioned the Datapro report that
showed only two operating systems increased their corporate market
share in 1997; Linux was one of them. He said the doubling time was
12 months, which would imply between 20 million and 40 million
Linux users; &ldquo;I'll be surprised if we don't go beyond
that.&rdquo;</p></li></ul></div><p>2. World domination: how much longer? [in reference to Linus'
rather famous stated goal in his .sig or .plan or something]</p><p>Linus Torvalds: &ldquo;That used to be a joke... [<span   class="emphasis"><em>much
laughter</em></span>] ...and it's becoming less and less so.&rdquo; He
said his ego hopes it will happen in five to ten years; but more
realistically, he hopes that in five to ten years no one dominates
the industry.</p><p>3. What is Samba's role in Linux's acceptance?</p><p>Jeremy Allison first asked for a show of hands; it appeared
that roughly 40% of the audience used Samba. Then he gave the short
answer to the question: Samba &ldquo;essentially allows people to remove
NT servers.&rdquo; He noted that SGI is officially adopting Samba
[<span   class="emphasis"><em>recall that they, like HP, are now selling NT systems as
the low end of their product line</em></span>] and that &ldquo;some crazy
folks are running it straight off of CDs with 200 users&rdquo; (mostly
universities who &ldquo;do not want NT&rdquo;). By the end of the year, he
hopes that Samba will be able to completely replace all primary NT
Server functions.</p><p>4. Open Source is obviously just another fad&mdash;isn't
it?</p><p>Larry Augustin was the first to disagree; he said that Open
Source is here to stay&mdash;for example, it allows a company like
Netscape to compete on its own terms with Microsoft, not on
Microsoft's terms. It also supports a Darwinian model: if one
vendor's support is lacking, you've got the source and can take
your money (and business) elsewhere. That's not possible with the
closed-source model epitomized by Microsoft.</p><p>Robert Hart expanded on that point: it's all about control.
If you need a new feature or bug fix or other customization, you
can simply hire someone to do it for you. &ldquo;You don't need anyone's
permission; just do it!&rdquo; I believe he related an example of a
company with a large application that was in dire need of a bug
fix; they were willing to spend essentially any amount of money or
manpower to get the thing working, but their vendor was
unresponsive and they had no real alternatives.</p><p>Jeremy Allison claimed that he was fundamentally &ldquo;a lazy
programmer&rdquo; and that the Open Source model is a way of letting
users do the work [<span   class="emphasis"><em>more laughter</em></span>]. He
mentioned that some incredible Samba patches occasionally turn up
in his e-mail&mdash;often oddball customizations useful to only a few
people, but to them they're extremely useful. &ldquo;Imagine asking
Microsoft to do a custom NT Server for your site.&rdquo;</p><p>5. What will be the long-term effects on Linux of Microsoft's
recent win against Netscape (i.e., bundling MSIE in Win98)?</p><p>Linus Torvalds dismissed the Department of Justice and the
U.S. legal system as important factors in Linux's future; &ldquo;the
only thing that will matter is the market.&rdquo; In fact, he claimed
it's an advantage since there are many companies who find it hard
to compete, when Microsoft sees what they're doing and simply
incorporates similar technology directly into the OS. In the Linux
arena they can find a niche and compete (echoing Larry's comments
above), as Corel has, for example. &ldquo;That's one reason why, in the
end, a monopoly just doesn't work. [<span   class="emphasis"><em>pause</em></span>]
Maybe that's just me...&rdquo;</p><p>6. What do we need to do to get applications (such
as from Adobe and Quark, which are the only non-Linux applications
used by <i  >Linux Journal</i>), ported to Linux?</p><p>Robert Hart said there are just two things: let them know you
want Linux ports, and show them there's profit to be made.</p><p>Larry Augustin related an article seen on Slashdot earlier in
the day about Informix's unannounced Linux port and said the key is
to tell vendors, &ldquo;If you port it to Linux, we will buy it.&rdquo;
[<span   class="emphasis"><em>Three days later, Slashdot and InfoWorld Electric
reported a sudden reversal of plans at Oracle: they will be porting
Oracle 8 to Linux after all. In fact, they say they've had it
running internally for a while already. See also InfoWorld
Electric's article on Informix's official Linux announcement, made
on July 22.</em></span>]</p><p>7. With regard to the Linux Standard Base (a standard for
base-level compatibility across Linux distributions): Red Hat and
Debian's standard package formats, Red Hat's early adoption of
glibc vs. everyone else, etc., are we doing this right? Are there
too many Linux &ldquo;standards&rdquo;?</p><p>Robert Hart had three points in response. First, a lot of
discussion goes on between the various distribution makers,
precisely for the purpose of avoiding fragmentation. Second, we
have a danger of stultifying and crushing the rapid pace of
development and the incredible customization choices available to
users if we have too much rigidity and standardization. Third, to
the other distributions: &ldquo;Please get with it&mdash;glibc is the only
actively maintained C library.&rdquo;</p><p>Larry Augustin countered that he's seen a lot of users who,
when they upgraded to Red Hat 5.x, found that &ldquo;everything broke&rdquo;.
[<span   class="emphasis"><em>Thanks to Jason Riedy for the reminder that just
installing the older libc 5.4.x somewhere in the library path isn't
sufficient; most shared libraries used by older applications need
to be duplicated, as was the case in the changeover from a.out to
ELF binaries a couple of years ago.</em></span>] &ldquo;You're in the big
time now. Some things (like Informix) users can't simply
recompile&mdash;try to make things easier for people and remain
compatible.&rdquo;</p><p>8. What if Microsoft plays the Linux game? For example, Open
Windows 99 or Internet Explorer for Linux?</p><p>Linus Torvalds first noted that he's working at a company
[<span   class="emphasis"><em>Transmeta</em></span>] whose product won't be available
on the Internet. He went on to say that he has a lot of respect for
Microsoft's PR machine, and &ldquo;let's hope they do.&rdquo;</p><p>Jeremy Allison apparently interpreted &ldquo;Open Windows 99&rdquo; as
a hypothetical Microsoft release based on Linux, and said he would
welcome MS Linux&mdash;the GNU General Public License (GPL) limits
abuse. &ldquo;If they change it, we'd get the source code,&rdquo; to which
Linus muttered, &ldquo;We could fix it, too.&rdquo; [<span   class="emphasis"><em>much applause
and laughter</em></span>]</p><p>9. NASA, NIST, the U.S. Postal Service, the IRS all use
Linux&mdash;is the U.S. Government the first step toward world
domination?</p><p>Linus Torvalds: &ldquo;I hadn't really thought of that, but now
that you've planted the idea...&rdquo; [<span   class="emphasis"><em>more
chuckles</em></span>]</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x182c580.0x191c5a0"></a>Prepared Question #1</h2></div></div><p>Is Linux superior, comparable, or inferior to commercial
operating systems? [or something like that]</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Jeremy Allison (Samba)</b></span>:
[<span   class="emphasis"><em>I think he was one of the panelists who made the comment
that &ldquo;Linux is a commercial OS&rdquo;; his answer amounted to choice
#1:</em></span>]</p><p>Linux is very standards-compliant (e.g., Posix); a good
approach is to develop first on Linux, then port to a proprietary
UNIX system. For example, Samba has three separate pieces of code
to deal with some aspect of file-system stuff; Linux supports all
three interfaces, so they just choose the one that runs the
fastest.</p><p>He gave a wish list of improvements he'd like to see, though:
64-bit file-system support (&ldquo;for those 20GB Exchange databases&rdquo;);
access control list (ACL) support; asynchronous I/O support; NFS
file-locking and improved performance [<span   class="emphasis"><em>amen to
that</em></span>]; and a thread model like Solaris.</p><p>He noted that Linux has current support for more platforms
than any other OS: x86, SPARC, Alpha, Power PC, 68k, etc. Bugs are
fixed the fastest, especially security leaks.</p><p>There's been a Linux &ldquo;iBCS&rdquo; module to support SCO UNIX
binaries for a couple of years; at this year's USENIX, SCO
announced (and demoed) a module to run Linux applications.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Larry Augustin (VA
Research)</b></span>: His answer was &ldquo;yes&rdquo;. Linux is not (yet) as
far along as Solaris in supporting 64-way symmetric
multi-processing (SMP). [<span   class="emphasis"><em>I thought the SPARC-based
Fujitsu AP1000+ on which David S. Miller reported success last year
was a big SMP box, but as Jason Riedy pointed out, it's a
distributed-memory multi-computer similar to the Connection Machine
CM5.</em></span>]</p><p>In his slides of user ratings (Datapro survey, which was
mentioned several times during the evening), Linux was not only the
overall winner in a field of half a dozen operating systems
(Windows NT placed last), it also won in all but two
categories&mdash;and only Digital UNIX was rated higher in those two
(availability and performance). The other categories included
reliability, technical support, price, etc.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Robert Hart (Red Hat)</b></span>: Linux
is a commercial operating system. It is sold and supported
commercially (Red Hat, Caldera and others); it is used
commercially; its only difference is that the source code is freely
available.</p><p>Key &ldquo;commercial OS&rdquo; features like a journaling file system
and database access that bypasses the file system layer are coming
very soon.</p><p>Many of Red Hat's users (more with every release) have never
installed an OS, which means Red Hat has to &ldquo;reverse engineer&rdquo;
their hardware configuration.</p><p>Why is Linux not ubiquitous? It's still not suitable for
everyone (he mentioned his &ldquo;75-year-old mum&rdquo;), and although there
are good office applications for Linux, there aren't any killer
ones yet. (There were follow-ups to the suitability comment by some
of the other panelists.)</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Sunil Saxena (Intel)</b></span>: He
presented some slides that amounted to a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; response as
well.</p><p>Strengths: Linux is becoming the OS of choice of ISPs; on
32-bit Intel systems, Linux has broader device-driver support than
any other UNIX (e.g., SCO, Solaris/x86, etc.); its Open Source
model means that updates, patches and bug fixes happen in
&ldquo;Internet time.&rdquo;</p><p>Weaknesses: SMP support and scalability is still evolving
(although he noted that Leonard Zubkoff did a successful two-day
port to the brand-new, four-way Pentium II Xeon system that Intel
and VA Research showed off); good server management is missing
(e.g., using a remote serial line or modem to update things,
including the BIOS); drivers for high-end hardware tend to be
lacking; and large-memory support (say, multi-gigabyte range) isn't
there.</p><p>Making it better: he said (and repeated several times
throughout the evening) that Intel really wants to help and do more
to support Linux, and in particular, they see the following as
likely areas of collaboration:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>more than 4-way SMP (serious scalability, at least
16 to 32 processors)</p></li><li><p>drivers for high-end platforms</p></li><li><p>direct server control and management</p></li><li><p>support for PII features such as 36-bit addressing
(up to 64 GB of RAM), enhanced system calls and save/restore, MMX
instructions, the page attribute table, and on-chip performance
monitors</p></li></ul></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus Torvalds</b></span>: He started
off with a comment to the effect of, &ldquo;What can I say? I came to
listen to the others.&rdquo;</p><p>He noted that Linux originally was a one-person OS; it was
never intended to be useful to others. He also pointed out that it
has just shown up on the list of the world's most powerful
supercomputers (in a cluster design); he thought it made #316.
[<span   class="emphasis"><em>Actually #315 in the June 1998 list&mdash;see the press
release for details.</em></span>] At the other end of the spectrum,
it's being ported to Palm Pilots. &ldquo;I don't see that [<span   class="emphasis"><em>its
broad portability and usefulness</em></span>] ending any time
soon.&rdquo;</p><p>He responded to a couple of Sunil's comments:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>36-bit addressing on Intel: &ldquo;We've been doing that
on Alpha for awhile.&rdquo;</p></li><li><p>Page Attribute Table: he didn't know about Intel's
implementation but said that he'd suggested it to an Intel engineer
a few years ago; &ldquo;I don't know if they did it right, but if so,
I'll be happy to use it.&rdquo;</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x182c580.0x191d518"></a>Prepared Question #2</h2></div></div><p>Where will Linux be in two to three years?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Sunil Saxena</b></span>: &ldquo;It's all on
my foil right here.&rdquo; Among Internets/Intranets/ISPs, Linux will
continue to grow, especially in corporate America; we'll see
continued adoption.</p><p>There will be new growth in the areas of E-commerce and
business-to-business Internet EDI (electronic data
interchange).</p><p>It will start showing up in all sorts of Internet appliances,
including wearable computers, video-conferencing systems,
etc.</p><p>We'll see 64-bit Linux on the IA-64 (Merced).</p><p>Linux will move into the data center via high-availability
clusters and 16- to 32-way SMP systems.</p><p>Other spiffy features like I2O, hot swap, serial-based server
management and control, etc., will be supported.</p><p>Linux developers will be granted early access and increased
access to specs and Intel engineers.</p><p>&ldquo;Please come talk to us and tell us what we can do.&rdquo;</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Larry Augustin</b></span>: One big
prediction: kernel 2.2 will be released within three years (&ldquo;and
that's pushing it&rdquo;). [<span   class="emphasis"><em>much laughter</em></span>]</p><p>He also took the opportunity to thank Leonard Zubkoff for the
four-way Xeon port being demoed by VA Research in the rear.
Apparently he modified (added?) 20 lines of code at the last minute
without even having all of the source there.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Robert Hart</b></span>: Two to three
years is an eternity for Linux&mdash;even a week is a long time.</p><p>People are lazy, and laziness leads to creativity, which
means great improvements for Linux.</p><p>He again noted that it's the only non-MS operating system to
gain market share and that it's being actively courted by large
vendors such as Intel. He also noted that it's generating strong
media interest, and not only that, but the reporting is generally
both accurate and useful. (He thanked the representatives of the
press in the audience.)</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3108fb.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

of Taos Mountain.
</p></div></div><p>There will be a strong showing of easy-to-use
applications.</p><p>Linux will be the dominant server platform, not just on Intel
but across all platforms. I believe he mentioned &ldquo;64-bit, 4-way
Merced,&rdquo; too.</p><p>He mentioned that it was Bastille Day and recalled how, in
1788 and 1789, the people rose up and stormed the IT department and
gave freedom to oppressed machines. &ldquo;They even executed some
people.&rdquo; But he disputed his own comparison and said that Linux
isn't so much a revolution as an evolution; it didn't happen just
once.</p><p>He concluded by predicting that in two to three years, Linux
will be &ldquo;very nearly everywhere&rdquo;.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus Torvalds</b></span>: &ldquo;I'm really
bad at predictions.&rdquo; For example, a few years ago when he was
asked about SMP support, his reaction was, &ldquo;I don't know, it's too
expensive&rdquo;; he said he didn't care much about it and didn't find
it interesting. But for the last year he's worked almost
exclusively on SMP.</p><p>2.2 will be out by then. [<span   class="emphasis"><em>much more
laughter</em></span>]</p><p>The kernel is really just a vessel for what one can do; he
claimed that it was inappropriate to ask him such a
question&mdash;&ldquo;what's really exciting is applications&rdquo; (and the
journaling file system is &ldquo;slightly exciting&rdquo;).</p><p>Servers will be big. [Do we sense a theme here?]</p><p>The interesting part will be &ldquo;pretty&rdquo; applications that
traditionally haven't been UNIX-based.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Jeremy Allison</b></span>: He used to
keep track of every minor release of every piece of free software;
these days, no one can do so for even 10% of it, and there will be
some incredibly cool things in that other 90%.</p><p>Linux will be a &ldquo;killer server platform.&rdquo;</p><p>Everyone at Cisco Systems uses Linux every time they print,
whether they know it or not. [<span   class="emphasis"><em>See the c.o.l.a
announcement for details about the printer-administration tool used
at Cisco, and the article about Cisco in this
issue.</em></span>]</p><p>At least one major PC vendor will start shipping PCs with
Linux pre-installed. (If not, Robert will start such a
company.)</p><p>With regard to applications, vendors are already &ldquo;not as
greedy&rdquo; as they've traditionally been on UNIX systems; Linux
applications are priced similarly to Wintel applications, not five
times more. Linux will be on the desktop, and one will be able to
buy almost any application for Linux.</p><p>Again, he predicted that Linux will be installed on 20% to
25% of shipping Intel systems.</p><p><a href="3108s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
