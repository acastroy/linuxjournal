An easy Web-based captive Wi-Fi portal is great for users. A
Web-based captive portal system that fits on a Linksys
box is great for administrators too.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c0a580.0x1d022f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
It has become commonplace for most major cities to have a Wi-Fi
group. The Wireless Community movement has spread across
North America, Europe and has extended to Latin America and Asia. Hackers
world-wide haven't been able to keep their hands off low-cost, easily
extensible hardware. Some Wi-Fi groups get together and share technical
information and war-driving data, and other groups work on projects
setting up ad hoc mesh networks or creating free hotspots in their
favorite hangouts.
</p><p>
Two years ago, in an event similar to what has taken place in many
other cities, a group of Montr&eacute;al technology enthusiasts got together
and decided to start creating free hotspots for themselves and for other
Montr&eacute;alers. People joined the group after hearing about it through the
local open-source grapevine. Calling themselves Ile Sans Fil (French for
&ldquo;Wireless Island&rdquo;&mdash;and, yes, Montr&eacute;al is an island), they are now one of
the more active established Wi-Fi groups in the world, with 25&ndash;35 active
volunteers, 50 hotspots and 6,000 users. Their current rate of expansion is
4&ndash;8 hotspots and 1,000 users per month. Based on the number of
users, this volunteer group is the most successful of the seven Wi-Fi companies
operating in that area.
</p><p>
Ile Sans Fil (ISF, <a href="http://www.ilesansfil.org" target="_self">www.ilesansfil.org</a>) was able to get a quick start on the project
by using a popular open-source captive portal called NoCat, which did
a good job of allowing only users from a list of user names and
passwords through. A captive portal is a dynamic firewall in
which all traffic is blocked until the user logs in (or a disclaimer page
was displayed and terms of service were agreed to). The login page
works by intercepting http traffic and, in its place, displaying
a form until the user is validated. Once logged in, some, or all, ports
work normally. By nature, all captive portal authentication solutions
are vulnerable to MAC address spoofing, and as such, these are not
bulletproof. However, they have the huge advantage of not requiring any
software beyond a Web browser to perform sign-on.
</p><p>
But NoCat wasn't perfect for their needs. The NoCat gateway was a Perl
script that relied on several heavy packages. It was too big to run on
most embedded hardware, so the choice was either to run it on new machines
(possibly the small but expensive Soekris board) or to use old desktops dug
out of closets and storage areas. Although inexpensive, the result was an
open wireless access point connected to a Pentium I connected to a modem
and a WAP (wireless access point). Keeping a network of heterogeneous
secondhand Pentium Is running in public places proved to be a support
nightmare, even for the initial three or four hotspots. The NoCat central
server also lacked any network monitoring features, it was difficult
to get any useful statistics from its logs and it didn't feature any
mechanisms to serve different content for each hotspot. Finally, to keep
a user's connection alive, NoCat used a second browser window that
used JavaScript to ping the gateway every five minutes. This meant that
devices that couldn't open more than one window (such as PDAs) or that had no
(or disabled) JavaScript support were forced to re-authenticate
continuously.
</p><p>
Fortunately, two years ago a wireless router running
Linux became available (the Linksys WRT54G). It wasn't advertised as
running Linux, but the Seattle Wireless group discovered this, and the
hacking began. ISF finally had an inexpensive embedded platform to
move to. They chose OpenWRT as a distro, but NoCat and its dependencies
just wouldn't fit.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8352f1.large.jpg"><img src="8352f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Wifidog has two parts: a central authentication server and
a gateway located at each wireless hotspot.
</p></div></div><p>
And so the Wi-Fi Guard Dog captive portal system was
born. Like NoCat, Wifidog (<a href="http://www.wifidog.org" target="_self">www.wifidog.org</a>) consists of two parts:
a gateway per hotspot running a client process and
a Web-based central server (Figure 1).
</p><p>
The Wifidog gateway is written in C with no dependencies beyond the
kernel. A working gateway install can be packaged in less than 15Kb on
an i386 platform. It works well on the MIPS-based WRT54G running OpenWrt.
The Wifidog central server is written in PHP and handles authentication
and manages the network. The system knows which hotspots are up through
heartbeating from the gateway.
</p><p>
The gateway remains small and simple by delegating all cryptography to
the user's Web browser and the auth server. Tokens are generated by the
auth server upon successful authentication and are then sent to the gateway. The
gateway then validates the token with the auth server. Tokens are
revalidated periodically in case they expire.
</p><p>
How secure is it? The gateway never sees the password. The token
itself is transmitted in the clear between the gateway and the auth
server. It would be quite simple to encrypt this, but it has been
deemed unnecessary bloat, considering that it's a one-time-use token
and that to do a man-in-the-middle attack on it, an attacker needs to
be between the gateway and the auth server, in which case the attacker
already has Internet access, making the whole attack pointless. A much
more realistic attack is MAC address spoofing, which is inherently easy
to do with any captive portal software running on an open Wi-Fi network.
The only solution for this is to use WPA. Unfortunately, tech-support
realities make it completely unrealistic to require this until every
platform has a central place to enter the necessary information (not
to mention that many drivers still don't support it). The team will
eventually move toward 802.11i once support for the standard improves.
</p><p>
Of course, the Wifidog auth server handles user authentication (currently,
plugins exist for internal authentication and for authenticating to
a remote radius database, including logging the amount of traffic
transfered by each client). But the auth server does much more than
that. It handles user sign-up, real-time network monitoring, extensive
statistics about network usage patterns and hotspot popularity.
</p><p>
With Wifidog, the volunteer group had an easy way to continue deploying
hotspots while minimizing the time spent on support.
</p><p>
However, although this technically has been a successful project in creating
another open-source captive portal solution, it is only half the
story. From the beginning, ISF viewed setting up free hotspots
as only a first step. The volunteers now had the tools to draw laptop users
from their basements and home offices into public spaces. The next step
of the project was to use the network of hotspots to help create a sense
of local community.
</p><p>
One way in which that is done is through the promotion
of local content. A unique feature of the Wifidog
system is its extensive support for location-specific
content. Users connecting from Caf&eacute; Laika see an
entirely different splash page and portal page than
users connecting from Atwater Library. At first,
the only form that local content took was HTML and
RSS feeds tied to a hotspot. Fortunately, some of the
hotspots had their own RSS feeds from their Web sites.
</p><p>
Through working with a local new media arts group, the local content
feature recently was extended, so that now there is a system that
also can manage text, images, audio, video and photos from Flickr
(by using the Flickr API). All of this content can be sent across
the network or sent only to select hotspot portals. The extensive
logging functions also allow the group to show content to a user only once, only
once per hotspot, once per day. It has certainly allowed these artists some
interesting and unique possibilities for location-based art.
</p><p>
Another feature is the ability to see who else is on-line at a hotspot
(either locally or remotely) and find out more about them if they have
filled out their profile. Profiles are an opt-in feature and not
only because the group doesn't want to annoy its users. The geographical
proximity of users (in the same hotspot) raises certain safety and privacy
issues that don't exist in most instances of social-networking software.

This past summer has been gratifying for the developers as their
project has drawn the eyes of many wireless groups all over the world.
Among the groups adopting it are WirelessLondon, New York City Wireless
and Paris Sans Fil. WirelessLondon has recently started to use the
Wifidog gateway with their existing central server. Jo Walsh&mdash;member of
the group and co-author of the recent O'Reilly book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Mapping
Hacks</em></span>&mdash;writes, &ldquo;We found
it easy to customize for our needs; we adapted our portal service to it
in half an hour. The presence of an active and committed development
community around Wifidog is reassuring; we know it won't go away, and
the community's been gracefully receptive to our suggestions.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Dana Spiegel&mdash;the executive director of NYCwireless&mdash;talks about his
organization's impending trial of the captive portal, &ldquo;NYCwireless
is using the software in a pilot project and hopes to deploy it by
the end of the summer to help local hotspots showcase local talent,
multimedia sharing, art and student works. [Wifidog] is a great
collaborative effort to provide a useful solution for community wireless
networks. It enables the creation of a supported wireless network with
community-oriented and created content, and really demonstrates how
these networks and groups provide an important service to local
areas.&rdquo;
</p><p>
The group has not been surprised by the success. Benoit Gr&eacute;goire, one of
the lead developers of the group, says, &ldquo;We designed Wifidog to be the
Swiss Army knife of captive portal systems. We hoped that it could
meet the needs of most wireless community groups well enough that they
would prefer to help with its development rather than roll their own.
Now we're seeing some of the realization of that goal.&rdquo; The world
of Wi-Fi
community groups is starting to agree with them. What remains a question
is how these other groups will use Wifidog for their own networks and in
their own communities. From finding ways to make the software work (and
make sense) in a mesh network, to developing GIS applications, to adding
chat functionality to the network, there's lots of promising community and
social applications for what was originally an infrastructure project.
</p><p>
Beyond the interesting technical possibilities, it is the chance to have
an impact on the lives of their fellow citizens that seems to motivate
Wifidog developers the most. With 10,000 users expected by December
2005 in Montr&eacute;al alone, there is a good chance that their code will
be used by neighbors, coworkers and friends. That, combined with the
frequent press coverage and the chance to work with people they wouldn't
normally meet, such as artists and community activists, means the team's
energy and enthusiasm should remain high for the foreseeable future.
