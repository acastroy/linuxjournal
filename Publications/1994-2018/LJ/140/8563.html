begins a new series on Linux shell scripting in this issue.

If you're reading this publication, you already know that Linux is one
of the most powerful and versatile operating systems available today. If
you're an old-timer like me, you also know all about the command line and
the geeky retro joy that typing commands rather than clicking icons offers
the diligent user. Nowadays, though, the graphical interface layered
atop Linux is so well designed that&mdash;though I find it a bit
baffling&mdash;plenty of Linux users never go near the command line.
</p><p>
That's too bad. The command line is tremendously powerful, and the
underlying metaphor of commands being strung together in pipes to create
custom command sequences means that Linux actually offers millions
of unique ways to work with the system. But, yes, there's a definite
learning curve to overcome.
</p><p>
More than just the command line, though, it turns out that the shell
offers a simple and surprisingly powerful programming environment through
what we call shell script programming. In UNIX parlance, a shell is a
command-line interface or CLI. Either way, it's the program that receives
the commands you type in and actually does whatever it is you requested.
String a bunch of these commands together, put them in a file and you
have a shell script&mdash;simple and straightforward.
</p><p>
That's what I'm going to address in this new column here at <i  >Linux Journal</i>, and fair warning for those &uuml;ber-geeks in the crowd, I'm going
to go slow and make sure we cover all the basic concepts before we
move into complex scripting tricks and techniques.
</p><p>
To start, let me briefly introduce myself. I first logged in to a BSD
UNIX system way back in 1980 and have been involved with UNIX, and then
Linux systems, ever since. I worked with the Open Software Foundation,
helped manage the Usenet hierarchy, was one of the postmasters at hplabs
back in the old UUCP days and am pretty well known as the author of The
Elm Mail System. I've written 19 books, notably including <span   class="emphasis"><em>Teach
Yourself Unix in 24 Hours</em></span> and the best-selling
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Wicked Cool Shell Scripts</em></span>.
I've contributed software to a variety of UNIX and Linux distros,
including BSD 4.4 back when that was released, and I still have an open
terminal window on my computer regardless of what I'm working on. I'm
hooked on the command line, what can I say?
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2868580.0x29607c0"></a>
Redirecting Input and Output</h2></div></div><p>
To get started, let's talk about one of the most important concepts
of the Linux command line: standard input and output. When you run a
program like <tt  >ls</tt> to list files or
<tt  >date</tt> to see the date and time (sadly,
the latter command doesn't help you gain a social life. If only it were
so easy!), it turns out that the program actually has an input channel and
two output channels. For these commands, the input channel is ignored
because they don't actually read input from what's called the input
stream, but they do have both an output and error output stream that
are utilized. These three streams are called standard input (or stdin),
standard output (or stdout) and standard error (or stderr). Why is
this important? Because you can redirect any of them to come from a
file or to go to a file&mdash;for any Linux command.
</p><p>
Let's say that you want to create a new file called rightnow, and you
want it to contain the current date and time. Here's how that'd look
on the command line:

<pre     class="programlisting">
date &gt; rightnow
</pre>
</p><p>
Easy enough. An important warning, however, is that if the output file
you specify already exists, by default Linux just silently overwrites
it, not infrequently leading to curses, great frustration and unhappy
users. Be careful (or read up in your favorite command shell's man page
about noclobber).
</p><p>
Let's say you want to save the date twice in the file. Now, instead of
creating a new file, it's time to add the new content to the existing
contents of the file. This is done thusly:

<pre     class="programlisting">
date &gt;&gt; rightnow
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2868580.0x2960b30"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Check the file now and you'll see two time/date stamps, a few seconds
apart.
</p><p>
Let's add another useful command to our list, wc, which counts
characters, words and lines in either a specified file or in stdin
(the standard input stream). First, how many characters, words and
lines are in the standard output of the date command?

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ date &gt; test
$ wc test
       1       6      29 test
</pre>
</p><p>
Typical cryptic Linux output: the first value is the number of lines,
the second the number of words and the third the number of characters.
Let's try a variation on this too:

<pre     class="programlisting">

$ wc &lt; test
       1      6      29

</pre>
</p><p>
Notice this time that rather than having the wc command open up a file
we've specified by name, we're using a redirection to replace stdin
with the contents of the specified file. That's
why the wc output doesn't show the filename; it doesn't know that the
input is from a file.
</p><p>
Let's consider one more file redirection before we wrap up this quick
tour. We've seen &gt; and &gt;&gt; and &lt;. What do you think happens if you use
&lt;&lt;
as a file redirection? Ah, well, that's a tricky one because it doesn't
append anything, it lets you simulate a file redirection without
actually having a file involved. In fact, &lt;&lt; is known as a here document,
because when used in the standard form of &lt;&lt; EOF, it is read as
&ldquo;read
until you reach 'here'&rdquo; (the EOF sequence). This'll make more sense with
an example:

<pre     class="programlisting">

$ wc &lt;&lt; EOF
&gt; this is a simple test and should
&gt; show you how many lines, words
&gt; and characters are in this little
&gt; input sequence.
&gt; EOF
       4      21     114

</pre>
</p><p>
Now you can see where the output of wc is starting to make sense: four
lines, 21 words and 114 characters. Count it for yourself! Also, notice
that the &gt; symbol at the beginning of the lines is automatically added
by the shell as a continuation character to let you know that more input
is expected. Once at the end of the here document, the sequence EOF appears,
the input stream is fed to the specified command and wc dutifully counts
lines, words and characters.
</p><p>
That should get us started with the basics this month. Next month, we'll
explore how you can create pipelines of commands where the output of one
command is the input of the next, then begin to talk about my long-term
shell script programming project for this column: a rudimentary blackjack
game.
