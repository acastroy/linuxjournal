Although <i  >LJ</i> readers have been using Linux desktops
for years, putting desktops in front of ordinary users is now a reality.
To help, we created <span   class="emphasis"><em>TUX</em></span>.

I know we are all going to miss Don Marti. Many of us <i  >LJ</i> folks have known
Don &ldquo;forever&rdquo;, and we have worked with him for five years. Don had the
big picture, knew his bits and was a great writer&mdash;exactly the right
mix.
</p><p>
Getting to write this piece gives me a chance to talk a bit about
what is changing in Linux and, because of that, what I have been
working on.
</p><p>
We as a company decided to switch everyone in the office over to KDE,
back on version 1. Everyone thought I was crazy, and many times, I
believed them. However, this meant
they all knew what Linux was and used it every day.
Since then, while most people were watching Linux (and
Apache) take over the server market, the desktop quietly matured. It
isn't perfect today, but it is certainly easy for
your grandmother to sit down at a Linux box and use it.
But <i  >LJ</i>'s job isn't done. Desktops still require new
drivers, new applications, security and, in general, administration.
<i  >LJ</i> here to help you with that, and will be for
years, but
Linux has a growing <span   class="emphasis"><em>user</em></span> market&mdash;users like
the receptionist I subjected to KDE 1 so many years ago.
</p><p>
More than a year ago, we started working on a new magazine named
<span   class="emphasis"><em>TUX</em></span>, and it's different in a lot of
ways&mdash;not just in audience:
1) it is distributed as a PDF;
2) it tells you how to get things done rather than what is inside; 3)
it's free; and 4) all the back issues are available for free too.
</p><p>
Is there a catch? Yes. We want lots more people to use Linux. Some of
them will become geeks and, thus, <i  >LJ</i> readers. But, lots of them will
simply get to see why we are so excited about what we do and,
hopefully, buy a few Linux systems. Some of those people will
buy a system for home, but many will end up using Linux at
work. That gets us all closer to the goal&mdash;World Domination.
If you have a friend or relative who just wants to use a
computer and you think Linux is the right answer, point them at
<span   class="emphasis"><em>TUX</em></span> (<a href="http://www.tuxmagazine.com" target="_self">www.tuxmagazine.com</a>) for articles and
free subscription links. And, maybe if you are pretty geeky and
know how to do everything on the command line, you should get
a subscription too. Although I am writing this with vi, some GUI programs
out there are useful&mdash;from amaroK to Inkscape.
</p><p>
Enough about what else we are up to. Let's talk about what we
did this month in <i  >LJ</i>.
</p><p>
Reuven continues looking at pieces of Ruby on Rails, focusing on
ActiveRecord, the object-relational mapper (page 14). I have been
working on a project using Ruby recently, although we rejected using
Rails because the project was far from a pure Web
application. Ruby on Rails certainly has its place, and Reuven is
doing a great job of showing us how to use it.
</p><p>
Marcel looks into amaroK and new features that have
recently appeared in this fancy music player (page 22). Even though OGG isn't
French for anything, Marcel fills you in on what amaroK can do.
</p><p>
Beyond that, we show you how to make Schenker graphs, master DVDs, replace
your TiVo with your own Linux box, squeeze parts of KDE into a small footprint and a whole lot more.
