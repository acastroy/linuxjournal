amaroK is a powerful music player and music management tool for Linux.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x298c580.0x2a843f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Fran&ccedil;ois, <span   class="emphasis"><em>oui</em></span>, it does look like a bit of a mess to me as well. I
agree that it started out as a great idea, ripping all the music CDs in
the restaurant to OGG format. The problem, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mon ami</em></span>, is that the mess
has gone from the CD shelf to the hard drive of your Linux system, and it
is getting only messier. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Non, mon ami</em></span>, I am not trying to make
fun of you, but unless we start using some kind of media player software
that make sense of this mess, your great idea will quickly become like
most of your ideas.
</p><p>
Now, now, Fran&ccedil;ois, I am just kidding. You are a fantastic waiter and
an unconventional thinker as well. You are welcome, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mon
ami</em></span>. And I
have just the software you need featured on tonight's menu. But quickly
now, our guests will be here any moment and we need to prepare for them
and select a wine. Too late! They are already here! Welcome, everyone,
Fran&ccedil;ois, please head down to the wine cellar and bring
back the 2002 Domaine Vincent Girardin Meursault Les Narvaux.
</p><p>
Today, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, we are going to feature but one item on the
menu&mdash;the breadth of its capabilities demands it. Fran&ccedil;ois has been
trying to convert all his music to digital format but needs a combination
media player and organizer&mdash;a digital jukebox, and I have just the thing
for him. This amazing Linux software package is, in this humble chef's
opinion, the best media player ever created, regardless of your operating
system. It's called amaroK and it truly rocks.
</p><p>
amaroK's features are too numerous to list, but let me give you a sample
of what the program offers. There's a powerful cover manager (downloads
covers from Amazon.com), a context browser that keeps track of your favorite
and most-listened-to songs, a skinnable interface, iPod support (other
players work as well), great visualization tools (using libvisual) and
more. There's even a lyric download feature so you can sing along with
your favorite tunes without worrying about whether you are getting the
words right. There is much more, and I will show you some of its
capabilities in a moment.
</p><p>
The first step to getting amaroK running on your system (check
first as some distributions come with it) is getting a copy (see
the on-line Resources). There's
really no need to build amaroK from scratch, as precompiled packages
are available for an amazing number of distributions. Should you need
to compile amaroK or choose to do so for the exercise, this is another
example of a simple, extract-and-build five-step:

<pre     class="programlisting">
tar -xjvf amarok-1.3.1.tar.bz2
cd amarok-1.3.1
./configure --prefix=/usr
make
su -c "make install"
</pre>
</p><p>
There are several options for building amaroK with a handful of audio
engines from which to choose (by default, aRts and Helix are used), and as
such, you may need other supporting packages (for example, gstreamer). The
most likely one you may need, however, is taglib, a library
used for reading and writing metadata and ID tags on MP3 and OGG
files. Check your distribution CDs or visit the TagLib site (see
Resources).
</p><p>
When you run amaroK the first time, you are presented with the
aptly named First-Run Wizard (Figure 1). This is a simple three-step
wizard that asks you to select an interface style, a folder where your
songs are stored (this can be a high-level directory where you have
access to the subdirectories) and the obligatory congratulations screen.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8558f1.large.jpg"><img src="8558f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Setting up
amaroK is easy with the First-Run Wizard guiding you along.
</p></div></div><p>
If you selected a folder to scan for songs, amaroK starts by scanning
that folder and building a song collection. As part of this process,
each song's ID tag is examined to build a list sorted by artist,
song, album and so on. How long this takes depends on how many songs
you have stored on your disk. To give you some idea, a progress status
bar near the bottom of the amaroK window displays the percentage of
completion (Figure 2).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8558f2.large.jpg"><img src="8558f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. As amaroK scans your folders, it automatically builds a
collection of all your music.
</p></div></div><p>
Once that collection is done, you are ready to go, and you can start
playing the song of your choice right away. Let's take a moment, however,
to see how amaroK is laid out. The larger, right-hand pane contains
your playlist. At the bottom of the playlist window are the controls
to pause, play and jump to the next or previous song. There's also a
volume control slider, a position slider (so you can move within the
song itself) and a nice graphic sound analyzer display. Incidentally,
if you click on the analyzer, it switches through a number of different
display styles. Over on the left-hand side is a list of artists
with some plus signs beside the artists' names. In both cases, there's a
search box above the pane to let you find a particular tune quickly by
typing in part of the name.
</p><p>
Let's get back to the playlist for a moment. Click on the plus sign
beside an artist's name, and the entry expands to reveal the various
albums by that artist, each of which further expands to list individual
songs. Double-click on a song, and it appears in the playlist window
and starts playing (Figure 3). I think, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, I'll just
double-click on Bachman Turner Overdrive's &ldquo;You Ain't Seen Nothin'
Yet&rdquo;
and crank up the volume a bit while Fran&ccedil;ois refills everyone's glasses.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8558f3.large.jpg"><img src="8558f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

double-click, and sit back and listen.
</p></div></div><p>
If you want to queue up a number of songs, simply drag them from the list
of songs into the playlist. As you build your playlist, you even
can move the songs up and down in the list, changing the order of play as you
go. So far, it sounds pretty good, but it gets a whole lot better. Before
we get too far though, it's time to look at those tabs running down
the left-hand side. When you are searching for songs, queuing them up
for playing by dragging them into the playlist, the active tab is the
Collection tab. For those impatient among you who just went ahead and
started playing a song, you will have noticed that the left-hand tab and
pane changed from Collection to Context. The context manager is one of
the most powerful and useful features in amaroK and it deserves some
explanation. When the context manager is active, there are four tabs
along the top of the left-hand pane. They are labeled Home, Current,
Lyrics and Artist.
</p><p>
The Home tab lists information about the most recently played tracks,
your favorite tracks (based on how often you play them) and your
newest tracks. The tab labeled Current displays information about
the current track. This includes complete information (or as much as
you have) on the current track and artist, the album cover (more on
this shortly), the rating and when it was last and first played. It also
lists your favorite songs by that artist and other albums you may
have in your collection. You may even see one or more
<span   class="emphasis"><em>suggested</em></span>
songs listed. The Lyrics tab will query on-line lyrics servers to find
the words for the current track (I personally love this feature since
I like to accompany my music&mdash;enough smirking, Fran&ccedil;ois). Finally,
the Artist tab will query the Wikipedia on-line encyclopedia to return
the information relating to the current artist (Figure 4).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8558f4.large.jpg"><img src="8558f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

you listen.
</p></div></div><p>
Since I mentioned the album cover in the context manager discussion,
it's only fair that I go back and talk about this feature. Aside from all
this great information about the track that's playing at any given moment,
most people will tell you that it's kind of cool to have the album cover
displayed as well. I personally don't want to go through the hassle of
scanning my CD covers and storing all those pictures on my system, but
amaroK makes this easy by downloading the cover art from Amazon.com. When
a song is playing, the context manager displays information with
either a default question mark cover or the actual cover (Figure
5). To download the cover for that particular song, right-click on the
image and select Fetch from Amazon.com from the menu that appears.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8558f5.large.jpg"><img src="8558f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. When songs are first loaded, there is no cover
information. Right-clicking on the default question mark cover lets you
download a cover from Amazon.com.
</p></div></div><p>
This is a great way to import cover art for the occasional track, but
you may have already had hundreds of songs stored on your PC when you
decided to use amaroK, and getting all those covers individually can
take an amazing amount of time. Luckily, there is a better way. Just
use amaroK's cover manager. Start by clicking Tools, then select Cover
Manager. The Cover Manager window appears with a list of all the
covers for which you have albums identified (a song without an album title
in its meta tags won't show up here). You'll probably see a whole slew
of albums with the default question mark cover. Now, look up in the top
right-hand corner of the Cover Manager and you'll see a button labeled
Fetch Missing Covers. Click that button, sit back and wait while
amaroK does the rest (Figure 6).

</p></div></div><p>
By now, you might be starting to believe that amaroK is as amazing as
Fran&ccedil;ois and I do, <span   class="emphasis"><em>non</em></span>?
</p><p>
Need more convincing? No true entertainment system is complete
without a great light show to go with it. Click Tools and select
Visualizations. Not getting the right sound for your room or music
style? You might need to change the levels using the built-in
equalizer. Click Tools and select Equalizer. When the Equalizer
window appears (Figure 7), the equalizer itself initially will be
deactivated. Click the Enable Equalizer check box, and adjust it to
your liking. The change in playback will accompany your changes. What's
particularly interesting here is that there is a drop-down box near
the top of the window labeled Presets. Click here and you'll find a
number of preset levels suited to different musical styles such as Club,
Large Hall, Pop, Rock, Reggae, Techno and several others.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="8558f7.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 7. The equalizer can be set manually, but includes many presets
for different musical styles.
</p></div></div><p>
amaroK also can play songs randomly, repeat your playlists for endless
music, save playlists and then drag the whole thing down into your mounted
iPod. Simply click the Media Player tab. Click the Playlists tab for even
more multimedia fun. This is where you manipulate your various playlists,
download and listen to podcasts or listen to Internet radio streams (amaroK
is already configured with a number of these stations). With this media
player on your Linux system, the entertainment never ends.
</p><p>
Can it be possible? The clock on the wall must be playing a joke on
us, saying it is near closing time. With the music playing and Fran&ccedil;ois
ready to refill your glasses, surely we can delay our parting a little
longer. We'll drag a few more songs into the playlist, turn up the volume
just a little higher, and maybe see if we can't find some truly decadent
<span   class="emphasis"><em>G&iuml;&iquest;&frac12;eau au chocolat</em></span> to finish off the evening.
Please raise your glasses, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, and let us all drink to one
another's health.
