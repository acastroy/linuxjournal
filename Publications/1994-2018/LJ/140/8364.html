GNU Lilypond provides an easy-to-use, yet extremely powerful,
tool for generating musical notation, including Schenkerian
Analysis graphs.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1906580.0x19fe348"></a></h2></div></div><p>
In the early twentieth century, Heinrich Schenker
developed a method of analyzing tonal music that
ties a piece's melody, harmony and form to a simple
underlying musical idea. To illustrate his theory,
he created a notational system that clearly depicts
these relationships. Schenkerian Analysis, as it is
called today, is a staple of music theory, but it is
notoriously difficult to notate using the industry-standard, proprietary music notation applications
Finale and Sibelius.
</p><p>
The Open Source world, however, has an excellent
music typesetter in GNU Lilypond, which now
runs natively on Linux, Mac OS X and Microsoft
Windows. Lilypond not only produces beautiful sheet
music, it also puts a great deal of control at the
user's fingertips. Additionally, its text-to-music
rendering method makes it easier for a typesetter
to control hidden elements. This makes Lilypond a
powerful tool for creating Schenkerian notation
graphs, which&mdash;by their nature&mdash;require extreme
control of positioning, as well as the masking and
hiding of notational elements.
</p><p>
In this article, I cover the creation of a
Schenkerian graph that contains all of the most
common Schenkerian notational elements, with
explanations of what each element signifies and the
code required to produce it. I assume that the
reader has at least a basic knowledge of Lilypond,
and thus give instructions only for the
nonstandard code used for Schenker graphs. I
also assume that the user is using Lilypond 2.6,
though most of the tools I cover are valid for
any 2.x version of Lilypond. Armed with a working
knowledge of Lilypond and with the techniques
explained in this article, any user should be able
to produce beautiful Schenker graphs&mdash;and some other
forms of advanced musical notation&mdash;in less time,
with less effort and difficulty than when using a
graphical music notation application.

The Basics of Schenkerian
Notation</h2></div></div><p>
There are a few simple steps to understanding a
Schenker graph and how it represents an analysis of
a piece. Two cardinal principles of tonal music form
the foundation of Schenker's theory as an intrinsic
part of the way we hear and perceive music. The
first principle is the supremacy of the tonic (I)
chord and the dominant (V) chord in the harmonic
structure. That is, the chords built on the first
and fifth notes of the scale. In the key of C major,
this would be the C-major chord (I) and the G-major
chord (V). The second principle is that the melodic
structure is built upon a descending line, which ends
on tonic (the first note of the scale).
</p><p>
A Schenkerian graph
notates the structure of a piece in two main ways. First, rhythmic
values are used to denote the structural importance
of a note, not the length for which it should be
played. Second, various musical markings&mdash;such as
slurs, ties, beams and lines&mdash;are used to show the
relationship of notes that have little structural
importance to those that have greater structural
significance. Schenkerian graphs also typically
contain analytical markings such as Roman numerals
for the harmony, scale-degree numbers and
occasionally figured bass and analysis brackets.
</p><p>
As an example, let's use an excerpt of an analysis
of J.S. Bach's Organ Chorale Prelude <span   class="emphasis"><em>Wenn wir in
hoechsten Noten sein</em></span>, from Gene Biringer's book
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Schenkerian Theory and Analysis: A Bridge
from Traditional Harmony, Counterpoint, and Form to
Advanced Studies in the Analysis of Tonal
Music</em></span> (unpublished, Lawrence University
Conservatory of Music). I chose this example because
it clearly illustrates many of the standard
Schenkerian notation elements, and I have made a few
slight modifications to the graph to
demonstrate the notation more completely. For the
complete Lilypond file for this graph, see the
on-line Resources.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8364f1.large.jpg"><img src="8364f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. J.S. Bach: Organ Chorale Prelude
<span  class="emphasis"><em>Wenn wir in hoechsten Noten sein</em></span>
</p></div></div><p>
In this example, note the use of different rhythmic
values&mdash;half notes, quarter notes and eighth notes.
In this case, as in most Schenker graphs, the
half notes are the notes of the fundamental
structure, and they are also beamed together to
highlight the structure most clearly. Next, observe
the use of ties, beams and slur marks in the graph.
Slurs are used to connect notes of lesser structural
significance with the fundamental structure. In the
above example, the second and third notes in the
upper staff are slurred showing that the F-sharp is
a neighbor tone (marked by N) to the more
structurally important G. The tie between the two
Gs surrounding that F-sharp shows that the second G
is a prolongation of the first G. Dotted slurs and
ties are also used by some theorists to show
extended prolongation of a note. In Figure 1,
three dotted slurs or ties show
extended prolongations of notes with other forms of
embellishment between.
</p><p>
Lastly, observe the diagonal lines between the two
staves. These lines are used to connect a melodic
note and a bass note that coincide structurally, but
they are not performed simultaneously in the piece. When
examining the graph in Figure 1, one can see that every note in
the example can be connected via slurs, ties or
beams to the fundamental structure of the piece,
thus showing the role of every note in the structure
of the piece.

Creating a Lilypond Template for
Schenkerian Graphs</h2></div></div><p>
Setting up a Lilypond file for a Schenker graph is
fairly straightforward. A typical graph contains
one or more grand staves, or piano staves, so one
will likely begin with a piano template. To modify a
piano template for a Schenker graph, add a
few lines of code. Inside the PianoStaff brackets,
but outside the individual Staff context brackets,
add these lines:

<pre     class="programlisting">

\set Score.timing = ##f
\set PianoStaff.followVoice = ##t

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1906580.0x19feb88"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The first line creates an unmetered score, with
no barlines&mdash;typical for Schenker graphs. The
second line is explained later.
</p><p>
Inside each Staff context, and inside \relative
brackets if you use them, insert:

<pre     class="programlisting">

\override Staff.NoteCollision
  #'merge-differently-headed = ##t

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1906580.0x19fed40"></a></h2></div></div><p>
This allows you to combine several layers of
hidden voices&mdash;an important tool&mdash;without altering
the note spacing.
</p><p>
The last global element is adding <tt  >raggedright =
##t</tt> to the \layout section. I think this just looks
better, but it also ensures consistency of
measurement if you make significant edits to the
graph after you've begun working on spacing. The
piano template is now ready to be used for a
Schenkerian graph. For an example template built
upon a single grand staff, see the Resources.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1906580.0x19feef8"></a>
Building a Schenkerian Graph in Lilypond</h2></div></div><p>
The first and most important part of the process of
building a Schenkerian graph is to sketch the final
graph by hand. The more complex the notation, the
more valuable this will be. And even though
Lilypond makes it easier than Finale or Sibelius to
edit graphs after they have been created, you will
still save much time and effort by sketching the
complete graph by hand before typesetting it. It is
also a good idea to mark off the beats that will be
used. Because almost every voice in the Lilypond file
will contain a number of skipped beats, it is
essential to know the number and layout of beats
ahead of time. One quarter-note beat for each
notehead should suffice.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1906580.0x19ff000"></a>
The Fundamental Structure</h2></div></div><p>
The next step is to typeset the fundamental
structure, the half notes connected by an
eighth-note beam. I chose to use two voices for
each staff when creating this. One voice contains
eighth notes with invisible noteheads, and the other
contains half notes with invisible stems. The
fundamental structure for the upper staff of the
Bach graph looks like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;&lt;
  {
    \override Beam  #'positions = #'(8 . 8)
    \override NoteHead #'transparent = ##t
    s1 b8[ s4. s1 a8 s4. s2 g8] s4.
    \revert Beam #'positions
    \revert NoteHead #'transparent
    }
\\
  {
    \override Stem #'transparent = ##t
    s1 b2 s1 a2 s2 g2
    \revert Stem #'transparent
    }
&gt;&gt;

</pre>
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="8364f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. The fundamental structure uses half notes
connected by an eighth-note beam.
</p></div></div><p>
Notice first that I override the beam positions, to
make it level and out of the way of any notes and
stems that may be placed under it. Also notice the
use of the transparent property, one of your best
friends when creating a Schenker graph in Lilypond.
And of course, notice that the beats correspond
exactly, with an eighth note and dotted-quarter skip
in voice one, corresponding to each half note in
voice two.
</p><p>
If you want to put scale-degree marks on each note,
as in the Bach graph, Lilypond 2.6 now makes it
possible without using LaTeX. You simply mark up the
note like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">

b8[^\markup { \override #'(baseline-skip . 0.5)
\column { \small {^ 3} } }

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1906580.0x19ff420"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The baseline-skip override should align the carat
tightly over the numeral.
</p><p>
You also may notice that I chose to create multiple
voices with brackets and back-slashes, rather than
\voiceOne, \voiceTwo and so on. In my experience, the
brackets are quicker, they make it easier to insert
and delete voices, and they are less likely to cause
alignment problems between voices.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1906580.0x19ff580"></a>
Slurs and Layers</h2></div></div><p>
Once the fundamental structure has been created in
each staff, next comes the surrounding notes. I
typically begin with plain noteheads in one
voice&mdash;separate from the two voices already
created&mdash;and add beams, stems, slurs and additional
voices as I continue. This helps me better organize
my code. To create a voice with plain noteheads,
begin the voice with the code:

<pre     class="programlisting">
\override Stem #'transparent = ##t
\override Stem #'length = #0
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1906580.0x19ff6e0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
and follow with all quarter notes or quarter-note
skips, never rests. The second line becomes useful
when adding slurs. Because slurs attach to the stem
if the stem and slur are on the same side of the
note, you can use this line to cause all slurs to
attach only to noteheads. Just remember to cancel
it out when you add a visible stem. When you reach
the end of the voice, remember to \revert anything
you \override.
</p><p>
Once the notes are added, you can begin adding the
necessary slurs, beams and other appropriate marks.
Multiple layers of slurs are intrinsic to
Schenkerian notation, but they can be cumbersome in
Lilypond code. There are two ways to accomplish it.
The first is to use the phrasing slur tool. This
allows you to create a lower layer of slurs with (
and ) and an upper layer with \( and \). This
allows for only two layers of slurs, but it does
let you keep both layers in the same voice. If
two layers of slurs are all you need, this may help
you keep your code cleaner and save you a little
work.
</p><p>
If you need more than two layers&mdash;note the four
layers of slurs on the first note in the Bach
example&mdash;you must create multiple voices. If
you require three layers of slurs, create three voices.
In the first voice, begin with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
\override Stem #'transparent = ##t
\override Stem #'length = #0
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1906580.0x19ff8f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
as before, and follow this with all the notes in the line
(and the skips and \revert commands). Insert the
first (lower) layer of slurs in this voice.
</p><p>
In the second voice, begin with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
\override NoteHead #'transparent = ##t
\override Stem #'transparent = ##t
\override Stem #'length = #0
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1906580.0x19ffaa8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
and follow with all the notes and the second layer
of slurs. This attaches each slur to an invisible
note in the same place as the visible notehead from
voice one. If you want, you can replace the
unneeded notes in this voice with skips, but it is
unnecessary. The third voice will look like the
second voice, but it will include only the third layer
of slurs.
</p><p>
After making a few minor spacing adjustments, your
code may look something like this (a variation of
the beginning of the lower staff of the Bach
example):

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;&lt;
  {
    \override Stem #'transparent = ##t
    \override Stem #'length = #0
    \once \override TextScript #'extra-offset =
      #'(-11 . -2.5)
    g4 a( b) fis( e)
    \revert Stem #'transparent
    \revert Stem #'length
    }
\\
  {
    \override NoteHead #'transparent = ##t
    \override Stem #'transparent = ##t
    \override Stem #'length = #0
    \once \override Slur #'extra-offset =
      #'(0.5 . 0.75)
    \once \override Slur #'height-limit = #1.5
    g4( a b) fis e
    \revert NoteHead #'transparent
    \revert Stem #'transparent
    \revert Stem #'length
    }
\\
  {
    \override NoteHead #'transparent = ##t
    \override Stem #'transparent = ##t
    \override Stem #'length = #0
    \slurDown
    \once \override Slur #'extra-offset =
      #'(-1.25 . 0)
    \once \override Slur #'height-limit = #2.75
    g4( a b fis e)
    \revert NoteHead #'transparent
    \revert Stem #'transparent
    \revert Stem #'length
    }
&gt;&gt;

</pre>
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="8364f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Using layers of slurs helps you organize your
code clearly.
</p></div></div><p>
Even when using only two layers of slurs, I prefer
this method rather than using slurs and phrasing
slurs combined. It gives me the same method in every
graph, it organizes my code more clearly and when I
edit slur properties, I always use the same commands
for any layer. Otherwise, I would alternate between
overriding slur properties and phrasing slur
properties.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1906580.0x19f6700"></a>
Editing and Tweaking Slurs</h2></div></div><p>
When using slurs in Schenker graphs&mdash;especially when
using multiple layers&mdash;you likely will need to edit
some of the slur properties in your graph. The
simplest edits are \slurUp and \slurDown, which
cause the following slur to be created above or
below the notes, respectively, and \slurDashed, a new
tool in Lilypond 2.6, which creates a dashed slur.
</p><p>
Another common tweak I find useful is:

<pre     class="programlisting">
\once \override Staff.Slur #'height-limit = #x
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1906580.0x19f68b8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
This allows me to specify how deep or shallow the
slur should be drawn (represented by the value x),
and it is especially helpful for layered slurs or
for slurs under and over text. Occasionally, I have
to specify the entire set of coordinates for a slur
manually. This lets you create some funky
slurs, which some Schenkerian theorists love to use.
For that, use the following code, where x and y
are horizontal and vertical distances, measured in
staff lines:

<pre     class="programlisting">
\once \override Slur #'control-points =
  #'((x . y) (x . y) (x . y) (x . y))
</pre>
</p><p>
And, as with just about any notational element in
Lilypond, you can alter a slur's extra-offset
property, moving the entire slur without altering
the shape:

<pre     class="programlisting">
\once \override Slur #'extra-offset = #'(x . y)
</pre>
</p><p>
See the example of slur layers in Figure 3 to observe extra-offset and height-limit in action.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1906580.0x19f6b20"></a>
Cross-Staff Diagonal Lines</h2></div></div><p>
Occasionally, a melodic note corresponds to a bass
note harmonically, but they are not sounded
simultaneously and thus are not aligned vertically
in the score. In Schenkerian notation, a simple
diagonal line connecting the notes suffices to
make this connection. Unfortunately, such a line is
not as easy to create in Lilypond as in a graphical
editor. However, it can be done rather painlessly
with <tt  >\change Staff</tt>. When creating our template,
we added the line:

<pre     class="programlisting">
\set PianoStaff.followVoice = ##t
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1906580.0x19f6cd8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
to our file. That line combined with <tt  >\change
Staff=LH</tt> or <tt  >\change Staff=RH</tt> creates a
diagonal line that follows the voice from one staff
to the other. Thus, if you create a new voice in the
upper staff with the following code:

<pre     class="programlisting">
\override Stem #'transparent = ##t
\override NoteHead #'transparent = ##t
\override Stem #'length = #0
s1 s4 e4 s
\change Staff=LH
fis,4 s2
\revert Stem #'transparent
\revert NoteHead #'transparent
\revert Stem #'length
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1906580.0x19f6ee8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
you will get the first diagonal line in the Bach
example, descending from the upper staff to the
lower staff. The transparent noteheads and stems
cause Lilypond to render only the diagonal line.
Using invisible notes also allows you to alter the
pitch of the start and end notes to adjust the
height of each end of the line. Though this may seem
to be overkill, the entire block of code easily can be cut
and pasted to another voice or file, with the
necessary adjustments being only height and beat
placement, making this an easy solution. (If you
really want to click and drag the line onto the
graph, open the finished graph in an image editor
and add the line there.)
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1906580.0x19f6ff0"></a>
The Unfolding Symbol</h2></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="8364f4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. The unfolding symbol shows a harmonic connection
between two notes in a melody.
</p></div></div><p>
The last Schenkerian idiom I cover here is the
unfolding symbol. Briefly, this symbol signifies a
harmonic connection between two notes in a melody.
They typically occur in pairs, showing the use of
two concurrent harmonic voices in one melodic line.
They are surprisingly easy to create. When two
simultaneous notes in a line are to be connected
with the unfolding symbol (as in the lower staff of
the Bach example), one simply needs two notes
connected by beaming brackets, with the commands
\stemUp and \stemDown in the appropriate locations.
Of course, one must remember to remove stem
transparency before creating the unfolding symbol
and insert eighth-note skips appropriately to
preserve vertical alignment:

<pre     class="programlisting">
\override Beam #'positions = #'(1 . -4)
\stemUp
g8[ s
\stemDown
b8] s
</pre>
</p><p>
Notice the use of beam positions to adjust the height
of the stems and the beam angle. When other notes
occur between the two notes to be connected with an
unfolding symbol, as in the upper staff of the Bach
example, put the unfolding notes in one voice and
the independent noteheads in another, with
appropriate skips in each voice. For example, if the
first voice contains:

<pre     class="programlisting">
\override Beam #'positions = #'(3 . -2.5)
\stemUp
a8[ s s2
\stemDown
d8] s
\revert Beam #'positions
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1906580.0x19f73b8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
and the other contains:

<pre     class="programlisting">
\override Stem #'transparent = ##t
s4 b c s
\revert Stem #'transparent
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1906580.0x19f7518"></a></h2></div></div><p>
the end result will turn out like Figure 5.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Creating Schenkerian graphs in a graphical editor
like Finale or Sibelius is enough to make many
theorists revert to pencil and paper. The process
is long and difficult, making changes to finished
graphs is nearly impossible and you must do the same
things to each graph every time you create a new
one. However, with GNU Lilypond and the above
tools, any musician can create beautiful Schenker
graphs with minimal headaches and maximum control.
Lilypond's text-to-music method makes it easy to
edit hidden elements, modify finished graphs, and
cut and paste code to future projects. Though the
methods take time to learn, in the long run Lilypond
saves time, energy and frustration, all the while
creating stunning output. The tools and examples in
this article should put you well on your way to
creating beautiful Schenker graphs and some other
forms of advanced musical notation with this great
application.
