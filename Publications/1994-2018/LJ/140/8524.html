Advanced methods for deinterlacing video playback and extracting video to take on the road.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc36580.0xd2e348"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Because of its stability and extensibility, Linux is often found at the
frontier of computing. Linux has emerged as a promising platform for home
theater audio/visual applications. My television viewing is now handled
by a special-purpose Linux PC running MythTV. As I set up MythTV, the
two major pain points I encountered were both related to video processing.
The first challenge is to configure smooth video playback, and the second
challenge is to take recorded programs on the road.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc36580.0xd2e450"></a>
Deinterlacing Video Playback</h2></div></div><p>
To work within the limitations of the electronics of the day, television
frames are transmitted as two separate &ldquo;fields&rdquo;. A field consists
of either the even-numbered or the odd-numbered horizontal lines in
the picture. On playback, the even-numbered and odd-numbered fields
are weaved together, and viewers far enough away from the display see
continuous blended motion.
</p><p>
Two consecutive fields are related, but are not identical. During periods
of rapid side-to-side motion of the camera, a field will be slightly
ahead of its predecessor, and there may be jagged edges to images
sliding across the screen. Figure 1 is a screenshot from a 1080i
high-definition broadcast. In the scene, the camera is panning from
left to right, causing the objects in the image to slide rapidly across
the screen. Each field is in a slightly different position, leading to
sawtooth-edge distortion, which is also called combing, serrations
or mice teeth. In scenes with a great deal of sideways motion, it may
be extremely difficult to follow the content through the distortion.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8524f1.large.jpg"><img src="8524f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Combing Distortion on Playback
</p></div></div><p>
To make a video like Figure 1 watchable, it can be converted into a
smooth picture by a process called deinterlacing. MythTV offers users
a choice between several deinterlacing methods:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
One field&mdash;instead of using two fields for one frame, this extremely
simple method keeps only one of the two fields. Every other field is
displayed as a still image, and the unused fields are discarded.
</p></li><li><p>
Linear&mdash;this method blends directly adjacent lines, which by definition
come from alternate fields, together. A slight ghost image may appear,
but the sawtooth distortion will be gone.
</p></li><li><p>
Kernel&mdash;this method blends several lines together instead of just
adjacent lines. Ghost images do not appear, though faint remnants of
one field may remain.
</p></li><li><p>
Bob&mdash;Bob is the most taxing method. Each field is line-doubled to
create a frame, and then the reconstructed frames are played at double
the frame rate.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Deinterlacing does require significant processing power, but most
modern CPUs have multimedia instruction sets that reduce the load of
the processing power. If you have an Intel processor with MMX or SSE
instructions, or an AMD processor with 3Dnow!, deinterlacing should not
be too difficult.
</p><p>
Bob is the best deinterlacing method to use with a synchronous TV output,
though it can tax a less-capable machine. My personal MythTV front end
is a 2GHz AMD Athlon64, and it has more than enough power to display
Bob-deinterlaced high-definition video to an analog TV set. Although the
CPU requirement is higher than the other deinterlacing methods, it is
still well within the performance capabilities of my system.
</p><p>
Linear deinterlacing and kernel deinterlacing have similar visual effects,
with the latter having a slightly larger CPU impact. Both are less taxing
than Bob, which may be helpful on underpowered CPUs. Between the two,
I prefer kernel deinterlacing because it blends several adjacent lines
and eliminates ghosts, which make the resulting picture sharper.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc36580.0xd2ec38"></a>
Exporting Video to Other Systems</h2></div></div><p>
One of the initial reasons for setting up a MythTV system was a desire
to take my television programs on the road. Now that
&ldquo;television&rdquo;
means &ldquo;files on hard disk&rdquo;, it is much easier to store, transport and
watch where it it is convenient for me. Like many mobile professionals,
my laptop has practically become an extra appendage, and it is an ideal
platform for playing back video while mobile, especially now that many
airplanes have added power ports for mobile electronics.
</p><p>
The basic tension in exporting video from MythTV is a trade-off between
size and processing time. Digital TV broadcast standards describe how
to send an MPEG-2 video stream over a TV channel, so it is natural for
MythTV to store digital TV broadcasts in their &ldquo;natural&rdquo; MPEG-2 format.
Converting the MPEG-2 digital TV stream to another MPEG-2-based video
format is relatively easy and can be done without lots of processing time.
Converting the digital TV stream to MPEG-4 requires much more processing
power, but the resulting video file will be much smaller.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc36580.0xd2eea0"></a>
Extracting the MythTV Recordings</h2></div></div><p>
Although digital TV recordings are an MPEG-2 video stream, the NuppelVideo
container format used by MythTV is specific to MythTV and is not supported
by most video player software. To watch the videos with anything other
than a MythTV front end, you must convert them to a format with a wider
selection of players.
</p><p>
Exporting video is further complicated by the filenames used by MythTV to
store recordings. The first part of the filename is the channel number
used by MythTV, and the two long numbers are the start date and end date:

<pre     class="programlisting">
myth:/video$ ls -lh *.nuv
-rw-r--r--  1 mythtv users 2.8G Sep  3 08:00 1000_20050903073000_20050903080000.nuv

</pre>
</p><p>
Tools to convert the MythTV recordings into more widely supported formats
are readily available. mythtranscode, a program that can decode the
MythTV NuppelVideo files into a standard video stream supported by
many programs, comes as part of the MythTV distribution. By feeding
the output of mythtranscode to an encoder program of your choice,
you can create any type of video file you want. A common choice of
encoder program is FFmpeg, which supports many common video formats.
Linking the two programs together to produce an intelligible output
file is theoretically possible, but wading through all the command-line
options and the recordings on your system is a complicated process.
</p><p>
Enter nuvexport, a Perl script that manages the process for you in an
extremely friendly manner. nuvexport assembles the command-line options
necessary to run mythtranscode and FFmpeg. It uses a text-based menu
interface to guide you through the process of selecting a show for export
and then setting up any required parameters of the conversion programs.
</p><p>
Before installing nuvexport, there are a few necessary support tools.
FFmpeg is the default program required to re-encode the video into the
selected target format. (nuvexport also supports transcode, which is
much slower.) MPlayer is used to decode the MythTV files for conversion.
Many conversions result in the appearance of noise that needs to be
filtered out. nuvexport uses the yuvdenoise program, which is one of
the MJPEG tools. All three programs are widely used and are likely to
be available as packages for your Linux distribution. nuvexport uses
the DateManip module as well, so fetch that from your distribution's
package site or favorite CPAN mirror.
</p><p>
The first prompt from nuvexport is to select the format of the
exported video file. The basic trade-off is whether to choose an
MPEG-4-based export format for minimum file size at the cost of extra
processing time to prepare it, or to use one of the larger but easier
to prepare formats. The major choices are:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Video CD (VCD) consists of an MPEG-1 video stream at 1,150kbps, with the audio in a separate MPEG layer 2 (MP2) track at 224kbps.
</p></li><li><p>
Super Video CD (SVCD) consists of an MPEG-2 video at
a variable rate, while retaining the MP2 audio track. Unlike VCD,
the audio track can have multiple channels, so 5.1 or 7.1 audio can be
stored in this format.
</p></li><li><p>
DVD is based on MPEG-2 video, with several options for an
audio track. It is higher resolution than either of the video CD formats.
</p></li><li><p>
DivX is an MPEG-4-based format, which results in small files.
However, it minimizes file size without significant sacrifices in quality.
DivX can produce either constant-rate video or variable-rate video.
</p></li><li><p>
XviD is an MPEG-4-based format that is an offshoot of the
development of DivX. It is based on an open-source development of a
DivX codec released in 2001. By default, nuvexport uses variable-rate
video encoding for XviD and offers the option of either a single pass
or multiple passes. Multiple passes improve video quality at the
expense of processing time.
</p></li><li><p>
Advanced Streaming Format (ASF) was developed by
Microsoft as a generic container for media, and it is commonly used with
Windows Media Audio (WMA) and Windows Media Video (WMV) files. WMV is
based on Microsoft extensions to MPEG-4.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
In my experience, the VCD and SVCD codecs offer good quality with fast
processing times, while the DivX and XviD codecs offer the smallest file
size but take longer to produce. After selecting a video export format,
nuvexport uses a text-based menu system to select the episodes for export
and set up parameters for the codec.
</p><p>
After selecting a set of episodes for export, nuvexport presents
standard questions, such as where to put the exported file. It offers
the option of using the MythTV cutlist, which cuts commercials from
the exported video. Noise reduction and deinterlacing are offered as
options. Although both default to yes, I usually disable them because
of the additional processing time. Many video players can deinterlace
on playback, and I have not found excessive noise from conversion.
</p><p>
Some export formats have additional codec-specific questions. Both
DivX and XviD will allow adjustment of the bit rates and resolution.
The default bit rates of 128kbps for audio and 960kbps for video are
sufficient to produce good-quality video on most computer displays.
When setting video size, nuvexport prompts for the width first and
then proposes a height based on the aspect ratio of the recording.
Keep the width less than the recorded width. The default width of 624
usually produces good video, but it can be larger for recordings that
are 1920x1080. VCD and SVCD do not prompt for resolution because the
formats have fixed resolutions.
</p><p>
Table 1 compares the processing time and space required by each of the
different formats, as well as the MythTV native format and my commercial
DVR. As a source, I used an hour-long episode of PBS's
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Nova</em></span>, which is
transmitted at a resolution of 704x480. The &ldquo;commercial DVR&rdquo; entry is
for the video program as transferred from my commercial DVR to my laptop.
As a rule of thumb, MPEG-2 requires approximately 1GB per hour, but
MPEG-4 will be only 350&ndash;450MB. The encoding time listed in the table
does not take into account either deinterlacing or noise reduction;
I perform both tasks in the video player on playback.

Although ASF has the smallest size, it is also by far the worst looking.
There are large compression artifacts in the ASF file that make it very
distracting to watch. Although the small size is attractive, the poor
picture quality rules it out. DVD video has the best picture quality,
but it also requires the most disk space. As a compromise between the
two extremes, I use VCD and DivX, depending on priorities. I use the
former to create a file quickly, and the latter to create the smallest
file possible.
</p><p>
Video transcoding is a CPU-intensive process. By default, nuvexport runs
its helper processes at high nice values to prevent them from interfering
with other system operations, such as video playback or recording.
All recent Linux distributions have software that allows the CPU clock
speed to be changed in response to demand for processing power. I use
the CPU speed control to keep the clock speed as low as possible while
still accomplishing the work I want. Many CPU speed control programs will
not take into account niced processes, but they can be configured to do so.
My Linux distribution uses the CPUfreq kernel driver, which needs to
be configured to monitor niced processes. A small start-up script runs
the following two commands:

<pre     class="programlisting">
echo "ondemand" &gt; /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_governor
echo "1" &gt; /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/ondemand/ignore_nice
</pre>
</p><p>
The second command instructs CPUfreq driver to count the processing
demands from niced processes. Times listed in Table 1 are from a 2.0GHz AMD Athlon64 running at top speed. At the minimum speed of 1.0GHz,
processing time is approximately three to four times as long.
Exporting the video from MythTV is only the first half of the battle.
Once the video is produced, it can be transferred to another location
for playback. In addition to the playback applications present on the
viewing platform, there are two notable open-source playback applications:
MPlayer and Video LAN Client (VLC). I use MPlayer because the built-in
deinterlacing capabilities result in a smoother picture than VLC.
Both applications are available on both Linux and Windows.
</p><p>
MPlayer's command line is identical on different host operating systems.
The goal is to get crisp full-screen video playback. The -fs option
plays back the video with the full screen so there is no window around
the video. Video filters can be used to change the playback and are
activated with the -vf option. I use two -vf options. One creates a
small black border around the screen with the expand filter. The expand
filter takes multiple arguments. A negative number is interpreted as
a border. The filter <tt  >-vf expand=0:-50</tt> puts a 50-pixel border at the
bottom of the screen and leaves the video centered in the border. To get
crisp video, deinterlacing is necessary. MPlayer activates deinterlacing
with the postprocessing filter, abbreviated pp. As a general rule, I turn
on four postprocessing filters: horizontal de-blocking (hb), vertical
de-blocking (vb), de-ringing (dr) and brightness/contrast correction
(al). The resulting filter is activated with <tt  >-vf
pp=hb/vb/dr/al</tt>.
Putting it all together, the command line is:

<pre     class="programlisting">
mplayer -fs -vf pp=hb/vb/dr/al -vf expand=0:-50 (filename)
</pre>
</p><p>
During playback, MPlayer's extensive keyboard commands enable pausing,
fast-forwarding and picture adjustment, as well as on-screen display.
