    The Perl debugger, a part of the core Perl distribution, is
    a useful tool to master, allowing close interactive
    examination of executing Perl code.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2671580.0x2769450"></a></h2></div></div><p>This article is a tutorial about the
Perl5 source debugger and assumes that the reader has written at
least one or more simple Perl programs. It is best read in front of
a computer, following along with a copy of the code, available at
<i  >Linux Journal</i>'s FTP site (see
<a href="2484s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a>). The version of Perl
that I use is perl5.004_1, which comes with the Perl debugger level
1. I've noticed some subtle differences between this and earlier
versions of the debugger. If something discussed here doesn't work
for you, consider upgrading.
</p><p>The Perl programming language is being used increasingly on
the World Wide Web as the back end to Common Gateway Interface
(CGI) forms and interactive web pages, as well as for automated
scripts for maintaining web sites and Unix servers in general. As a
result, more and more users are beginning to learn Perl.</p><p>Conceptually, a debugger is a tool which allows the
programmer a greater degree of control over the execution of the
program without having to physically insert code that provides this
control. A debugger allows the programmer to step through the
program code, line by line if necessary. It allows peeks into the
contents of the variables of the program, as well as into the
stack, which is basically the list of functions (known as
subroutines in Perl parlance) that have been called in order to get
from the the <span   class="emphasis"><em>main</em></span> part of the program to the
current point of execution.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2671580.0x2769710"></a>Examples of Debuggers</h2></div></div><p>There are many different debuggers. Some, such as
<span   class="bold"><b>dbx</b></span> or
<span   class="bold"><b>gdb</b></span>, are separate programs that
can be used to debug programs written in languages such as C, C++,
Modula-2 or FORTRAN. (<span   class="bold"><b>gdb</b></span>, for
instance, can handle C, C++ and Modula-2, according to its man
page, which on my system dates from 1991, so by now it may cover
FORTRAN.) Programming environments from Borland, Microsoft and
others may have debugging capabilities built into their windowing
environment.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2671580.0x2769920"></a>Invoking the Debugger with Unix</h2></div></div><p>Invoking the Perl debugger is as easy as invoking Perl
itself. All one needs to do is provide the <b  >-d</b>
option when invoking the Perl interpreter, like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
perl -d perlscript.pl
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2671580.0x2769ad8"></a>Invoking the Debugger with Windows</h2></div></div><p>Perl has also been ported to Win32 systems and can be invoked
similarly. If your system supports the <b  >#!</b> syntax
for scripts, you can have this as the first line of your Perl
script (assuming you keep the Perl interpreter in /usr/bin):</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#!/usr/bin/perl -d
</pre><p>This option isn't supported under Win32 systems (that I know
of), but there are ways to simulate it. See the appropriate
documentation.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2671580.0x2769ce8"></a>Invoking the Debugger with Emacs</h2></div></div><p>The Perl debugger can also run under Emacs, creating an
integrated programming environment that is similar to products from
Borland or others.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2671580.0x2769df0"></a>How the Debugger Works</h2></div></div><p>Generally, when using a program written in Perl, you are
invoking the program with the Perl interpreter. A Perl compiler is
on the horizon, but will not be directly covered by this article.
(The most logical way to debug code intended for the Perl compiler
is to use the standard debugger until the code is &ldquo;bug free&rdquo;,
then compile it.)</p><p>Under normal conditions, the Perl interpreter will read in
the Perl script and will do a certain amount of compilation,
turning your Perl code into some highly-optimized instructions,
which are then interpreted. When using the debugger, extra Perl
code is inserted into your code before it is handed off to the
interpreter. Also, a library file, called in current releases
perl5db.pl, is <span   class="emphasis"><em>required</em></span> in your Perl script.
This final script is interpreted, resulting in the program running
in the debugging environment.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2671580.0x2769fa8"></a>The Warning Flag</h2></div></div><p>When programming in Perl, you should probably always use the
warning flag. Use this just as you would use the debug flag, as
follows:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
perl -w
</pre><p>When you are getting strange results from your program, you
should <span   class="bold"><b>definitely</b></span> use the warning
flag. The warning flag causes Perl to issue warnings regarding your
code. These warnings are about things which are not fatal, but may
cause problems. You can view the warnings as critiques of your
coding style. Common warnings are those indicating that a certain
variable has been used only once (perhaps a typo), or that a used
package can't be found (maybe the package is not available on your
system or is installed incorrectly).
</p><p>Perl doesn't make you specify function prototypes and allows
you to create variables at any point, so you don't have the
advantages of type checking, although, with Perl 5 you can
optionally have type checking for subroutines.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2671580.0x276a210"></a>Commands (also see the man page)</h2></div></div><p>This tutorial covers the debugger commands that I've found
the most useful. The <span   class="bold"><b>perldebug</b></span> man
page has a complete list of commands.</p><p>The most important command that can be entered into the
debugger is <b  >h</b>, which prints out a help screen.
This tends to scroll off the screen, so type <b  >h h</b>
to see the help screen better formatted to fit your screen. Or, you
can type <b  >|h</b>, which will pipe the output of the
command <b  >h</b> into a pager, such as
<span   class="bold"><b>more</b></span> or
<span   class="bold"><b>less</b></span>. You can define what pager to
use by setting the PAGER environmental variable to whatever pager
you prefer. I prefer using less. (You can actually do this from
within the debugger by typing:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ENV{'PAGER'} = "/usr/bin/less"
</pre><p>at the debugger prompt.) This piping mechanism works with
more than just the help command, so if you ever do something and
the result moves off your screen, try prepending it with a pipe.
You can get help with individual commands by typing <b  >h
command</b>.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2671580.0x276a6e0"></a>Simple Example</h2></div></div><p>Now let's look at actual examples of using the debugger.
We'll start with the simple snippet of Perl code in
<a href="2484l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a>, called p1.pl. Notice
that we are executing the code with the <b  >-d</b>
option to <span   class="bold"><b>perl</b></span>, invoking the
debugger. Upon invoking the script under the debugger, we'll see
the following:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Loading DB routines from perl5db.pl version 1
Emacs support available.
Enter h or h h for help.
main::(./p1.pl:3): if(0) {
 DB&lt;1&gt;
</pre><p>The debugger has suspended the normal execution of p1.pl, and
is waiting for a command. Notice that we are given some information
concerning where we are in the text of the program. The string
<b  >main::(./p1.pl:3):</b> tells us that we are in the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>main</em></span> part of the Perl code, that the program
we are executing is <b  >./p1.pl</b> and that we are at
line three of the code. If we were in the middle of another Perl
package, that package name would be listed here. We are also shown
that line three is <b  >if(0) {</b>. When we see code on
a line, we have not yet executed it; rather it is this line in the
code that is about to be executed. The next line,
<b  >DB&lt;1&gt;</b>, is a prompt at which to enter the
first command to the debugger. If you enter a command and wish to
repeat it, you can enter <b  >!
<i><tt>comnum</tt></i></b>, where
<b  ><i><tt>comnum</tt></i></b> is the command
number you wish to repeat.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2671580.0x276acb8"></a>Listing Code</h2></div></div><p>We can see more of the surrounding script by typing
<b  >l</b> and pressing <b  >enter</b>. Be
careful not to put white space before this or any other commands.
Doing so tells the debugger that what follows is not a command.
Instead, the debugger will try to execute the code as normal Perl
code and will evaluate it in the current context of the program
being debugged. The debugger will do the same thing for any input
it doesn't recognize as a debugger command. Using the character ;
(semicolon) to end the command is optional.</p><p>Entering <b  >l</b> (letter l for list) causes the
following lines to appear on the screen:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
3==&gt; if(0) {
4: print "Can't get here!\n";
5 }
6
7: while ($i &lt; 10) {
8: $i++;
9 }
10
11: if($i &gt;= 9) {
12: print "Hello, world!\n";
 DB&lt;1&gt;
</pre><p>Notice the arrow, <b  >==&gt;</b>. This represents
the current line of code. In this case, it is line 3 and is the
first actual line of Perl code. Notice also that all the lines
which actually have executable code on them are labeled with a :
(colon) after the line number. This is important, because later on
when we get into breakpoints and action points, we will only be
able to set them at these lines.
</p><p>Entering <b  >l</b> again yields this
output:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
13 }
14
15: exit 0;
 DB&lt;1&gt;
</pre><p>The <b  >l</b> without any arguments reveals the
next window of Perl code. Subsequent usage reveals the next window
and the next. There is an internal line pointer that gets
incremented one window each time <b  >l</b> is used. To
back up a window, type <b  >-</b> (hyphen) and press
<b  >enter</b>, then press <b  >l</b> again.
</p><p>There are also arguments to the <b  >l</b> command,
dealing with various ways of specifying what lines are printed
based on their line numbers. We will use some of them as we need
them. Similar to <b  >l</b> is <b  >w</b>,
which prints out windows of program text. See the perldebug man
page for details.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2671580.0x2761d30"></a>Stepping Through Lines of Code</h2></div></div><p>There are two ways to execute the code. We know that the
current line is 3 and is an <b  >if</b> statement. The
first method, <b  >s</b>, is to step through the code,
statement by statement. The other method is <b  >n</b>,
for <span   class="emphasis"><em>next</em></span>, which similarly steps through the
code; however, in the case where the current statement is a
subroutine call (as opposed to a built-in function or some sort of
variable assignment), <b  >n</b> will treat the
subroutine as though it were a built-in function and will step over
the subroutine, as if it is an atomic command. In contrast,
<b  >s</b> will enter the subroutine and step through
every line of the subroutine. It will do the same for any
subroutines encountered within the first one. This can be annoying
when we know that the subroutine is working correctly&mdash;hence the
<b  >n</b> command. For this simple example, where we
have no subroutines, <b  >n</b> has the same effect as
<b  >s</b>. After entering <b  >s</b> or
<b  >n</b>, we can simply press <b  >enter</b>,
and the debugger will reissue the last <b  >s</b> or the
last <b  >n</b> command. This is useful to get through
lines of code quickly. Pressing <b  >s</b> displays the
following:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
main::(./p1.pl:7): while ($i &lt; 10) {
</pre><p>Notice that we've skipped from line 3 to line 7. Enter
<b  >l 3+4</b>. This shows us four lines from line 3. We
skipped to line 7 because the conditional in line 3,
<b  >if(0)</b>, is false. So the <b  >then</b>
part of the conditional is ignored, and the <b  >else</b>
portion is executed.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2671580.0x2762570"></a>Listing Variables</h2></div></div><p>Notice that there is a variable in the code,
<b  >$i</b>. We know that the body of the while loop will
be executed until <b  >$i</b> is greater than or equal to
10. (Enter <b  >l 7+10</b> to see the body of the while
loop.)</p><p>So what value does <b  >$i</b> have now? Type
<b  >p $i</b>. The print command is <b  >p</b>,
and without an argument; it will print the contents of the magic
Perl variable <b  >$_</b>. Any valid Perl expression is a
valid argument to <b  >p</b>. Because anything that the
debugger doesn't recognize as a debugger command is evaluated as
Perl code, you could also type <b  >print</b> instead of
<b  >p</b>. Don't worry about having redirected standard
output to something other than your screen. The debugger will take
care to ensure that you'll see some output. But, typing
<b  >p</b> is quicker than typing
<b  >print</b>, and as any good programmer knows,
laziness is one of the &ldquo;programmer's virtues&rdquo;, the other two
being hubris and impatience (Larry Wall, see Resources).</p><p>Typing <b  >p $i</b> results in nothing. No, we
didn't do anything wrong. <b  >$i</b> hasn't been set to
anything, so it gets the default value of nothing. Type
<b  >s</b> (or just press <b  >enter</b>). Try
<b  >p $i</b> again. It should print the number 1. Press
<b  >enter</b> again and type <b  >p $i</b>
again. Now, we could continue this, but we know that we will keep
spinning in this <span   class="emphasis"><em>while</em></span> loop until the
conditional returns false, which won't happen until
<b  >$i</b> is no longer less than 10. And, as I said
before, impatience is another programmer's virtue, so we'll rush
things along a bit. Enter <b  >$i = 8</b>, then press
<b  >enter</b> again. Do it one more time, and we've
broken free of the loop.</p><p>The last conditional checks that <b  >$i</b> is at
least equal to 9. Because it now is, the <b  >then</b>
portion of the <b  >if</b> statement will not get
executed. Note that we could have set <b  >$i</b> back to
2 before we execute the final <b  >if</b> statement. The
result would have been an execution that under normal conditions
(i.e., without using the debugger) could never have occurred
(assuming the computer is working properly, and no bits in memory
get fiddled).</p><p>As any good first program should, our first debug program
prints <b  >Hello, World!</b> to the screen. Notice that
even under the debugger, this happens as it should. Pressing
<b  >enter</b> one more time terminates the
program.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2671580.0x2763228"></a>More Complex Example</h2></div></div><p>The code in <a href="2484l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2</a> is a
more complex piece of code with a bug in it. It should print out
every regular file in the current directory and all subdirectories,
recursively. Right now, it only prints the files in the current
directory and doesn't seem to delve into further
subdirectories.</p><p>Execute this program in a directory with a few subdirectories
and place files and further subdirectories in these subdirectories
to create a small but diverse hierarchy.</p><p>The output of this code (once the bug gets fixed) from the
directories I ran it in, looked like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
./file1
./dir1.0/file1
./dir1.0/file2
./dir1.0/file3
./dir1.0/dir1.1/file1

./dir2.0/file2
./dir2.0/file3
./dir2.0/dir2.1/file1
./dir2.0/dir2.1/file2
./dir3.0/file1
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2671580.0x2763490"></a>Subroutines</h2></div></div><p>There is one more variation of the list code command,
<b  >l</b>. It is the ability to list the code of a
subroutine, by typing <b  >l
<i><tt>sub</tt></i></b>, where
<b  ><i><tt>sub</tt></i></b> is the subroutine
name.</p><p>Running the code in Listing 2 returns:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Loading DB routines from perl5db.pl version 1
Emacs support available.
Enter h or h h for help.
main::(./p2.pl:3): require 5.001;
 DB&lt;1&gt;
</pre><p>Entering <b  >l searchdir</b> allows us to see the
text of <b  >searchdir</b>, which is the meat of this
program.
<pre     class="programlisting">
22 sub searchdir { # takes directory as argument
23: my($dir) = @_;
24: my(@files, @subdirs);
25
26: opendir(DIR,$dir) or die "Can't open \"
27:     $dir\" for reading: $!\n";
28
29: while(defined($_ = readdir(DIR))) {
30: /^\./ and next; # if file begins with '.', skip

32 ### SUBTLE HINT ###
</pre>


As you can see, I left a subtle hint. The <b  >bug</b> is
that I deleted an important line at this point.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2671580.0x2a77f08"></a>Setting Breakpoints</h2></div></div><p>If we were to step through every line of code in a subroutine
that is supposed to be recursive, it would take all day. As I
mentioned before, the code as in Listing 2 seems only to list the
files in the current directory, and it ignores the files in any
subdirectories. Since the code only prints the files in the
current, initial directory, maybe the recursive calls aren't
working. Invoke the Listing 2 code under the debugger.</p><p>Now, set a breakpoint. A breakpoint is a way to tell the
debugger that we want normal execution of the program until it gets
to a specific point in the code. To specify where the debugger
should stop, we insert a breakpoint. In the Perl debugger, there
there are two basic ways to insert a breakpoint. The first is by
line number, with the syntax <b  >b linenum</b>. If
<b  >linenum</b> is omitted, the breakpoint is inserted
at the next line about to be executed. However, we can also specify
breakpoints by subroutine, by typing <b  >b
<i><tt>sub</tt></i></b>, where
<b  ><i><tt>sub</tt></i></b> is the subroutine
name. Both forms of breakpointing take an optional second argument,
a Perl conditional. If when the flow of execution reached the
breakpoint the conditional evaluates to true, the debugger will
stop at the breakpoint; otherwise, it will continue. This gives
greater control of execution.</p><p>For now we'll set a break at the <b  >searchdir</b>
subroutine with <b  >b searchdir</b>. Once the breakpoint
is set, we'll just execute until we hit the subroutine. To do this,
enter <b  >c</b> (for continue).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2671580.0x2a783d8"></a>Adding Actions</h2></div></div><p>Looking at the code in Listing 2, we can see that the first
call to <b  >searchdir</b> comes in the main code. This
seems to works fine, or else nothing would be printed out. Press
<b  >c</b> again to continue to the next invocation of
<b  >searchdir</b>, which occurs in the
<b  >searchdir</b> routine.</p><p>We wish to know what is in the <b  >$dir</b>
variable, which represents the directory that will be searched for
files and subdirectories. Specifically, we want to know the
contents of this variable each time we cycle through the code. We
can do this by setting an action. By looking at the program
listing, we see that by line 25, the variable
<b  >$dir</b> has been assigned. So, set an action at
line 25 in this way:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
a 25 print "dir is $dir\n"
</pre><p>Now, whenever line 25 comes around, the
<b  >print</b> command will be executed. Note that for
the <b  >a</b> command, the line number is optional and
defaults to the next line to be executed.
</p><p>Pressing <b  >c</b> will execute the code until we
come across a breakpoint, executing action points that are set
along the way. In our example, pressing <b  >c</b>
continuously will yield the following:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
main::(../p2.pl:3): require 5.001;
 DB&lt;1&gt; b searchdir
 DB&lt;2&gt; a 25 print "dir is $dir\n"

 DB&lt;3&gt;
</pre><p>Note that older versions of the debugger don't output the
last line as listed here, but instead exit the debugger. This newer
version is nice because when the program has finished it still lets
you have control so that you can restart the program.</p><p>It still seems that we aren't getting into any
subdirectories. Enter <b  >D</b> and <b  >A</b>
to clear all breakpoints and actions, respectively, and enter
<b  >R</b> to restart. Or, in older debugger versions,
simply restart the program to begin again.</p><p>We now know that the
<span   class="bold"><b>searchdir</b></span> subroutine isn't being
called for any subdirectories except the first level ones. Looking
back at the text of the program, notice in lines 44 through 46 that
the only time the searchdir subroutine is called recursively is
when there is something in the <b  >@subdirs</b> list.
Put an action at line 42 that will print the
<b  >$dir</b> and <b  >@subdirs</b> variables
by entering:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
a 42 print "in $dir is @subdirs \n"
</pre><p>Now, put a breakpoint at line 12 to prevent the program from
outputting to our screen (<b  >b 12</b>), then enter
<b  >c</b>. This will tell us all the subdirectories that
our program thinks are in the directory.

This program sees that there are directories in &ldquo;.&rdquo;, but not in
any of the subdirectories within &ldquo;.&rdquo;. Since we are printing out
the value of <b  >@subdirs</b> at line 42, we know that
<b  >@subdirs</b> has no elements in it. (Notice that
when listing line 42, there is the letter &ldquo;a&rdquo; after the line
number and a colon. This tells us that there is an action point
here.) So, nothing is being assigned to <b  >@subdirs</b>
in line 37, but <span   class="emphasis"><em>should</em></span> be if the current (as
held in <b  >$_</b>) file is a directory. If it is, it
should be pushed into the <b  >@subdirs</b> list. This is
not happening.
</p><p>One error I've committed (intentionally, of course) is on
line 38. There is no catch-all &ldquo;else&rdquo; statement. I should
probably put an error statement here. Instead of doing this, let's
put in another action point. Reinitialize the program so that all
points are cleared and enter the following:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
a 34 if( ! -f $_ and ! -d $_ ) { print "in $dir: $_ is
weird!\n" }
b 12"
c
</pre><p>which reveals:
<pre     class="programlisting">
main::(../p2.pl:3): require 5.001;
 DB&lt;1&gt; a 34 if( ! -f $_ and ! -d $_ ) { print "in $dir:
$_ is weird!\n" }
 DB&lt;2&gt; b 12
 DB&lt;3&gt; c
in dir1.0: dir1.1 is weird!
in dir1.0: dir2.1 is weird!
in dir1.0: file2 is weird!
in dir1.0: file3 is weird!
in dir2.0: dir2.1 is weird!
in dir2.0: dir1.1 is weird!
in dir2.0: file2 is weird!
in dir2.0: file3 is weird!
main::(../p2.pl:12): foreach (@files) {
 DB&lt;3&gt;
</pre>


While the program can read (through the <b  >readdir</b>
call on line 29) that dir1.1 is a file of some type in dir1.0, the
file test (the <b  >-f</b> construct) on dir1.1 says that
it is not.
</p><p>It would be nice to halt the execution at a point (line 34)
where we have a problem. We can use the conditional breakpoint that
I mentioned earlier to do this. Reinitialize or restart the
debugger, and enter:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
b 34 ( ! -f $_ and ! -d $_ )
c
p
p $dir
</pre><p>You'll get output that looks like this:
<pre     class="programlisting">
main::(../p2.pl:3): require 5.001;
 DB&lt;1&gt; b 34 ( ! -f $_ and ! -d $_ )
 DB&lt;2&gt; c
main::searchdir(../p2.pl:34): if( -f $_) { # if its a file...
 DB&lt;2&gt; p
dir1.1
 DB&lt;2&gt; p $dir
dir1.0
 DB&lt;3&gt;
</pre>


The first line sets the breakpoint, the next <b  >c</b>
executes the program until the break point stops it. The
<b  >p</b> prints the contents of the variable
<b  >$_</b> and the last command, <b  >p
$dir</b> prints out <b  >$dir</b>. So, dir1.1 is a
file in dir1.0, but the file tests (<b  >-d</b> and
<b  >-f</b>) don't admit that it exists, and therefore
dir1.1 is not being inserted into <b  >@subdirs</b> (if
it's a directory) or into <b  >@files</b> (if it's a
file).
</p><p>Now that we are back at a prompt, we could inspect all sorts
of variables, subroutines or any other Perl construct. To save you
from banging your heads against your monitors, and thus saving both
your heads and your monitors, I'll tell you what is wrong.</p><p>All programs have something known as the current working
directory (CWD). By default, the CWD is the directory where the
program starts. Any and all file accesses (such as file tests or
file and directory openings) are made in reference from the CWD. At
no time does our program change its CWD. But the values returned by
the <b  >readdir</b> call on line 29 are simply file
names relative to the directory that <b  >readdir</b> is
reading (which is in <b  >$dir</b>). So, when we do the
<b  >readdir</b>, <b  >$_</b> gets assigned a
string representing a file (or directory) within the directory in
<b  >$dir</b> (which is why it's called a subdirectory).
But when running the <b  >-f</b> and
<b  >-d</b> file tests, they look for
<b  >$_</b> in the context of the CWD. But it isn't in
the CWD, it's in the directory represented by
<b  >$dir</b>. The moral of the story is that we should
be working with <b  >$dir/$_</b>, not just
<b  >$_</b>. So the string</p><pre     class="programlisting">
###SUBTLE HINT###
</pre><p>should be replaced by
<pre     class="programlisting">
$_ = "$dir/$_"; # make all path names absolute
</pre>


That sums it up. Our problem was we were dealing with relative
paths, not absolute (from the CWD) paths.
</p><p>Putting it back into our example, we need to check
<b  >dir1.0/dir1.1</b>, not <b  >dir1.1</b>. To
check to make sure that this is what we want, we can put in another
action point. Try typing:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
a 34 $_ = "$dir/$_"
c
</pre><p>In effect this temporarily places the corrective measure into
our code. Action points are the first item on the line to be
evaluated. You should now see the proper results of the execution
of the program:
<pre     class="programlisting">
DB&lt;1&gt; a 34 $_ = "$dir/$_"
DB&lt;2&gt; c
./file1
./dir1.0/file1
./dir1.0/file2
./dir1.0/file3

with the calling stack a bit. Giving the command
<b  >T</b> will display the current calling stack. The
calling stack is a list of the subroutines which have been called
between the current point in execution and the beginning of
execution. In other words, if the main portion of the code executes
subroutine &ldquo;a&rdquo;, which in turn executes subroutine &ldquo;b&rdquo;, which
calls &ldquo;c&rdquo;, then pressing &ldquo;T&rdquo; while in the middle of subroutine
&ldquo;c&rdquo; outputs a list going from &ldquo;c&rdquo; all the way back to
&ldquo;main&rdquo;.</p><p>Start up the program and enter the following commands (omit
the second one if you have fixed the bug we discovered in the last
section):</p><pre     class="programlisting">
b 34 ( $_ =~ /file2$/)
a 34 $_ = "$dir/$_"
c
</pre><p>These commands set a breakpoint that will only stop execution
if the value of the variable <b  >$_</b> ends with the
string <b  >file2</b>. Effectively, this code will halt
execution at arbitrary points in the program. Press
<b  >T</b> and you'll get this:
<pre     class="programlisting">
@ = main::searchdir('./dir1.0/file2') called from file '../p2.pl' line
45
@ = main::searchdir(.) called from file '../p2.pl' line 10
</pre>


</p><p>Enter <b  >c</b>, then <b  >T</b>
again:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
@ = main::searchdir('./dir1.0/dir1.1/file2') called from file
`../p2.pl' line 45
@ = main::searchdir(undef) called from file '../p2.pl' line 45
@ = main::searchdir(.) called from file '../p2.pl' line 10
</pre><p>Do it once more:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
@ = main::searchdir('./dir2.0/file2') called from file '../p2.pl' line
45
@ = main::searchdir(.) called from file '../p2.pl' line 10
</pre><p>You can go on, if you so desire, but I think we have enough
data from the arbitrary stack dumps we've taken.</p><p>We see here which subroutines were called, the debugger's
best guess of which arguments were passed to the subroutine and
which line of which file the subroutine was called from. Since the
lines begin with <b  >@ =</b> , we know that
<b  >searchdir</b> will return a list. If it were going
to return a scalar value, we'd see <b  >$ =</b>. For
hashes (also known as associative arrays), we would see <b  >%
=</b>.</p><p>I say &ldquo;best guess of what arguments were passed&rdquo; because in
Perl, the arguments to subroutines are placed into the @_ magic
list. However, manipulating @_ (or <b  >$_</b>) in the
body of the subroutine is allowed and even encouraged. When a
<b  >T</b> is entered, the stack trace is printed out,
and the current value of @_ is printed as the arguments to the
subroutine. So when @_ is changed, the trace doesn't reflect what
was actually passed as arguments to the subroutine.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2671580.0x2cf55d0"></a>Warnings</h2></div></div><p>Well, by now you must be thinking, &ldquo;Gosh, this Perl debugger
is so keen that with it I can end world hunger, learn to play the
piano and increase my productivity by 300%!&rdquo; Well, this is the
right attitude. You are now displaying the third programmer's
virtue, hubris. However, there are some warnings.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2671580.0x2cf56d8"></a>Race Conditions</h2></div></div><p>Race conditions are the scourge of the programmer. Race
conditions are bugs that occur only under certain circumstances.
These circumstances usually involve the time at which certain
events correlate with other events. Using the debugger to debug
these situations is not always possible, because the act of using
the debugger may change the timing of the events in the program.
This can cause a symptom to occur without the debugger, but while
using the debugger, the symptom may disappear. The bug isn't gone,
it just isn't being &ldquo;tickled&rdquo;.</p><p>There really isn't any stock method to get rid of race
conditions. Usually, an intense analysis of the algorithms is
necessary. Finite-state diagrams may also be useful, if you have
the patience for it.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2671580.0x2cf5838"></a>Process Management, IPC</h2></div></div><p>When writing code that involves more than one process (for
example, if your code uses a &ldquo;fork&rdquo; system call or its
equivalent), using the debugger becomes very difficult. This is
because when the fork occurs, you are left with two (or more)
processes, all running under the debugger. But since the debugger
is interactive, you have to interact with every process. The result
is that you have to individually deal with each process,
controlling each execution. All the processes will want to read
debug commands from the controlling terminal, but only one at a
time will be able to do so. The other(s) will block, waiting for
the first to complete. When it does, another process will complete.
Incidentally, we can't know for sure which process will be first.
This is an example of the above mentioned race condition.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2671580.0x2cf5940"></a>Perl Code Must Be Compilable</h2></div></div><p>The final concern with using the debugger is compilation.
Because the debugger is actually just debugging code inserted into
your script, it is necessary that your script be compilable. That
is, there should be no syntax errors.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2671580.0x2cf5a48"></a>Summary</h2></div></div><p>Mastering the Perl 5 debugger is almost as useful as
mastering Perl 5 itself. It allows you to take part in the actual
execution of your program, to examine and experiment. It allows you
to kill the bugs.</p></div></div>
