three years. In that time, I have been impressed by the
creativeness of the Linux community, and its dedication to
Linux.</p><p>Having caught the fever myself, I find myself telling my
acquaintances in business about Linux and what it can do for them.
Some are willing to listen and will use Linux for some narrowly
defined tasks, such as a firewall. Most, however, are reluctant to
use Linux as a part of their core operation. This is due in part to
a reluctance to entrust their businesses to a free operating
system&mdash;&ldquo;free&rdquo; somehow implying cheap or inferior. But a large
part of the reluctance, I've found, is due to a seeming lack of
applications that run under Linux.</p><p>In particular, the fact that none of the &ldquo;big three&rdquo;
relational database packages are available in Linux editions is a
serious problem for many business people. As businesses come to
depend upon relational databases for managing their day-to-day
operation, having a robust relational database management system
(RDBMS) available is crucial to selling an operating system to
business people.</p><p>Fortunately, a solution to this problem exists if one is
willing to consider software written somewhere other than northern
California. Many companies in Canada and Europe now offer their
products with Linux support, and some of those products offer much
of the functionality of better known products at a fraction of the
price. One such product is the Yard RDBMS.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdda580.0xed2978"></a>What Is Yard?</h2></div></div><p>Yard is an RDBMS package that is published by Yard GmbH of
Cologne, Germany. The Yard package includes the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>SQL engine</p></li><li><p>Utilities for monitoring and managing the
engine</p></li><li><p>ODBC drivers and libraries for Windows 3.1, Windows
95 and Windows NT</p></li><li><p>JDBC driver</p></li><li><p>ESQL-C library: with this package, you can write C
programs that have SQL statements embedded within them.</p></li><li><p>X Window System-based tool for interrogating the
database: this tool uses a point-and-click method for interacting
with a database. With it, a user who has no knowledge of SQL can
build queries and interrogate the database.</p></li><li><p>Tools for building a CGI interface to a
database</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdda580.0xed2fa8"></a>Implementation</h2></div></div><p>Yard is a fully featured RDBMS. Its SQL engine includes the
following features:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Full implementation of the SQL-2 standard</p></li><li><p>Stored procedures, implemented using the
stored-procedure language described in the draft SQL-3 standard of
August 1994</p></li><li><p>Triggers, implemented as described in the draft
SQL-3 standard</p></li><li><p>Advanced data types, including
<span   class="bold"><b>VARCHAR</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>TEXT</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>BLOB</b></span> (binary large object)</p></li><li><p>A rich set of functions, including mathematical
functions, date functions, string-manipulation functions and
user-customized functions</p></li><li><p>Methods for enforcing domain integrity and
referential integrity</p></li><li><p>Support for locale-specific data, including the use
of national character sets for sorting, display of date and time
and display of money</p></li><li><p>Physical and logical logging</p></li></ul></div><p>Yard uses a standard client/server interface: the SQL engine
services requests from client processes that are running either
locally or on networked systems. Local requests are received via
pipes; network requests are received via sockets. Client processes
can use a number of protocols to exchange data with the engine:
ODBC, JDBC, ESQL-C, etc.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdda580.0xed37e8"></a>Resource Management</h2></div></div><p>When you install Yard, you must define one or more
<span   class="emphasis"><em>database systems</em></span> (DBS). Each DBS has its own
shared-memory segment that is used by every user who is working
with that DBS, and one or more <span   class="emphasis"><em>database
spaces</em></span>, each of which is a chunk of disk that holds
data. Yard's method of managing system resources closely resembles
that of major commercial relational database packages; if you are
familiar with Informix OnLine, you will feel at home working with
Yard.</p><p>Each of Yard's database spaces is a statically allocated
portion of disk. Usually, a database space is a part of a raw disk
partition&mdash;one that does not have a file system on it. A database
space can also be a file, although this is discouraged.</p><p>The system administrator must use a fairly complex formula to
compute just how much disk space to allocate to a given database
space. This formula includes the number and size of the physical
and logical logs, the number of users, the number of tables and the
estimated extent of each table.</p><p>The administrator can dictate the database space used by
individual tables within a database. By estimating the frequency
with which individual tables will have to be accessed, the
administrator can balance disk I/O across all of the devices that
hold a given database and thus ensure transactions are processed as
quickly as possible.</p><p>As you can see, Yard is a serious package. To see it at its
best requires serious hardware&mdash;preferably a machine with lots of
memory, cycles to burn and multiple SCSI disks. It also requires an
administrator who knows databases, UNIX and hardware and who can
devote a significant portion of her time to monitoring and managing
the database.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdda580.0xed3b00"></a>Versions</h2></div></div><p>To use Yard, you must purchase a license for the SQL engine,
plus licenses for one or more ancillary systems (ODBC, ESQL-C,
YARD-X or JDBC).</p><p>Yard costs a fraction of what you would pay Oracle or
Informix for a package with similar functionality. An SQL license
for five users costs 990DM (not including value-added tax)&mdash;or
about $490 US. (The actual cost will depend upon the rate of
exchange between the Deutschmark and the US dollar, which
fluctuates.) The other tools are similarly priced.</p><p>Unlike Oracle, which utilizes &ldquo;named users&rdquo; (that is, only
a defined set of individuals can use the package), Yard defines a
&ldquo;user&rdquo; as someone who is interacting with the engine. Thus, a
five-user license can actually serve more than five users&mdash;a fact
that is particularly important if your users work only
intermittently with the database.</p><p>A free personal edition of Yard is available for download
from Yard's web site (http://www.yard.de/). This package supports a
single user and limits the size of the database. An ODBC driver is
also available for the private edition. If you are interested in
Yard, the private edition is an excellent way to become familiar
with it.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdda580.0xeca5a0"></a>Documentation</h2></div></div><p>Documentation comes in the form of HTML files. Some
sub-systems also have PostScript versions available; in particular,
these are available for the ESQL-C library.</p><p>Documentation is available in German and English. I do not
speak German but I found the English documentation to be
well-organized and complete and its English to be both correct and
lucid. My only complaint is that the HTML version tends to put each
sub-section into its own file, making it difficult to print a copy
to read while you're away from your computer.</p><p>The documentation assumes that you know SQL and are
thoroughly familiar with Linux. Again, Yard is not a package for
beginners.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdda580.0xeca758"></a>Installation</h2></div></div><p>Installation of Yard is driven by a shell script and runs
smoothly. The script requests a location for installing the
binaries, requests license numbers and keys, then copies the bits
appropriately. A complete installation of the engine, libraries,
header files and configuration files takes less than 11
megabytes.</p><p>Installation, unfortunately, is hampered by minimal
documentation. The only documentation you receive are two lines of
instruction, printed on the CD-ROM case, telling you to mount the
CD-ROM and invoke the installation script. Thereafter, you're on
your own. If something goes wrong, your only recourse is to read
the shell script and interpret what it was doing when it
failed.</p><p>Thanks to this flaw, installation is practically guaranteed
to fail at some point, at least on your first try. For example,
nowhere does the Yard package indicate that the binaries must be
owned by a user and group named
<span   class="bold"><b>yard</b></span>&mdash;your first hint of this
requirement is the obscure error message you see when the script
fails.</p><p>This may be splitting hairs, but it is a pain to diagnose and
fix problems that could easily have been avoided had the publisher
included a page of instructions in a README file.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdda580.0xeca9c0"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>Yard is a fully implemented, enterprise-scale
database-management package. With it, you can process transactions
for a small- to medium-sized business or not-for-profit enterprise.
It offers most of the features of Oracle or Informix, but at a
fraction of the cost.</p><p>Since it is an enterprise-scale RDBMS, Yard may be too much
database for some users. If you are looking for a tool with which
you can learn SQL or if you wish to set up a small database for
your church or fantasy-baseball league, you probably would be
better off with a more modest commercial package, such as
JustLogic, or with one of the free databases, such as PostgreSQL or
msql.</p><p>However, if you are a contractor who specializes in
Linux-based solutions or a business person who is considering using
Linux as the backbone of your enterprise's information system, you
will find that Yard is serious software worth serious
consideration.</p></div></div>
