months now, and each month I look forward to receiving the newest
edition in the mail. Each edition is better than the last, and you
folks always seem to cover issues I need more information about
right around the same time the magazine arrives (are you psychic?).
Perhaps the following might be of interest to your readers.</p><p>Would you like to work on an exciting project? There is a
Windows application, called JWP&mdash;a Japanese Word Processor. This
package was written by Stephen Chung, and as a GNU product it is
freely distributable. I've used it extensively over the past few
years, and it is a <span   class="emphasis"><em>great</em></span> package.</p><p>This project will never get off the ground without
volunteers; therefore, I invite any interested X-Windows developer
who wants to make a contribution both to the GNU and
Japanese-speaking communities, to lend a hand with this exciting
project.</p><p>The JWP-Port Project home page contains more information on
the JWP package as well as the JWP-Port project itself. If you are
interested, please visit the page at
http://qlink.queensu.ca/~3srf/jwp-port/.</p><p>&mdash;Steve Frampton 3srf@qlink.queensu.ca</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1025580.0x111d3a0"></a>ispell</h2></div></div><p>I just read your <i  >LJ</i> article on
<span   class="bold"><b>ispell</b></span>. [&ldquo;Take Command&rdquo;,
February 1998] You obviously like it. I find it a large pain in the
ass, and wish I had a normal UNIX spell-checker available on my
Linux box.</p><p>I have two gripes concerning ispell. First, the word list it
comes with is not very complete. I've added 382 words so far and
keep adding. One reason for needing to add so many is that ispell
(for reasons I have argued with its creator about) insists on
trimming &ldquo;'s&rdquo; from possessives. That means that sooner or later I
find myself having to add the possessive form of every noun in the
language to my word list. And that's my second gripe: why can't
they at least provide the removal of &ldquo;'s&rdquo; as an option?</p><p>The developer of ispell insists that this bug is a feature. I
think his feature is a bug. What do you think? Doesn't this bug
you?</p><p>&mdash;Andrew T. Young aty@mintaka.sdsu.edu</p><p>In general, ispell works well for me, although I do have my
own frustrations. I'd like it to have a &ldquo;change all&rdquo; feature, so
if the word is consistently misspelled throughout I only have to
tell it to change it once. There are words I think should be in
there that aren't: hydroponic and oxymoron, for example. I've added
304 words but many have been proper names (people and products),
computer jargon and abbreviations.</p><p>The &ldquo;'s&rdquo; is a feature in the spell checker I have at home
too; at least for words I am adding to the dictionary. I too find
it annoying, but not as much as you evidently do.</p><p>&mdash;Editor</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1025580.0x111d768"></a>Linux</h2></div></div><p>I just read the Letter to the Editor from searoy@aol.com
[February 1998] and thought I needed to share with you our
experience with Linux at work. First of all, you do not have to
become a programmer to run Linux and many of its applications (my
two sharpest guys are operators). The Red Hat 5.0 distribution (it
costs a whopping $39 US) is very easy to install on Intel computers
and even runs on Sun SPARCs and DEC Alphas (you need to be familiar
with how SPARCs and Alphas work through the boot process). Red Hat
comes with editors, databases, compilers, scripting languages
(Perl, Expect, etc.), network security tool and several types of
servers (web, SAMBA, printer, Novell, etc). Even the updates are
easy to get off of the web and install on the computer.</p><p>The second thing we like about Linux is that it is supported
by programmers, hackers, engineers and users around the world, so
problems get fixed fast. I recently read an article in BYTE
magazine about the bug in the Pentium processors, and the only OS
to have a fix out was Linux. (The bug is in a piece of code that
will try to stuff a 64 bit word into a 32 bit register.)</p><p>The third thing we like is that we learn how the computer,
operating system and applications work, which has a snowballing
effect. Each time we've solved one problem or gotten a program
working it has helped on the Solaris and HP-UX systems we have.
Last, you can get into Linux cheaply. Find an old 386/486 with 16MB
of memory and at least 300 MB of disk space and you have a computer
system for experimentation. Kevin (one of my operators) built a
firewall for the local college with a 386/33 that they had in the
scrap pile, and we run all of our network monitoring tools on
486/66 ASTs that were headed for salvage.</p><p>&mdash;Bernie Morin bm@aol.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1025580.0x111d978"></a>&ldquo;A Partner's Survival Guide&rdquo;</h2></div></div><p>Brilliant!

[September 1997] contains an error. Near the bottom of the first
column on page 32 is the following command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
mkfifo pipe;  ls -l pipe1;  cat &lt; pipe

fact be <b  >pipe1</b>. This error caused
<span   class="emphasis"><em>me</em></span> no trouble, but it was not intended for me,
rather for someone who has paid money for <i  >LJ</i>
and expects to learn and trusts <i  >LJ</i> to be
accurate. Now, &ldquo;No finger pointing between <i  >LJ</i>
and Vaught&rdquo;. I would just like to see the guilty party stand up
and apologize to ALL the readers for the frustration they have
caused someone trying to learn. As a publisher, you have an
obligation to ensure that there are no errors. And, please, no
excuses.
</p><p>&mdash;August Gramm asursa@cris.com</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>You are correct: the commands should have read

that</em></span> <i  >LJ</i> has an obligation to publish technically correct
information. We are, however, not perfect. We would like to be, and
we have at least four different people look at each article. We are
continually surprised when mistakes like the one you mention get
past us. The ultimate responsibility for mistakes lies with me&mdash;my
policy has always been &ldquo;the buck stops here&rdquo;. I am sorry for any
frustration caused by these typos. Yours was the only letter I
received about this error and the September issue is quite
old&mdash;perhaps even the newbies were able to figure out the right way
to give the commands.</p><p>&mdash;Editor</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1025580.0x111e0b0"></a>Oracle In-house Linux Port? Bah!</h2></div></div><p>Your piece on databases for Linux (&ldquo;Databases&rdquo;, February
1998) mentions a stealth, &ldquo;in-house&rdquo; port of Oracle for Linux,
which we've apparently had &ldquo;some time.&rdquo; And Oracle refuses &ldquo;to
sell or support it&rdquo;.</p><p>Where do these rumors get started? I've worked for Oracle for
two years, and have been a Linux-head that whole time. If a version
of Oracle written for Linux existed, I'd have noticed.</p><p>Oracle7 for SCO certainly does run on Linux under iBCS, and
quite well. Maybe a misunderstanding of that fact somehow started
the rumor.</p><p>No one here at Oracle has ever heard of an actual Linux port.
If one does exist, perhaps it's being used to help reverse-engineer
those captured UFOs at Area 51. That might explain the super
secrecy.</p><p>&mdash;Steve Abatangle, Oracle
Corporation sabat@us.oracle.com</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>At the 1994 Uniforum Conference, a man wearing an
Oracle badge walked up to the</em></span> <i  >Linux Journal</i> booth and
introduced himself as an Oracle developer to our publisher Phil
Hughes. This man told Phil he had a working version of Oracle on
Linux. Unfortunately, Phil has forgotten the man's name, though not
the event.</p><p>&mdash;Editor</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1025580.0x111e478"></a>Bleeding Edge Articles?</h2></div></div><p>I am a long-time reader of <i  >LJ</i> and have
always been very pleased by your articles. Linux is finally getting
some of the respect it so richly deserves, and it is great to see
such a fine publication supporting the cause.</p><p>I do have a question, however. I'm an occasional kernel
developer and long-time Linux user and I would like to see more
articles (maybe one per issue) on Bleeding Edge Linux projects and
ports. Articles detailing such relevant topics as MacLinux (Linux
for Macintosh/m68k, http://maclinux.wwaves.com/), Linux/PMac, GGI,
and other works in progress would definitely be a boon to your
readers and allow for more people to become involved in these
experimental projects. Now, in the true Linux fashion, I'm not
going to suggest you do things without volunteering myself in the
process and I would like to know if you accept articles from the
user world and (if so) to whom can I send them?</p><p>&mdash;Joe Pranevich knight@wave.lm.com</p><p>We have had articles on the Macintosh and Linux in issue 31,
issue 37 and issue 45. Reuven Lerner talks about CGI each month in
&ldquo;At the Forge&rdquo;. I agree it would be nice to have bleeding edge
articles each month, so we print them as we can. Yes, we do accept
articles from the user world. Please send your ideas to
info@linuxjournal.com. Author information can be found on our web site
at http://www.linuxjournal.com/wanted.html.</p><p>&mdash;Editor</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1025580.0x111e738"></a>BTS</h2></div></div><p>I think the first &ldquo;corrupted terminal&rdquo; answer on page 72 of
the February 1998 issue needs some work:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>cat</b></span> was NOT
&ldquo;designed to handle ASCII files.&rdquo;
<span   class="bold"><b>cat</b></span> conCATenates files to standard
output (hence the name). It concatenates one or more files from
argv, or if argv is empty, simply from stdin until EOF. There is
nothing in cat or its documentation to suggest that it was designed
for ASCII files, or could not handle binary files.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>cat</b></span> does not
&ldquo;interpret a lot of the binary file as control sequences.&rdquo; The
terminal emulation supported by the console code (or an xterm)
interprets any control sequences it is sent via any program that
writes to it. These can come from any program. The terminal
emulator is supposed to do this. It's why things like Pine and
Emacs work, for example.</p></li></ol></div><p>Here's a question for you: how many Linux seats are there,
and how many new seats a month are there? Any idea?
</p><p>&mdash;Ron Minnich rminnich@sarnoff.com</p><p>No idea. Vendors don't like to give their sales numbers to
their competition, and those numbers would probably be the most
accurate count. There is the Linux Counter, but not everyone knows
about it or takes the time to register so its count is way low. If
you haven't registered, go to http://counter.li.org/ and do
so&mdash;now!</p><p>&mdash;Editor</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1025580.0x111ec60"></a>Red Hat CDE</h2></div></div><p>I recently saw the review of Red Hat CDE by Don Kuenz in the
January edition of <i  >LJ</i>, and decided to buy the
software. However, on filling in the order, I saw that the January
price for CDE was 25% higher than the price advertised in
<i  >LJ</i>. I think it's unfortunate that the
information in the published review was out of date before I even
received the magazine. I am also disappointed that Red Hat, while
obviously benefitting from the PR of this review, are not prepared
to honour the advertised price.</p><p>&mdash;Dr. Steven Bird Steven.Bird@edinburgh.ac.uk</p></div></div>
