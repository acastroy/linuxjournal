    Linux was used in two projects as a data acquisition system
    running more or less autonomously in the German ICE trains.
    This article describes design issues and implementation as
    well as the problems and solutions used in those projects.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1605580.0x16fd3f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>The Fraunhofer Gesellschaft is a
non-profit research organization specializing in applied research
and acting as a proponent of technology transfer between basic
research and industry. With nearly 50 institutes in Germany, almost
all aspects of science are covered. Part of the IITB (Institut
f&uuml;r Informations- und Datenverarbeitung) specializes in
applications of computer-based monitoring, control and diagnosis of
industrial processes and equipment by means of signal and image
analysis. As such, our group was involved in two projects requiring
data acquisition and analysis in one of the German high speed
trains, the InterCity Express (ICE). This article describes how the
data acquisition was implemented using Linux.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1605580.0x16fd500"></a>The Projects: UNRA and ICE-D</h2></div></div><p>Project UNRA (unrunde R&auml;der) tried to discover the
reasons wheels of high speed trains become out-of-round sooner than
expected. As railway experts know, train and coach wheels become
out-of-round, i.e., the difference between the minimum and the
maximum radius of a wheel becomes non-negligible. For ICE wheels,
DB-AG uses 0.6 mm as the threshold above which wheels must be
changed. Despite being only 0.1% of the wheel radius, such
differences induce low-frequency vibrations into the coach
structure. They not only put additional stress on structural
materials but also cause an unpleasant ride for passengers.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2512f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
ICE High Speed Train
</p></div></div><p>As part of this project, a measuring axle developed and
patented by Forschungs- und Technologiezentrum der DB-AG (Minden,
Germany) was installed in a regular running ICE to measure triaxial
forces in the stand-up point of the wheel. In addition, four
accelerometers were installed, three on the axes at the bearing and
one in the coach measuring vertical acceleration. In addition, a
resolver was attached to the axle. It delivers 1440 TTL-edges for
one turn of the wheel. The edges are used to clock 90 A/D
conversion for one turn of the wheel, resulting in a sampling rate
dependent on the wheel's rotation speed but synchronous with its
rotation.</p><p>With additional channels not mentioned above, a total of 17
channels had to be measured. Since the radius of an ICE-wheel is
460 mm, 1 km amounts to:</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2512f2.jpg"></div><p>samples, resulting in:</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2512f3.jpg"></div><p>of data every day.</p><p>The second project, called ICE-D, did not have such a great
demand on bandwidth, but it required some data analysis to be
computed on-line. Since the system is quite similar to the one used
in the UNRA project, this project will not be described in such
detail. Suffice it to say that another Linux computer will run for
two years in a coach car with a new type of bogie (the assembly of
four wheels on which the coach rests) to acquire and analyse 50
data channels.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1605580.0x16fdb88"></a>Hardware</h2></div></div><p>The computer hardware used in both projects is not identical
but not very exciting in either case. In UNRA we use a garden
variety Pentium 90 system with Adaptec 2940 SCSI controller, a
sufficiently large Quantum disk, which seems to have settled its
disagreements with the SCSI controller, and an HP DAT streamer. For
the ICE-D project very similar hardware is used. Comparatively
expensive were the 19-inch cases which were necessary to mount the
computer in a rack in the train.</p><p>Of more interest might be the measurement hardware. In UNRA
there is an Analog Devices RTI-860, which is a 16-channel, 12-bit
A/D (analog/digital) conversion board. What makes it particularly
suited for use with Linux is its on board memory of 256K samples,
relieving us from hard real-time constraints.</p><p>Another board, called ADCO, was developed along the
specifications of IITB by CMS. It is basically a device to measure
times with a 40 MHz clock driving a 16-bit counter. On external
events, the counter is read into a FIFO of one kilometer word
length and then reset to start again from zero. Consequently the
FIFO collects counter values representing a sequence:</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2512f4.jpg"></div><p>of times between events. The events are generated by the
resolver mounted on the axle and happen once for every four degrees
of wheel rotation. Knowing how much time the wheel needs to rotate
four degrees, we can calculate the rotational speed of the wheel
with high precision. The one kilometer sample FIFO on the ADCO is
small compared to the buffer on the RTI-860 and actually proved to
be too small for the first driver developed (see below).</p><p>Project ICE-D required another kind of measurement hardware
because the task was not to acquire data at high speed but to
measure up to 64 channels. We decided on an RTI-834 from Analog
Devices because it can measure 32 channels and is probably the only
board around with a useful programmer's manual. The manual is not
free (approximately 250 DM) but, believe it or not, it contains
almost all details about programming the hardware, including
examples that made it comparatively easy to write a device
driver.</p><p>In addition to these devices, a GPS (Global Positioning
System) device was mounted on the coach. Position information was
recorded with the data to be able to correlate it later with actual
locations on the track.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1605580.0x16fdf50"></a>Software</h2></div></div><p>The software comprises several main components: the data
acquisition program, a watchdog and a taper, a GPS monitor and
device drivers. These components are described in the following
subsections.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1605580.0x16fe058"></a>Data Acquisition</h2></div></div><p>Except for the time between two and four o'clock in the
morning, the data acquisition is active and digitizes data. Because
the data acquisition is synchronous with wheel rotation, the data
rate depends on the train's speed. At 300kph the wheel rotates at
about 29Hz resulting in a data rate of</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2512f5.jpg"></div><p>which has to be streamed to disk without loss.</p><p>Every 345 rotations of the wheel (about one kilometer), the
hardware is reset to trigger again on the next zero-degree marker
of the resolver. At that time the data acquisition program fetches
the most recent information from the GPS, writes it to file, closes
the file and opens a fresh one. Each file covers one kilometer of
track and is nearly one megabyte in size. This approach was chosen
for several reasons:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>One megabyte and one kilometer are convenient sizes
to handle with data analysis software.</p></li><li><p>Synchronising every kilometer makes sure that
losing individual events from the resolver due to noise will not
spoil all data for the rest of the day.</p></li><li><p>One kilometer was determined to be a useful
checkpoint to record GPS information.</p></li><li><p>The files are not created anew each day but are
overwritten for efficiency reasons. In case of a power failure, it
is almost impossible to find out how much of a file is new and how
much is from the day before; therefore, a partly written file has
to be thrown away. Throwing away up to one kilometer of data is a
reasonable tradeoff between number of files and amount of data
lost.</p></li></ol></div><p>Of course, there is nothing magic about one kilometer. Two
kilometers or one half kilometer would probably have worked equally
well.</p><p>While reading data from the devices, the data acquisition
program also monitors the wheel's rotational speed to check whether
the train's speed is above 60kph. Below that threshold, data is
considered to be of no interest and is thrown away. In particular
the file currently being written is reset and reused as soon as the
speed rises above the threshold. Of course, up to one kilometer
worth of data recorded at speeds above 60kph is discarded, but in
fact, the threshold of 60kph is a rough guess anyway so no harm is
done by discarding some data recorded at speeds slightly above
60kph. Typical travelling speeds of the ICE are, depending on track
type, 100kph, 160kph, 250kph and 280kph, and only those speeds were
of major interest in the project.</p><p>The data acquisition program is rather simple, most of it
doing error handling in case of read or write errors. Since device
drivers were implemented for the RTI-860 as well as for the ADCO,
digitizing is as easy as opening a file and reading from it. The
only thing requiring even minimal thought was that the data rate
from the two drivers is not identical. Reading the same amount of
data from both devices in every course through the main loop would
soon fill up one of the driver's buffers. A general solution in
such cases is the use of the
<span   class="bold"><b>select()</b></span> system call; however, in
the given case, the exact ratio between the two data rates was
known and the amount of data read from each driver in every
read-call was chosen accordingly.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1605580.0x16fe790"></a>cron Jobs</h2></div></div><p>At two o'clock in the morning the data acquisition process
stops recording data in order not to interfere with other work done
at that time. First, a <span   class="bold"><b>cron</b></span> job
reboots the system as a preventive measure against memory leaks.
Although none were observed, rebooting costs nothing and does no
harm. After the boot, the acquired data is written to tape with a
script started as a cron job which ultimately calls tar.</p><p>A minor nuisance was that it is almost impossible to find out
how much space is used on the tape if internal compression of the
DAT drive is enabled. Assuming that the compression ratio is about
the same every day, it would probably have been possible to put two
days' worth or 1.5GB of uncompressed data onto a 2GB tape. Since
the A/D converter only delivers 12 bits which are stored as 16-bit
values, a compression to 1.125GB should be trivial. Another 12%
reduction is probably possible because most of the time the
digitized signals do not cover the full 12 bits.</p><p>During the rest of the day, i.e., not between two and four
o'clock in the morning, another cron job is started every ten
minutes. As a measure against yet unknown bugs in the
data-acquisition program which may cause it to crash, a watchdog
program checks if the data-acquisition process is still in the
process table, and if it is, assumes that it is doing something
useful. If it is not in the table, the system is rebooted. As of
this writing the watchdog has still to prove its utility, since no
such incident has been found in the log files.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1605580.0x16fe9a0"></a>GPS monitor</h2></div></div><p>The GPS device is a cute little gadget that looks like a
computer mouse without buttons. It is about the same size, shape
and color as a mouse and is mounted on the top of the coach to have
a clear view of the sky. It is connected to the computer via a
serial line which also delivers power to the device. As soon as the
GPS is connected, it starts sending several types of information
which can be read with a command as simple as:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cat /dev/ttyS1
</pre><p>as long as /dev/ttyS1 is set to the correct baud rate. By
writing to the device, it can be programmed to deliver only certain
types of information.
</p><p>The high speed data acquisition has one minor deficiency&mdash;it
only delivers a dataset once per second. As described above, the
positioning information is entered into every data file one
kilometer in size. Now suppose that the data acquisition process
starts reading from the GPS after it has acquired the last one
kilometer sample. Reading may take up to one second while the wheel
turns up to 28 times per second, thereby losing about 80 meters of
data.</p><p>Since losing data was not considered efficient, the
<span   class="bold"><b>gpsmonitor</b></span> program was introduced,
running parallel to the data acquisition process. It reads the
position information at the given rate of one second and stores it
in a file where the most recent information is always available for
the data acquisition process.</p><p>To make sure that the data acquisition process does not read
partially written data sets, in general it would be necessary to
use a file locking scheme to bar the acquisition process from
reading while gpsmonitor is writing its data. However, one data set
is only 80 characters in length and is sent to the file in one
write-operation. Checking the Linux kernel sources might show that
this is not an entirely atomic operation, but experiments with a
process rereading the information at the highest possible frequency
have shown that the probability that a write of 80 characters would
be interrupted by another process is practically zero, i.e., was
not observed. Consequently, file locking was considered to be
unnecessary overhead.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1605580.0x16fecb8"></a>Device Drivers</h2></div></div><p>The most interesting part of the project for the Linux hacker
is certainly the device driver section. As usual, no device driver
could be obtained from manufacturers of the boards to be used. It
is a pity that no manufacturer of measurement hardware recognizes
the potential of Linux as a measurement platform. Certainly not a
real-time system, but with today's fast processors and some
precautions, Linux is able to stream data to the disk at high rates
and without dropping data.</p><p>Writing a device driver seemed to be a daunting task, and it
proved to be exactly that, but for reasons other than the expected
ones. Not being particularly familiar with the internals of Linux,
it first seemed that learning the interface between kernel and
driver might be a complicated problem. It proved to be almost too
trivial to mention. With an early version of the kernel hacker's
guide, code of other drivers all around, and the helpful Net
community, communication between kernel and driver was easily
established.</p><p>The bad part was the hardware, mainly due to a lack of decent
documentation. German distributors were approached to almost no
avail, even for analog devices. Linux was as yet unheard of, and
all that could be obtained was source code for MS-DOS and a user's
guide for the RTI-860 containing a full schematic diagram. For the
ADCO, the situation was just about the same. Nevertheless drivers
were written, and the work is almost perfect today. Only the
RTI-860 driver still contains a nasty bug, probably due to a timing
problem: clearing the on-board memory and enabling the trigger
cannot be done in the right order. Independent of which operation
is done first, some samples are sometimes dropped, presumably only
if the trigger line goes active very shortly after the trigger is
enabled.</p><p>Another problem is the kernel itself. This problem was
observed in 1.x kernels and seems to persist in 2.0.x kernels.
Because the ADCO board has only a one kilometer sample FIFO and
must be emptied before it overflows, at a 50KHz sampling rate the
driver has to read the data out at a rate of 50Hz. Put another way,
the driver has to have a look at the board at least every 20ms.
With a time slice of 10ms in a typical Linux kernel, this must
happen every other jiffy. For those not familiar with kernel code,
it should be noted that there is a variable called a jiffy in the
kernel, which is incremented by the timer interrupt. In the Linux
kernel, a jiffy is defined rather exactly to be 10ms. In particular
with the POSIX scheduler available in recent kernels, this should
not present a problem. In contrast to the normal Linux scheduler
which constantly changes process priorities to distribute processor
time in a fair way, the POSIX scheduler allows a fixed priority to
be attached to a process. With the right priorities, at least one
process can be guaranteed to get the processor at the next
scheduling event after it makes a request. This should be at the
next tick of the clock, which is at most 10ms away.</p><p>In practice it was found that sometimes no scheduling occured
for 40, 50 or even 100ms, which was even more irritating as no
other process was active at that time. It looked very much like the
mechanism responsible for paging and/or swapping was responsible
for it, but due to limited resources, the problem could not be
further investigated.</p><p>As a workaround, a mechanism in the kernel was exploited
which allows small pieces of code to run between two jiffies.
Although no scheduling was performed for up to 100ms, the timer
interrupt was not blocked and ticked along fine every 10ms. One of
its tasks is to run code which is registered on a certain queue by
other parts of the kernel. By registering a function which reads
the ADCO's FIFO into a driver-internal buffer, the problem of
missing scheduling events could be circumvented. In fact, it is not
even necessary to use the POSIX scheduler.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1605580.0x16f5808"></a>Conclusion, Open Questions and Lessons
Learned</h2></div></div><p>Linux proved to be an absolutely stable platform for software
development and autonomous data acquisition. The three finger
salute (<b  >ctrl-alt-del</b>), well known on certain
widespread desktop program launchers, is never necessary on
Linux.</p><p>Using A/D conversion boards with on-board memory precludes
all real-time constraints. Boards with too little memory are not
easily supported. The fact that scheduling is sometimes suppressed
for more than 100ms is considered a bug and first resulted in some
hectic and active kernel debugging in cooperation with Ingo Molnar
(Wien). It turned out that there seemed to be more than one reason
for the problems, and they were reported to the kernel developers
by Mr. Molnar. However, since we could not wait for the problem to
be corrected (a simple patch seemed not to be enough), the solution
described above was chosen.</p><p>Programming feature-rich A/D conversion boards proved to be
more complicated than expected. Even the driver for the
well-documented RTI-834 was not easy because of the many
dependencies in time and logic between subcomponents of the board.
It seems as if a general problem with A/D conversion boards is that
designers put too many features on one board introducing
dependencies and side effects only they are able to deal with
correctly. This might be the reason why it is usually not possible
to get good documentation&mdash;it simply does not exist, because nobody
is able to write it.</p><p>A new and very interesting trend in measurement devices was
recently initiated by Intelligent Instrumentation (a Burr Brown
company). Their EDAS (Ethernet Data Acquistion System) is a 16
channel, 12 bit, 100KHz A/D conversion device which can be hooked
to the Ethernet. For UNIX they deliver a library in source code to
talk to the device, i.e., program it and read the data. No new
device driver must be written. The device can either be connected
to a local network or, if continous high speed transfer is
necessary, it can be connected to its own &ldquo;network&rdquo;--a direct
line between the device and a dedicated Ethernet board in the
computer. However, while this idea is very nice and is similar to
those fashionable WebCams, the EDAS is a bit broken for two reaons:
A minor annoyance is that it does not understand RARP (reverse
address resolution protocol). To set its IP address, it has to be
connected to a computer via a serial line. A more major problem is
the device's inability to continuously pump the 100KHz it samples
onto the Net. After the first enthusiasm we were very disappointed
when the German distributor told us that the EDAS' microcontroller
can fill the internal 32 kilometer samples of memory at 100KHz, but
that it is too slow to stream the data to the Ethernet at the same
speed.</p><p>Considering the price of 2500 DM (about $1400 US), it would
be cheaper to combine a single-board PC (1000 DM) with an A/D
conversion board (1000 DM) and, say, some flash RAM as replacement
for a disk into a small case. Install a minimal Linux and a
suitable daemon as an interface between IP and the device driver of
the A/D board, and you have an iDAB (Internet Data Acquisition
Box). Depending on the application, you can even install software
to preprocess the data before it is passed to the network.</p></div></div>
