    A Python SIG has put together a DB-API standard; Mr.
    Kuchling gives us the details.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2681580.0x27793a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>Many people use Python because, like
other scripting languages, it is a portable, platform-independent
and general-purpose language that can perform the same tasks as the
database-centric, proprietary 4GL tools supplied by database
vendors. Like 4GL tools, Python lets you write programs that
access, display and update the information in the database with
minimal effort. Unlike many 4GLs, Python also gives you a variety
of other capabilities, such as parsing HTML, making socket
connections and encrypting data.
</p><p>Possible applications for the Python DB-API include:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Many web sites construct pages on the fly to
display information requested by the user, such as selections from
the products offered in a catalog or from the documents available
in a library. Doing this requires CGI scripts that can extract the
desired information from a database and render it as HTML.</p></li><li><p>An Intranet application might use the
<span   class="bold"><b>Tkinter</b></span> module and the DB-API to
provide a graphical user interface for browsing through a local
database, such as accounts receivable or a customer list.</p></li><li><p>Python programs can be used to analyze data by
computing statistical properties of the data.</p></li><li><p>Python programs can form a testing framework for
programs that modify the database, in order to verify that a
particular integrity constraint is maintained.</p></li></ul></div><p>There are lots of commercial and freeware databases
available, and most of them provide Structured Query Language (SQL)
for retrieving and adding information (see Resources). However,
while most databases have SQL in common, the details of how to
perform an SQL operation vary. The individuals who wrote the Python
database modules invented their own interfaces, and the resulting
proliferation of different Python modules caused problems: no two
of them were exactly alike, so if you decided to switch to a new
database product, you had to rewrite all the code that retrieved
and inserted data.</p><p>To solve the problem, a Special Interest Group (SIG) for
databases was formed. People interested in using Python for a given
application form a SIG of their own: they meet on an Internet
mailing list, where they discuss the topic, exchange ideas, write
code (and debug it) and eventually produce a finished product.
(Sounds a lot like the development process for the Linux kernel,
doesn't it?)</p><p>After some discussion, the Database SIG produced a
specification for a consistent interface to relational
databases&mdash;the DB-API. Thanks to this specification, there's only
one interface to learn. Porting code to a different database
product is much simpler, often requiring the change of only a few
lines.</p><p>The database modules written before the Database SIG are
still around and don't match the specification&mdash;the mSQL module is
the most commonly used one. These modules will eventually be
rewritten to comply with the DB-API; it's just a matter of the
maintainers finding the time to do it.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2681580.0x27799d0"></a>Relational Databases</h2></div></div><p>A relational database is made up of one or more tables. Each
table is divided into columns and rows. A column contains items of
a similar type, such as customer IDs or prices, and a row contains
a single data item, with a value for each column. A single row is
also called a <span   class="emphasis"><em>tuple</em></span> or a
<span   class="emphasis"><em>relation</em></span>, which is where the term &ldquo;relational
database&rdquo; originates.</p><p>For an example database, we'll use a small table designed to
track the attendees for a series of seminars. (See
<a href="2605l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a>.) The Seminars table
lists the seminars being offered; an example row is (1, Python
Programming, 200, 15). Each row contains a unique identifying ID
number (1, in this case), the seminar's title (Python Programming),
its cost ($200), and the number of places still open (15). The
Attendees table lists the name of each attendee, the seminar that
he or she wishes to attend and whether the fee has been paid. If
someone wants to attend more than one seminar, there will be more
than one row with that person's name, with each row having a
different seminar number and payment status.</p><p>The examples below use the
<span   class="bold"><b>soliddb</b></span> module, which supports
accessing SOLID databases from Python. SOLID is a product from
Solidtech that was reviewed by Bradley Willson in
<i  >LJ</i>, September, 1997. I'm not trying to cover
CGI or Tkinter programming, so only the commands to access the
database are presented here, in the same manner as if typed
directly into the Python interpreter.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2681580.0x2779d40"></a>Getting Started</h2></div></div><p>To begin, the program must first import the appropriate
Python module for connecting to the database product being used. By
convention, all database modules compliant with the Python DB-API
have names that end in &ldquo;db&rdquo;, e.g., soliddb and oracledb.</p><p>The next step is to create an object that represents a
database connection. The object has the same name as the module.
The information required to open a connection, and its format,
varies for different databases. Usually, it includes a user name
and password, and some indication of how to find the database
server, such as a TCP/IP hostname. If you're using the free trial
version of SOLID, UNIX pipes are the only method available to
connect to the server, so the code is:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;&gt; import soliddb
&gt;&gt;&gt; db = soliddb.soliddb('UPipe SOLID',
         'amk', 'mypassword')
&gt;&gt;&gt; db
&lt;Solid object at 809bf10&gt;
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2681580.0x2779ef8"></a>Cursor Objects</h2></div></div><p>Next, you should create a cursor object. A cursor object acts
as a handle for a given SQL query; it allows retrieval of one or
more rows of the result, until all the matching rows have been
processed. For simple applications that do not need more than one
query at a time, it's not necessary to use a cursor object because
database objects support all the same methods as cursor objects.
We'll deliberately use cursor objects in the following example.
(For more on beginning SQL, see <span   class="emphasis"><em>At the Forge</em></span>
by Reuven Lerner in <i  >LJ</i>, October, 1997.)</p><p>Cursor objects provide an
<span   class="bold"><b>execute()</b></span> statement that accepts a
string containing an SQL statement to be performed. This, in turn
causes the database server to create a set of rows that match the
query.</p><p>The results are retrieved by calling a method whose name
begins with <span   class="bold"><b>fetch</b></span>, which returns
one or more matching rows or &ldquo;None&rdquo; if there are no more rows to
retrieve. The <span   class="bold"><b>fetchone()</b></span> method
always returns a single row, while
<span   class="bold"><b>fetchmany()</b></span> returns a small number
of rows and <span   class="bold"><b>fetchall()</b></span> returns all
the rows that match.</p><p>For example, to list all the seminars being offered, do the
following:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;&gt; cursor = db.cursor()
&gt;&gt;&gt; # List all the seminars
&gt;&gt;&gt; cursor.execute('select * from Seminars')
&gt;&gt;&gt; cursor.fetchall(
[(4, 'Web Commerce', 300.0, 26),
 (1, 'Python Programming', 200.0, 15),
 (3, 'Socket Programming', 475.0, 7),
 (2, 'Intro to Linux', 100.0, 32),
 ]
</pre><p>A row is represented as a tuple, so the first row returned
is:
<pre     class="programlisting">
(4, 'Web Commerce', 300.0, 26)
</pre>


Notice that the rows aren't returned in sorted order; to do that,
the query has to be slightly different (just add <b  >order by
ID</b>). Because they return multiple rows, the fetchmany()
and fetchall() methods return a list of tuples. It's also possible
to manually iterate through the results using the
<span   class="bold"><b>fetchone()</b></span> method and looping
until it returns &ldquo;None&rdquo;, as in this example which lists all the
attendees for seminar 1:
<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;&gt; cursor.execute (
        'select * from Attendees where seminar=1')
&gt;&gt;&gt; while (1):
...  attendee = cursor.fetchone()
...  if attendee == None: break
...  print attendee
...
('Albert', 1, 'no')
('Beth', 1, 'yes')
('Elaine', 1, 'yes')
</pre>


SQL also lets you write queries that operate on multiple tables, as
in this query, which lists the seminars that Albert will be
attending:
<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;&gt; cursor.execute("""select Seminars.title
...                from Seminars, Attendees
...        where Attendees.name = 'Albert'
...            and Seminars.ID = Attendees.seminar""")
&gt;&gt;&amp;Gt; cursor.fetchall()
[('Python Programming',), ('Web Commerce',)]
</pre>


Now that we can get information out of the database, it's time to
start modifying it by adding new information. Changes are made by
using the SQL <b  >insert</b> and
<b  >update</b> statements. Just like queries, the SQL
statement is passed to the execute() method of a cursor object.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2681580.0x277a688"></a>Transactions</h2></div></div><p>Before showing how to add information, there's one subtlety
to be noted that occurs when a task requires several different SQL
commands to complete. Consider adding an attendee to a given
seminar. This requires two steps. In one step, a row must be added
to the Attendees table giving the person's name, the ID of the
seminar they'll be attending and whether or not they've paid. In
the other step, the <b  >places_left</b> value for this
seminar should be decreased by one, because there's room for one
less person. SQL has no way to combine two commands, so this
requires two execute() calls. But what if something happens and the
second command isn't executed&mdash;perhaps, because the computer
crashed, the network died or there was a typo in the Python
program? The database is now inconsistent: an attendee has been
added, but the <b  >places_left</b> column for that
seminar is now wrong.</p><p>Most databases offer <span   class="emphasis"><em>transactions</em></span> as a
solution for this problem. A transaction is a group of commands:
either all of them are executed, or none of them are. Programs can
issue several SQL commands as part of a transaction and then
<span   class="emphasis"><em>commit</em></span> them, (i.e., tell the database to apply
all these changes simultaneously). Alternatively, the program can
decide that something's wrong and <span   class="emphasis"><em>roll back</em></span>
the transaction without making the changes.</p><p>For databases that support transactions, the Python interface
silently starts a transaction when the cursor is created. The
<span   class="bold"><b>commit()</b></span> method commits the
updates made using that cursor, and the
<span   class="bold"><b>rollback()</b></span> method discards them.
Each method then starts a new transaction. Some databases don't
have transactions, but simply apply all changes as they're
executed. On these databases, commit() does nothing, but you should
still call it in order to be compatible with those databases that
do support transactions.</p><p><a href="2605l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2</a> is a Python
function that tries to get all this right by committing the
transaction once both operations have been performed. Calling this
function is simple:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
addAttendee('George', 4, 'yes')
</pre><p>We can verify that the change was performed by checking the
listing for seminar #4, and listing its attendees. This produces
the following output:
<pre     class="programlisting">
Seminars:
4       'Web Commerce'  300.0   25
Attendees:
Albert  4       no
Dale    4       yes
Felix   4       no
George  4       yes
</pre>


Note that this function is still buggy if more than one process or
thread tries to execute it at the same time. Database programming
can be potentially quite complex.
</p><p>With this standardized interface, it's not difficult to write
all kinds of Python programs that act as easy-to-use front ends to
a database.</p><p><a href="2605s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
