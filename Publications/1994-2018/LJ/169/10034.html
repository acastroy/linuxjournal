<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #169, May 2008</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Linux 0.01</b></span> is alive and well. <span   class="bold"><b>Abdel Benamrouche</b></span> recently ported the
original Linux code from 1991 to <span   class="bold"><b>GCC version
4</b></span>. This is the sort of
project people do because it's fun and unusual&mdash;not because
they expect there to be any practical application for it at all. Yet,
as often as not, there is. When <span   class="bold"><b>Cong Wang</b></span> heard about Abdel's work,
his first thought was how useful it might be to university Computer
Science departments teaching operating systems. With that thought, he
immediately sent Abdel's work to Cong's own CS department. Where they
go with it is anyone's guess.
</p><p>
The original Linux 0.01 required GCC 1.40 or thereabouts, according to
a linux-kernel post by <span   class="bold"><b>Linus Torvalds</b></span> in
August 2001, when <span   class="bold"><b>Tristan
Sloughter</b></span> tried to get 0.01 running on his 386. A little later, in
September 2001, <span   class="bold"><b>Mikulas Patocka</b></span> actually fixed a bug in the disk
request sorting code of Linux 0.01. At the time, Linus offered
Mikulas maintainership of the 0.01.xx kernel series, but Mikulas
turned it down. Maybe Abdel will decide to take up the banner and
maintain 0.01 himself.
</p><p>
The kernel sources include a variety of shell scripts that each try
to rely only on the default <span   class="bold"><b>/bin/sh UNIX
shell</b></span>. <span   class="bold"><b>Andreas Mohr</b></span> recently
discovered that one of these scripts actually relied on the <span   class="bold"><b>bash
shell</b></span>, though it claimed to work on whatever the user used by
default&mdash;that is, on /bin/sh. He ran into this problem when he tried to use
the script on a system that used the bash shell by default. So, after
doing some cleanup, he submitted a shell to remove all the bashisms
from the script. It was not easy&mdash;there were a number of obscure bash
features represented in the code. But, after some testing, comments
from other kernel folks and revised patches, it did seem as though
he'd managed to eliminate all the bashisms from the script. <span   class="bold"><b>Adrian
Bunk</b></span>'s suggestion that it might be quicker simply to make the script
rely on bash explicitly was ignored in favor of the much more fun
project of delving into shell arcana.
</p><p>
Apparently, too many people have started using the new <span   class="bold"><b>ext4 filesystem</b></span>.
This code is not yet ready for widespread consumption, but it's been
in the main kernel source tree for a while already to encourage
experimentation. And, folks have been experimenting! Unfortunately, not
everyone who's been using it has been aware that it was not fully
ready. Adrian Bunk recently reported seeing users trying it out
without considering the consequences, just because it was there in the
kernel already. To deal with this, he proposed a patch, making ext4
dependent on the BROKEN configuration option. To compile the
filesystem, users would have to edit the config files by hand to
remove that dependency.
</p><p>
There have been various objections to this, including from folks like
<span   class="bold"><b>Alan Cox</b></span>, who accused Adrian of meddling too deeply in kernel
configuration culture. There is a lot of resistance to making ext4
harder to use, precisely because the ext4 developers very strongly
want lots of people to test it. And, as they tend to be kernel
&ldquo;insiders&rdquo; like Alan, they can get an experimental filesystem into the
main kernel tree while other filesystems, who also want lots of
testers, have to wait outside the tree and undergo a lot of additional
scrutiny before being included.
</p><p>
This is not to begrudge ext4 its place of privilege. The ext4
developers are insiders because they've earned it, and they have a deep
understanding of how kernel development should be done. Linus tends to
trust their judgment, not because they are insiders, but because they
have earned that trust. But, the fact remains that ext4 is in the main
kernel tree, and it is not yet ready for regular use. Folks interested in
it certainly should test it out if they want to, but with caution (and
backups).
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Michal Simek</b></span> may become the official
maintainer of the <span   class="bold"><b>Microblaze
kernel port</b></span>, included in the main kernel source along with the other
architectures. He coded up the Microblaze support himself, but he was not
very familiar with what would be involved in being a maintainer and
what sort of support he could expect from the kernel.org people (such
as git repository hosting and so forth). A lot of folks had a lot of advice,
and the whole discussion served to summarize current best practices
regarding patch submissions and review, and the best way to host a
full kernel tree (it turns out that hosting on kernel.org itself has
the advantage of sharing git objects with Linus' tree, and this would
make for a much smaller repository on disk). It seems likely that
Michal will become the official maintainer. There certainly has been
enough enthusiasm for him to do so.
</p><p>
A bunch of people have been translating <span   class="bold"><b>kernel
documentation</b></span> into
<span   class="bold"><b>Chinese</b></span>, under guidance from <span   class="bold"><b>Greg Kroah-Hartman</b></span>, who seems to be
leading the effort. Recently, several translations were integrated
into the kernel, including some by <span   class="bold"><b>Li
Yang</b></span>, <span   class="bold"><b>Zhang Le</b></span> and <span   class="bold"><b>Bryan Wu</b></span>,
among others. This push toward greater accessibility has been ongoing
for years, but it appears to be picking up speed at the moment. These
translations are dramatically increasing the available kernel
developers who can participate in Linux development, and they pave the way
for a deeper integration with the means of development.

<h2 class="title">Apache's Share Goes Back above 50%</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Doc Searls</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #169, May 2008</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
For more than a decade&mdash;from October 1995 to November 2005&mdash;Apache's
growth in Web server market share went mostly up. In November 2005, the free
and open Web server peaked at 70.98% among Top Developers on the
Netcraft.com survey for that month.
</p><p>
Since then, the share mostly has gone down. In October 2007, Apache's share
declined by 2.8% from the previous month, dropping to 47.73%, while 
Microsoft IIS gained 2.08% to hold at 37.13%. That was Apache's lowest share
advantage since IIS appeared in 1996.
</p><p>
But since then, the trend has reversed again. The latest (February 2008) survey
from Netcraft, with January 2008 numbers, had Apache at 50.61% on a 1.04% share
increase.
</p><p>
Apache isn't only competing with IIS, of course. Google appeared on
Netcraft's survey in 2007 and had a 5.33% share in January 2008.
</p><p>
And, the market isn't a pie. Its size overall constantly grows. The total
number of servers, Apaches included, has been sloping upward nearly every
month since 1995. One exception is the current (January 2008) report, where
Netcraft notes &ldquo;much slower growth&rdquo;.
</p><p>
One new open-source server to watch is nginx, or engine x. It's an
open-source server developed in Russia. In the Google Online Security Blog
in
June 2007, nginx had a 4% share (to Apache's 66% and IIS's 23%). The nginx site
currently says about 20% of Russian virtual hosts run on its server. On
Netcraft, it cruised past 0.5% in January 2008.

Instead of the usual They Said It, this month we decided to compile
quotations
from Linus Torvalds alone, because they show a kind of historic turn as we
head into an increasingly mobile Linux-based world.

To the Linux-Kernel Mailing List (LKML), May 25, 2007:

It's Friday evening, and the US is preparing for a long three-day weekend,
often considered the official start of summer here.
</p><p>
So what's a pasty white nerd to do? You can't go out on the beach, because
the good-looking people will laugh at you and kick sand in your face.
</p><p>
I'm not bitter.
</p><p>
But now you <span   class="emphasis"><em>can</em></span> do something: you can download
the latest -rc kernel, and smile smugly to yourself, knowing that you
are running the latest and greatest on your machine. And suddenly it
doesn't even matter that summer is coming, because you can just sit in
the basement, and close the blinds, and bask in the warm light from your
LCD, rather than the harsh glare of the daystar.
</p><p>
The geeks with embedded hardware can consider themselves doubly special
(and not just because your mothers told you you are), because we've got
updates to ARM, SH and Blackfin.
</p><p>
What more could you possibly want?

To various IDG publications in Australia in January 2008:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Technology doesn't worry me. Stupid external issues, especially patents and
stuff like that&mdash;those are the ones that worry technical people. Probably
because they feel they can't (including me) do a lot about them. When you

The embedded people actually solved a lot of the power problems, but they
tended to solve it for their particular platform....You had ten solutions

them for everybody.

I don't even have a mobile phone! I hate phones in general, because I'm the

because they just disturb you, and mobile phones are even worse because you
have them with you all the time, so I don't do mobile phones at all. I have
one of the early Linux mobile phones in my workroom because I got it for

</p><p>
To the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Sydney Morning Herald</em></span> at the same event:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
An OS should never have been something that people (in general) really
care about: it should be completely invisible and nobody should give a
flying f*** about it except the technical people.
</p><p>
It's stupid&mdash;when you make a big deal about something like Vista or
Leopard, a lot of it is about things I don't consider to be the operating
system. It's about the visual shell around it. The fact that Microsoft tied the
two together so much actually caused them problems, not just the legal
problems. If you manage a thousand clients, or a hundred thousand clients,
which is not at all unheard of, you sure as hell don't want to point and
click at them. In many ways, Microsoft has had to fix the design mistakes
they made when they thought the graphical approach should be a very
intimate part of (Windows).
</p><p>
To Microsoft and Apple, the OS is important as a way to control the whole
environment, from a marketing and money-making standpoint, to force people
to upgrade their applications and hardware.
</p><p>
I don't think they're equally flawed. I think Leopard is a much better
system. On the other hand, (I've found) OS X in some ways is actually worse
than Windows to program for. That filesystem is complete and utter crap,
which is scary. I think OS X is nicer than Windows in many ways, but
neither can hold a candle to my own (Linux). It's a race to second place!

<h2 class="title">OpenID's Open-Source SSO Gains Momentum</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Doc Searls</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #169, May 2008</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
The decision by the Identity Gang (now formalized as Identity Commons) to
get behind OpenID was an easy one: it was simple single sign-on, or SSO,
and already in use at LiveJournal, the popular blogging system created by
Brad Fitzpatrick, famous as well for memchached and other fine hacks. Brad
also made OpenID open source, making it easy for developers to work with
and contribute to it.

</p><p>
One remarkable fact about that Gang meeting (the first Internet Identity
Workshop, in 2005) was that leading figures working on other identity
systems&mdash;people from Microsoft, Sxip, Cordance (i-names) and
Higgins&mdash;all jumped in to find ways of working with OpenID.
</p><p>
Since then, there have been many workshops, many meetings, much hacking and
an acceleration of acceptance toward critical mass. You know that's been
achieved when Google, IBM, Microsoft, VeriSign and Yahoo join an
organization's board all at once. That happened for the OpenID Foundation
in February 2008.
</p><p>
When I asked David Recordon, Vice Chair of the foundation board and
OpenID's highest-profile advocate for his take on things, he said, &ldquo;In 2007
OpenID saw incredible momentum as it grew from a grass-roots technology to a
common tool in a developer's arsenal. Already in 2008, it has grown to
include support by Google in Blogger and Yahoo by enabling hundreds of
millions of their accounts as OpenIDs.&rdquo;
</p><p>

issue on page 18.

The XO is a laptop for children. A product of the noncommercial OLPC (One
Laptop Per Child) Project, and run by veterans of MIT's Media Lab, its
brainparent is Nicholas Negroponte, who says, &ldquo;It's an education project,
not a laptop project&rdquo;, and its goal is &ldquo;to provide children around the
world with new opportunities to explore, experiment and express
themselves&rdquo;.

3.5 Geeks per XO Laptop, at the Latest Apachecon
</p></div></div><p>
But, I've yet to see an XO in the hands of a child. Nearly all the OLPCs
I've seen have belonged to geeks, or have been in use by them. As an example of
the latter, see the shot taken at the latest Apachecon.
</p><p>
As it's turning out, XO isn't just a fun toy for geeks and kids, but a
target for development as well&mdash;for example, the Sweet SocialCalc Project.
Writes Dan Brickin:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
I purchased an OLPC XO computer during the Give One Get One campaign,
which arrived around New Year's. I love my XO and see its great potential.
When I tried my new code on it, the code actually ran quite well.
</p><p>
...when we are done I hope we will have native OLPC code driving this
(written in Python), so the JavaScript integrates with the OLPC user
interface environment (which is called Sugar, hence the word sweet)....
</p><p>
Feedback is welcome, as are volunteers to help us make this project a
reality.
</p><p>
In the future, we will also be integrating this code into more
traditional platforms for more traditional wiki-like collaboration. Before
that, though, I need to complete the implementation of these libraries,
adding more commands, functions, etc.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Dan, by the way, is the other half of the pair that created VisiCalc, the
first electronic spreadsheet. The other half was Bob Frankston, subject of
a feature article this month (see page 42).

</p></div></div><p>
It was at a Harvard meeting where I noticed that Michael was using an ASUS Eee
PC, with exceptional ease and enthusiasm. Turns out, it's one he bought from
Amazon. It came new with Knoppix, but then he &ldquo;cracked&rdquo; it to do more than
ASUS expects of ordinary users (for example, expanding windows to a full
screen). I was impressed by how rapidly he typed on the keyboard. Later I
found that he was actually typing in Chinese. I hadn't realized, until he
explained it, that it's actually possible to type Chinese at the speed of
speech on a qwerty keyboard. &ldquo;I type in Chinese about five times faster
than I write&rdquo;, he says. The word Harvard, for example, is four keystrokes rather
than seven. So, if you know Chinese, you can use it as a kind of
shorthand&mdash;impressive. (As you see from the photo, he was using Smart Pinyin.)

In sum, Michael said he has found the Eee PC ideal for three things: 1)
hacking, 2) doing journalistic work and 3) watching TV. (In fact, he
believes it is &ldquo;the future of the TV&rdquo;.)

Ethan Zuckerman, who was at the same meeting, added, &ldquo;I've seen these all
over the place. I ran into (some) Asian businessmen in Amsterdam last week.
And they were all carrying them. It's caught on really, really
fast.&rdquo;
</p><p>
His one caution is adaptation. It took him a week to get used to the
smaller-size keyboard. Plus, he adds, &ldquo;You should have some five minutes to get
used to it&rdquo; when you're coming from a normal-size keyboard. Seems like
time he's willing to invest.
