Turn the Chumby device into a useful kitchen assistant.

I am now the happy owner of one of the coolest gadgets I have ever
experienced, the Chumby. At first glance, this diminutive computer
appears to be nothing more than a Web-connected alarm clock. This,
in and of itself, is a neat idea, and worth the price of admission
for me. However, the Chumby is much more than a simple alarm clock,
Web-connected or not. To that end, I made a conscious decision when the
Chumby was on its way to me from the factory in China 
<span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> to have the
Chumby in the bedroom. Such a useful device should be in a room where
people can take advantage of it while they're awake.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10048f1.large.jpg"><img src="10048f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. What Comes with the Chumby 
</p></div></div><p>
The Chumby, at its heart, is a small embedded computer wrapped in
a soft, squeezable shell made of plastic and leather. If you want to get
technical, the Chumby is powered by a 350MHz ARM processor and contains
64MB of SDRAM and 64MB of NAND Flash ROM. For output, it has a 3.5"
LCD color touchscreen, 2W stereo speakers, two USB 2.0 full-speed ports
and a headphone jack. For input, it has the aforementioned touchscreen,
a squeeze button on the top, and an accelerometer for motion and tilt
sensing. It connects to the Internet via 802.11b/g, which means you
need to have a wireless network of some sort. Power is supplied by an
external AC adapter, and there also is a connector for a nine-volt battery
for emergency power.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10048f2.large.jpg"><img src="10048f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Back of the Chumby 
</p></div></div><p>
The Chumby displays small Flash movie &ldquo;widgets&rdquo;. These Flash movies can do
anything that Flash movies can do within the limits of the Flash-Lite-3
embedded Flash player that the Chumby runs. In practical terms, this
means it can play most Flash movies that run in version 8 or lower of
the Flash browser plugin. Some features were added in version 9 of the
browser plugin that are not supported in Flash-Lite-3.
</p><p>
A lot of thought and care has gone into the design of the Chumby, and
every effort appears to have been made to make the Chumby as easy to
use as possible. Even the packaging contains some nice touches, such as the
linen bags the Chumby arrives in instead of yet another box. The bags are
useful and mean less waste&mdash;always a good thing in my book.
</p><p>
The user interface also is well designed. My very nontechnical wife
was able to find her way around the Chumby easily. There even is a 
nice movie that plays when you turn the Chumby on for the first time
that gives you a quick tour of the interface and main features.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10048f3.large.jpg"><img src="10048f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. The Chumby Guided Tour 
</p></div></div><p>
Once I had the Chumby unpacked and connected to my network (and had given
the little charms that I found in one of the bags to my kids), it was
down to business. My original thoughts on what I wanted to do with the
Chumby were to turn it into a kitchen assistant with a favorite recipes
database that it served up from either a built-in or in-house Web server,
a recipe search widget (to search the recipes in the database, or find new
ones on-line), a music player, a shopping list creator, a meal planner,
a calendar, a photo album, an egg timer, a calculator and a plain-old
alarm clock. Ten things shouldn't be too hard, right? Well, my success
was mixed. Some things worked out great, and others, not so much. I haven't
given up on getting all of the above working eventually, but not all of
them work at this time.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10048f4.large.jpg"><img src="10048f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. The Chumby in the Kitchen 
</p></div></div><p>
My first order of business was to try to create some Flash widgets, and
I quickly found there are some major downsides to having Flash be
the preferred method of application development on the Chumby. The good
part is that the Flash software from Adobe is easy to use and can create
all sorts of things. The bad part is that said software&mdash;apart from
it being proprietary, closed-source and available only for Windows and
Macintosh&mdash;costs twice as much as the Chumby, and there are no
easy-to-use open-source alternatives to the Flash programming environment that
run on Linux.
</p><p>
There has been some progress in this area, mostly along the lines of
simple environments for writing and compiling Adobe's Action Script
language into Flash movies, but the best of these, FlashDevelop, is
Windows-only. I'm also not too keen on learning yet another programming
language. There are some Linux GUI tools that are in the proof-of-concept
stage (meaning they look nice but don't work).
</p><p>
Another option for me would have been to hack the underlying embedded
Linux operating system on the Chumby and add something like embedded GTK
or KDE, but I quickly put that out of my mind, as I don't think I have
the chops to avoid turning the Chumby into a paperweight in the process.
</p><p>
So, I went with what I had, and what I could find. The upside to this
approach is that new widgets are being released all the time&mdash;more
than
a dozen in the few weeks that I've had the Chumby&mdash;and people
are constantly thinking up new things for their Chumbys to do.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xffd580.0x10f5eb0"></a>
The Chumby as an Alarm Clock</h2></div></div><p>
There is an alarm clock built in to the Chumby, so this one was checked off
of my list before the Chumby arrived. The Chumby can have multiple alarms,
and the alarms can trigger different sounds and activate different sets
of widgets. For example, in the morning I have an alarm that does not make
a sound (the Chumby is not in my bedroom, so any alarm sound would not be
heard), but what it does do is switch the active set of widgets over to my
&ldquo;morning&rdquo; set, which contains a mixture of news and weather widgets that
I like to look at while I'm getting breakfast ready. When the time comes
to take the kids to school, there's another alarm, and this one does make
a sound. I also have other morning, afternoon and evening alarms
that&mdash;although they don't make any noise&mdash;switch the active widget set to
the sorts of things I am generally interested in at those times.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xffd580.0x10f6010"></a>
The Chumby as a Digital Photo Frame</h2></div></div><p>
The photo album also was checked off before the Chumby arrived. There
are many options for displaying photos through your Chumby. The easiest
are the series of official photo widgets that can pull photos from your
Flickr, Picasa, Photobucket or MySpace accounts. You just enter your
login details and the album you want, and away you go.
</p><p>
There is also a neat service called Dailio where you can send photos
to a special e-mail address, and they will show up on your Chumby without
any further effort.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xffd580.0x10f61c8"></a>
The Chumby as a Kitchen Timer</h2></div></div><p>
The egg timer was another easy item to cross off my list, as an
enterprising member of the Chumby community (the same one who created
the Dailio widget) already created one that works very well.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10048f5.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. Toasty, the Chumby Kitchen Timer
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xffd580.0x10f6488"></a>
The Chumby as a Calculator</h2></div></div><p>
There is a also a calculator widget that a different member of the Chumby
community created. It works well, and that's about all I have to say on
the subject, apart from that I wish the buttons were bigger.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xffd580.0x10f6590"></a>
The Chumby as a Calendar</h2></div></div><p>
The calendar widget I'm using is one that displays my Google Calendar. It
is limited to an agenda view that lists each scheduled item in order. It
would have been nice to have daily, week or month views, but it is
certainly usable if not quite what I was looking for.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xffd580.0x10f6698"></a>
The Chumby as a Music Player</h2></div></div><p>
I was very pleased with the Chumby's support for listening to music. The
music section of the Chumby control panel has several options that let
you listen to music from a variety of locations. These include an iPod,
SHOUTcast streams, Mediafly podcasts, any radio streams in MP3 or Ogg
format from radio stations or your own local SlimServer, or music
files (in Ogg, MP3 or FLAC format) from a USB thumbdrive plugged
in to one of the available USB ports.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10048f6.large.jpg"><img src="10048f6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. Music on the Chumby
</p></div></div><p>
Incidentally, the speakers on the Chumby sound quite nice, especially
considering their size. There is, of course, the option to plug in a set
of external speakers or a pair of headphones to the headphone jack if
you want better sound.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xffd580.0x10f69b0"></a>
The Chumby as a Recipe Book</h2></div></div><p>
The first idea I had for my kitchen-assistant Chumby was to make it into a
recipe book, so I focused a lot of my efforts here. The recipe book idea
is also, coincidentally, my wife's favorite use for the Chumby. She's
been storing her favorite recipes for years now on her computer in .odt
format, and whenever she cooks something she needs a recipe for,
she either makes a lot of trips back and forth to her computer, or she
prints the recipe out. Neither of those options are ideal.
</p><p>
As with the other tasks I had outlined for the Chumby&mdash;I named him
George, by the way&mdash;I first went looking to see if someone had a recipe
widget already created. I could not find any, so I then decided to look
to see whether there were any widgets I could easily adapt into becoming a
recipe widget.
</p><p>
There are several photo-viewing widgets, so my first inclination was
simply to create 320x240 pixel images of my recipes, upload them to my
Flickr or Picasa accounts, and then view them on the Chumby. This
worked&mdash;a PNG image is a PNG image after all&mdash;but it didn't work
very well,
because practically all of the photo widgets are for showing slideshows,
with the photos switching every few seconds. This is fine if you are
displaying photos&mdash;I use the Flickr one for pictures of my kids and
love it&mdash;but recipes need to stay on the screen for several minutes
(or longer, depending on preparation time).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10048f7.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 7. My Early Attempt at a Recipe Book&mdash;Individual
&ldquo;Card&rdquo;
Images
</p></div></div><p>
The photo widget that worked the best was the Dailio widget. Unlike
other photo widgets, this one lets you set how long
a photo stays displayed (from five seconds to five minutes). There 
also is a forever option, which I assume means that the photo stays
displayed until you change it manually, but that option did not work
for me. Instead, it caused the recipes to blink and stutter. So I was
stuck with five minutes, which is okay, but not perfect.
</p><p>
I finally found the perfect recipe option sitting right under my nose:
Impress, the OpenOffice.org presentation application. It has an option to
export any slideshow as a Flash (.swf) file. It also turns out that these
files play perfectly on the Chumby, even though they are not technically
the correct size. So I chose one of the basic templates, and then,
using each slide as a &ldquo;recipe card&rdquo;, created a recipe book.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10048f8.large.jpg"><img src="10048f8.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 8. Creating a Recipe Book 
</p></div></div><p>
For simplicity and ease of use, I did not put in any transitions or text
animations. I also tried to keep the fonts as large as possible while
still fitting an entire recipe on a single slide. The side effect of
not putting any auto-advancing slides into my presentation is that each
slide stays put until I'm done with it, which is perfect behavior.
</p><p>
Each presentation always starts at the first slide, and you have to tap
through each preceding recipe to get to the one you want. So I created
several presentations with general themes, like desserts, main dishes
and so on, to keep the number of recipes per widget manageable.
</p><p>
Currently, the recipe books are pretty plain. Over
the next few weeks, I plan to add photos to the recipes and make other
general improvements, but as they stand now, they already have been put
to good use.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10048f9.large.jpg"><img src="10048f9.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 9. A Recipe on the Chumby 
</p></div></div><p>
The process of getting a custom widget, like my recipe books, onto the
Chumby is simple. There actually are a couple ways to do this, but
the most straightforward option is to upload it to Chumby.com and add
it to one of your channels there. All you need is your .swf file and an
icon. The icon is a simple 80x60 pixel .jpg image. I kept mine simple by
putting black text on a white background using The GIMP.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10048f10.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 10. Creating an Icon in The GIMP
</p></div></div><p>
Go to <a href="http://www.chumby.com/widgets/upload" target="_self">www.chumby.com/widgets/upload</a> to upload your widget. The
form is self-explanatory. Once uploaded, your widget will be available
in the category you chose, and if you marked it as public, it will be
viewable by all Chumby users (once the Chumby folks have determined that
it isn't a malicious widget).
</p><p>
The only real downside to the browser method is that Chumby.com will
let you upload only widgets that are less than 100K in size. If you
create a widget larger than that&mdash;and I expect that once I've
added all my recipes and photos, each recipe book has
the possibility to be larger than that&mdash;the other way to get a widget
onto your Chumby is with a USB thumbdrive.
</p><p>
For the thumbdrive method, apart from the icon and Flash files, you
need a text file named profile.xml. The Chumby looks for this file
when it boots and will add any widgets described in it to all of your
widget channels. This file is self-explanatory, and the Chumby Wiki
provides
full instructions.

The Chumby as a Recipe Search Engine, Shopping List Creator
and Meal Planner</h2></div></div><p>
I haven't been able to get all the things I wanted to get onto the
Chumby onto it. However, after actually using the Chumby for a couple
weeks, I'm not so sure they were good ideas to begin with.
</p><p>
The main reason for this is that my intended recipe search,
shopping list creator and meal planning widgets all would require
extensive text input, and that is where the Chumby is not ideal. The
Chumby is mainly an output device, suited to displaying various
bits of information. Input is best limited to simple interactions, such
as tapping on buttons and sliding your finger around the screen.
</p><p>
The Chumby can handle text input, and some widgets require it. The control
panel, for example, has a simple on-screen keyboard where you enter in
your wireless settings during the Chumby's initial setup. Also,
in the music interface, there is another on-screen keyboard where you
enter in the location of the music stream to which you want to connect.
But, supporting text input where required and doing a lot of text
input are two very different things.
</p><p>
After entering text in just those two above-mentioned places, I could see
it was not something I would want to do on a regular basis with
the Chumby, because although it works, it's slow. The problem is that when
using the Chumby, the natural thing to do is to use your fingers, and most
widgets&mdash;if they have buttons at all&mdash;keep them large and few in
number. For effective text input, you need a lot of small buttons, and
on the Chumby's screen, lots of small buttons practically requires you
to use a stylus&mdash;not something I want to have to use with the Chumby.
</p><p>
I toyed around with using an RSS widget to display recipe data from
sites that offer it, such as Taste-of-Home's Recipe of the Day, but as
you can see from the screenshot, my testing did not go so well.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10048f11.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xffd580.0x10ee5d8"></a>
Final Thoughts</h2></div></div><p>
The Chumby is an amazing device. It can be adapted to fit in with
almost any room in the house and can display any sort of data that can
be displayed within the confines of the Flash file format.
</p><p>
New widgets come out all the time, and the basic software is under
constant improvement. Check out <a href="http://chumby.com" target="_self">chumby.com</a> and browse the available
widgets; there's something for everyone.
</p><p>
The Chumby is also very hackable. The underlying operating system is
embedded Linux, and all the source code (apart from a few licensed bits
that they aren't allowed to disclose) and complete hardware schematics
are available on the Chumby Web site. The developers really seem to get
the idea of making a device hackable, with their only warning being
a gentle reminder that if you take your Chumby apart, it will void the
warranty. Beyond that, they actively encourage you to turn the Chumby
into anything you please and are eager to help you in any way they can
through their Web site, forums and wiki.
</p><p>
In these days of locked-down,
don't-you-dare-look-behind-the-curtain-or-we'll-sue gadgets, having
one that you can mod to your heart's content, with full schematics
and source code&mdash;and the original developers&mdash;to guide you, is a
nice feeling.

The Secret Chumby Menu&mdash;It's as Easy as Pi</b></p><p>
There's a secret menu on the Chumby, and it is fairly easy to reach. Here's
what you need to do:

Bring up the control panel.
</p></li><li><p>
Tap on Settings.

</p><p>
The Web server, by default, has only a link to some statistics on how good
the wireless connection is, but it can be extended easily.
