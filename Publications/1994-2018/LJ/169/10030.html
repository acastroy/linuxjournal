It's easy to build redundant systems when time and money are limitless.
When you have neither, or you are designing a personal system, often
backups and redundancy are parts of the project you plan to get to on a
rainy day. Of course inevitably, you put those tasks off until the main
system fails,
and then you scramble to pick up the pieces.
Setting up RAID and doing backups, in fact, are probably the most common examples of these
do-it-on-a-rainy-day tasks (and if you haven't heard yet, they are not
the same thing). We all know we <span   class="emphasis"><em>should</em></span> back up
important data, and
we <span   class="emphasis"><em>should</em></span> set up a RAID on that important file server,
and by now,
enough of us have been bitten by that mistake that I'm not going to talk
about either today. Instead, I'm going to talk about one of those services
that gets less attention: your mail server.
</p><p>
It is important to have a backup mail server, but whether you work for a
small company, or you administer your own personal mail server, you might
not have gotten around to a secondary mail relay. Then, disaster strikes.
It could be that the primary mail server's hardware failed, or maybe it was
hacked and, in either case, it is going to be down for a few days. In the
meantime, you still would like to be able to send and receive e-mail. In
this column,
I cover a few easy, and more important, quick steps to create a
secondary mail relay to tide you over until the primary can come back
on-line.
</p><p>
Now, my preferred method for an emergency mail server uses a Knoppix disc. I
always have one around somewhere, and because I can install just about any
software I need on the live CD, it is ideal when I need a basic Linux
system fast. I can just locate a spare machine, boot Knoppix on it, and set
up my server. When the emergency is over, I can shut it off with no
commitment. 
</p><p>
Then again, you might want to make this secondary mail server a
bit more permanent. These same steps will work just fine on any ordinary
Linux system that has postfix available.
</p><p>
Before you perform any steps, be sure to choose a server that has enough
storage to store your mail. This number varies based on your e-mail traffic
and the number of clients on the server, but the machine will need to store
all incoming mail locally until the primary server comes back up. So, if you
get 50MB of mail each day and plan for the primary to be down for three days,
you should have at least 150MB of spare storage for the mail spool in
/var/spool/postfix plus extra, just in case. If you don't have enough spare
storage or you use Knoppix for this, mount an extra partition, create a
postfix directory on it and symlink /var/spool/postfix to it.
</p><p>
Now that you have chosen a server, the first step is to install postfix.
Postfix is a common package and should be available for any major Linux
distribution you use. On Debian-based systems, the installation process
automatically runs a configuration script to set up a reasonable default
config. If you do run into this script, choose the &ldquo;Internet
Site&rdquo;
configuration type and accept the rest of the defaults in the script.
Alternatively, you can copy a default configuration that ships with your
postfix package or run it through a configuration script your distribution
includes.
</p><p>
Once postfix is installed, you need to tweak the default configuration so
that it can act as your mail relay. Postfix makes this pretty simple, and
you need to worry about only a few configuration options. Edit the
/etc/postfix/main.cf file, and locate a line called mynetworks. This option tells
postfix for which networks to relay mail. Ideally, you should set this only
for internal networks or specific external hosts you trust will not relay
spam through your system. If you allow all networks, you have just turned
your system into an open relay and will likely find yourself on a spam
black-hole list in no time. If your local network is 192.168.1.x, for
instance, you would add an entry for that and for localhost:

<pre     class="programlisting">
mynetworks = 127.0.0.0/8, 192.168.1.0/24
</pre>
</p><p>
Next, you need to tell postfix for which incoming domains it will accept mail
for relay. This variable will be set to any domains for which you accept incoming
mail. So, if you own example.com and example.org, for instance, you
would add:

<pre     class="programlisting">
relay_domains = example.com, example.org
</pre>
</p><p>
You even can act as a secondary mail server for friends. Simply add their
domains here as well, and your mail server will accept incoming mail to
those domains and then forward it to the appropriate primary mail server.
How does it know which server to use? It relies on DNS, which I 
discuss shortly.
</p><p>
The final postfix options to change tell postfix how long to spool and
attempt to deliver mail before it bounces it. By default, postfix queues
mail for three days, and during that time, it continuously attempts
delivery. After three days, postfix bounces the mail and sends an e-mail
notification to the sender that the e-mail could not be delivered. If
your primary server is going to be down for a few days, you probably
will want to extend this default. Locate the following values (or add them if
they aren't defined) in /etc/postfix/main.cf, and edit them so they look like the
following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
bounce_queue_lifetime = 14d
maximal_queue_lifetime = 14d
</pre>
</p><p>
Here I increased the maximum time to 14 days, but you can change it
to a value that makes sense for you. Generally, you don't want to hold on to
e-mail for too long, as senders likely will want to know eventually if
their e-mail could not be delivered. Once these options are changed, type
<tt  >/etc/init.d/postfix start</tt> to start the service, or
type <tt  >/etc/init.d/postfix
reload</tt>, if postfix already is running. 
</p><p>
Next, test the server. Either configure
your mail client to use this server as its SMTP gateway and then send an
e-mail to your domain, or if you feel fancy, connect to port 25 on the
server using Telnet, and type the raw SMTP commands. Check /var/log/mail.log
or /var/log/maillog to confirm that postfix accepted and spooled your mail.
</p><p>
The last step is to configure your DNS server so that it lists your new
machine as a secondary mail server for your domain. Your DNS server should
have at least one MX record defined that looks something like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
example.com.    IN MX    100    mail1.example.com.
</pre>
</p><p>
If I created a new mail server and added its IP to DNS so that
mail2.example.com pointed to it, I then would add the following line to my
DNS zone:

<pre     class="programlisting">
example.com.    IN MX    200    mail2.example.com.
</pre>
</p><p>
Because I assigned mail2 a higher value (200) than mail1 (100), other mail
servers know that mail1 is my primary and that mail ultimately will land
there. However, if mail1 is unavailable, they know that they can attempt
delivery on mail2 (and some mail servers attempt mail delivery on secondary
servers first anyway). Once my DNS zone is reloaded, mail that has been
queued up on remote servers ever since mail1 went down should start being
delivered to mail2. Be sure to add this DNS entry for any domains you added
in the relay_domains option. It also may go without saying, but be sure
that mail2.example.com points to an external IP address that lands on your
mail server.
</p><p>
As this server runs, monitor its storage to make sure you have plenty for
new incoming mail. You also can run the mailq command to see all the
queued messages. Once your primary server comes back up, postfix will
start delivering its queued messages automatically (it actually will have
been attempting it the entire time). By default, postfix will throttle this
delivery so it doesn't flood the primary mail server, but if you want all of
the queued e-mail delivered immediately, type <tt  >postqueue
-f</tt>.
</p><p>
With the primary machine back up, you might want to take down this
temporary machine or at least work on a more permanent solution. If you do
take it down, be sure to remove its MX record from all your DNS
servers. You <span   class="emphasis"><em>do</em></span> have redundant DNS servers, right?
