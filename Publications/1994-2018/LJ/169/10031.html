Zero Install System (<a href="http://0install.net" target="_self">0install.net</a>)</h2></div></div><p>
You may have heard of this project before&mdash;another attempted solution to
a software installation problem with Linux. What is the problem, you ask?
</p><p>
How do you install new software on Linux easily, in a uniform manner that
won't scare off a shy Windows user? This area often needs attention, and
we turn a blind eye because we're used to using apt or something similar. Are systems like
apt really sufficient though? What if the program I want to install isn't
within a distributions's archive? What if it's too old? What if I want a newer
version than my distribution's archive provides, without upgrading a gig's worth
of my whole system to satisfy all the other niggling dependencies? What
if my distro dies off and its archives disappear? What if I
simply want to do <span   class="emphasis"><em>the same thing</em></span> on each system?
</p><p>
Zero Install is the next in line for tackling this issue
where projects like Autopackage failed, but will it tickle the fancy of
the larger Linux audience?
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Installation</b></span>
</p><p>
Thankfully, a large number of binaries are available, and they will
probably cover your system's needs. I grabbed the Etch .deb, and it worked
without any hassles. If your system isn't covered though, the
site includes a source tarball that contains a Python script, plus instructions
on how to use it. There aren't any real obscure dependencies, so chances
are the base package will install without any issues.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Usage</b></span>
</p><p>
Initial usage is more of a command-line affair, which puts the Zero
Install System in a different league from Autopackage immediately. Once
the Zero Install Injector has been installed, you can install packages
simply by typing <tt  >0launch</tt> and pasting the URL of the package into
the shell after it. However, finding the page of available packages
took me a minute&mdash;it's available at <a href="http://0install.net/injector-feeds.html" target="_self">0install.net/injector-feeds.html</a>. Once you've found a package that interests you, copy the URL
of the package and do as follows:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ 0launch http://insertyourURLhere
</pre>
</p><p>
An installer window will pop up, displaying the package name and
any dependencies you may require. In a few seconds, a window may appear,
presenting you with a trust key (a GPG signed key), asking you whether 
to allow this key to run, which is similar to when your browser asks whether
to accept a site's Authentication Certificate. As there aren't a
great deal of packages available yet, trusting these keys is fine for
now, but should they become popular, you will want to examine closely
the key presented. Once the key business is out of the way, press
Run,
and the download of the new package will start along with any other
dependencies. Once the download has finished, the new program should
launch right away. If not, any error messages will appear in the shell.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10031f1.large.jpg"><img src="10031f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Zero Install chases down dependencies along with the new
program.
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10031f2.large.jpg"><img src="10031f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Zero Install presents an interesting trust key.
</p></div></div><p>
This is all okay for the first time, but any other attempts to run the
new program will require the same arduous steps each time. Thankfully,
with some clever scripting, a local link is made that puts a filename
into your path without the need for root privileges. It will require
you to enter the URL once more though, coupled with the command
<tt  >0alias</tt>
and your chosen alias name, as follows:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ 0alias alias http://insertyourURLhereagain
</pre>
</p><p>
As a real-world example, I had success with a game called
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Barrage</em></span>,
and the shell input looked like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ 0alias barrage http://people.freenet.de/LinuxCNC/0install/barrage
</pre>
</p><p>
Now I can run the program in the future simply by entering
<tt  >barrage</tt> at the command line. Included on the package page is a selection
of tools for simplifying some of these tasks, but the above steps are still
required for installing them.
</p><p>
Zero Install definitely has an interesting interface
with its own unique take on distro-independent packaging. I'm guessing
many people will be turned off by the command-line nature of this beast,
especially with the copying and pasting from a Web browser (command lines
and GUIs have never made the best of comrades). Also, many of the tools
seem to be based on the Rox file manager&mdash;a great lightweight system
but still relatively obscure to the larger Linux audience.
</p><p>
Personally, I mourn the demise of Autopackage, an outspoken project that
received a great deal of hostility from the traditional distro packagers,
such as Debian, that ultimately sparked its demise. Other similar projects
take a more pragmatic approach&mdash;some with a more &ldquo;Windowsy&rdquo; installer
(not necessarily a bad thing), others as unique as this one. Zero Installer
may gain popularity simply by not being Autopackage and subsequently
not angering the apt-get overlords. However you see it, I hope all
these distro-independent packaging projects are sending a message to
the developer community that not everyone is happy with the idea of being
reliant on repositories, and a major change is required soon in software
installation methods. This issue won't go away.

deco&mdash;Archive File Extractor (<a href="http://hartlich.com/deco" target="_self">hartlich.com/deco</a>)</h2></div></div><p>
deco is great for people sick of typing <tt  >tar -zxvf</tt>,
<tt  >-jxvf</tt> and so
on. According to the project's Web site, &ldquo;deco is a generic archive file
extractor that has a consistent command-line interface (<tt  >deco 1.tar.bz2
2.zip 3.flac 4.rar 5.deb</tt> will just work) and consistent behavior
(it never deletes archives after extraction, it extracts relative to the
current working directory, and it extracts just verbosely enough, all
unless explicitly requested otherwise). It provides automatic handling
of extractor gotchas by creating an extraction directory if there is more
than one file or directory at the archive top level and by being able to
fix strange permissions. Dozens of archive file extensions are supported
out of the box, and adding support for others requires very little
work.&rdquo;
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10031f3.large.jpg"><img src="10031f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. deco is probably the easiest archive extractor I've used.
</p></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Installation</b></span>
</p><p>
At the time of this writing, deco is available only as a source tarball;
however,
installation is easy and unlikely to cause any hassles. After
extracting the archive and entering the new directory, doing a standard:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ./configure 
$ make
(if not root) $ su 
# make install 
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17a6580.0x189f640"></a></h2></div></div><p>
worked with no issues, and probably will do the same for you, as it
doesn't have a large amount of dependencies.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Usage</b></span>
</p><p>
The general usage is simply: 

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ deco filename.tar.gz
</pre>
</p><p>
That's about all there is for most people&mdash;short and sweet. But, what
tricks lie under the hood? There are all sorts of neat optimizations.
</p><p>
For instance, usually Linux projects are placed in a directory within an
archive to keep source directories from becoming cluttered. Unfortunately,
archives sometimes have files placed straight in them, without being
placed in a directory. This fills up your source directory with all sorts
of unwanted files that also may be overwritten. deco places an archive's
extracted contents within a directory to keep things clean. Cleverly,
if an archive already has its contents contained within a directory,
deco extracts the archive as is. If not, deco places them
within a directory named after the filename, minus its extension.
</p><p>
For example, if I had a file called tuesday-jam-session.tar.gz, 
deco would place the contents under the directory tuesday-jam-session.
</p><p>
If you want further control, such as deleting the archive after extraction
and so on, this also is possible with a series of command-line switches,
available on the project's Web site. Even if you're happy with the way
it works already, it's worth reading the site to see some of
the other options available, and also what neat tricks and shortcuts
lie under the hood.
</p><p>
Something to keep in mind is that the deco project doesn't try to re-invent
the wheel&mdash;it isn't monolithic. It's reliant on having the necessary
external extraction tools available, such as unrar for .rar files
and so on. However, this is the approach taken by most archive tools,
so most people expect that anyway. Nevertheless, it wouldn't
take a great deal of work to include all these external programs in
one big package, so any enthusiasts of the project may want to do just
that. Although it's currently available only via source, hopefully it
will make it into most distro archives soon.
</p><p>
Overall, deco is a lovely little program that is likely to save many
a tired, caffeine-fueled coder some midnight grief and make computing
just that little bit nicer.

orDrumbox (<a href="http://www.ordrumbox.com" target="_self">www.ordrumbox.com</a>)</h2></div></div><p>
orDrumbox is a small, Java-based drum-machine applet that runs on Linux,
Windows and Mac OS X. Designed less for the drummer and more for the
desktop DJ, orDrumbox quickly makes funky mid-tempo
electronic tunes with beats and inserted samples. Developed using Java,
this drum machine is highly portable and lightweight, which is ideal
for DJ enthusiasts jumping between machines and showing their friends.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10031f4.large.jpg"><img src="10031f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Surprisingly, just clicking randomly probably will make a
halfway decent beat.
</p></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Installation</b></span>
</p><p>
As far as packages go, the only Linux binary available is an .rpm
(not handy as I have a Debian-based system). Source code is available,
but it is zipped and for Java, and not everyone will have a compatible
compiler. I downloaded the .rpm and converted it to a .deb using alien,
which is not difficult; check the alien man page for more info. Thankfully,
it converted and installed with no major issues. When I started the
program though, it required a particular version of Java, jpackage-utils
(see <a href="http://www.jpackage.org" target="_self">www.jpackage.org</a>, also available on <a href="http://rpmfind.net" target="_self">rpmfind.net</a>). This had no Debian file either, so I had
to use alien on this package too. Luckily, there were no complaints here
either,
and after these two steps, the program simply worked.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>
Usage</b></span>
</p><p>
To start the program, enter <tt  >orDrumbox.sh</tt> into your
shell. If all goes
well, the program now should be working. If you look in the top half
of the orDrumbox screen, there should be a window called Pattern 0
(Edit)&mdash;this is where most of your work will happen. If you look to
the right of the box containing a 4 at the top of the window, you'll
see a gray and yellow box. Hover your mouse over it, and it will say,
&ldquo;create new track&rdquo;. Press this a large number of times (14 and up
for the default drum kit), as each line creates a new instrument with which to
play. On the left of each line are the controls for each instrument,
including volume and so forth. On the right is the Note Editor area.
</p><p>
With the Note Editor, double-click any of the boxes, and they will change
from white or gray to green and red. The green tells you what note
will be played, and you'll see there are two red sliding bars: one going
from bottom to top, the other from left to right. The bottom-to-top slider controls
the note velocity, and the left-to-right slider determines the note and octave
played (or the pitch). It defaults to C2, but it can be tuned up or down
accordingly. Click randomly in any of the boxes, then click the large
play icon in the bottom center of the screen. A beat will start
playing&mdash;probably a strange one. Try changing the pitch and velocity randomly,
as well as adding new notes and removing old ones to see how it affects
the beat. To remove any notes, simply right-click in the note's box and
choose delete note.
</p><p>
This should be enough to get you started on beats, but you'll need
the user manual to get more involved and create whole songs. Check the
manual available on the Web site, and try out some of the custom drum kits
available too. There are some limitations with the scalability of the
program, and the biggest limitation is that it's limited to 120BPM. This
is enough for most electronic and dance music, but it's unsuitable for
genres like punk, speed metal and so on. The sounds that are provided
with these kits really are geared for more electronic genres anyway
and will sound strange with anything rock-based, so those into fast
rock genres will want to stick with something like Hydrogen. Overall,
this is a fun little utility that will find its way into the hearts of
many a home DJ.
