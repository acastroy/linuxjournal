Getting started with Skype.

Want to use your computer as a full-fledged telephone, and be able to
make free phone calls over the Internet or paid calls to any normal
number? How about adding more features, such as instant
messaging, file transfers and video conferences? How about being able to use
it on Linux, Windows or Mac OS X? If these things interest you, you should install
Skype.
</p><p>
Skype is a free, VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) program,
created in 2003 by Niklas
Zennstrom and Janus Friis. Two years later, eBay acquired it
for more than 2.5 billion dollars (plus an
unspecified extra amount depending on performance).
</p><p>
As of the beginning of 2008, it has more than 250 million users, both for
its
free and paid services, in practically every country on earth. When
you connect to Skype, in the bottom-right corner, you will see how many
other users are on-line at the same time. In my experience, it's usually
around ten million, which is a hefty number indeed. Skype derives its
income from paid services (including calling or receiving calls from
landline or mobile phones, voice mail, call forwarding and so on),
but you can use it without paying a cent if you
call only other on-line users over the Web.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe83580.0xf7b4b8"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
From Music to TV</b></p><p>
Skype wasn't the first collaboration by Zennstrom and Friis, and it isn't
their last. In 2000, they created Kazaa, a well-known peer-to-peer
file-sharing program. Obviously, they
were able to apply the P2P expertise gained there to Skype's own
development. Kazaa had plenty of legal problems (similar to those of
Napster) because of sharing copyrighted
material, mainly music. In 2001, Kazaa was sold to Sharman Networks,
which had to face several copyright-related suits. In July 2006, there
was an out-of-court settlement, when its Web site seemingly was updated
for the last time.
</p><p>
After selling Skype to eBay, Zennstrom and Friis turned to TV and created
Joost: a system for distributing video (mainly TV shows) over the Web,
once again using the same peer-to-peer technology used on Skype. Joost's
development started in 2006, and currently (February 2008),
it's at beta. If you want to test-drive this software, however, you
are out of luck. For the time being, there are only
Windows and OS X versions available. According to some reports, Wine
isn't a solution either, though that might change.
</p><p>
Joost will be a free system, supported by advertising, just like
traditional TV, aiming for full-screen, high-quality viewing. Though
its technology isn't yet mature or fully reliable, it's an
interesting concept and free of the legal problems that troubled the
original Kazaa. There are some licensing aspects that still need work
(most of the available content can be seen only in the US right now),
but there's much promise ahead.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe83580.0xf7b778"></a>
Getting Skype</h2></div></div><p>
The program itself is free, but it's not open source. And, if you like running
the best and latest versions of programs, prepare yourself for a
disappointment. 
The current Windows version is 3.6, the current OS X version is 2.6, but Linux
is trailing far behind with only a beta, called 2.0. Thus, 
plenty of features are missing from the Linux version (see the What's
Missing in the Linux Version of Skype? sidebar),
but Skype still is quite usable as is.
</p><p>
Skype's hardware requirements are pretty modest.
You need a 400MHz processor or faster, 256MB of RAM and about 20MB
of free disk space. If you want to talk (don't sneer; you can use Skype
just for instant messaging), you need a microphone and either
earphones or speakers. And, if you want to make video
calls, you need a Webcam. Finally, you 
need to open an account, but you have to install the program first.
</p><p>
Installation should be quite easy. As far as I've seen, it's
available for pretty much all distributions, so you should have no problem
finding it in your repositories. Because I use Smart, getting
Skype simply meant typing <tt  >smart install skype</tt>. In
any case, you should check that the version you
get is not earlier than 2.0. (To do so, start Skype, click the
S on the lower left, select About, and you'll see a window with
the version information.) Because Linux lags behind Windows as far as versions,
you just might have version 1.4, which would require an upgrade.
</p><p>
If your version is an older one (or if you just want to make sure
to have the latest one), visit Skype's download site, and get whatever is
correct for your machine. There are distribution-specific versions for
Debian, Fedora, Mandriva, MEPIS, OpenSUSE, Ubuntu and Xandros. There
also are some generic versions&mdash;the &ldquo;static&rdquo; one might be
best for you.
</p><p>
After the download is ready, open a console, <tt  >cd</tt> to the
directory where you downloaded the software, and do <tt  >sudo rpm -Uvh
skype-2-<i>XXX</i>.rpm</tt>, and you should be ready. 
</p><p>
When you open Skype, if you already have an account and a password,
simply enter them to connect (Figure 1). However, if
this is your first time ever, or if you just want to create a second or
different account, click Don't have a Skype name yet?, and a window
will open where you can create an account. Follow the instructions on the
screen, and you'll be set (Figure 2). Skype won't allow passwords that are too short, but play it safe, and use a long one, preferably with
numbers and special characters.

What's Missing in the Linux Version of Skype?</b></p><p>
Skype for Linux is several versions behind the current Windows program 
and is still in beta. In later versions (keep your fingers crossed,
but be prepared for a long wait), it could add:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Enhanced file transfer speed.
</p></li><li><p>
More stable video calls among users with Internet connections of different
speeds.
</p></li><li><p>
Improved video and audio quality on low-speed Internet connections.
</p></li><li><p>
Call quality feedback and bandwidth indicators.
</p></li><li><p>
Safety and privacy improvements.
</p></li><li><p>
Support for MySpace.
</p></li><li><p>
High-quality video calls.
</p></li><li><p>
Video snapshots.
</p></li><li><p>
Auto redial.
</p></li><li><p>
Call transfer.
</p></li><li><p>
Private telephone numbers.
</p></li><li><p>
Import contacts from MSN, Yahoo and Gmail.
</p></li><li><p>
Skype Prime (calling lines that charge per minute).
</p></li><li><p>
Skype Find (a community-generated directory).
</p></li><li><p>
Sending SMS.
</p></li><li><p>
Ten-way conference calls.
</p></li><li><p>
Public chat rooms.
</p></li><li><p>
Predictive dialer.
</p></li><li><p>
Contact grouping.
</p></li><li><p>
Shared groups.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
This is a (shortened) version of all new features in the
release notes since January 2006, when version 2.0 for Windows
came out, so there should be plenty forthcoming for Linux users.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe83580.0x1375288"></a>
Configuring Skype</h2></div></div><p>
The first time you run Skype, check its configuration. Click
the S on the bottom left, and you'll see the Options
window. Here are some of the
possibilities:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
General allows you to specify what happens when you double-click
on a contact (either start a call or a chat), the timeouts (after how much
time you will be shown as Away or Not Available) and the program
language. Although Skype's Web site advertises almost 30 languages, it came
with only 13. Spanish was noticeably missing.
</p></li><li><p>
Privacy lets you decide whether you will accept calls or chat invitations
from anybody or only from people you specifically allow, whether you will
answer incoming calls automatically (I wouldn't check that), and how
long you want to keep the chat history.
</p></li><li><p>
Notifications allows you to assign sound bits to different events,
such as an incoming call or an answered call, and whether you will be shown
a pop-up notification. If you click Advanced View, you can specify
scripts that should be executed on specific events, or a message that
should be sent to the other party.
</p></li><li><p>
Chat permits you to define what will happen if somebody starts a chat
with you, such as whether to use emoticons and whether other parties should be
informed when you are typing. 
</p></li><li><p>
Call Forwarding is a paid feature. When someone calls you, and you
are not at your computer, you can have Skype call your mobile or
landline phone, paying per minute at the regular call rates. (If you call
people who forward their calls, you pay nothing.) You even can forward
calls to more than one phone, answer whichever you want, and you
will be billed accordingly.
</p></li><li><p>
Voice mail is another paid feature, available only with a Skype Pro
subscription. Basically, it works as an answering machine, and you can
listen to the calls you received whenever you are signed in.
</p></li><li><p>
Sound Devices lets you choose which devices should be used for
sound. I'd suggest keeping the default devices, unless you know
what you're doing. Click on Make a test sound to verify whether
Skype can produce sound, and then click Make a test call to check whether
your microphone is working. Then, follow the spoken instructions to see if
everything's working.
</p></li><li><p>
Web Devices can be used to specify whether Skype Video will be used,
whether video should start automatically, and whether you want to receive other
people's video and let them know you have video capabilities. After
you have set up your Webcam, use the Test button to verify that you can
see yourself.
</p></li><li><p>
Advanced lets you select whether you want to check for updates when
starting Skype (I'd suggest doing so), which port to use (leave it
as suggested), and if you are using a proxy, its details.
</p></li><li><p>
Blocked People lets you manage your blacklist. If you don't want
to receive calls from particular users, you can block them from Skype's
main window. Right-click on users' names, and you will have the option
to block them. If you want to restore (unblock) someone, you can do so here.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Play around with all options, but be sure to check, at the very least,
the Sound Devices screen and do a test call. Otherwise, you might
find that people call you, but you can't hear them, or that you speak,
but nobody hears you. 
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe83580.0x1375b20"></a>
Using Skype</h2></div></div><p>
After installing Skype, your first goal should be setting up your contacts
list. The green plus sign icon in the lower-left corner lets you look
for other Skype users (Figure 3). In the text box at the top, enter either
the Skype name, part of the full name, or the e-mail address to search for
someone. You can restrict the search further (probably necessary
if the person you are seeking has a common name) to a
specific country, state, city, language and sex. Click Search,
and Skype runs through all users, looking for those who match
and shows a window with the list. If the person you are seeking is on
the list, click on the name to select it, and then click Add Contact.
The contact will appear on your personal list.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10007f3.large.jpg"><img src="10007f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Use the search form to look for people and add them to your
contact list.
</p></div></div><p>
If you have purchased some credit, you also can call
landlines. (In order to buy credit, visit Skype's Web site, and you'll find
the link in the top-right corner.) You can pay with PayPal,
Visa, MasterCard and a few other options. (Remember to use some of the
credit; if you don't spend any of it in 180 days, your credit expires
and you will lose whatever you had still remaining in your account.) 
</p><p>
If
you want to add a standard phone, in the Add a Skype contact box, click the
bottom link, Add an ordinary phone, and you will be able to enter
the name and phone number. These numbers will show up in your
contact list with a blue (instead of green) icon, so you can recognize
them at a glance (Figure 4).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10007f4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. In your contacts list, green icons correspond to Skype users who
are on-line, grayed-out icons indicate off-line users, and blue icons
represent standard
phones.
</p></div></div><p>
If you click on a user, you can see his or her picture (if you want to upload
yours, click on your own name, and then click Edit Profile), and you will see
three icons: a sky-blue Start Chat icon, a green Start Phone Call
icon, and a down-pointing arrow that adds several more options, such as
Send File, View Profile, Rename Contact
(if you want to change the way the user appears on your list), and for
unwanted users, Delete Account and Block Account. Another option
is to click on Call Ordinary Phones, which shows a touchtone-type
display, allowing you to key in any number from any country; remember
this has a cost, and you must have enough credit for this.
</p><p>
During a phone call, you can right-click on the call window at any time
and get similar options as described in the above paragraph. You even
can start a chat, simultaneously with the call (you might want to do this
should your connection prove a bit flaky). Another option is adding
video, so you can send your image to the other party. You can do this
automatically (depending on how you configured the video options, as
described previously) or on demand (simply click the button). Click the
red button at the lower right to hang up and finish the call.
</p><p>
The chat window is quite similar to all other IRC channels. You can add more people to the chat if you
like; simply click the Add People button. To end a chat,
click on Leave Chat or close the window.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Skype lets you turn your computer into a phone,
capable of calling both Skype users and common phone numbers all over
the world. Let's hope that the Skype developers speed up a bit,
and let Linux users have more of the functionality available in other
operating systems.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe83580.0x13762b0"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Getting Your Webcam to Work</b></p><p>
The biggest enhancement in Skype 2.0 is the video capabilities, so I
certainly needed a Webcam in order to write this article. I went to
a nearby computer shop, and knowing there could be driver problems
(most Webcams, if not all, come only with Windows drivers, and not
even a peep regarding Linux), I applied my common sense, studied the
options thoroughly and opted for the cheapest model&mdash;if it wouldn't
work, at least it wouldn't cost much!
</p><p>
Even with the lack of support, there's a good source of drivers at
the Libland Web site. Its owner, Michel Xhaard, is doing a great job
in providing a free driver that works with more than 200 different Webcam
models. Thus, as the model I bought wasn't exactly cutting-edge,
I thought there would be a good chance it would work out of the box
with this driver.
</p><p>
I installed the Webcam, and did <tt  >lsusb</tt>, which produced a line reading
<tt  >Bus 001 Device 002: ID 0ac8:307b Z-Star Microelectronics
Corp.</tt>.
The first four characters (actually, hexadecimal numbers) after ID
identify the manufacturer, and the last four characters specify
the model. I then checked the list of supported Webcams, looking for
these values, and didn't find them; however, I did find several other
models from the same manufacturer, so I decided to give the driver a
whirl. Because I'm running kernel 2.6.23, I needed the gspcav1 driver;
for kernels below 2.6.11, scpa5xx is needed. I downloaded the
package, and then as root, did the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
tar zxf gspcav1-20071224.tar.gz
cd gspcav1-20071224
./gspca_build
</pre>
</p><p>
The process ran seamlessly, so I tried the Webcam with Skype, and it
worked. You might not be so lucky, but I recommend
starting your search for a driver at Xhaard's site.
