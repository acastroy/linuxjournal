Shell scripts may be quick, easy and lightweight, but proper scripting
includes the ability to anticipate and respond to error situations
gracefully and without anything breaking. Dave explores some of the basic
shell script error-handling options.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25e9580.0x26e14b8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
I realize I've been playing a bit fast and loose with my shell scripts
over the last few months, because I haven't talked about how to ensure that
error conditions don't break things. If you read the Letters section in
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>, you know I haven't covered this topic because, well,
you have covered it for me!
</p><p>
This topic ranges from the simple to the sophisticated, so let's start with a
basic test: the return status after an application or utility is invoked.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25e9580.0x26e1720"></a>
The Magical $? Sequence</h2></div></div><p>
Different shells have different return status indicators (the C shell, for
example, uses $status), but the most basic is Bash/the Bourne shell, which
is what we've focused on since I started writing Work the Shell, and it uses
<tt  >$?</tt>.
</p><p>
Here's a quick example:

<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/sh

mkdir /
echo "return status is $?"

mkdir /tmp/foobar
echo "return status is $?"

rmdir /tmp/foobar
echo "return status is $?"

rmdir /tmp
echo "return status is $?"

exit 0
</pre>
</p><p>
Run this, and you can see the difference between commands that succeed and
those that fail:

<pre     class="programlisting">
mkdir: /: Is a directory
return status is 1
return status is 0
return status is 0
rmdir: /tmp: Not a directory
return status is 1
</pre>
</p><p>
You can see that when invoking <tt  >mkdir</tt> or
<tt  >rmdir</tt> with an error condition,
they output an error and&mdash;the important part&mdash;the $? return status is
nonzero.
</p><p>
In fact, check out the man page for a typical command like mkdir, and
you'll see: &ldquo;DIAGNOSTICS: The mkdir utility exits 0 on success, and &gt;0 if
an error occurs.&rdquo;
</p><p>
In a perfect world, the <tt  >&gt;0</tt> return code would actually tell you what
happened, but although that's true with the functions accessible via software,
it's not true for the shell.
</p><p>
On the other hand, it's still helpful to explore how to make a shell
function that does error handling too. Here's a basic example function:

<pre     class="programlisting">
makedirectory()
{
   mkdir $1
   status=$?

   echo "return status is $status"
}
</pre>
</p><p>
This just makes a simple function that calls mkdir, and it should be no
surprise that it works as follows if I invoke it three times&mdash;twice in error
situations and once without an error:

<pre     class="programlisting">
mkdir: /: Is a directory
return status is 1
mkdir: /tmp/foobar: File exists
return status is 1
</pre>
</p><p>
It's a drag to have <tt  >mkdir</tt> generate an error message
when you can produce
your own simply by testing the $? status variable. 
</p><p>
Here's how you can do just that:

<pre     class="programlisting">

makedirectory()
{
   mkdir $1 2&gt;&amp;1 &gt; /dev/null
   status=$?

   echo "makedirectory failed trying to make $1 (error $status)"
}

</pre>
</p><p>
This is a bit tricky to understand, because you have to suppress the error
message from <tt  >mkdir</tt> so you can generate your own. That's done by redirecting
standard error to standard out (the <tt  >2&gt;&amp;1</tt> sequence) and then redirect
standard output to /dev/null (the <tt  >&gt; /dev/null</tt>
sequence).
</p><p>
Tip: there's a shorthand you could use here too, if you wanted to be a bit
more cryptic: <tt  >&amp;&gt;/dev/null</tt>.
</p><p>
Now when running this, however, the output is far more sophisticated:

<pre     class="programlisting">
makedirectory failed trying to make / (error 1)
makedirectory failed trying to make /tmp/foobar (error 1)
</pre>
</p><p>
That's a nice way to deal with errors, and of course, the function can
also return the error code, with <tt  >return $status</tt> as the last line.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25e9580.0x26e22d0"></a>
Using test to Avoid Error Conditions</h2></div></div><p>
The best way to handle errors is to capture error
conditions beforehand.
This is best done with the wonderful and powerful test command. For
example, the two typical error conditions that you'd encounter with the
makedirectory() function are the directory already existing or the script
not having permission to create the directory.
</p><p>
The first is pretty easy to test:

<pre     class="programlisting">
if [ -d "$1" ] ; then
  echo "Error: directory $1 already exists."
  exit 0
fi
</pre>
</p><p>
The second is a bit trickier because you need to grab the parent directory
portion of the requested directory then test it to see whether you have write and
execute permission to create the subdirectory. This can be done with the
dirname function (which returns . if there's no explicit directory
given), followed by a test for -w for writeable and -x for executable. 
</p><p>
It all combines like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
parentdir="$(dirname $1)" 
if [ ! -x $parentdir -o ! -w $parentdir ] 
then
  echo "Uh oh, can't create requested directory $1"
  exit 0
fi
</pre>
</p><p>
This is a sophisticated use of the test command, but read &ldquo;!&rdquo; as
&ldquo;not&rdquo;
and &ldquo;-o&rdquo; as &ldquo;or&rdquo;, and you can see the test is &ldquo;if not executable $parentdir
or not writeable $parentdir then...&rdquo;, and that should make sense!
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25e9580.0x26e27f8"></a>
Avoiding Output Problems with noclobber</h2></div></div><p>
Finally, another thing to be aware of with the shell is that it's all too
easy to zap important files with a redirect. For example, this shouldn't
work:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ who &gt; who.output
$ ls &gt; who.output
</pre>
</p><p>
The second command should generate an error because the output file already
exists, right? But it doesn't, and it simply trashes the who output without
a warning or error&mdash;not good.
</p><p>
To avoid that problem, you'll want to <tt  >set -o
noclobber</tt> in scripts or,
better, for your login shell, and let it be inherited by subshells,
including those that run your shell scripts. A good place to put it could
be in your .profile or .bashrc.
</p><p>
With noclobber set, the two commands behave differently:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ls &gt; who.output
-bash: who.output: cannot overwrite existing file
</pre>
</p><p>
That's useful for everyone, and doubly so for us shell script hackers,
right?
