<a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2018/10/22/184">Greg Kroah-Hartman released
Linux kernel 4.19</a> and handed the kernel tree back to
Linus, writing "You can have the joy of dealing with the merge window."</li>

<li>
<a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/63.0/releasenotes">Firefox
63.0 was released</a>. With this new version, "users can
opt to block third-party tracking cookies or block all trackers and create
exceptions for trusted sites that don't work correctly with content
blocking enabled". In addition, WebExtensions now run in their own process
on Linux, and Firefox also now warns if you have multiple windows and tabs
open when you quit via the main menu. You can download it from <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/download/thanks">here</a>.</li>

<li>
<a href="http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/info-gnu/2018-10/msg00001.html">Richard Stallman
announced the "GNU Kind Communication
Guidelines"</a>. Stallman writes that in contrast to a code of conduct with
punishment for people who violate the rules, "the
idea of the GNU Kind Communication Guidelines is to start guiding
people towards kinder communication at a point well before one would
even think of saying, 'You are breaking the rules'." The
initial version of the GNU Kind Communications Guidelines is <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/kind-communication.html">here</a>.

Linus Torvalds discusses his return to Linux in an <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/linus-torvalds-talks-about-coming-back-to-wo
rk-on-linux">interview with ZDNet</a>, and says he's "starting the usual
merge window activity now".
Regarding the Code of Conduct, he says: "I want to leave
it alone, and wait until we actually have any real issues. I'm hoping there
won't be any, but even if there are, I want the input to be colored more by
real and *actual* concerns, rather than just people arguing about it."
See the <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/linus-torvalds-talks-about-coming-back-to-wo
rk-on-linux">article</a> for more details on what he's been doing and other
news from the Maintainers Summit.
