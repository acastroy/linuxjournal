<h1 class="title">Open Sauce: Open Science Means Open Source—Or, at Least, It Should</h1>

<h2 class="sigil_not_in_toc">Why open source was actually invented in 1665. By Glyn Moody</h2>

<p>
When did open source begin? In February 1998, when <a href="https://opensource.com/article/18/2/coining-term-open-source-software">the
term was coined by Christine Peterson</a>?
Or in 1989, when Richard Stallman drew up <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/gnu.announce/m0Jjj_64PeQ/8xL1xkVKJb8J">the
"subroutinized" GNU GPL</a>? Or
perhaps a little earlier, in 1985, when <a href="https://github.com/larsbrinkhoff/emacs-16.56/blob/master/etc/COPYING">he
created the GNU Emacs license</a>? How about on March 6, 1665? On that
day, the following paragraph appeared:
</p>

<blockquote><p>
Whereas there is nothing more necessary for promoting the
improvement of Philosophical Matters, than the communicating to such, as
apply their Studies and Endeavours that way, such things as are discovered
or put in practise by others; it is therefore thought fit to employ the
Press, as the most proper way to gratifie those, whose engagement in
such Studies, and delight in the advancement of Learning and profitable
Discoveries, doth entitle them to the knowledge of what this Kingdom,
or other parts of the World, do, from time to time, afford, as well
of the progress of the Studies, Labours, and attempts of the Curious
and learned in things of this kind, as of their compleat Discoveries
and performances: To the end, that such Productions being clearly and
truly communicated, desires after solid and usefull knowledge may be
further entertained, ingenious Endeavours and Undertakings cherished,
and those, addicted to and conversant in such matters, may be invited
and encouraged to search, try, and find out new things, impart their
knowledge to one another, and contribute what they can to the Grand design
of improving Natural knowledge, and perfecting all Philosophical Arts,
and Sciences.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Those words are to be found in <a href="http://rstl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/1/1/0.1.full.pdf+html">the
very first issue of the Royal Society's <em>Philosophical Transactions</em></a>,
the oldest scientific journal in continuous publication in the world,
which published key results by Newton and others. Just as important is
the fact that it established key principles of science that we take for
granted today, including the routine public sharing of techniques and
results so that others can build on them—open source, in other words.
</p>

<p>
Given that science pretty much invented what we now call the open-source
approach, it's rather ironic that the scientific community is currently
re-discovering openness, in what is known as open science. The movement
is being driven by a growing awareness that the passage from traditional,
<em>analog</em> scientific methods, to ones permeated by digital technology,
is no minor evolution. Instead, it brings fundamental changes to how
science can—and should—be conducted.
</p>

<p>
The open science revolution can be said to have begun with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2016/06/what-is-open-access-free-sharing-of-all-human-knowledge">open
access</a>—the idea that academic papers should be freely available as
digital documents. It takes the original idea behind the Royal Society's
<em>Philosophical Transactions</em>—that news about discoveries should be
set down and published—to the next level, by making that information
freely accessible to all. Open access illustrates neatly the leap between
analog and digital worlds. Where it would have been impossible to make
the printed versions of the Royal Society's <em>Philosophical
Transactions</em>
generally available, the internet can potentially give everyone with an
online connection cost-free access to every article posted online.
</p>

<p>
The same can be said of another important aspect of open science:
open data. Before the internet, handling data was a tedious and
time-consuming process. But once digitized, even the most capacious
databases can be transmitted, combined, compared and analyzed very
rapidly. For science, this is transformational, since it means that, in
principle, other researchers can check experimental results by downloading
complete datasets and carrying out their own, independent analysis and
evaluation. Just as important, they can conduct new analyses to obtain
results that go beyond the initial discoveries. The development of tools
and techniques to mine data for new information, and to combine it with
other datasets, has led to <a href="https://theodi.org/about-the-odi">the
spread of open data ideas and practices far beyond science</a>.
</p>

<p>
The final leg of the open science tripod, and arguably the most radical
one, is open source. One of the most important developments in science
in the last few decades is the use of digital tools for research.
These might be programs that gather data, or analyze it, or store it.
But however it is used, software is indispensable for modern science.
The problem is, much of the code is specifically written for each scientific
investigation. Despite all the effort that goes into this indispensable
tool, the fruits of that work are rarely shared with other scientists
afterward.
</p>

<p>
Indeed, even as the open science movement gathers momentum, open
source is conspicuous by its absence. For example, in 2016, the
Council of the European Union issued its important policy statement titled <a href="http://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-9526-2016-INIT/en/pdf">"The
transition towards an Open Science system"</a>, in which
open source it not mentioned once. Neither does the 2017 <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/research/openscience/pdf/eosc_declaration.pdf">European
Open Science cloud declaration</a>. The 2018 <a href="https://www.wilsoncenter.org/event/advancing-open-science-the-eu-and-the-us">Advancing
Open Science in the EU and the US workshop</a> also seems
to have overlooked this aspect. More recently, The National
Academies Of Sciences, Engineering, And Medicine published a <a href="http://www8.nationalacademies.org/onpinews/newsitem.aspx?RecordID=25116">"New
Framework to Speed Progress Toward Open Science"</a>. In it, the power
and success of open source is mentioned no less than 20 times, which
is great. Unfortunately, the final recommendations do not include
promoting open source as part of open science.
</p>

<p>
A major new initiative in Europe, which has been hitting the
headlines in scientific circles, is also silent on open source.
With the support of the European Commission and the European
Research Council, 11 national research funding organizations
recently announced the launch of Plan S by the weirdly named <a href="https://www.scienceeurope.org/coalition-s">cOAlition S</a>. This
is "an initiative to make full and immediate Open Access to research
publications a reality". Open source could play an important role
here, through the use of high-quality free software applications that
make publishing easier and cheaper than current approaches. Instead,
the plan simply says: "The importance of open archives and repositories
for hosting research outputs is acknowledged because of their long-term
archiving function and their potential for editorial innovation"—open archives, but not open-source archives, that is. Fortunately,
influential figures are calling out this serious oversight. <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/+PeterSuber/posts/iGEFpdYY9dr">Commenting
on Plan S</a>, Peter Suber, widely recognized as one of the leaders in
the open access world, writes:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The plan promises "support...for Open Access infrastructures
where necessary." So far, so good. But the plan is silent on the
importance of open infrastructure, that is, platforms running on
open-source software, under open standards, with open APIs for
interoperability, and preferably owned or hosted by non-profit
organizations.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
As the above indicates, governmental bodies and the top science
organizations show a regrettable lack of interest in working with
open source in order to boost open science. That's surprising and
unacceptable, since much of the code written by researchers has been
funded by the public. There is, therefore, a compelling case that all
such software <em>must</em> be released under an open-source license to
allow anyone—including the people who paid for it with their taxes—to re-use it however they wish.
</p>

<p>
In the face of that indifference from the big funding bodies,
grass-roots activists are doing what they can with their
limited resources, and there are some hopeful signs of progress.
For example, <a href="https://operas.hypotheses.org">OPERAS</a>,
a European research infrastructure, has published a white paper
exploring <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/1324110">what
open-source solutions are available</a> for creating an open
science scholarly communication infrastructure. Similarly, <a href="https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2018/08/30/mapping-open-science-tools">a
recent post by Lettie Y. Conrad</a> provides a useful <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1k8x7jH4zsDgtYf3xiGrj2sYW5iKPqBh2NqOpOcKwgio/edit?usp=sharing">survey
of what "open" tools are available for open science</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
For purposes of this project, we zeroed in on those tools
provided by non-profit or community-based organizations using open
source software, offering open data, via an open license, leveraging
open standards where possible—basically, as open as humanly and
technologically possible.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Conrad presented her work at a workshop on producing <a href="https://jrost.org/2018/09/13/workshop.html">a Joint Roadmap
for Open Science Tools</a>. What's striking is that among <a href="https://jrost.org/participants">the participants in the
workshop</a>, the only mainstream name from the Open Source world is
Mozilla. This shows that alongside the massive failure on the part of
research funding bodies to embrace open source as part of the solution,
there is a similar failure of open-source projects to become active in
this important area.
</p>

<p>
That's a real shame, because open science offers a huge opportunity
for free software coders to take on new challenges and create some
exciting and innovative programs. As well as enriching the Open Source
community and its projects, such a move also would help accelerate the
open science revolution. It's surely what the founders of the Royal
Society's <em>Philosophical Transactions</em> would have wanted.
