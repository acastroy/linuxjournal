SUSE Enterprise Storage</h2></div></div><p>
The conundrum for many enterprise-level businesses is that the demand for
data storage is significantly outpacing the shrinking price for storage.
The upshot for many is that budgets for storage are growing faster than
data demands. Fortunately SUSE wants to reduce your storage costs, which is
why it released the new SUSE Enterprise Storage 3. SUSE's updated
intelligent software-defined storage solution is touted as the first
commercially supported solution based on the Jewel release of CephFS, which
enables enterprises to transform storage infrastructure to reduce costs
while providing unlimited scalability. SUSE Enterprise Storage users can
transform their storage infrastructure and seamlessly adapt new
technologies using cost-efficient, resilient and redundant storage
infrastructures on commodity hardware. Other innovations in version 3
include multisite object replication to ensure replication at distance for
improved disaster recovery and a new framework to simplify management by
providing the foundation for an advanced GUI management tool (using
openATTIC).

SourceClear's Commit Watcher</h2></div></div><p>
Someone accidentally commits private AWS keys to an open-source project and
ends up handing candy to a bitcoin miner. Once committed, these secrets are
easily discoverable through GitHub Search, which makes this accidental
disclosure additionally dangerous. To combat this and other threats to safe
use of open source, Source Clear announced Commit Watcher, a recently
open-sourced tool that finds interesting and potentially hazardous
commits&mdash;both accidental credential leaks and undisclosed security patches.
The tool addresses two critical categories of issues found among
open-source software that by nature are disclosed publicly but are also
largely unknown. These are accidental disclosure of sensitive information
(SSH keys, AWS credentials and so on) and security patches for vulnerabilities
that are not explicitly disclosed. Companies can watch their own projects,
public and private, for accidental disclosures and take remedial action as
soon as possible. Commit Watcher is further backed by a comprehensive
vulnerability database, SourceClear Registry, and complements SourceClear
Open in the arsenal of products SourceClear has designed specifically for
open-source developers.

Juniper Systems' Geode</h2></div></div><p>
Juniper Systems' new Geode rugged sub-meter GNSS (Global Navigation
Satellite System) receiver collects real-time professional-grade data but
is intuitive enough for novices. Designed foremost for versatility, the
Geode features one-button simplicity and can be paired with any of Juniper
Systems' rugged handhelds as well as a wide range of Android devices.
The Geode features a small, compact design and can be carried conveniently 
by hand or in a pack or mounted on a pole, depending on specific user
requirements. Like other Juniper Systems' products, the Geode is built
to Juniper Rugged standards and IP68-rated protection against dust and
water for reliable performance in harsh environments. The receiver features
an Overtime Technology battery for all-day power and a wide operating
temperature range (very low and high), even conserving power in low
temperatures.

illusive networks' Deceptions Everywhere</h2></div></div><p>
illusive networks' bread and butter is its deception cybersecurity
technology called Deceptions Everywhere whose approach is to neutralize
targeted attacks and Advanced Persistent Threats by creating a deceptive
layer across the entire network. By providing an endless source of false
information, illusive networks disrupts and detects attacks with real-time
forensics and without disruption to business. The latest illusive networks
release is enhanced with Linux support, Advanced Forensics and Highly
Interactive Deceptions to distract attackers from their targets further.
The new forensics dashboard provides laser-focused forensics illuminating
the minutes before, during and after an attack. illusive enables defenders
to focus on high-quality information (as opposed to trudging through
terabytes of data) and generate the report in real time.

Contrast Security's Contrast Enterprise</h2></div></div><p>
The phrase with which Contrast Security describes the one-of-a-kind
protection provided by the new Contrast Enterprise is &ldquo;continuous
application security&rdquo;. By this, Contrast Security means that Contrast
Enterprise is &ldquo;The first and only enterprise security software product
that fully integrates the ability to find and fix application
vulnerabilities during development, and monitor and block application
attacks in production, all within one unified environment.&rdquo; Contrast
Security points out that these two capabilities heretofore were 
available only in partially integrated solutions at best or siloed products from
partnering vendors at worst. Meanwhile, Contrast Enterprise uses patented
deep security instrumentation to weave vulnerability
detection, threat visibility and attack protection directly into
applications automatically, without requiring application changes or security experts.
While these applications are running, highly accurate context is instantly
generated about where applications are vulnerable and under attack.
Contrast Security calls its approach &ldquo;a revolution in application
security for traditional development approaches, as well as for Agile
and DevOps methodologies&rdquo;.

Jose Dieguez Castro's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Introduction to Linux Distros</em></span> (Apress)</h2></div></div><p>
Although Linux always has been a diverse ecosystem, once upon a time, just a
handful of Linux distributions, or distros, existed. Do you recall
Yggrasil, Trans-Ameritech and the original S.u.S.E. (which begat SuSE, SUSE
and openSUSE)? Today, literally hundreds of Linux flavors exist, each with
its own unique offerings. How do you choose the right one for you and your
needs? A new book called <span   class="emphasis"><em>Introduction to Linux Distros</em></span> by Jose Dieguez
Castro explores the pros and cons of the most frequently used Linux
distributions in a concise step-by-step manner, so users can avoid
hours of web surfing, countless downloads and ample confusion by new
concepts and complex and marathon installation guides. Readers will benefit
from the author's long-term experience working hands-on with each distro.
In the book, Dieguez Castro also discusses the idea of a Linux
&ldquo;distro&rdquo; and why so many exist, the criteria for finding the right
distro for one's needs, the various Linux &ldquo;family trees&rdquo; and
their unique &ldquo;philosophies&rdquo;, as well as how to install, maintain
and obtain support for each distro.

iguaz.io</h2></div></div><p>
An IT megatrend in progress involves the shift from legacy monolithic apps
running on enterprise storage to systems of engagement that interact with
users, collect real-time data from many sources and store it in elastic and
shared data services. A self-described &ldquo;disruptive&rdquo; enterprise
seeking to push this vision forward is iguaz.io, which recently announced a
virtualized data services architecture for revolutionizing both private and
public clouds. In contrast to the current siloed approach, iguaz.io
consolidates data into a high-volume, real-time data repository that
virtualizes and presents it as streams, messages, files, objects or data
records. All data types are stored consistently on different memory or
storage tiers, and popular application frameworks (Hadoop, ELK, Spark or
Docker containers) are accelerated. In addition to a 10x to 100x
improvement in time to insights at lower costs, iguaz.io says that its
architecture provides best-in-class data security based on a real-time
classification engine, a critical need for data sharing among users and
business units.

NordVPN for Android</h2></div></div><p>
The prospect of privacy protection and occulting your smartphone's IP
address with a VPN are sufficient selling points, but the ability to watch
your Spanish-dubbed Turkish telenovellas while on the beach in Tahiti should
seal the deal for real. Better security and access to geo-blocked content
are part and parcel of NordVPN, a new Android app designed to bring VPN
(Virtual Private Network) services to a larger public with its simplicity
to set up and use. NordVPN says that its apps have received wide acclaim
from critics and users for their &ldquo;breakthrough usability and
design&rdquo;. The app can connect to the desired destination quickly by
simply clicking on the country name, as it automatically selects the
fastest server available. Additional NordVPN features include service on
up to six devices with one account, a choice of more than 550 servers worldwide,
24/7 customer support, an automated kill switch, integrated access to
SmartPlay (an encrypted SmartDNS), double VPN, Tor over VPN, anti-DdoS,
Ultra Fast TV Servers, a Netflix shortcut and more.
