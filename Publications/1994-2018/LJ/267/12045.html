Google Android is undergoing legal attacks in several jurisdictions due to
perceived abuses of its market position. Android security is beginning to
play a larger role in these conflicts, and significant penalties for
Google, network carriers and OEMs due to security shortfalls can no longer
be discounted.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1804580.0x18fc250"></a></h2></div></div><p>
This article focuses on flaws in Android's stock web libraries, while
acknowledging related exploits. Some modern Android browsers have
critically weak encryption and other dangerous flaws that cannot be patched
or otherwise corrected. This weakness extends to multiple browsers and
applications and is determined by the linkage to the system webcore on
older OS versions. HTML applications that do not provide their own
rendering engine should be avoided for all versions of Android less than 5.0.
</p><p>
Recent statistics indicate that 19% of the population accessing internet
information systems have been the victims of an exploit or data breach,
causing 45% to reduce or eliminate reliance upon electronic commerce and
communication
(<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/05/13/americans_cutting_back_on_online_activity_over_security_and_privacy_fears" target="_self">www.theregister.co.uk/2016/05/13/americans_cutting_back_on_online_activity_over_security_and_privacy_fears</a>). Computer security flaws are resulting in a direct impact on
the economics of online business, and this must be corrected.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1804580.0x18fc4b8"></a>
Weakened WebKit</h2></div></div><p>
Most mobile platforms (including Android) owe a great debt to the KHTML
rendering engine from the KDE Konqueror web browser. Mobile HTML is
essentially a monoculture from the perspective of an OS default
browser&mdash;they all emerge from KHTML, which won this position by providing a
high-quality codebase under a reasonable license at the right time.
</p><p>
Although one would hesitate to call Apple a consistently good steward of KHTML
due to past friction with the Konqueror project
(<a href="https://blogs.kde.org/2005/04/29/bitter-failure-named-safari-and-khtml" target="_self">https://blogs.kde.org/2005/04/29/bitter-failure-named-safari-and-khtml</a>), the Safari browser
introduced a compelling rework of KHTML known as WebKit. Apple has provided
both new features and regular security fixes for WebKit (more than 100
security-related patches in 2015), which eventually were brought back to
Konqueror
(<a href="http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2007/07/the-unforking-of-kdes-khtml-and-webkit" target="_self">arstechnica.com/information-technology/2007/07/the-unforking-of-kdes-khtml-and-webkit</a>). As Safari moved from desktop MacOS to mobile iOS, WebKit assumed
the mantle of mobile browser leadership, and that role never has been
seriously challenged.
</p><p>
Google also adopted WebKit into both Android and the Chrome web browser.
Chrome has become the dominant browser by market share, and it receives
regular updates from Google on all platforms where it is supported.
</p><p>
However, Google also added WebKit as a library to Android. Any application
can link the system WebKit to render HTML as part of the User Interface
(UI) by calling WebView, which links in /system/lib/libwebcore.so.
</p><p>
The problem with Android's bundled WebKit is that for older
versions, it is never updated, which is not well known. Android 5.0
Lollipop is the first release where the bundled WebKit can be
patched.
</p><p>
For Android 4.4 KitKat, the bundled WebKit 537.36
(<a href="http://jimbergman.net/webkit-version-in-android-version" target="_self">jimbergman.net/webkit-version-in-android-version</a>) and its TLS
implementation does not conform to best-practice encryption as defined in
RFC 7525 (<a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7525.txt" target="_self">https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7525.txt</a>). As reported by the
Qualys SSL Scanner (<a href="https://www.ssllabs.com" target="_self">https://www.ssllabs.com</a>):
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
SSL version 3 is enabled&mdash;a <span   class="emphasis"><em>must not</em></span> from the RFC. This can be exploited
via the POODLE downgrade attack to decrypt traffic.
</p></li><li><p>
Weak &ldquo;export-grade&rdquo; ciphers are allowed&mdash;also a
<span   class="emphasis"><em>must not</em></span> from the RFC.
This enables hostile decryption by third parties via the FREAK attack.
</p></li><li><p>
RC4 ciphers are allowed&mdash;also a <span   class="emphasis"><em>must not</em></span> from the RFC.
</p></li><li><p>
Weak Diffie-Hellman primes are allowed, which can be exploited via the
Logjam attack.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
These software flaws preclude the use of the KitKat system WebKit for
sensitive transactions of any kind. Android JellyBean, which spans
numerical releases of 4.1 through 4.3, has WebKit version 534.30, which is
even worse, as it wasn't actually updated since Android version 4.0.1 Ice
Cream Sandwich:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
JellyBean disables TLS 1.1 and 1.2 by default, in addition to allowing SSL
v3.
</p></li><li><p>
JellyBean also is vulnerable to the &ldquo;Same Origin Policy&rdquo; bug
CVE-2014-6041
(<a href="https://community.rapid7.com/community/metasploit/blog/2014/09/15/major-android-bug-is-a-privacy-disaster-cve-2014-6041" target="_self">https://community.rapid7.com/community/metasploit/blog/2014/09/15/major-android-bug-is-a-privacy-disaster-cve-2014-6041</a>), which allows hostile websites to spy on browser
activity.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Google cannot and will not patch these or other bugs
(<a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/google-why-we-wont-patch-pre-kitkat-android-webview" target="_self">www.zdnet.com/article/google-why-we-wont-patch-pre-kitkat-android-webview</a>), because the Android
patch process is both technically and politically (too) difficult&mdash;in
Google's own words, patches are &ldquo;no longer practical to do
safely&rdquo;. Google
regularly abandons large segments of the Android base, and the above design
flaws now infect more than 50% of Android devices. As of April 4, 2016, KitKat is
33.4% of the total Android base; Jelly Bean is 21.3%, and earlier versions
sum to 4.9% (<a href="https://developer.android.com/about/dashboards/index.html" target="_self">https://developer.android.com/about/dashboards/index.html</a>). Web
browsing of sensitive data on those platforms is unsafe
if the system libraries are involved.
</p><p>
This problem is exacerbated by wireless carriers who still stock KitKat,
Jelly Bean and earlier versions. Even the largest of carriers are guilty
of this activity, and they include no disclosure that these older OS
versions have weak, exploitable encryption and a slew of other flaws, which
place them at a severe disadvantage for sensitive traffic. Some carriers
spend far more effort in locking phones with bootloaders that require
kernels bearing digital signatures than they have ever spent on security
patches.
</p><p>
Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) cause equal trouble. Although many
&ldquo;stock browsers&rdquo; in various versions of Android use the system WebKit, some
OEMs build separate versions of WebKit for their branded browsers that
exhibit the same (lack of) support as shown by Google. OEM/vendor browsers
also cannot be trusted with sensitive data.
</p><p>
The US Federal Communications and Trade Commissions (FCC and FTC) have
announced a joint investigation into Google and its partners over the
lack of security updates for Android
(<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/05/09/fcc_ftc_android_updates" target="_self">www.theregister.co.uk/2016/05/09/fcc_ftc_android_updates</a>), which may result in future
architecture changes but is unlikely to secure the older releases.
Ideally, the FCC would compel carriers and OEMs to release signing keys for
phones that have gone without security patches for more than six months,
giving users of abandoned phones the option of third-party security
support.
</p><p>
Had Microsoft taken the final Trident rendering engine from Windows XP's
Internet Explorer and locked it to 50% of the Windows user community while
actively preventing updates, the condemnation would have been fierce and
brutal. The time has come to recognize that what Google has done is far
worse&mdash;XP and KitKat support ended within a few months of one another, but
Microsoft does not allow XP to proliferate through third parties as Google
does with its orphaned products.
</p><p>
It was likely with some measure of relief that Apple and the WebKit team
greeted the news that Google was forking the code, forming the BLINK engine
and leaving the project (<a href="http://www.wired.com/2013/04/blink" target="_self">www.wired.com/2013/04/blink</a>). Google has the worst security record of any large
WebKit implementation. Although other Linux distributions also lag on
WebKit security
(<a href="https://blogs.gnome.org/mcatanzaro/2016/02/01/on-webkit-security-updates" target="_self">https://blogs.gnome.org/mcatanzaro/2016/02/01/on-webkit-security-updates</a>), none has the ubiquity of Android. Google's departure will
only improve WebKit's security standing.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1804580.0x18fd590"></a>
The Plague Spreads</h2></div></div><p>
A number of browsers in the Google Play Store are reputedly faster and more
feature-rich than Chrome. Some even assert greater security, which I 
soon will refute here. Chrome is generally seen as a conservative choice by app
review sites, and it is rarely listed in first place in Android browser
reviews.
</p><p>
These faster browsers often simply wrap new UI controls around the system
WebKit, and thus inherit all of the security flaws of the Android version
upon which they run.
</p><p>
Browsers that run with degraded security, as tested on Jelly Bean and
reported by the Qualys SSL Scanner (<a href="https://www.ssllabs.com" target="_self">https://www.ssllabs.com</a>), include Apus, Apus Turbo, Best Browser,
Boat Browser, Brave (Link Bubble), CM Browser, Dolphin, Dolphin Zero, Easy,
Flynx, Flyperlink, Ghostery, Javelin, Maxthon, Mercury, Naked Browser, Next
Browser, Ninesky, Safe Browser and UC Browser. <span   class="bold"><b>These browsers are to be

Surprisingly, JellyBean does include the latest TLSv1.2 encryption
protocol, but it is disabled by default. There is a procedure to enable it
that a developer must follow to secure an application with this feature
(<a href="http://blog.dev-area.net/2015/08/13/android-4-1-enable-tls-1-1-and-tls-1-2" target="_self">blog.dev-area.net/2015/08/13/android-4-1-enable-tls-1-1-and-tls-1-2</a>). A
few of the browsers mentioned above have done so, but many have not, either out of
ignorance or sloth. There are extensive options for detailed cipher control
(<a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/javax/net/ssl/SSLSocket.html" target="_self">https://developer.android.com/reference/javax/net/ssl/SSLSocket.html</a>) 
that can be used to pass more of the Qualys SSL Labs tests with the standard
WebKit (by disabling SSLv3, RC4, export ciphers and so on), but none of the
tested &ldquo;rebadged-WebKit&rdquo; browsers listed above have done so (likely as no
best-practice details the procedures).
</p><p>
Beginning with Android 2.3 Gingerbread, Google made the surprising decision
to alter the preferred cipher order, switching to RC4-MD5 from Android 2.2
Froyo's AES256-SHA1 (<a href="https://op-co.de/blog/posts/android_ssl_downgrade" target="_self">https://op-co.de/blog/posts/android_ssl_downgrade</a>). Although it appears that this was done to mirror the Java
standards, the impact is described as &ldquo;a sign of horrible ignorance,
security incompetence or a clever disguise for an NSA-influenced
manipulation&rdquo;. This flaw remained in place for the initial Android
JellyBean 4.1 release, although it appears to have been corrected by
release 4.3.
</p><p>
Moving onward to third parties, the CM Browser application specifically
advertises that it is &ldquo;Secure: Malicious &amp; Fraud
Protection&rdquo; with the &ldquo;#1
antivirus engine...which can protect you from malicious threats.&rdquo;
Despite these claims, its use of the WebKit system exposes it to all the
problems of the older platforms. The Safe Browser advertises
anti-spyware/-virus, but the SSL test results surely negate any dubious
benefit from a malware host list. The Ghostery browser appears to be
available as a plugin for Firefox&mdash;use it in this manner for better
encryption support.
</p><p>
Opera Mini deserves special mention. In the default configuration, the
Qualys SSL scanner detects the &ldquo;Presto&rdquo; rendering engine, not WebKit, and
it passes all of the security tests. However, if the &ldquo;data
savings&rdquo; setting
is switched from &ldquo;extreme&rdquo; to &ldquo;high&rdquo;, then WebKit is detected (not Presto),
and all of the tests fail. It appears that, while Presto is active, all of
Opera Mini's browser traffic is routed through Opera's servers for
pre-rendering and compression. This is deceptive, so Opera Mini's failing
grade is reported here.
</p><p>
All of the browsers tested were free, but some have
&ldquo;ad-free/pro&rdquo; versions
that must be purchased. Be sure to test via the Qualys SSL scanner before paying for any
Android browser to avoid purchasing a failure.
</p><p>
This problem does not end with browsers. A number of applications will
render web pages as a small subset of their function, and those rendered
pages also are unsafe. For example, the Tinfoil for Facebook application
has an option to &ldquo;Open links inside app&rdquo;. Those are opened with the system
WebKit. Banking, securities and finance apps may well do the same. If you
run an Android app that handles sensitive data, ask the developers if they
use WebKit/WebView. If so, do not use it on Android 4.4 or below.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1804580.0x1e88e20"></a>
Safe Harbor</h2></div></div><p>
From the web browsers above that pass all standards tests, Google Chrome
likely has the largest installed base, as it is bundled on many Android
devices when they are sold. Many will be tempted to use it as their secure
browser. This is likely the wrong choice, for a number of reasons:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Although Chrome allows malware blocking as an extension in other operating
systems, this feature has been removed from the Android version. Google has
not stopped with merely denying this single feature in Chrome, but has gone
further and removed third-party malware/adblock applications from the Play
store
(<a href="http://lifehacker.com/5990448/google-has-started-removing-ad-blockers-from-the-play-store" target="_self">lifehacker.com/5990448/google-has-started-removing-ad-blockers-from-the-play-store</a>), further endangering the Android community. Such a move demonstrates
clearly that advertising telemetry is more important than security for
the Android architects.
</p></li><li><p>
Google Chrome is (partially) closed source, and users have no idea what it
might be harvesting when it is installed and in use, especially on the
Android platform where Google likely feels a sense of entitlement.
</p></li><li><p>
Instead of Chrome, it is possible to load the open-source Chromium browser
on Android (to which Google adds closed-source components prior to
distribution). The getChromium application on F-Droid can install this
precursor browser
(<a href="https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=com.anddevw.getchromium" target="_self">https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=com.anddevw.getchromium</a>). Still, Chromium lacks malware filters.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
It's plain that the safest browser on Android should be open source,
include malware block capability, receive regular updates and
not be based on WebKit in any way to ensure that it does not
clandestinely utilize vulnerable Android components. The obvious browser
that meets these qualifications is Firefox. This is not to imply that
Firefox is a perfect browser. It famously lacks a sandbox, which has not
helped its reputation
(<a href="http://www.extremetech.com/computing/178587-firefox-is-still-the-least-secure-web-browser-falls-to-four-zero-day-exploits-at-pwn2own" target="_self">www.extremetech.com/computing/178587-firefox-is-still-the-least-secure-web-browser-falls-to-four-zero-day-exploits-at-pwn2own</a>). However, it is far better than the majority of its
peers on Android. It also has a large extensions library that includes
several malware/adblock options, which Google has confirmed will never come
to Chrome for Android
(<a href="http://www.omgchrome.com/chrome-android-extensions-not-planned-ama" target="_self">www.omgchrome.com/chrome-android-extensions-not-planned-ama</a>), which might be for the best, as criminals have been
soliciting Chrome extension app authors to abuse Chrome users
(<a href="https://software-gunslinger.tumblr.com/post/143004937538/google-chrome-a-history-of-crime" target="_self">https://software-gunslinger.tumblr.com/post/143004937538/google-chrome-a-history-of-crime</a>).
</p><p>
To address other Android components that present a danger to safe usage,
consider the following:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
/system/lib/libstagefright.so &mdash; this library has been compromised in
attacks transmitted by web pages and media sent by MMS
(<a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2015/07/stagefright_vul.html" target="_self">https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2015/07/stagefright_vul.html</a>). Some have suggested
that Firefox is not vulnerable to StageFright exploits
(<a href="http://android.stackexchange.com/questions/120914/why-is-firefox-not-vulnerable-to-stagefright" target="_self">android.stackexchange.com/questions/120914/why-is-firefox-not-vulnerable-to-stagefright</a>).
</p></li><li><p>
/system/lib/libc.so &mdash; the core standard library for the C programming
language was taken largely from OpenBSD, then neglected for years. Recent
update efforts by the maintainers expose the sad state to which the code
had fallen (<a href="http://undeadly.org/cgi?action=article&amp;sid=20140506132000" target="_self">undeadly.org/cgi?action=article&amp;sid=20140506132000</a>): &ldquo;I've seen what a mess things were when we diverged (and how
many bugs went unfixed in Android despite having been fixed for years
upstream).&rdquo;
</p></li><li><p>
The Linux kernel itself &mdash; more a demonstration of policy than security,
Google's source contribution to the kernel for Android was erased by a
kernel maintainer who announced the reason why
(<a href="http://m.theregister.co.uk/2010/02/03/android_driver_code_deleted_from_linux_kernel" target="_self">m.theregister.co.uk/2010/02/03/android_driver_code_deleted_from_linux_kernel</a>):
&ldquo;In short, no one cared
about the code, so it was removed&rdquo;
(<a href="http://www.kroah.com/log/linux/android-kernel-problems.html?seemore=y" target="_self">www.kroah.com/log/linux/android-kernel-problems.html?seemore=y</a>). For a definitive kernel security
weakness that, for many users, will never be patched, the example of Pinkie
Pie's Towelroot is the best known
(<a href="http://geeksided.com/2014/06/16/towelroot-exploit-reveals-security-nightmare-android" target="_self">geeksided.com/2014/06/16/towelroot-exploit-reveals-security-nightmare-android</a>). This flaw allows any application to gain
root privilege on some KitKat devices and many earlier versions.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
You do not want to trust your bank account to an operating system where no
one cares that hundreds of bugs are ignored, regardless of enthusiasm,
hype or attractiveness. Assuming that you must use your Android device to
process such sensitive information, it is likely better to use a mobile
HTML site in a safe browser rather than a local app. If circumstances force
you to use an app, prefer an app developer that recognizes Android libraries
for the security minefield that they are and thus avoids using OS features
that can compromise your data.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Users of modern, enterprise Linux are accustomed to five-year support
cycles on platforms with regular security updates that rely on fine-grained
package databases, allowing for easy reversal of an individual patch. All
of this is available for free from multiple vendors, although paid support
is available through several avenues.
</p><p>
For such individuals, Android releases closely resemble unsupported
development snapshots. In the rare events that Android updates do arrive,
they come as giant .ZIP files that are slapped over (/system)/bin in an

computer sciences and the people who use them, let's hope that day comes
soon.
