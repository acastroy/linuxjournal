Turn an old PC into a virtual-machine host using Proxmox and KVM.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x188f580.0x1987250"></a></h2></div></div><p>
In the May 2016 issue, I introduced the idea of the Tiny Internet Project,
a self-contained Linux project that shows how to build the key pieces of
the public internet on a single computer using one or two old computers,
a router and a bunch of Linux software. In this second part, you'll
learn how to build the virtual-machine host&mdash;using Proxmox&mdash;and
deploy your first server. Later, in Part III, you'll build a template
to make DNS and email hosts, a website and a Linux distribution mirror.
</p><p>
You'll need two separate computers for this project. This first is your
&ldquo;administration PC&rdquo;. It's any desktop or laptop with network access, a
graphical browser (like Firefox or Chrome) and at least one USB port. The
second machine will become your virtual machine host.
</p><p>
The central idea is to build a sort of internet-in-a-box with common
Linux servers and use the setup to teach young people or newcomers about
Linux. Using virtualization software, you'll deploy several servers that
will handle domain names, email, web pages and more&mdash;all on a single
piece of hardware. You don't need anything new or fancy. I built the
prototype on a six-year-old Velocity Micro desktop with an Intel i3
processor, 8GB of RAM, two network cards and a couple 1TB drives.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x188f580.0x1987510"></a>
Choosing Your Hardware</h2></div></div><p>
First off, you need a computer that supports virtualization&mdash;meaning
its BIOS, 64-bit-capable CPU and motherboard allow you to share all
the system's resources with virtual machines that will run on it.
You may have experimented with VirtualBox
or even free versions of VMware's ESXi software. The idea here is the same:
place a number of virtual servers on a single physical machine and share
all of that physical machine's resources, including memory, CPU and drives.
</p><p>
The Linux version is called KVM for Kernel-based Virtual Machine. For this
project, you'll 
use a pre-compiled version called Proxmox, which comes with everything
you need.
</p><p>
To see if the computer you have in mind can become a Proxmox server,
you'll need to check whether it supports virtualization. Graphical tools are
available for Windows, Linux or Mac OS X, and if you've got a machine
with no operating system installed, you can boot it from a USB or CD
drive using any flavor of Linux to test it. See the Resources section
at the end of this article to learn how to do that.
</p><p>
On Windows, you can learn a lot from the main Computer
properties. Right-click on Computer (on the desktop or Start menu), and
look at the lower part of the window, which will look something like Figure
1.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12046f1.large.jpg"><img src="12046f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Windows Computer Properties
</p></div></div><p>
If you see &ldquo;Quad CPU&rdquo;, or something similar, and &ldquo;64-bit Operating
System&rdquo;, you likely have a machine that (once wiped) will work. To
be more certain, you can use Intel or AMD tools to identify further your
CPU's ability to support virtualization (again, see the Resources at the end
of the article).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="12046f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. SecurAble helps you learn more about your processor.
</p></div></div><p>
If you're planning to use an old Intel-based Apple Mac, there are many
that support virtualization. Getting an older Mac to boot from USB can
be a little tricky, and I won't cover those steps here. However, I have
successfully installed Linux on several Intel Macs, and it runs well.
</p><p>
If you already have Linux installed on a desktop or server, you can use
a few simple terminal commands to see if it supports virtualization. Open
a terminal and enter this command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep vmx
</pre>
</p><p>
If it returns something that looks like the following text (repeated
several times for each CPU), you're in business and can proceed to
the next step (if you're still uncertain, check the Resources for more
options):

<pre     class="programlisting">
[flags		: fpu vme de pse tsc msr pae mce cx8 apic sep 
 &#8618;mtrr pge mca cmov pat pse36 clflush dts acpi mmx fxsr

 &#8618;vnmi flexpriority ept vpid fsgsbase smep erms]
</pre>
</p><p>
If the <tt  >flags</tt> output includes <tt  >vmx</tt> (possibly highlighted red
in the output), you should be set. If not, check your system's
BIOS. Virtualization often is possible on a system, but it's disabled
by default. Look for virtualization settings in your system's BIOS,
enable it and reboot.
</p><p>
Although the Tiny Internet Project is designed to provide everything you
need without having to access the public internet, the fact is you'll need
your Linux distribution mirror to connect to servers on the outside. You
can do this
by setting up a proxy server (which I will cover in Part III) or
by installing two Ethernet cards on your Proxmox host. Wired connections
are easier to set up than wireless ones, and I don't recommend using a
Wi-Fi card or USB dongle as the host's second connection.
</p><p>
With two cards installed, your Proxmox host will be able to talk to both
public and private networks, and so will the virtual machines running
on top of it.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x188f580.0x1987f08"></a>
The Virtualization Software: Proxmox</h2></div></div><p>
Since you're obviously most interested in Linux and free software,
let's use the custom KVM Proxmox.
</p><p>
You can install KVM during the server set-up process on many Linux
distributions, particularly Debian-based flavors. These out-of-the-box
KVMs work well, but I found them a little too complicated for the Tiny
Internet Project. Installing KVM on an existing machine using
<tt  >apt</tt> or
<tt  >yum</tt> works, but it's not something a newcomer can do
easily.
</p><p>
By itself, KVM doesn't come with a GUI interface either&mdash;a shortcoming
that's fine for Linux experts, but not newbies. There will be plenty of
command-line work to do later, so I wanted an easy-to-use interface for KVM
management, preferably something browser-based. The tools I found,
such as WebVirtMgr (<a href="https://www.webvirtmgr.net" target="_self">https://www.webvirtmgr.net</a>), were workable, but again,
they were a little too complicated for a newbie to set up.
</p><p>
Proxmox works well because it includes the following:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
A fairly standard, if lightweight, Debian kernel.
</p></li><li><p>
An easy-to-use web interface.
</p></li><li><p>
A ready-made .iso that can be burned onto a USB or DVD.
</p></li><li><p>
Nice tools for managing clusters and storage.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Proxmox supports clustering, which lets you set up multiple VM host
machines. It also supports a variety of storage types, including local
and network-based drives.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x188f580.0x19885e8"></a>
Install Proxmox</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>1. Download the .iso and make a bootable
USB.</b></span>
If you've ever downloaded a Linux .iso and used it to create a
bootable USB or DVD, you can breeze through this step and go right to
the installation. If you're new to the process, you'll need a couple
tools. The Ubuntu website provides good instructions for Windows, Mac
and Linux users. (See Resources to learn
more about each.)
</p><p>
The DVD approach is doable, but it will take longer and it'll be a
little less flexible. I recommend using USB thumbdrives for creating
bootable OS installers, but sometimes an older system's BIOS may not
support booting from USB. In those cases, rather than banging your
head against a wall trying to get a raw system to start from USB, use
a DVD. If you're using a Mac, this may be the only way to get started;
support for USB booting on Apple hardware is a tutorial unto itself.
</p><p>
The .iso you want is the Proxmox Virtualization Environment (PVE). Using
your administration PC, download the latest version. (It was 4.1 at the
time of
this writing.) The file is less than 1GB and easily fits on a 2GB thumbdrive. Burn the .iso to a USB.
</p><p>
Use your administration PC and go to <a href="http://proxmox.com" target="_self">proxmox.com</a>, and download the
installer. 
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
2. Boot the Proxmox PVE installer.</b></span>
Remove the USB from your administration PC and use it to boot your
Proxmox machine.
</p><p>
The initial installation screen offers three choices. Select Install
Proxmox VE.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12046f3.large.jpg"><img src="12046f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Initial Proxmox Installation Screen
</p></div></div><p>
Next, choose the drive on which you want to install it. If your host
machine has more than one drive, you'll get choices here. Otherwise,
it will default to something like /dev/sda.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12046f4.large.jpg"><img src="12046f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Choose the Installation Drive
</p></div></div><p>
As with any OS install, this will wipe out everything you have on the
drive. Take your time and make sure to select the correct drive.
</p><p>
Set your location in the next screen before moving on to set up the
network, which includes the hostname (the name of the machine as it will
appear on your network and in DNS), the IP address, netmask, gateway
and DNS server. These won't be random; you'll need to give some thought
to your future network, your VMs and the address you're going to give
your DNS server.
</p><p>
For your private network, you'll be deploying between five and seven
machines that will need their own addresses and a domain name. I used
&ldquo;tiny.lab&rdquo; to avoid using a .com, .net, .org or any other public domain
extension that could cause problems. So, with this simple plan, you'll
be creating the following:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
The Proxmox host.
</p></li><li><p>
Two DNS servers.
</p></li><li><p>
One mail server.
</p></li><li><p>
One mirror.
</p></li><li><p>
Two or more web servers.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Given this schema, give the Proxmox host machine (pve in my example)
the first non-gateway address, and address the others, like so:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
pve &mdash; 10.128.1.2
</p></li><li><p>
dns01 &mdash; 10.128.1.3
</p></li><li><p>
dns02 &mdash; 10.128.1.4
</p></li><li><p>
mail &mdash; 10.128.1.5
</p></li><li><p>
mirror &mdash; 10.128.1.6
</p></li><li><p>
web01 &mdash; 10.128.1.7
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Therefore, for the Proxmox host, set the Network Configuration settings
to the following:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
hostname &mdash; pve.tiny.lab
</p></li><li><p>
IP Address &mdash; 10.128.1.2
</p></li><li><p>
Netmask &mdash; 255.255.255.0
</p></li><li><p>
Gateway &mdash; 10.128.1.1
</p></li><li><p>
DNS Server &mdash; 10.128.1.3
</p></li></ul></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12046f5.large.jpg"><img src="12046f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. Proxmox Network Configuration
</p></div></div><p>
If you're planning to deploy multiple Proxmox hosts and form a cluster,
I recommend reserving the lower range of your chosen subnet&mdash;which
is 10.128.1.1 to 10.128.1.255&mdash;so you can keep things logical. For
example, you could give pve01 10.128.1.2 and pve02 10.128.1.3, and then
start your DNS servers at 10.128.1.4.
</p><p>
Once you enter a password on the next screen, the installation will
begin. After about five minutes, you'll be prompted to reboot. The
initial boot screen looks like any Grub menu, and if all goes well,
you'll end up with a login screen and a welcome telling you where to
point your web browser:
https://10.128.1.2:8006.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12046f6.large.jpg"><img src="12046f6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. Proxmox is ready.
</p></div></div><p>
If you used a different IP address, that IP will appear instead. Later,
after you've set up your domain, you'll be able to access the server at
https://pve.tiny.lab:8006.
</p><p>
For now though, the IP is the only way in.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>3. Confirm network settings on your Proxmox
host.</b></span>
Unlike a typical Linux network setup, the Proxmox
host uses bridged ports. Where you'd typically see eth0 and eth1, on Proxmox you'll see vmbr0 and
vmbr1.
</p><p>
To get the two Proxmox host NICs to work properly, you'll need to edit
the network interfaces file. From the pve login screen, log in using the
user name &ldquo;root&rdquo; and the password you set during installation. Make a
copy of the interfaces file (for safekeeping), then edit the original:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# cd /etc/network/
# cp interfaces interfaces.bak
# vi interfaces
</pre>
</p><p>
When you first open the file, it'll look something like this: 

<pre     class="programlisting">
[
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

iface eth0 inet manual

iface eth1 inet manual
]
</pre>
</p><p>
This isn't going to work for your purposes. You need to set up a static
bridged address to eth0 and a static bridged address to eth1. First, set
the interface that will communicate with your private network (tiny.lab):

<pre     class="programlisting">
[
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

#iface eth0 inet manual (comment out or delete)

#iface eth1 inet manual (comment out or delete)

auto vmbr0
iface vmbr0 inet static
        address  10.128.1.2
        netmask  255.255.255.0
        dns-nameservers 10.128.1.3 10.128.1.4
        dns-search tiny.lab
        bridge_ports eth0
        bridge_stp off
        bridge_fd 0
]
</pre>
</p><p>
Note that the interface bridges to eth0, but eth0 itself is not configured
here. That's on purpose. Now, configure the second NIC to communicate
with your public network (the network in your house or classroom that
connects to the internet):

<pre     class="programlisting">
[
auto vmbr1
iface vmbr1 inet static
        address  192.168.1.75
        netmask  255.255.255.0
        gateway  192.168.1.1
        dns-nameservers 8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4
        bridge_ports eth1
        bridge_stp off
        bridge_fd 0
]
</pre>
</p><p>
A couple things to note here. The address&mdash;192.168.1.75&mdash;is any
free address on your public network. Don't pick this at random; make
sure the address is available.
</p><p>
Also note that there is no gateway address on the first interface. That's
because you can have just one gateway on a machine connected to multiple
networks. Also, the dns-nameservers are set to 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4,
Google's public nameservers. You can use these or the nameservers
provided from your ISP or school. Finally, note that this vmbr1 interface
bridges to eth1.
</p><p>
Save the file and reboot.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>4. Set up your private network devices.</b></span>
From this point forward, you'll do most of your work from your
administration PC, not the Proxmox host.
</p><p>
In order to connect other machines to your Proxmox host, you'll need
to place your Proxmox server and your administration PC on the same
network. That requires a network switch or router.
</p><p>
If you're using a router, preferably one with wireless capabilities,
you can set it up with a base LAN address of 10.128.1.1. That will become
its gateway address (even though you won't use it for that). If your
router includes a DHCP server (most do), the device will 
hand out IP addresses to all the computers you attach to your tiny
internet network automatically.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12046f7.large.jpg"><img src="12046f7.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 7. Router Setup
</p></div></div><p>
In your router, leave the WAN settings empty or disabled. Just set the
following for the LAN:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
IP address (10.128.1.1)
</p></li><li><p>
Netmask (255.255.255.0)
</p></li><li><p>
Turn on DHCP
</p></li><li><p>
Configure wireless security
</p></li></ul></div><p>
If you're using a &ldquo;dumb&rdquo; switch (one that is unmanaged), you'll need to
set up a static IP address on your administration PC before it can join
your private network. The switch won't hand out DHCP addresses on the
private network, so you have to set one manually. Later, you can deploy
a DHCP server, but for now, static is easy.
</p><p>
Be sure to give your administration PC a static address beyond the
range of your server addresses, perhaps starting at 10.128.1.25 or even
10.128.1.50. The basic static-IP configuration should look something
like this:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
IP address &mdash; 10.128.1.25
</p></li><li><p>
Netmask &mdash; 255.255.255.0
</p></li><li><p>
DNS servers &mdash; 10.128.1.3, 10.128.1.4
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Again, gateway is purposely left out. In this case, your administration
PC's gateway already is set to your home or school network (something like
192.168.1.1). That gateway address enables you to get to destinations
on the internet. Your private-network machines won't need a gateway to
talk to each other.
</p><p>
If your administration PC has an Ethernet port and wireless, use the wired
port to connect to the public network (192.168.1.1, in this example). Use
the wireless to connect to your tiny internet (10.128.1.x). That way,
you'll have simultaneous access to both the public internet and your
private tiny internet.
</p><p>
It's important to note that connecting a single computer to two separate
networks can be very quirky. Fortunately, Windows 7, Mac OS X and most
modern flavors of desktop Linux auto-negotiate network connections. In
Linux, Network Manager (network-manager) can handle dual networks, but
it can give routing priority to the wired connection. That means you
should connect your internet-capable network to the wired port and use
wireless to connect to your private network. In Linux Mint, I found that
the opposite configuration will make web browsing slow because the system
is trying to reach the internet via the wired private network first. If
you must connect this way, set metrics in /etc/network/interfaces. (See
Resources.)
</p><p>
Be aware that you may have to reboot your administration PC to get the
network settings to take hold. Do that before proceeding.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>5. Log in to the Proxmox GUI.</b></span>
Now that the PVE host is up and running, and both it and your
administration PC can communicate with each other via your router (or
switch), you're ready to get down to business. On your administration PC,
point a browser to the address the Proxmox host offered you:
https://10.128.1.2:8006.
Enter the root user name and your password.
</p><p>
Once you click OK to dismiss the &ldquo;No valid subscription
warning&rdquo;, you'll
see the main view, split into a server-manager column on the left and
the main information panel on the right. The panel at the bottom gives
real-time updates on actions you take, such as starting or stopping
a server.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12046f8.large.jpg"><img src="12046f8.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 8. Proxmox Main View
</p></div></div><p>
If you named your Proxmox host &ldquo;pve&rdquo;, the server listed when you expand
the Datacenter folder will be &ldquo;pve&rdquo;. Below it is listed the local storage,
which is named &ldquo;local&rdquo;.
</p><p>
Explore the various tabs and become familiar with the interface. Much of
it is self-explanatory.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>6. Deploy your first server.</b></span>
You're now ready to deploy your first virtual machine. Before you do,
decide whether you want to deploy a cluster by adding one or more Proxmox
servers to your setup. If you do, you must add the second PVE host now
before adding any VMs. Otherwise, if you later decide to add more PVE
hosts, you'll have to delete all the virtual machines you created and
basically start over.
</p><p>
Proxmox has some freely available templates for everything from
CentOS 7, Ubuntu 15.04, Debian 7, a LAMP stack and WordPress. If your
Proxmox server has access to the internet&mdash;either directly or via a
proxy server&mdash;you can download and install these by clicking on
&ldquo;local&rdquo;
(your storage drive), and then choosing the Content tab and Templates.
</p><p>
For now, however, you're going to deploy your own virtual machine from
scratch by downloading the latest .iso of Ubuntu (or whatever flavor
Linux you like) and building a VM from it.
</p><p>
Using your administration PC, download the Ubuntu
14.04.3-server-amd64.iso. This is the long-term release of the server
version of Ubuntu, which you'll run without a GUI desktop. The .iso file
is just more than 600MB.
</p><p>
To build a VM from this .iso, you'll need to upload it to your Proxmox
server.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12046f9.large.jpg"><img src="12046f9.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 9. Uploading the .iso
</p></div></div><p>
In the main PVE browser view, open Datacenter and your machine (pve)
and click on the &ldquo;local&rdquo; storage icon. In the right-hand pane, click the
Content tab and the Upload button. In the pop-up window, browse for the
.iso file you just downloaded. Click OK to begin the upload.
</p><p>
When the upload is complete, you should see the file listed under the
ISO Image list on the Content tab page. You're now ready to deploy it.

In the top right of the main Proxmox browser view, click the Create VM
button. In the modal window that opens, Node will be filled in with the
name of your Proxmox host (&ldquo;pve&rdquo;), and the VM ID will be set to 100. Each
future VM will auto-increment from there. Enter a Name, such as
&ldquo;ubuntu&rdquo;,
and click the Next button or the next tab.

Select the OS type&mdash;Linux 4.x/3.x/2.x Kernel (I26). Click Next and
make sure the &ldquo;Use CD/DVD disc image file (iso)&rdquo; radio button is chosen,
select the storage drive (&ldquo;local&rdquo;), and use the &ldquo;ISO
Image&rdquo; drop-down to
choose the .iso you uploaded. Click Next.

The hard disk settings are fine as is. Note that you'll be creating
a 32GB drive on the &ldquo;local&rdquo; drive. That will be plenty for all the
machines you create, except the mirror server, which will be more like
200GB. Click Next.
</p><p>
Depending on how many CPUs and cores your machine has, you'll be able
to add more than one &ldquo;Socket&rdquo; and more than one
&ldquo;Cores&rdquo;. Your Ubuntu
servers will run fine with a single CPU, so leave the defaults (1 socket,
1 core, Default kvm64 Type), and click Next.
</p><p>
With memory, like CPU, your settings can vary based on how much memory
your system has. I assume you don't have much, and I've tested various
configurations and found that setting a range works best. Click the
radio button next to &ldquo;Automatically allocate memory within this
range&rdquo;,
and set the Maximum value to 1024 and the Minimum value to 512. The
virtual machine will use only the memory it needs, which typically
will be much less than 512MB, but it automatically can use as much as 1GB
if necessary. Click Next.
</p><p>
For networking, select Bridged mode and Bridge vmbr0. Click the box next
to Firewall and leave all the other settings as defaults. Click Next to
review a summary of your choices. When you click Confirm, Proxmox will
create the virtual machine. When it's done, you'll see a new icon in
the left-hand pane of the main view.

To start the new VM, either right-click on it and choose
&ldquo;Start&rdquo; or
left-click it once and choose Start from the menu located above the tabs
in the right pane. As it starts up, you'll see the content of the Summary
tab change. Right-click the machine and choose &ldquo;Console&rdquo; from this list
(or from the menu above the tabs). A new browser window will open (check
to make sure you're not blocking pop-ups on the site), and you'll see
the Ubuntu start-up screen. You're ready to start deploying VMs!
