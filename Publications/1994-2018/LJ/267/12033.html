It's a Windows world at your favorite radio station, but in DC, Linux is
coming on strong.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xca4580.0xd9c2a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
You would have a difficult time today finding a radio station that
was all-live and did not have some kind of computerized, automated means of
storing and playing audio. 
</p><p>
In a bygone era, hands-on media management of records and tape
cartridges (&ldquo;carts&rdquo;) was the way of the world. Through the years,
turntables, CD players and &ldquo;cart decks&rdquo; gave way to mechanized
playback of content by banks of reel-to-reel machines under crude sequential
control. The earliest fully computerized &ldquo;audio on hard drive&rdquo;
systems for radio stations and networks ran generally under DOS, evolving
into the elaborate Windows-based systems in use everywhere today. 
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xca4580.0xd9c5c0"></a>
So What about Linux?</h2></div></div><p>
Do a web search for &ldquo;Linux radio station&rdquo;, and the pickings
are slim indeed, with most sites promoting instead ham radio software or
streaming audio players, and a handful devoted to setting up a streaming web
radio station&mdash;including one such optimistic article in <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span> some 15 years ago (see &ldquo;Running a Net Radio Station
with Open-Source Software&rdquo;, January 2001:
<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/4397" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/4397</a>).
</p><p>
Unfortunately, much of this documented interest took place a decade
or more in the past via domains like opensourceradio.com that are no
longer with us. A few projects persevere, but a good number of postings are
similarly dated. The fact is, there are more Linux-based ways to stream and
listen to radio stations than there actually are the means to broadcast and
control them.
</p><p>
Fortunately, the choices today are getting better. Transmitter
manufacturer Nautel incorporates Linux in its AUI. Broadcast automation and
media management systems, such as Airtime and DIY-DJ, were designed around
Linux from the start. Many Windows-based commercial automation systems seem
happy when networked with Linux servers. But, as for in-studio hands-on
control of program execution, there still is a way to go.

Off to Washington</h2></div></div><p>
In and around the nation's capital, actual over-the-air radio
programming driven by Penguin power is a reality, and you already may be
listening to it wherever you are.
</p><p>
Back around 2002, Fred Gleason, then the director of engineering for the
Salem Communications radio cluster in Arlington, Virginia, saw the need for an
open-source radio automation system: one that was nimble enough to handle
the turn-on-a-dime demands of radio station programming, flexible enough to
be modified and rewritten as the demands on it grew, and as crash-proof
as possible to keep the music flowing and the commercials rolling. Working
with partner and automation expert Scott Spillers, the two planted the
seeds for what became the Rivendell radio automation suite. Rivendell is
now under the banner of Paravel Systems, with Gleason as President and
Chief Developer, and co-founder Spillers holding the VP reins. The company
offers Rivendell as custom-built turnkey hardware, with a free software
version as a downloadable iso file.
</p><p>
Rivendell originally was crafted for SUSE Linux but now runs under
CentOS. It is an artistic mix of custom code and popular existing libraries
and applications. Gleason used the Qt Toolkit to create the user interface,
allowing it to run on anything right down to a Raspberry Pi; MySQL to
maintain and manage the audio database; the Apache Web Server, ID3Lib, a
couple CD rippers and the X11 Window System, among its many components.
</p><p>
Gleason's handcrafted code includes the GlassSuite collection of
audio tools for Icecast and HTTP Live Streaming (HLS), and what he calls
&ldquo;a slew of code&rdquo; to perform audio format conversions whenever new
audio is imported into the station's audio library. Early in the development
of Rivendell, SOX handled the format conversion, but Gleason noticed a
slowdown due to &ldquo;limited process control with the multi-stage command
pipeline. This was before SOX had its library interface.&rdquo; His code
performs the format conversions natively, without any shell outs.
</p><p>
Today, there are three major broadcast operations based in Washington,
DC, that employ Rivendell&mdash;Radio America Network, Salem Communications
DC and Radio Free Asia&mdash;with listeners everywhere in both Eastern and
Western hemispheres. This is not to say that Rivendell is available only to
major players. Many smaller users have come to depend on Rivendell as well.
High school educational radio station WKHS-FM in Worton, Maryland, has been a
Rivendell user since 2012, opting for a 32-bit Ubuntu-based appliance distro
called RRABUNTU. A recent count showed more than 40 US AM and FM
radio stations with a Rivendell installation in operation. A dozen miles
south of DC, &ldquo;Rolling Valley Radio&rdquo;, a low-power license-free
community station uses the 64-bit CentOS version to broadcast its short-range
signal to a small enclave of four or five suburban blocks.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xca4580.0xd9ccf8"></a>
Behind the Scenes</h2></div></div><p>
The Radio America Network in Arlington, Virginia, is a creator,
distributor and syndicator of national radio programming, including
conservative talkers Dana Loesch and Chad Benson. A stroll through the
bullpen reveals a somewhat non-conservative and very creative attitude: a
disco mirror ball hangs from the ceiling of a video production suite.
Ukuleles are available for strumming while audio mixdowns are rendering.
Coffee urns are labeled &ldquo;Folger's&rdquo; and &ldquo;Creosote&rdquo;, and every
Friday is Hawaiian Shirt Day.
</p><p>
But on the air, it's all business. The network runs 24/7, delivering
programming via satellite to affiliates from Guam to the tip of Maine. With
hundreds of thousands of listeners across the US, dependability and
stability are critical and downtime is not an option. So with the exception
of a dozen or so Windows office machines and a quartet of Mac video editors,
the plant is populated by CentOS desktops, in-house-built servers and
Rivendell automation computers in five studios. The network also streams its
programming over the internet using Glasscoder and logs every minute of
broadcast audio around the clock on a Linux computer nicknamed
&ldquo;Delorean&rdquo;.
</p><p>
Not being locked in to a single commercial system allows for a lot of
flexibility. For instance, in studios that use more than one computer, actual
physical desktop space is at a premium. Synergy software is used across all
machines: one keyboard and one mouse move seamlessly across the screens and
leapfrog from one computer to the next. And for assistant engineers and
technicians lacking mad command-line skills but who need to tend to the
system, Webmin is in use on several computers.
</p><p>
Some staffers experiment on their own. Show producers in the bullpen
employ Linux desktop computers running Audacity audio software to collect and
clean up sound bites for various talk hosts. The same hosts surf the web and
manage their call-screening software during their shows on CentOS machines.
The network's production director favors UbuntuStudio on an older laptop,
using Ardour to do preliminary mixes on several prerecorded weekend lifestyle
shows (Figure 1). And engineers recently have begun exploring LinPhone
as a replacement for Skype and ISDN as a two-way studio link with hosts at
remote locations.

ten-year-old Toshiba laptop.
</p></div></div><p>
Radio America adopted Rivendell sometime around 2005 and has served
as a proving ground for subsequent upgrades and improvements. It is a classic
example of Linux radio automation working, and it's working well.
</p><p>
Operations Director Rich McFadden, a former user of numerous radio
automation systems, said &ldquo;Rivendell&mdash;and Linux&mdash;gives us the
most stable environment to stay on the air without interruption.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Across the Potomac River from the nation's capital in Rosslyn, Virginia,
the Washington DC cluster of Salem Communications&mdash;WAVA-FM, WAVA(AM)
and WWRC(AM)&mdash;also is driven by Linux and Rivendell. The Salem cluster
recently closed up its old facility (on the air since 1996) and moved to all-new studios and offices, with Rivendell tied in closely to its new complement
of Axia digital audio consoles and engines. The software commands the
consoles to perform specific functions and automatically reroute audio to
different destinations, and because of its open-source nature, can be changed
and rewritten at almost anytime. Director of programming Chris Roth noted
that &ldquo;It interfaces very well with our Axia/Livewire [digital broadcast
consoles], which makes our operation run very smoothly.&rdquo; The master
control console shown in Figure 2 handles three stations and the Sirius XM
channel programmed by Salem.

Other Possibilities</h2></div></div><p>
On-air execution is not the only opportunity for Linux&mdash;and open-source
software in general&mdash;to shine in radio broadcast operations. Both
the LibreOffice and Apache OpenOffice suites have replaced or augmented
Microsoft Office when cost containment becomes an issue. Creative DJs who
spin and mix multiple songs into sonic tapestries are exploring MIXXX, a free
music performance tool that rivals commercial DJ applications. An
Icecast-compatible encoder with the memorable name B.U.T.T. (Broadcast Using
This Tool) has found many a home, including the college webcasting station
E-Radio WMCR based at Montgomery College in Maryland.
</p><p>
With most US radio stations owned by large corporations&mdash;several hundred
each at a time&mdash;it is likely the dependence on
Windows-type computer systems for radio broadcast will persist, given the
need for large and fast equipment deployments, compatibility with other
systems and familiarity of operation. Fortunately, the Linux alternative
exists, and although it may not enjoy the exposure and popularity that Win-based
broadcast products do, it is out there and being embraced by those who are
looking for stability, versatility and affordability.
</p><p>
DC today. Tomorrow, who knows?
