<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #267, July 2016</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Stephan M&uuml;eller</b></span> has been working on updating the code that implements
<span   class="bold"><b>/dev/random</b></span>. As new technology has become
popular, such as solid-state
drives, fully virtualized systems and highly parallelized systems,
the ability to find enough entropy to produce truly random numbers has
declined.
</p><p>
Good random number generation is crucial on modern systems in an era
where security exploits are commonplace and governments throughout
the world often are the ones wearing the black hats. It's also
important for the Linux kernel to guarantee a sufficient source of
random numbers on all systems, regardless of any particular hardware
configuration. This can prove complex to implement, as the kind of
entropy available on a given system is often related to the kind of
hardware available to it.
</p><p>
Stephan implemented <span   class="bold"><b>LRNG</b></span> (Linux Random Number Generator) to address
the existing problems associated with /dev/random. The big goals were
to provide a good source of entropy even during boot-up and to reduce
entropy-related slowdowns on parallelized systems, where security
measures must be implemented across the full set of CPUs, whether
physical or virtual.
</p><p>
There were a number of objections to Stephan's code, none of which are
likely to keep it out of the kernel. The reason is that the old
mechanism for generating random numbers is out of date, so any
incremental improvement will be better than the status quo. Also, LRNG
is intended to exist side by side with /dev/random for the present, so
no features will be overtly lost.
</p><p>
But, for example, <span   class="bold"><b>Theodore Ts'o</b></span> objected that some of Stephan's
entropy sources weren't providing true entropy and should be removed
from the calculation. Stephan was happy to comply.
</p><p>
Another objection was that <span   class="bold"><b>glibc</b></span> might not
export the <span   class="bold"><b>getrandom()</b></span>
system call, as it was a Linux-specific call and wouldn't exist on
operating systems like the <span   class="bold"><b>Hurd</b></span>. In which case, Ted said, there might
have to be a special <span   class="bold"><b>liblinux</b></span> library alongside glibc, that could
catch all the Linux-specific entries.
</p><p>
Just as an aside, it's so cool that glibc is taking account of
projects like the Hurd and other operating systems. Now that Linux
runs the world (seriously&mdash;it does), it would be tempting for glibc
and other projects to cater only to Linux. But no! We still see
similar struggles as were going on in 1995 and thereabouts. It's like
the perennial <span   class="bold"><b>C compiler</b></span> debate: &ldquo;The
compiler should produce <span   class="emphasis"><em>this</em></span>
machine code!&rdquo; &ldquo;No, the kernel should use
<span   class="emphasis"><em>this</em></span> source construction!&rdquo;
&ldquo;That source construction sucks! It doesn't work with other
compilers!&rdquo; &ldquo;<span   class="emphasis"><em>What</em></span> other compilers! If it's
a problem, use #ifdef!&rdquo;
&ldquo;We're trying to get <span   class="emphasis"><em>away</em></span> from #ifdefs, not pepper the code with
them!&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, la dee da!&rdquo; &ldquo;La dee da
yourself!&rdquo; And so on.
</p><p>
A prime attack vector against any operating system is the concept of
knowing where in RAM a particular data structure or code sequence
resided. It won't necessarily give you a full security exploit on its
own, but it can combine with other security holes to trick a system
into thinking it's doing something secure, when really control has
been handed over to Dr. Evil.
</p><p>
The solution is to make sure that no one ever can tell what's in a
given portion of <span   class="bold"><b>RAM</b></span>. But, that's tricky. The kernel itself has to know
where everything is, so there has to be some rhyme and reason to
the RAM layout, but it has to be a rhyme and reason that user code
can't figure out.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Thomas Garnier</b></span> recently came out with
<span   class="bold"><b>ASLR</b></span> (Address Space Layout
Randomization) for <span   class="bold"><b>x86-64</b></span> systems. It's essentially an enhancement to
security features that have been in the kernel since 2005.
Security-centric Linux distributions have been rolling their own
enhancement patches for a while now, and Thomas wanted to bring that
level of security to the official kernel.
</p><p>
No one had any major objections, so it looks like the code will go
forward into the official tree. This won't eliminate security problems
on Linux, but it'll greatly strengthen Linux's defenses against
certain attack vectors.
</p><p>
These are rough days for Linux security. Linux essentially runs
everything in the whole world except consumer desktops. It's a huge
target. All the nations of the world are engaged in massive amounts of
cyber warfare against each other and in some cases against their own
citizens. Nongovernmental hactivist groups also derive a significant
portion of their power and voice from Linux security exploits. And, the
entire corpus of source code is freely available for everyone to pore
over in search of the elusive zero-day exploit.

<h2 class="title">Android Candy: Waze Redux</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #267, July 2016</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Back in 2014, I highlighted Waze, which is a turn-by-turn GPS navigation
program created by a startup in Israel. That company was bought by Google,
but it still remains independent, at least for now. (It does share some data
behind the scenes, but it functions differently when it comes to routing.)
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="12037androidf1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
(Image from <a href="https://www.waze.com" target="_self">https://www.waze.com</a>)
</p></div></div><p>
Although I had very bad luck with Waze early on, I recently used it on a
cross-country trip, and it was amazing. I still have unpleasant memories
of Waze trying to force me to turn off an overpass and having it rout me
to an off-ramp only to get back on the on-ramp immediately. I'm happy to
say, however, those issues seem to be resolved. In fact, it was a very
pleasant experience!
</p><p>
Not only was the navigation reliable (and murder-free), but it has a
unique way of saving time by taking less-traveled routes. Last year when
I was driving through Atlanta, Georgia, I got stuck in traffic for hours
using my Garmin GPS. This year, Waze took me into corn fields in order
to avoid traffic jams in Nashville. I'll admit, I was a bit worried when
GPS advised me to turn on a poorly maintained country road, but in the
end, it saved me hours of monotonous city traffic.
</p><p>
The TL;DR truth is, Waze has gotten to the point where it's now my
favorite GPS app. Plus, if your passenger is bored, it's fun to report
speed traps and hazards on the road. All that input makes for better
driving, which makes family vacations far more enjoyable! Check it out
in the Google Play store today. Waze is still free, and you'd be silly
not to give it a test drive.

<h2 class="title">Non-Linux FOSS: Scripts in Your Menu Bar!</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #267, July 2016</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
There are hundreds of applications for OS X that place information in the
menu bar. Usually, I can find one that almost does what I want, but not
quite. Thankfully I found BitBar, which is an open-source project that
allows you to write scripts and have their output refreshed and put on
the menu bar.
</p><p>
I personally use it to fetch Bitcoin and Ethereum prices, but because
you're limited only by what you can get Bash to output, it's extremely
flexible. Even the method by which you change update frequency is
elegant. By adding a refresh rate to the name of your script, the
program refreshes only as often as you desire. You can see an example
of my Bitcoin price-fetching script in the screenshot (Figure 1). Also notice the
file format for my additional scripts (Figure 2).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="12037fossf1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

Figure 2. File Format for Additional Scripts
</p></div></div><p>
If you head over to <a href="http://getbitbar.com" target="_self">getbitbar.com</a>, you can
download the binary or the source code. There is also a huge library
of user-contributed scripts so you don't have to start from scratch. My
Bitcoin script is actually from this repository, and I based my other
scripts off that. Whether you want to pull text from an API like me or
possibly <tt  >grep</tt> the temperature from a weather page, BitBar is simple and
elegant at the same time. In fact, BitBar is so useful and well designed,
we're giving it the Editors' Choice award for this month.

<h2 class="title">Stepping into Science</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Joey Bernard</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #267, July 2016</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
In past articles, I've looked at several libraries or specialist
applications that can be used to model some physical process or
another. Sometimes though you want to be able to model several different
processes at the same time and in an interactive mode. This is especially
helpful in educational situations where you are trying to learn how those
processes work. 
So in this article, I introduce an application named
Step from the Edu section of the KDE Project (<a href="https://edu.kde.org/step" target="_self">https://edu.kde.org/step</a>). 
</p><p>
The one major limitation
is that the simulation runs only in two dimensions. Aside from that,
you can model almost any system you can imagine. You can create discrete
systems that are made of particles connected either with rigid rods or
springs. You can apply external gravitational or electrical forces to
your system. There is a molecular dynamics portion that allows you to
model gases and liquids, including condensation and evaporation, and there
is support for units and error values in your numbers. Several
solvers are available to handle the actual calculations, so you should be
able to find one that is best for your particular application. 
</p><p>
To install
Step, you should have a package available within your distribution's
package management system. For example, with Debian-based distributions,
you can install Step with this command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo apt-get install step
</pre>
</p><p>
One thing to be aware of is that Step is part of the KDE Project. So,
if you install it on a different desktop environment, such as GNOME
or Unity, you also will need to install a large number of KDE support
libraries. It will run fine on other desktop environments, so you don't
actually need to run KDE.
</p><p>
To start Step, you either can find it within your desktop's menu system
or open a terminal window and run the <tt  >step</tt> command. When
it starts up, you'll get a new, empty project in which to build your
simulation.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12037stepf1.large.jpg"><img src="12037stepf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. When you start Step, you get a new blank project to start
your simulation.
</p></div></div><p>
In the center of your window is the main
pane where your system of particles and forces is displayed. On the
left-hand side is a palette of elements you can use to build the
system you want to model. On the right-hand side, you can see a series of
panes that give information about the system as a whole, along with
details about specific selected elements. 
</p><p>
It might be rather daunting to look
at all of this functionality and have to start with a completely blank
canvas. Luckily, Step comes with a number of tutorials to walk you through
the first steps of building and simulating systems within Step. You can
access them by clicking the menu item File&rarr;Open Tutorial. This pops
up a dialog window where you can select and load one of the five provided
tutorials. When you select one, you get a system of elements along with
a description of activities that you can follow along with
to help you learn a bit more about each of Step's sections.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12037stepf2.large.jpg"><img src="12037stepf2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Step comes with a set of tutorials to walk you through
some of the available functionality.
</p></div></div><p>
When you want to move on to developing your own models, several
example projects are available that cover a large number of physical systems. You
can access them from the File&rarr;Examples&rarr;Open
Example menu item. This will pop open a dialog where you can select and load
systems, such as the double pendulum model. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12037stepf3.large.jpg"><img src="12037stepf3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Step comes with a number of example projects, such as the
double pendulum.
</p></div></div><p>
These examples
provide a starting point that you can alter to create your own
model. In order to make changes, you either can select the element
in question within the main pane or you can select from the top pane on
the right-hand side. Either of these steps will populate the middle pane
on the right-hand side with the details for that element. Then you can go
ahead and make your alterations. For example, for a particle, you can
change the position, velocity or mass. Once you have your own system
built, you can save it as a Step file by clicking File&rarr;Save As.
</p><p>
All I've described to this point is setting up the model of the physical
system. I've yet to cover any simulating of the physical processes. To
start the simulation, click on the Simulate button at
the top of the window (just below the menu bar). You should notice
a button next to that (with a down arrow on it) that lets you set
the speed of the simulation. This lets you see your system in motion,
which can be very illuminating in trying to understand how your system
will behave. 
</p><p>
Sometimes, however, this isn't good enough. You may need
to have numbers tracking what various elements are doing within the
simulation. Luckily, Step provides three measurement objects: meters,
graphs and tracers. As an example, let's add a meter to monitor the
speed of the first particle in the double pendulum example. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12037stepf4.large.jpg"><img src="12037stepf4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. You can add elements, like meters, to track the behavior
of elements in your simulation.
</p></div></div><p>
Start by clicking the meter option in the object palette. Step
then asks you to select where this meter will be displayed. Once
it's created, you still need to configure it so that it's monitoring
a certain property of some object. You either can right-click on the meter
and select Configure meter, or you can select the meter object
from the top pane on the right-hand side. 
</p><p>
In the example given in the
screenshot, I chose the velocity of the particle1 object. When you
first do this, you may notice that the meter isn't actually displaying
anything. Don't forget that you also need to select the index of the
property. In this case, you would need to change it from the default of
0 to 1. 
</p><p>
Once you start creating your own systems, you may decide that
the default solver isn't appropriate. Each solver is better or worse,
depending on the details and constraints for your system. The details of
the numerical analysis involved are too much to cover for such a short article,
but you should know that you do have some control over this. You can
select the solver1 object from the top pane on the right-hand side. The
middle properties pane lets you select the solver type from among the
16 available solvers. You should be able to select one, along with its
other properties, that is appropriate for your simulation.
</p><p>
I've covered only the most basic elements
available within Step here, but hopefully you've seen enough to spark your
interest in playing with it further&mdash;especially if you need a good tool
to teach these types of physical processes to your students. They'll
get a much more intuitive feel for them when they can play with the
relevant parameters and see what effects they have.

<h2 class="title">Message for You, Sir!</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #267, July 2016</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
In my Open-Source Classroom column in the May 2016 issue, I discussed how to set up Gmail as your SMTP provider for
outgoing email. The problem with email is that sometimes the sheer
quantity of it makes important messages slip past my radar. So for really
important error messages, I like to get SMS messages. Thankfully, I get
several orders of magnitude fewer text messages than I do email messages. That
means if a text comes, I almost always notice, and I always check it.
(&ldquo;Inbox
Zero&rdquo; is far more attainable with my SMS inbox!)
</p><p>
Most providers have an email gateway for sending text messages, but
figuring out what format to use for what number is frustrating. I prefer
a simple way to add a one-liner into a script that will send a text
message. Thankfully, Ian Webster provides TextBelt free of charge! You
can download the source code and host it yourself if you prefer, but Ian
graciously offers a running instance of TextBelt that is free as in beer
and free as in speech to use. To send a text, simply use
<tt  >curl</tt>:

<pre     class="programlisting">
curl -X POST http://textbelt.com/text -d number=5551234567 -d 
 &#8618;'message=Warning! Your server is on fire! Also, 
 &#8618;you are out of milk.'
</pre>
</p><p>
The code above will send a text message to any of the major carriers in
the US. You'll get a response on the command line showing either success
or failure. There's also an international gateway that is available;
see <a href="http://textbelt.com" target="_self">textbelt.com</a> for more information.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12037textf1.large.jpg"><img src="12037textf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
Note: there are a still a few goofy carriers. My Android phone
is on Cricket Wireless, and although I do get a success message, the text
never arrives. I suspect this is because Cricket recently changed its
email gateway; hopefully the TextBelt code will be updated shortly. The
moral of the story is, test first before relying on the service to work!

<h2 class="title">A Better Raspberry Pi Streaming Solution</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #267, July 2016</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
In last month's issue (June 2016), I described my Raspberry Pi outdoor camera
build. Since then,
however, I've discovered a different way to stream video from
it. Although capturing images with &ldquo;raspistill&rdquo; and serving them out via
Web server is perfectly fine, I'd prefer to have an actual video stream
coming from the little RPi. Thankfully, there's UV4L.
</p><p>
I had to add a line to my sources.list file in order to download the
software, but it was well worth it. Add this to your /etc/sources.list
file:

<pre     class="programlisting">
deb http://www.linux-projects.org/listing/uv4l_repo/raspbian/ 
 &#8618;wheezy main
</pre>
</p><p>
And then you'll need to add the key:

<pre     class="programlisting">
curl http://www.linux-projects.org/listing/uv4l_repo/lrkey.asc 
 &#8618;| sudo apt-key add -
</pre>
</p><p>
Once that is done, simply install the program:

<pre     class="programlisting">

sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get install uv4l uv4l-raspicam \
uv4l-raspicam-extras uv4l-server uv4l-uvc uv4l-xscreen \
uv4l-mjpegstream uv4l-dummy

</pre>
</p><p>
And finally, you can add a line like this to your crontab that will turn
your RPi into a streaming IP camera! These are just the settings I use;
check out the man pages for your options:

<pre     class="programlisting">
@reboot /usr/bin/uv4l -nopreview --auto-video_nr --driver 
 &#8618;raspicam --encoding jpeg --quality 90 --metering matrix 
 &#8618;--drc low --width 1280 --height 720 --framerate 10 
 &#8618;--server-option '--port=9090' --server-option 
 &#8618;'--max-queued-connections=10' --server-option 
 &#8618;'--max-streams=5' --server-option '--max-threads=15'
</pre>
</p><p>
Browse to <a href="http://raspberry.pi.ipaddress:9090" target="_self">raspberry.pi.ipaddress:9090</a> to see the
various things UV4L provides.
