Cross-platform never looked so Flashy.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1283580.0x137b300"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Most Linux users are intimately familiar with programs that are similar
to their commercial counterparts, but not quite the same. There isn't
anything wrong with clone applications, but if programs were inherently
usable, regardless of the underlying operating system, fewer programmers
would have to re-invent the wheel over and over again.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1283580.0x137b4b8"></a>
Cross-Platform Apps, a Great Concept</h2></div></div><p>
One real hope for Linux users is the idea of cross-platform applications.
It's not a new concept, but we're beginning to see some huge leaps in
the ability for Linux users to use the same applications that Windows
and OS X users use&mdash;not just clones, but the same actual
apps.
</p><p>
Java, for instance, is a great way to make the underlying operating system
unimportant. One really huge stumbling block with Java programs,
however, is that packaging them for the different computer systems is
very difficult. Sure, you can download a JAR file, but that does the
average user little good. It takes effort to make installers for each
platform you want to support. Java also has a reputation for poor
performance. Before any Java developers form a lynch mob and hunt me
down with pitchforks, note that I said it has a
<span   class="emphasis"><em>reputation</em></span> for
poor performance. At one time it was true, but in most cases, these days
Java programs perform quite well. However, fair or not, the general opinion
regarding Java programs to date is that they are slow and cumbersome.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1283580.0x137b6c8"></a>
On the Web, Computers Become Irrelevant</h2></div></div><p>
Web-based applications recently have become the most prevalent way
to provide equal access for everyone. Whether you call it Web 2.0,
advanced JavaScripting or just the availability of a more diverse set
of Web programming frameworks, the Web currently is a hotbed of new
platform-agnostic programs. That trend isn't going away any time soon,
but there are a few problems that are tough to solve with on-line apps.
For one, relying on the Web browser to handle multiple applications puts all
of your eggs in one basket. If the Web browser itself crashes, so does
every one of your running programs. An even bigger problem is that if
the Internet itself isn't accessible, neither is the Web-based program.
</p><p>
Several potential solutions exist to solve the &ldquo;unconnected&rdquo; problem
regarding Web apps. Google, for instance, continues to develop its
Gears infrastructure that allows people to use Web applications when in
off-line mode. The concept, whether implemented by Google or someone else,
will make Web applications more viable as desktop program alternatives.
Unfortunately, it still tethers us to a Web browser. Projects like Prism
can allow for separate instances of Web applications, but regardless
of what browser is used, the apps still require the browser in order
to function.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1283580.0x137b880"></a>
Enter: AIR</h2></div></div><p>
Adobe has taken its long history of Flash on the Web and given
developers the ability to create standalone applications that don't depend
on a Web browser at all. I know that many <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span> readers
just rolled their eyes at the mention of Flash technology under Linux,
but to be fair to Adobe, it has put more serious effort in its Linux
ports recently than ever before. The mere fact that the same version
of Flash is available for Linux as is available for Windows proves that Adobe
is taking our favorite operating system more seriously.
</p><p>
So, what makes AIR unique? Several things:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Applications look and function the same, regardless of the operating
system.
</p></li><li><p>
Developers do not need to package AIR apps separately. One package
installs identically on any platform.
</p></li><li><p>
AIR applications, along with the AIR environment itself, can be installed
directly from a Web link inside a Web browser (assuming a recent version
of Flash is installed on the computer).
</p></li><li><p>
Applications are standalone and don't require a browser. One AIR
app doesn't affect other apps if it crashes.
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1283580.0x137bd50"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Equal-Opportunity Adobe?</b></p><p>
Although the initial development of Adobe's AIR for the Linux platform has
been behind its Windows and Macintosh counterparts, Adobe promises
future releases all will come out at the same time for all three platforms.
I contacted Rob Christensen, Adobe AIR Senior Product Manager, and he
confirmed that future releases are planned to come out simultaneously.
</p><p>
At the time of this writing, that means while AIR 1.5 is available
for Windows and OS X, the latest version for Linux is 1.1 Beta.
The unfortunate side effect of the different versioning is that many
of the newest (read: coolest) AIR applications don't run under Linux,
because they require the 1.5 runtime environment. In fact, due to the
&ldquo;beta&rdquo; aspect of the Linux port, some apps designed to work with version
1.1 don't even function properly.
</p><p>
Hopefully, Adobe will remain true to its promise, so AIR apps work
everywhere, all the time, regardless of the underlying OS. I'm hopeful,
especially after seeing the recent timely releases of Adobe Flash.
</p></div><p>
One of the best things about AIR applications is that they tend to look
aesthetically pleasing. Let's look at a few from Adobe's AIR Marketplace.
I specifically focus on those that work under Linux now, and a
couple that I hope work by the time you read this article.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1283580.0x137c118"></a>
Twhirl</h2></div></div><p>
Twhirl is one of the dozens of Twitter clients available.
Many people find Twitter's Web interface much less useful than using a
dedicated client. I'm in that boat. Twhirl has lots of seemingly simple
features that make it a great way to interface with the Twitter universe.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10356f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Twhirl is a Twitter microblogging client.
</p></div></div><p>
Many users prefer another AIR-based Twitter app, known
as TweetDeck. As both are free, and both work
well under Linux, so I suppose it's only fair to mention both. Twhirl is
just my personal preference.
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Twhirl&mdash;works under Linux AIR 1.1 Beta: yes.</em></span>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1283580.0x137c4e0"></a>
DestroyFlickr</h2></div></div><p>
DestroyFlickr is a program that lets you manage your Flickr
stream with an interface that resembles a light table. It's a convenient
way to use Flickr.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10356f2.large.jpg"><img src="10356f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. DestroyFlickr manages your on-line Flickr account.
</p></div></div><p>
Another application that currently works under Linux is
Flump. It is much more simplistic in its interface, but it can upload
and download photos.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10356f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Flump is a very simple Flickr app.
</p></div></div><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>DestroyFlickr&mdash;works under Linux AIR 1.1 Beta: yes.</em></span>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1283580.0x137ca60"></a>
Snackr</h2></div></div><p>
Snackr is an RSS ticker that runs along the border of
your screen. Clicking on a story opens it in a preview window,
which gives you the option to open the actual page in a browser.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10356f4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Snackr continuously scrolls your RSS feeds, so you can
&ldquo;snack&rdquo;
on them at your leisure.
</p></div></div><p>
If you would prefer to have a cute fuzzy puppy read your
RSS feeds to you while he rolls around on your desktop, you might prefer
Pet-It RSS News by zerofractal.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10356f5.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. Pet-It RSS uses an avatar much less annoying than Microsoft's
Clippy.
</p></div></div><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Snackr&mdash;works under Linux AIR 1.1 Beta: yes.</em></span>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1283580.0x13738c8"></a>
Snippage</h2></div></div><p>
Snippage allows you to select a specific section of a
Web site and make it display in a widget on your desktop. The Web site
can update automatically, so if the page changes, so does the widget.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10356f6.large.jpg"><img src="10356f6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. Snippage lets you create a widget from a Web page selection.

Google Analytics Reporting Suite</h2></div></div><p>
If you look at Google Analytics information very often,
this application will save you time. Its functionality isn't much greater
than visiting Google's Web site, but the speed and convenience is nice.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10356f7.large.jpg"><img src="10356f7.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 7. Browsing through Google Analytics information is simple

Back It!</h2></div></div><p>
Back It! is a simple utility for backing up a predetermined
set of files and folders from one place to another. The program isn't
complex, but it's a great example of AIR interacting with the underlying
operating system.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10356f8.large.jpg"><img src="10356f8.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 8. Back It! does exactly as its name suggests. It backs stuff up.
</p></div></div><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Back It!&mdash;works under Linux AIR 1.1 Beta: yes.</em></span>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1283580.0x1374370"></a>
Remember the Milk Notifier</h2></div></div><p>
RTM Notifier logs in to your on-line account and notifies
you of upcoming tasks. I noticed a few graphic glitches running it under
Linux, but the program itself is fully functional.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10356f9.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 9. Remember the Milk Notifier is a popular on-line task manager.

Sam's Interactive Reader</h2></div></div><p>
This is a children's program that reads with
young readers interactively. There also are activities and the ability to download
additional content. Pricing for additional content varies from free to
slightly more expensive than free.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10356f10.large.jpg"><img src="10356f10.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 10. I'm a sucker for childhood literacy, so I really hope this
program works better by the time you read this.
</p></div></div><p>
The functionality of this program is not consistent.
Sometimes it won't load at all, and sometimes it starts almost enough
to use. I included the app, hoping it works well when AIR for Linux is no longer in beta.
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Sam's Interactive Reader&mdash;works under Linux AIR 1.1 Beta: almost, but no.</em></span>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1283580.0x1374aa8"></a>
MyMediaPlayer</h2></div></div><p>
MyMediaPlayer is an application that interfaces the hulu.com
Web site and makes it easy to navigate and display hulu videos.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10356f11.large.jpg"><img src="10356f11.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 11. MyMediaPlayer makes the already-simple hulu.com even
simpler&mdash;assuming it works by the time you read this.
</p></div></div><p>
Under the Linux beta of AIR, this application does everything
but actually play the videos. The menu navigation is easier than using
the hulu.com Web site, and I expect it to be a great application once
AIR gets out of beta.
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>MyMediaPlayer&mdash;works under Linux AIR 1.1 Beta: almost, but no.</em></span>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1283580.0x1374e70"></a>
Pandora Desktop</h2></div></div><p>
If you use Pandora to listen to music, you know how
inconvenient it can be if you accidentally close the browser window.
Several Pandora AIR applications exist in the wild, and assuming
the actual playback works once AIR is out of beta, this application
will be awesome. It even integrates in the Linux notification area on
the taskbar.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10356f12.large.jpg"><img src="10356f12.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 12. Pandora is a Web application just begging to be
a standalone app.
</p></div></div><p>
As with the other apps that play back media, Pandora apps
don't quite work yet. By the time you read this, it should be an
application you won't want to forget.
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Pandora Desktop&mdash;works under Linux AIR 1.1 Beta: almost, but no.</em></span>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1283580.0x1375290"></a>
FotoBooth</h2></div></div><p>
FotoBooth is an application written in Flex that allows
you to take photos with your Webcam. It supplies real-time effects you
can apply to the photos and allows for uploading directly to Flickr.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10356f13.large.jpg"><img src="10356f13.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 13. FotoBooth is a clone of Apple's PhotoBooth, with Flickr
integration.
</p></div></div><p>
FotoBooth has a complex history. It exists as a Web-only
Flash application and several versions written in AIR. Some of the
versions work under Linux, and some don't. Again, hopefully by the time
you read this, it will be a moot point.
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>FotoBooth&mdash;works under Linux AIR 1.1 Beta: yes.</em></span>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1283580.0x1375658"></a>
Almost Equal-Opportunity Development</h2></div></div><p>
Because countless numbers of AIR apps are available, I'm certain I
missed many that you would appreciate. The best place to search for
new AIR applications is the Adobe AIR Marketplace (see 
Resources).
</p><p>
There is a significant chance that you'll want to create your own
custom program as well. Fear not, because Adobe also offers tools that
allow developers to create their very own AIR apps. Granted, the tools
available for Linux developers aren't as robust as those available for
Windows and Macintosh users, but the upside is that the Linux tools
are free&mdash;well, at least for now.
</p><p>
Folks familiar with the Eclipse IDE can download the free (currently
alpha, currently free, although that might change) Flexbuilder plugin.
It interfaces with the extremely well-known Eclipse program to give Linux
users a method for creating AIR apps. If GUI programming environments
don't impress you, AIR apps also can be created with a simple text
editor.
</p><p>
When you add the simplistic installation method, the cross-platform
homogeny and the availability of (albeit rudimentary) development tools
for Linux, Adobe AIR is a platform that levels the playing field a bit
for those who prefer Linux. Most encouraging of all, at least for
me, is that Adobe is paying attention to Linux in a way that has never
before been witnessed. And, that kind of Flash really gets my attention.
