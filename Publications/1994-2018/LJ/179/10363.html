<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #179, March 2009</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Much of the Linux kernel source tree is taken up with the text of
<span   class="bold"><b>licenses</b></span> under which the code is released. There are plenty of
GPL-compatible licenses, and much of the kernel is released under a
dual license. As <span   class="bold"><b>J&ouml;rn Engel</b></span> points out, a lot of kernel source files
also include the full text of their licenses, causing about 3.5MB
of duplication throughout the source tree, or something more than
1% of the total size of the tree. <span   class="bold"><b>Roland
Kletzing</b></span> recently reported
those numbers, suggesting that one way to reduce the size of the
kernel would be to replace all that duplication with simple one-line
pointers to a single copy of each relevant license.
</p><p>
Although completely rational, this may not be likely to happen. On the
one hand, as J&ouml;rn says, a lot of the duplication is done because
corporate legal departments want their engineers including full
licensing information with all their contributions. Taking it out
again might pose problems for them. On the other hand, <span   class="bold"><b>Chris Snook</b></span>
reminded folks that the kernel was distributed in compressed form, and
because the licenses were all duplications, they compressed down to a
very, very small size. <span   class="bold"><b>Bodo Eggert</b></span>'s
objection&mdash;that even this small
size, when multiplied by the number of times the kernel actually
was downloaded, resulted in an immense waste of bandwidth&mdash;was largely
ignored, primarily because shrinking the compressed sources by such a
small amount also could be accomplished by doing actual coding work,
which is more fun, more sexy, and has the added benefit of actually
making the kernel run better.
</p><p>
Maybe someone will find a way to keep the corporate lawyers happy and
reduce the amount of license duplication at the same time, but this
doesn't seem likely to become a high priority for anybody.
</p><p>
There's a new driver out that connects PCI devices called
<span   class="bold"><b>PCINet</b></span>. It was written by <span   class="bold"><b>Ira Snyder</b></span>, and it implements the Ethernet
protocol across the PCI interface. Now folks can code up communication
between two PCI devices, using the familiar Ethernet protocol.
</p><p>
No one likes getting a <span   class="bold"><b>kernel oops</b></span>. Well, some folks actually do, and
they spend lots of time trying to invoke them, just so they can fix
them and make the world better. <span   class="bold"><b>Arjan van de
Ven</b></span> has written a Perl
script to take the raw oops output, pretty it up, and also try to
clarify the part of the oops that's actually relevant to figuring out
what went wrong. The script, called <span   class="bold"><b>markup_oops.pl</b></span>, still is tethered
to the i386 platform, thanks to some coding constructs that <span   class="bold"><b>Keith
Owens</b></span> pointed out to him. It also seems that Perl is no longer the
&ldquo;language of ascendancy&rdquo;, so writing the script in Perl may be another
strike against it.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Michael Halcrow</b></span>, <span   class="bold"><b>Tyler Hicks</b></span> and <span   class="bold"><b>David
Kleikamp</b></span> have added filename
encryption to <span   class="bold"><b>eCryptFS</b></span>. This has some interesting issues that make the
implementation trickier than it might seem. For example, the
encryption process can make the filename slightly longer than the
unencrypted version, so if the unencrypted version is too close to the
maximum length allowed by the filesystem, the encryption process won't
work.
</p><p>
Also, the eCryptFS folks want encryption to be optional&mdash;some files
in the directory may be encrypted while others aren't. How do you tell
the difference between an encrypted filename and a filename that's
just really dorky? The answer is that the encrypted names all have a
special prefix, and the rest of the name is in a special format. If
you really want to mess with the filesystem and create an unencrypted
filename with that prefix and that format, you're on your own. But
the issue probably will never come up.
</p><p>
The <span   class="bold"><b>linux-next tree</b></span> is continuing to be fine-tuned. On the one hand,
<span   class="bold"><b>Stephen Rothwell</b></span> wants the tree to be a place where code migrates
quickly into the main kernel tree. He also specifically wants <span   class="bold"><b>Andrew
Morton</b></span> to be able to base his own -mm tree releases on
linux-next easily. All of this means linux-next is intended to make sure
that code merges well together and will not cause housekeeping
problems for any upstream maintainers (such as <span   class="bold"><b>Linus
Torvalds</b></span> and Andrew).
</p><p>
So, all code is expected to be unit-tested and posted to the relevant
mailing lists. The folks submitting the code should know that if it
doesn't get dropped, it'll be heading into the official tree. Any
patches that conflict with the tree will be dropped. Any code that
breaks the build will be dropped. In practice, truly trivial breaks
won't get code dropped from linux-next, if Stephen can just eyeball
the problem and fix it quickly. But, anything beyond that will require
the folks submitting the code to fix it up and submit it again. In
some cases, people from different projects will have to work together
to resolve whatever breakage one of their submissions brought to
light. The idea is that linux-next gives these projects the
opportunity to identify and work on those conflicts and other
problems, before trying to get it past Linus or Andrew and into their
trees.

Last month, we reported here about Splashtop (<a href="http://www.splashtop.com" target="_self">www.splashtop.com</a>),
which starts a laptop in only a few seconds. Since then, Splashtop 
reportedly has found its way into the Lenovo IdeaPad S10e and the ASUS Eee PC.
</p><p>
Now there's Cloud (<a href="http://thinkgos.com/press-release20081201.php" target="_self">thinkgos.com/press-release20081201.php</a>),
from Good OS, which gave us gOS Linux and a cover story for <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span> in March 2008. Good OS calls Cloud &ldquo;A New Operating System for
2009&rdquo;. More specifically, the press release says Cloud &ldquo;integrates
a Web browser with a compressed Linux operating system kernel for
immediate access to Internet, integration of browser and rich-client
applications, and full control of the computer from inside the
browser&rdquo;
(<a href="http://thinkgos.com/press-release20081201.php" target="_self">thinkgos.com/press-release20081201.php</a>).
</p><p>
The browser looks like Google's Chrome, and most of the icons in the Mac-like
dock on the bottom of the screen are for Google apps running in &ldquo;the
cloud&rdquo;. One exception is the Windows symbol. We won't go there.
Meanwhile, the
fast-start race all goes to Linux.Cloud, launched in December 2008 at the Netbook
World Summit in Paris, demonstrated on a GIGABYTE Netbook.

An avidity to punish is always dangerous to liberty. It leads men to
stretch, to misinterpret, and to misapply even the best of laws. He that
would make his own liberty secure must guard even his enemy from
oppression; for if he violates his duty he establishes a precedent that
will reach to himself.

Coincident with the release of this code I have concluded my agreement
with Atheros whereby I had access to information about their devices. This
means that in the future all fixes, updates for new chips, etc., will need
to be a community effort. Atheros states the Linux platform will be the
reference public code base, so folks wanting to add support for other
platforms will have to scrape the information from there.

When I started following Linux action on Twitter, one contributor stood
out: mich_linux_guy. His tweets include, &ldquo;Playing with the Android
SDK&rdquo;,
&ldquo;Getting ready to install Fedora 10 on my son's XO laptop....Hope it's a
win&rdquo; and &ldquo;Bought an Acer Aspire One at Costco for $350. Just installed
Ubuntu 8.10. Did require fiddling with wireless packages (Googled it).
Works!&rdquo; His name is Don Stokes. He's a veteran hardware and software hacker
living with his wife and three sons in Oakland County, Michigan, where he's
also pursuing an MS in Computer Science at Oakland University. His startup
is <a href="http://stokesautomation.com" target="_self">stokesautomation.com</a>. And his favorite quote is
from Spinoza: &ldquo;Let every
man think what he wants and say what he thinks.&rdquo; What follows is plenty of
both.

</p></div></div><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
The first computer I purchased was a TRS-80 model 1. I goofed around with
some text-based adventure games and played with BASIC programming. The next
computer I bought had an Intel 80286 processor. It came with MSDOS, but I
bought a copy of IBM OS/2 to run. Eventually, OS/2 died, and I was forced to
run Windows NT. I think it was in 1999 that a friend at work (Ben&mdash;what
happened to you? Call me!) passed me a Red Hat Linux CD. (It was actually
labeled &ldquo;Red Ass Linux&rdquo;.) It required a lot of tinkering to get it to work,
but for me, this was &ldquo;fun&rdquo;! Eventually, I decided to make it my primary OS.
</p><p>
For our anniversary, I bought my wife an HP laptop with a gig of RAM and
put Ubuntu on it. She uses it for her e-mail, Web browsing and to manage
the music on her iPod. I put Ubuntu on my dad's old Dell laptop about a year
ago. As he doesn't have the root password or sudo rights, he can't mess
it up. Because it is a lot harder to attack Linux than Windows, I don't worry
about the security of his system. It's a great OS for him. My mom is next!
</p><p>
I ran Fedora until Ubuntu Feisty Fawn came out. Once in a while, I will boot
a live CD of other distributions to see what they are up to. I also have
Damn Small Linux (DSL) running on a couple of machines. It is amazing how much
functionality you can get using this distribution on machines that most
people would leave on the curb for the garbage truck.
</p><p>
The best thing about Linux is that its modular architecture makes it so
configurable/customizable. If I want eye candy, I can run GNOME or KDE
desktops. I can even run the X server with only a display manager, if I want
to maximize efficiency. On machines with low CPU or memory resources, I can
run with only a command line on a text display with no graphical user
interface.
</p><p>
Another reason I use Linux is the huge repository of free software. Kids
have very short attention spans. Even the best games won't keep them
content for long. With Linux, I can simply go to the Add/Remove option on
the main menu and choose from a gazillion free applications&mdash;all
installable with a few mouse clicks. Many of these applications are very
educational; it's been a great experience for my kids. Because they don't
have administrator access, they can't corrupt the machine.
</p><p>
I recently downloaded the Android SDK for the Eclipse IDE. It is amazing
how easy it is to create applications written in Java for Android. I got so
excited, I went out and bought a G1 the next day. (That's how long it
took the local T-Mobile guys to get some stock.) I'm currently writing a
simple encryption application for storing private information like
passwords and account numbers. Collecting devices that run Linux has become
kind of an obsession with my family (okay, me). Here is our current
collection:

</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>

</p></li><li><p>

son).
</p></li><li><p>
HP Pavilion a1687 desktop with Ubuntu 8.10 (hooked to our LCD TV in the
family room).
</p></li><li><p>
ASUS Eee PC running Xubuntu 8.10 (rides in my bag).
</p></li><li><p>
Acer Aspire One running Ubuntu 8.10 (maybe a replacement for the Eee?).
</p></li><li><p>
OLPC XO running Fedora, Sugar and XFCE (toy for my four-year-old son&mdash;he loves
hearing it say what he types).
</p></li><li><p>
IBM NetVista with 128MB of RAM running Xubuntu 8.10.
</p></li><li><p>
Compaq Pressario, 166MHz Pentium MMX, 16MB of RAM running Damn Small Linux
(basement machine&mdash;with the graphical desktop up playing a CD, it is
using only 8MB!).
</p></li><li><p>
Six other PCs of varying CPU and RAM running Ubuntu and DSL (acting as
file/print/game servers).
</p></li><li><p>
Nokia n810 (replacement for my Palm TX, but replaced by G1).
</p></li><li><p>
T-Mobile G1 phone running Android.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
All the software I use on a daily basis is free, and almost all of it is
open source. I use OpenOffice.org for word processing, spreadsheets,
presentations and simple databases. I use Mozilla Firefox and Thunderbird
for Web browsing and e-mail. Pidgin is my instant messenger. I use gcc for
compiling my C/C++ source and Eclipse for my Java development. I also use
Apache Web servers and a MySQL database manager for systems I have developed.
I also use Umbrello, Octave, Kino and VLC on a regular basis. I love my
freedom!

Intel, maker of WiMAX chipsets, has been investing heavily in WiMAX device
development and network deployment. Recently, it joined the Ministry of
Economic Affairs (MOEA) in Taiwan to jointly establish an &ldquo;enabling

for Moblin (<a href="http://moblin.org" target="_self">moblin.org</a>), which calls itself &ldquo;a Linux-based platform optimized for the
next generation of mobile devices, including Netbooks, Mobile Internet
Devices and In-vehicle infotainment systems&rdquo;. On that last front, Intel is
working with Wind River on a Moblin-enabled &ldquo;automotive infotainment
stack&rdquo;.
Says LinuxDevices, &ldquo;Wind River hopes the latter will appear in products
from 'Tier 1' automotive equipment makers, and it lists Bosch, BMW Group,
Delphi and Magneti Marelli among the companies 'actively supporting' its
