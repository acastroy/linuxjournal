Firefox is the wunderkind of Linux browsers, but is it right
for you? We take a look at three competing browsers&mdash;Opera, CrossOver Chromium
and Flock&mdash;that may just give you more
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Webvergnuegen</em></span>.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2857580.0x294f300"></a></h2></div></div><p>
What a relief we felt when Firefox was first released. It replaced &ldquo;None
of the above&rdquo; as our favorite browser, and we finally were rid of the
monolithic dinosaur Netscape. Since then, Firefox has been relatively
unchallenged in its supremacy.
</p><p>
As of late, some new challengers are seeking to steal some of Firefox's
thunder. In this article, we take a closer look at three of them:
Opera, CrossOver Chromium and Flock.
</p><p>
Opera clearly has ambitions, because although always good, recent releases
have shown vast improvements, a wealth of smart features and a sleek
Euro style. CrossOver Chromium is Google Chrome running on Wine.
Though Chromium is betaware, it gives us a sneak peek into Google's plans
to re-invent the browser by going minimalist. Will Chrome do to Firefox
what Firefox did to Netscape? Finally, Flock seeks efficiency not
in raw speed but in doing everything in one place and integrating the
Net experience in one &ldquo;portal&rdquo;.
You may find that one of these browsers is a better fit for you.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2857580.0x294f618"></a>
The Opera Web Browser</h2></div></div><p>
Although Linux-friendly for ages, the Opera Web browser, which is based on
the proprietary Presto layout engine, has failed to reach critical mass
in the collective Linux consciousness. Lacking the massive community
involvement and open-source credentials of Firefox, most of us don't
even register Opera. In the 2008 <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>
Readers' Choice Awards,
less than 5% of respondents picked Opera as their favorite Web browser
(compared to Firefox's 86%).
</p><p>
Although I'd also love to see an open-source Opera, I somewhat understand
the company's unwillingness to release its source code. I recently spoke
with Opera's CTO, Hakon Wium Lie, who explained the company's position
on open source:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
At Opera, we believe in open standards, security, speed, performance
and features&mdash;these are values that we share with the Linux
community....We're very proud of our source code, and we'd like to show it
to others, but we haven't found a business model that allows us to do so
while still charging for commercial use. Ideally, I'd like to see an open-source license similar to the Creative Commons noncommercial license. The
license would say, &ldquo;here's the source code, feel free to use and reuse
it, but we'd like a cut if you make money from it&rdquo;. Anyway, on the
Web,
I believe open standards are much more important than open source.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Personally, I don't see why an open-source Opera could not only scale up
its market share but also leverage that increased popularity to rake in
a hefty share of revenues from partnerships with search engines, like
Firefox does. However, I'll leave that discussion for another day.
The reality is that the Opera browser is good&mdash;surprisingly even as
good as the Windows edition&mdash;which makes it worthy of our scrutiny.
Let's have a look.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2857580.0x294f930"></a>
The Opera Experience</h2></div></div><p>
Although I have used Opera on and off over the years as a backup browser,
I never really gave it a hard run for its money. When I dove into the new
Opera 9.6, I was pleasantly surprised at its features and ergonomically
sound look and feel. From a style standpoint, I like Opera better
than Firefox on Linux. The Opera folks clearly put much thought into
design elements.
</p><p>
Opera makes up for its open-source &ldquo;deficit&rdquo; with cool features and
customizability. Although the browser is speedy enough, Opera is about
the features, not leanness. Many features that are Firefox extensions
are already built in to Opera.
</p><p>
Here are some core features that distinguish Opera from its rivals.
The Opera browser has the most interesting startup options of any
Linux-based browser. First, upon opening a tab, Opera's default is Speed
Dial, a sort of home page with nine customizable thumbnails for your
favorite Web sites (Figure 1). Second, Opera lets you decide how to
start each session&mdash;just as you left off, your home page, a blank page,
via dialog or from a saved session. The built-in session manager is a
powerful feature, given how many different tabs/windows the typical user
has open concurrently. One can have saved sessions for different
modes, such as home, work, finances, news, hobbies and so on.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10358f1.large.jpg"><img src="10358f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Summon a new tab in
Opera, and up pops Speed Dial, a sort of home page with nine one-click
links to your favorite sites.
</p></div></div><p>
I also found Opera's &ldquo;philosophy&rdquo; of
default tab-oriented browsing pleasant, which I personally think is nicer
than Firefox's tab mode. As you open new pages, Opera opens each
substantial (that is, non-squished) tab, complete with mouse-over preview,
across the top of the browser. Although you certainly can configure Firefox
to act in a similar way, Opera feels more comfortable and looks nicer
in tab mode.
</p><p>
A number of other built-in features make Opera worth a look. The Wand
allows you to save user names and passwords and autofill them upon
subsequent site visits. Opera Link is a service that synchronizes
bookmarks, the Speed Dial contents, browsing history and other elements
across computers or other devices that run Opera, including mobile devices
that utilize Opera Mini, the mobile version of Opera. Furthermore,
RSS (with label-able feeds), IRC, a mail client and BitTorrent support
are built in.
</p><p>
For those who appreciate aesthetics, Opera goes well beyond its pleasant
default skin. Changing Opera's skin is easy, because a surprisingly wide
range of skins are easy to preview, download and install with just a
few clicks.
</p><p>
Besides the myriad built-in features, Opera also offers a range of widgets
that collaborate with the browser. Widgets get their own tab from which
one can view, install and manage them. They can appear anywhere the
user wants. Although numerous, useful widgets exist, Opera's philosophy
is to have more core features built in than does Firefox. The result is a
heavier but more immediately customizable browser.
</p><p>
On the negative side, though I didn't find Opera to be noticeably
slower than its peers, I had some occasional page-rendering problems.
On one site, the search box slid behind the main menu and was completely
unaccessible.
</p><p>
Despite such problems, I'd argue that Opera's plethora of features makes
up for the speed deficits and its rendering problems. Of course,
the trade-offs are yours to weigh, as well.

Google Chrome on Wine: CrossOver Chromium</h2></div></div><p>
At the time of this writing, the recent Google Chrome browser is available natively
only on the Windows platform with a Linux edition still in development.
The idea behind Chrome is to remedy the past &ldquo;mistakes&rdquo; made by browser
makers and provide a tool that also runs applications and not just
displays Web pages.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10358f2.large.jpg"><img src="10358f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Chromium
</p></div></div><p>
Thanks to good ol' Linux-geek ingenuity, however, we don't have to wait
for the Google folks to finish their project. Instead, CodeWeavers,
makers of the CrossOver line of Wine-based applications, has created
CrossOver Chromium, a Linux &ldquo;port&rdquo; of Google Chrome.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2857580.0x2950380"></a>
The Chromium on Linux Experience</h2></div></div><p>
Although the situation may change by the time you read this, the reality
is that CrossOver Chromium is betaware and not yet ready for prime time.
On Chromium's status, CodeWeavers offers the warning that it is &ldquo;just
a proof of concept, for fun, and to showcase what Wine can do&rdquo;.
</p><p>
Should you decide to tinker with Chromium, you'll find some things
satisfactory, and others frustrating. On the plus side, Chromium is
thankfully open source, written in V8, Google's JavaScript virtual
machine and based on the WebKit layout engine. Furthermore, installing
Chromium is a snap, with a downloadable binary in DEB (for Ubuntu) and
RPM (for SUSE, Mandriva and Red Hat) formats, as well as a package with
a one-click shell script for other distros.
</p><p>
You'll also like Chromium if you prefer a lack of clutter over feature-rich
functionality. I've been told that the Windows version is fast as
lightning, as reputedly shall be Chrome for Linux, but Chromium certainly
is more like thunder than lightning.
</p><p>
One unique feature our ilk will love on Chromium is the (for real) &ldquo;Stats
for nerds&rdquo; function. When you call forth the task manager, you'll get a
list of open Web pages, complete with memory status, CPU usage and network
speed related to each page. On the task manager, in addition to an option
to kill the process for each open page, you also can click on a Stats for
nerds link, which pulls up a new tab complete with additional information
such as PID, memory utilization for both the entire browser and each tab.
</p><p>
I also like Chromium's option to open a number of home pages upon startup
and not just one. Apparently unique to Chromium is another neat feature,
incognito browsing, which allows the user to leave no local trace in
the browser or cache of what's been viewed.
</p><p>
On the frustrating side, although you'll find Chromium functional for loading
Web pages, it feels a bit slow and clunky. Furthermore, Chromium
lacks an integrated non-Web-based RSS reader, which Firefox and Opera have
right in the address bar. It also lacks extensive bookmark management, which
most other full-featured browsers have. Another core issue is privacy on
Chromium, because Google collects usage statistics and crash reports from
you as a default. Luckily, you can turn this off by selecting Options
from the &ldquo;wrench&rdquo; menu.
</p><p>
In the future, Google says we can expect currently absent features to
become available, such
as better bookmark management, an extension framework, a way to 
e-mail complete Web pages and links easily and more.
</p><p>
The take-home message on Chromium is that it is a Spartan browser with few
bells and whistles whose post-beta experience is slated to be lightning
fast on the Linux platform. For now though, CrossOver Chromium is a
sluggish prototype held together by lots of virtual duct tape. We can
only hope that the native Linux version of Chrome will be so blindingly
fast that it gives us a reason to consider leaving its bulkier competitors
behind.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2857580.0x2950850"></a>
Flock</h2></div></div><p>
At the far opposite end of the philosophical spectrum from the slim
Chromium lies Flock, the Swiss Army knife of browsers. Flock takes the
&ldquo;portal&rdquo; approach to browsing, adhering to a philosophy that efficiency
lies in consolidation rather than raw page-load speed. Based on the
latest Gecko engine with a number of specialized extensions, Flock bills
itself as &ldquo;The Social Web Browser&rdquo; that &ldquo;collects all of your feeds,
friends, media and sites in one convenient place&rdquo;.
</p><p>
The reason for such a billing is that Flock wants you to do nearly everything
from a unified command center. This includes interacting with social
networking sites (such as Facebook and Twitter), photo and video search
(such as Flickr and YouTube), photo uploading and sharing (such as Picasa
and Photobucket), blogging (such as Blogger and LiveJournal), news
consolidation with custom RSS feeds and bookmark syncing with on-line
bookmark services (such as delicious and magnolia). 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10358f3.large.jpg"><img src="10358f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. The Flock browser seeks efficiency via tight
integration with popular sites like YouTube and Facebook.
</p></div></div><p>
The key to keeping all this stuff straight is the Flock Toolbar,
which offers an icon that represents each type of media by function (Figure
4). These icons include My World, a home base of sorts that
includes the information you want, such as news feeds and your Facebook
friends; the People Sidebar for social networking interactions; the
Media Bar for quick video and photo searches; the Feeds Sidebar for
managing RSS; Webmail for interfacing with Web-based e-mail services;
Favorites (bookmarks); the Accounts and Services Sidebar
for managing accounts and logins; the Web Clipboard, a location to
which you can drag links, images and text to save for later perusal;
the Blog Editor and the Photo Uploader. Besides all this, you can,
of course, simply surf the Web conventionally.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10358f4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Flock packs a lot
into a small space. The secret to keeping your media organized
is the Flock Toolbar. Each icon represents a different type of media
by function.

Happy Flocking</h2></div></div><p>
I first approached Flock 2.0 with my own Firefox-colored assumptions
and habits, including a primal urge to summon each site I visit onto
its own tab or window. I typically scroll through my tabs with Ctrl-Tab
or my windows with Alt-Tab. As I dug in to Flock, I had to tell myself
&ldquo;Hold off on the keystrokes and start flocking&rdquo;, as the animated
introduction suggests.
</p><p>
As I began to &ldquo;flock&rdquo; on Flock, I realized the tight integration with its
partner sites. To test Flock's capabilities, I sent a friend a hilarious
Bollywood music video I had seen recently on YouTube. Culling my urge
to call up YouTube on its own tab, I instead did it the Flock way by
launching the Media Bar, which popped up one-inch wide across the top of
the browser window. Because the Media Bar is integrated with several
media-based sites, including YouTube, I could choose YouTube from
the drop-down menu and search the site without going there directly.
The Media Bar came back with thumbnails and mouse-over previews of the
search results. Then&mdash;here's the coolest part&mdash;after finding my video,
I sent it to my friend by dragging the thumbnail over to his Facebook
entry in the People Sidebar, which automatically composed a message
to him, including the link to the video and the thumbnail. All I had
to do was click Send. I could have done the same with my Yahoo Webmail, Twitter or blog entry. Similar drag-and-drop functionality and
integration works while blogging on one of the supported blog sites.
</p><p>
Despite Flock's toolbar-driven modular layout, you're probably wondering
how it packs so many goodies into such a small space. Admittedly, all
that content was a bit scrunched on my 12"-laptop display, but it still
was functional. The real estate found in a large LCD is more appropriate
for flocking. Nevertheless, features such as the rapidly sliding tab
bar allow you to open and manage a huge volume of tabs.
</p><p>
Otherwise, Flock was very customizable according to my whims, and
the main toolbar was logical and functional after becoming accustomed
to it. The degree of integration with other sites is unprecedented among
Linux-based browsers. Despite the heft of features, Flock is based on
Firefox, which means the options are familiar, browsing is nimble,
and most, but not all, extensions are usable.
</p><p>
Whether you choose Flock really depends on the degree to which
you hang out on social media sites, share pictures and video with friends,
blog frequently and track RSS feeds. If you are a social media addict, 
I suspect Flock will save you time and hassle. If you are
a more casual user, Flock may seem claustrophobic and cluttered.
I, for instance, am a Facebook user who checks the site once or
twice a day&mdash;probably not enough to warrant using Flock. However,
I admit that having my Facebook (and Twitter) contacts right next door
makes me more conscious of and interactive with my contacts. Who knows,
maybe I'll stay on board. If you do decide to flock, however, be prepared
to throw your typical browser habits out the window and re-orient yourself
to Flock's all-in-one philosophy.
</p><p>
Before putting Flock to bed, I should add that Flock makes two special
editions for the Linux platform: the Gloss and Eco editions. The Gloss
edition is preconfigured for entertainment and fashion-related topics, and the
Eco edition is for green topics. Being an eco-geek, I checked out the latter.
On the negative side, the souped-up editions are a release behind&mdash;namely
1.2.6 at the time of writing, compared to 2.0 for the standard release.
The Eco edition, beyond its earthy eye candy, preloads a plethora
of enviro-oriented links, media streams, RSS feeds and favorites.
As an avid reader of green media, I was impressed with the wide range
of selections, many of which I had never seen before. Although the Eco
edition is probably overkill on quantity, it provided me with plenty of
new information sources, as well as a template for how to maximize Flock.

Other Browsers for Linux: Epiphany and Konqueror</h2></div></div><p>
The Linux platform is blessed with several other Web browsers. Here is
a quick take on two, Epiphany for GNOME and Konqueror for KDE.
</p><p>
If you are an avid Ubuntu user, you probably are familiar with
Epiphany, the GTK-based Web browser built for the GNOME desktop.
Besides integrating tightly with the GNOME desktop, Epiphany's goal is to
be simple and easy to use. The browser utilizes Mozilla's Gecko layout
engine and offers nearly the same functionality as Firefox, including
its extensions. However, one feature that stands out in Epiphany is
its topic-based, rather than hierarchical, bookmark management, which
is similar to Gmail's labels. This system allows you to categorize a
bookmark more intuitively with multiple topics. Epiphany also supports
cookie management, pop-up blocking, tabbed browsing and its own extension
package. Some native extensions relate to mouse gestures, a certificate
viewer, an interactive Python console and smart bookmarks.
</p><p>
If you're a KDE aficionado, you know Konqueror well as your &ldquo;everything
tool&rdquo;. Beyond managing and viewing files, Konqueror also is a decent and
basic Web browser, though not as robust functionally or stylistically
as Firefox or Opera. I find Konqueror to be a great backup Web browser when
things go awry with others. The browser identification tool aids the
troubleshooting process by letting you configure how Konqueror reports
itself&mdash;for example, as Internet Explorer, Googlebot, Firefox and Safari,
among others.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2857580.0x2d496a8"></a>
Let Your Philosophy Decide</h2></div></div><p>
With the above and more options available, what are you going to choose
as your browser? We are fortunate that each browser niche is being
filled with great options on the Linux platform. For those who believe
that efficiency lies in integration and feature-richness, Flock and
Opera are excellent options. Flock integrates the most tightly with
other services, and Opera builds in as much functionality as possible.
Neither browser is known for its page-load speeds. Meanwhile, browsers
like Firefox and its more streamlined cousins (such as IceCat and Epiphany) hold
the middle ground, seeking to balance speed with essential functionality,
leaving many features to the extensible extension system. Currently,
Firefox is the fastest we've got. However, although CrossOver Chromium is
not so nimble, it gives us an enticing preview of the forthcoming Google
Chrome for Linux. Chrome for Windows is faster than Firefox. If you
pride speed and agility above all else, keep your eye out for Chrome.
Whatever your philosophy, you'll find a great Linux-based browser to
meet your needs.
