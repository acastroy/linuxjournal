I know I have been writing about the basics of working with 
variables in shell scripts, but I'm going to diverge and 
address a recent query I received. Okay? (And, hey, write 
to me.)
</p><p>
&ldquo;Dear Dave, I seek an edge when I next play
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Hangman</em></span> or 
other word games. I want to know what words are most common 
in the English language and what letters are most common in 
written material too. If you can show how to do that as a 
shell script, it'd be useful for your column, but if not, 
can you point me to an on-line resource? Thanks, Mike R.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Okay, I can tell you up front, Mike, that the secret to 
playing <span   class="emphasis"><em>Hangman</em></span> is to ensure that you have sufficient 
guesses to get at least 30% of the letters before you're in 
great peril. Oh, that's not what you seek, is it? The 
first letter to guess, always, is E, which is the most 
common letter in the English language. If you have a 
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Scrabble</em></span> set, you also can figure out the frequency of 
letters, because the points for individual letters are 
inversely proportional to their frequency. That is, E is 
worth one point, while the Q and Z&mdash;two very
uncommon 
letters in English&mdash;are worth ten points each.
</p><p>
But, let's work on a shell script to verify and prove all 
this, shall we?
</p><p>
The first step is to find some written material to 
analyze. That's easily done by going to one of my favorite 
places on the Web, the Gutenberg Project. You can pop there 
too at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org" target="_self">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</p><p>
With thousands and thousands of books available in free,
downloadable form, let's grab only three: <span   class="emphasis"><em>Dracula</em></span> by Bram 
Stoker, <span   class="emphasis"><em>History of the United States</em></span> by Charles A. Beard 
and Mary Ritter Beard, and <span   class="emphasis"><em>Pride and Prejudice</em></span> by Jane 
Austen. They're all obviously a bit older, but that's okay 
for our purposes. To make life easy, I'll download them as 
plain text and leave the geeky introduction to the 
Gutenberg Project at the top of each file too, just for 
more word variation and, well, because I'm lazy. Okay with 
you, dear reader?
</p><p>
Here's a quick heads up on the three:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ wc *txt
   16624  163798  874627 dracula.txt
   24398  209289 1332539 history-united-states.txt
   13426  124576  717558 pride-prejudice.txt
   54448  497663 2924724 total
</pre>
</p><p>
Okay, so we have 54,448 lines of text, representing 497,663 
words and 2,924,724 characters. That's a lot of text.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e3a580.0x1f32bf0"></a>
Word Frequency</h2></div></div><p>
The key to figuring out any of our desired statistics is to 
realize that the basic strategy we need to use is to 
break the content down into smaller pieces, sort them, and then 
use the great <tt  >uniq -c</tt> capability, which de-dupes 
the input stream, counting frequency as it goes. As a 
shell pipe, we're talking about <tt  >sort | uniq -c</tt>, coupled 
with whatever command we need to break down the individual 
entities.
</p><p>
For this task, I'm going to use <tt  >tr</tt>, like this,
to convert spaces to newlines:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ cat *txt | tr ' ' '\
' | head        
The
Project
Gutenberg
EBook
of
Dracula,
by
Bram
Stoker
</pre>
</p><p>
Okay, so what happens when we actually unleash the beast on 
all 54,448 lines of our combined text?

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ cat *txt | tr ' ' '\
&gt; ' | wc -l
  526104
</pre>
</p><p>
That's strange. Somehow I would expect that breaking down 
every line by space delimiter should be fairly close to the 
word count of <tt  >wc</tt>, but most likely 
the document has punctuation like &ldquo;the end.  The next&rdquo;
where a double space becomes two, not one line. No worries, 
though, it'll all vanish once we take the next step.
</p><p>
Now that we have the ability to break down our documents 
into individual words, let's sort and &ldquo;uniq&rdquo; it to see what 
we see:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ cat *txt | tr ' ' '\
' | sort | uniq | wc -l
   52407
</pre>
</p><p>
But, that's not right. Do you know why?
</p><p>
If you said, &ldquo;Dude! You need to account for capitalization!&rdquo;,
you'd be on the right track. In fact, we need to 
transliterate everything to lowercase. We also need to 
strip out all the punctuation as well, because right now it's 
counting &ldquo;cat,&rdquo; and &ldquo;cat&rdquo; as two different
words&mdash;not good.
</p><p>
First off, transliteration is best done with a character 
group rather than with a letter range. In tr, it's a bit funky 
with the [::] notation:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ echo "Hello" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]'
hello
</pre>
</p><p>
Stripping out punctuation is a wee bit trickier, but not 
much. Again, we can use a character class in tr:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ echo "this, and? that! for sure." | tr -d '[:punct:]'
this and that for sure
</pre>
</p><p>
Coolness, eh? I bet you didn't know you could do that! Now, 
let's put it all together:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ cat *txt | tr ' ' '\
' | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | 
tr -d '[:punct:]' | sort | uniq | wc -l
   28855
</pre>
</p><p>
So, that chops it down from 52,407 to 28,855&mdash;makes sense to 
me. One more transform is needed though. Let's strip out 
all lines that don't contain alphabetic characters to 
eliminate digits. That can be done with a simple <tt  >grep -v 
'[^a-z]'"</tt>:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ cat *txt | tr ' ' '\
' | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | 
tr -d '[:punct:]' | grep -v '[^a-z]' | 
sort | uniq | wc -l
   19,820
</pre>
</p><p>
If you analyze only <span   class="emphasis"><em>Dracula</em></span>, by the way, it turns out that the 
entire book has only 9,434 unique words. Useful, eh?
</p><p>
Now, finally, let's tweak things just a bit and see the ten 
most common words in this corpus:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ cat *txt | tr ' ' '\
' | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | 
tr -d '[:punct:]' | grep -v '[^a-z]' | 
sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head
29247 the
19925 
16995 of
14715 and
13010 to
9293 in
7894 a
6474 i
5724 was
5206 that
</pre>
</p><p>
And, now you know. 
</p><p>
Next month, I'll wrap this up by showing how 
you can analyze individual letter occurrences too, and 
finally, I'll offer a way to find some great <span   class="emphasis"><em>Hangman</em></span> words for 
stumping your friends.
