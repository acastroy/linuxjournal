By running OpenSim on your own server, you can create
your own virtual world and even connect it to other virtual worlds.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x189d580.0x19952a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Last month, I took you on a tour of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Second Life</em></span> and showed you some
applications for it besides entertainment. This month, I explain
how you can run your own virtual island using the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Second
Life</em></span>
client and the open-source 3-D application server software called
OpenSimulator. OpenSimulator, or OpenSim for short, is a free (as in
speech) implementation of a virtual world platform, utilizing the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Second Life</em></span> protocols. From its FAQ: &ldquo;OpenSim is a platform for
operating a virtual world and supports multiple independent regions
connecting to a single centralized grid. This is somewhat similar
to the Web, where people can run their own Web servers, tied together
through the Internet. It can also be used to create a private grid,
analogous to a private intranet.&rdquo; In other words, OpenSim can be like
a 3-D Apache server, enabling collaboration, entertainment
and business without having to utilize a centralized service.
</p><p>
You don't need a beefy machine to run OpenSim. I've had a Pentium 4
with 1GB of RAM running a basic island for a little while, and it has supported
eight concurrent logins without any trouble. If you have a more modern
machine, you even can run OpenSim locally on the same machine as your
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Second Life</em></span> client. I also have tested this
configuration on my Core 2 Duo-equipped laptop, and it ran quite well. 
</p><p>
The client is a much more demanding
system than the server is. I hardly notice the server process when
running this in &ldquo;all-in-one&rdquo; mode. As a matter of fact, one machine can
support a number of sims (also known as regions). I have tested up to
ten regions on a dual-core machine with 2GB of RAM. So long as there
isn't crazy activity in one of the regions, they all have acceptable
performance. This is similar to what Linden Labs does in its data
centers&mdash;it runs its &ldquo;openspace&rdquo; regions at four regions per CPU core.
</p><p>
The folks over at OpenSim say that the best method for getting and
running OpenSim is to build it from source, though they do offer nightly
builds. OpenSim is written in C# and runs under
Mono on Linux. Due to
the high dependency on Mono, I'm assuming you are running Ubuntu 8.04
or 8.10 (to get OpenSim running on other distros, please see the Build
Instructions in the Resources section). Versions of Ubuntu earlier
than 8.04 need to have Mono upgraded at least to version
1.9.1. (OpenSim will run under the 1.2.6 that ships with Ubuntu 8.04,
but 1.9.1 is preferred for its better memory management.) The build
process is well documented and straightforward, even for a ham-fisted
guy like me. 
</p><p>
Before you try it, please check the OpenSimulator Build
Instructions link in the Resources section of this article, but here's
how you build OpenSim on Ubuntu 8.04. This set of commands installs
Mono and the necessary dependencies and libraries, gets the latest source
from SVN and builds it:


<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo apt-get install subversion nant mono-gmcs \
             libmono-microsoft8.0-cil \
             libmono-system-runtime2.0-cil \
             libgdiplus libmono-i18n2.0-cil ruby
svn co http://opensimulator.org/svn/opensim/trunk opensim
cd opensim
./runprebuild.sh
nant
</pre>
</p><p>
Once nant finishes running, that's it. OpenSim is ready to be configured
and started. OpenSim can run in two modes: standalone and grid. Standalone
OpenSim servers are islands unto themselves&mdash;self-contained and not
dependent on any separate login managers or services. Grid mode is the
more interesting mode, where multiple islands can be linked together
into a cohesive virtual world. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Second Life</em></span> itself is an example of a
bunch of regions running in grid mode, although there are other third-party grids now, such as OSGrid, DeepGrid and Openlife Grid. 
</p><p>
Before
you configure your OpenSim, you need to decide on the mode in which
you will run.
I recommend running your first sim in standalone mode to get the
hang of the way things work. Once you understand standalone mode, you
can set up another sim or convert your standalone sim to a grid-based
sim, and either build your own network of sims or connect your sim to
another grid altogether, like OSGrid. Configuring a grid server is beyond
the scope of this article, but there is excellent documentation at the
OpenSimulator Web site. 
</p><p>
Configuring a basic standalone server couldn't
be easier, as the server asks you several questions on first startup,
and it builds the opensim.ini configuration file from that.
</p><p>
Another decision you need to make prior to configuring OpenSim
is what database back end you want to run. For experimentation and
light use in standalone mode, the default SQLite database is perfect. There are no special configuration settings to mess with and no external
databases to set up. When you decide to graduate to grid mode, however,
you probably will want to run the back end on MySQL. Configuring a MySQL
back end also is beyond the scope of this article, but again, there is
great documentation on this at the OpenSim Web site.
</p><p>
Let's get your first OpenSim up and running. All the compiled binaries
will be in the opensim/bin directory. You either can run OpenSim from
there or move them to a directory of your choice. If you choose to
move them, ensure that you move the files under the opensim/bin directory
recursively. Once you've got the binaries in place, you can start
OpenSim simply by running <tt  >mono ./OpenSim.exe</tt> from
the directory in which you
put the binaries. Once that command is executed, OpenSim goes to
work, creating a bunch of standard &ldquo;assets&rdquo; and populating the SQLite
database. 
</p><p>
Next, you will see a prompt that asks you about the configuration
of your server. It's actually safe to accept all the defaults if you just
want to play with an OpenSim on the same machine as the client. Note
that OpenSim's default is to listen on loopback (that is, localhost) only. If you don't
put the IP address of your machine in the external hostname field,
you won't be able to connect to your OpenSim instance from another
machine. You definitely will need to deviate from the defaults if you want
to have the client and server on different machines. You probably
also will want to specify the Master Avatar first and last name as something
other than the default. Here's an example:


<pre     class="programlisting">
21:45:34 - [CONFIG]: Calling Configuration Load Function...
DEFAULT REGION CONFIG: Region Name [OpenSim Test]: 
Bill's Place
DEFAULT REGION CONFIG: Grid Location (X Axis) [1000]:

DEFAULT REGION CONFIG: Grid Location (Y Axis) [1000]: 
1000
DEFAULT REGION CONFIG: Internal IP Address for 
        incoming UDP client connections [0.0.0.0]: 
0.0.0.0
DEFAULT REGION CONFIG: Internal IP Port for 
        incoming UDP client connections [9000]: 
9000
DEFAULT REGION CONFIG: External Host Name [127.0.0.1]: 
192.168.1.140
DEFAULT REGION CONFIG: First Name of Master Avatar [Test]: 
Bill 
DEFAULT REGION CONFIG: Last Name of Master Avatar [User]: 
Deere
DEFAULT REGION CONFIG: (Sandbox Mode Only)Password for 
        Master Avatar account [test]: 
password
</pre>
</p><p>
Once you answer these questions, the OpenSim server finishes its
startup sequence and is ready for you to log in when you see a <tt  >Region
(root) # :</tt> prompt. The OpenSim console allows you to do some basic
management and administration of the server from this prompt, but the
real fun stuff begins when you fire up a <span   class="emphasis"><em>Second Life</em></span> viewer. The actual
virtual world can be accessed only via the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Second Life</em></span> viewer. Assuming
you already have the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Second Life</em></span> viewer and have untarred it into
a directory, you can log in to your server by running the following
command:


<pre     class="programlisting">

./secondlife -loginuri http://&lt;server IP&gt;:9000/ \
             -loginpage http://&lt;server IP&gt;:9000/?method=login

</pre>
</p><p>
In my case, I can log in to my server with the following:



<pre     class="programlisting">
./secondlife -loginuri http://192.168.1.140:9000/ \
             -loginpage http://192.168.1.140:9000/?method=login
</pre>
</p><p>
The client will launch, and
you will see a basic HTML screen (Figure 1). Input
the first and last name of the Master Avatar that you specified when
configuring the server (see above) and the
password you specified.
</p><p>
The client then will log in to the server, and you'll be
on your own little island! It's not much to look at, just a little hump
in an empty sea, but then again, neither is your avatar. Regardless of
how you envision your avatar, all avatars in an OpenSim deployment start
out as <span   class="emphasis"><em>one</em></span> basic shape&mdash;the basic Linden shape known as Ruth. This
is because you have no prepopulated inventory, so you get the generic
unisex avatar, which just happens to look female. Go figure.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10357f1.large.jpg"><img src="10357f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Logging In to My Virtual World
</p></div></div><p>
Ruth is sort of ambiguous-looking (Figure 2), but it's not hard to
fix that. By going into the inventory window, right-clicking on Body
Parts, and then clicking on New Body Part&mdash;New Shape, you can create
a body shape, then wear it. Once you wear that shape, you can right-click
on your avatar, and select Edit Appearance. Then, edit that shape
to your liking. Once you get your shape dialed in, you can create basic
clothing that's a little better than what's provided with Ruth, and look
as fashionable as I do (Figure 3). 
</p><p>
Another thing you may want to do to
your island is to terraform it. This is done by right-clicking on the
ground and selecting Edit Terrain. The terraforming dialog comes
up, and from there, you can use the raise land or lower land tools to
change the elevation of certain areas of the parcel. I spent about five
minutes in the terraforming dialog, and my island went from the basic
little round hump to something that vaguely resembles Pac-Man (Figure 4).

If you are a seasoned <span   class="emphasis"><em>Second Life</em></span> user, you may go through a period of
shock once you realize there is no prepopulated inventory, nor are there
any stores to buy goods on your own private island. Much like Robinson
Crusoe, you are going to have to make anything you want to use or wear on
your own island. If you do know LSL scripting in <span   class="emphasis"><em>Second
Life</em></span>, you'll be
glad to know that there is an analog in OpenSimulator as well. The
OpenSim folks have implemented about 85% of the LSL scripting language
in OpenSim, and they are improving the support for it every day.
</p><p>
Once your island is up and running, for an added challenge, you may want
to try connecting your private island to one of the alternative grids
that have been set up by virtual reality fans. See the Alternative
Grids sidebar for more information on this&mdash;it's a great way to
jumpstart into a whole new virtual universe. If you can set up
the infrastructure, but have a difficult time creating content, you may
choose this path. 
</p><p>
Once you've hooked your island into a grid, you can
start to leverage all the shared inventory and assets of other people
who have come before you. Much like <span   class="emphasis"><em>Second Life</em></span>, there are stores on
the alternative grids where you can get clothes, vehicles, furniture
and other goods&mdash;and most of it on the alternative grids is free!
</p><p>
That's the basics on your own island. At this point, you can have friends
or colleagues log in to your server using the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Second
Life</em></span> client, and you
can converse and collaborate. Explore what you can do with the technology,
and have fun making your own virtual world!
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x189d580.0x1996c70"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Alternative Grids</b></p><p>
Some of the alternative grids are very interesting places to visit
if you're adventurous. One of my favorite places to check out is
OSGrid. OSGrid is a loose confederation of independent OpenSim operators
who have tied their sims into a cohesive grid. Some of the operators
are universities experimenting with virtual worlds, and others are
amateur enthusiasts or OpenSim developers. Getting onto OSGrid is
easy; simply go to the OSGrid site (see Resources),
and register for a free account. Then, start your <span   class="emphasis"><em>Second
Life</em></span> client
with the following command:


<pre     class="programlisting">
./secondlife -multiple -loginuri http://osgrid.org:8002 \
             -loginpage http://osgrid.org/loginscreen.php \
             -helperuri http://osgrid.org
</pre>
</p><p>
Once you log in, feel free to wander
about (Figure 5). There's lots to see and do, and unlike <span   class="emphasis"><em>Second
Life</em></span>,
there is no economy, so you either find and utilize freebie items or you
create your own content. OSGrid is a great sandbox for builders in
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Second
Life</em></span> who want to experiment without upload costs as well. 
</p><p>
If you want to
try running your own OSGrid-enabled
server at home, you can find instructions on how to join your own server
to OSGrid at the OSGrid Web site. Attaching your own server to OSGrid is much
simpler than running your own private grid, because the centralized login
and asset servers are maintained by the OSGrid group. Reserve a spot on
the OSGrid map for your sim and check it out! It's easier than it looks.

Getting Help</b></p><p>
You can get help with your own OpenSim deployment via various
methods. Possibly the most convenient method is the OpenSim IRC server
that you can log in to for help with running your own server. There is
a great FAQ on the OpenSim site as well. Other great resources are
the residents of OSGrid. Because they all had to connect their sims to
OSGrid themselves, they can be great technical resources.
