The following is the beginning of a series of columns on Linux
disasters and how to recover from them, inspired in part by a Halloween
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> Live episode titled &ldquo;Horror
Stories&rdquo;. You can watch the

</p><p>
Nothing teaches you about Linux like a good
disaster. Whether it's a hard
drive crash, a wayward <tt  >rm -rf</tt> command or fdisk mistakes, there are any
number of ways your normal day as a Linux user can turn into a nightmare.
Now, with that nightmare comes great opportunity: I've learned more about how
Linux works by accidentally breaking it and then having to fix it again,
than I ever have learned when everything was running smoothly. Believe me when I
say that the following series of articles on system recovery is hard-earned
knowledge.
</p><p>
Treated well, computer equipment is pretty reliable. Although I've experienced
failures in just about every major computer part over the years, the fact
is,
I've had more computers outlast their usefulness than not. That being
said, there's one computer component you can almost count on to fail
at some point&mdash;the hard drive. You can blame it on the fast-moving
parts, the vibration and heat inside a computer system or even a mistake
on a forklift at the factory, but when your hard drive fails prematurely,
no five-year warranty is going to make you feel better about all that lost
data you forgot to back up.
</p><p>
The most important thing you can do to protect yourself from a hard drive
crash (or really most Linux disasters) is back up your data. Back up your data!
Not even a good RAID system can protect you from all hard drive failures
(plus RAID doesn't protect you if you delete a file accidentally), so if the
data is important, be sure to back it up. Testing your backups is just as
important as backing up in the first place. You have not truly backed
up anything if you haven't tested restoring the backup. The methods I
list below for recovering data from a crashed hard drive are much more
time consuming than restoring from a backup, so if at all possible, back up
your data.
</p><p>
Now that I'm done with my lecture, let's assume that for some reason, one of
your hard drives crashed and you did not have a backup. All is not
necessarily lost. There are many different kinds of hard drive failure.
Now,
in a true hard drive crash, the head of the hard drive actually will crash
into the platter as it spins at high speed. I've seen platters after a head
crash that are translucent in sections as the head scraped off all of the
magnetic coating. If this has happened to you, no command I list here will
help you. Your only recourse will be one of the forensics firms out there
that specialize in hard drive recovery. When most people say their hard
drive has crashed, they are talking about a less extreme failure. Often, what
has happened is that the hard drive has developed a number of bad
blocks&mdash;so many that you cannot mount the filesystem&mdash;or in other
cases,
there is some different failure that results in I/O errors when you try to
read from the hard drive. In many of these circumstances, you can recover at
least some, if not most, of the data. I've been able to recover data from
drives that sounded <span   class="emphasis"><em>horrible</em></span> and other people had
completely written off, and it took only a few commands and a little
patience.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15b5580.0x16ad8d8"></a>
Create a Recovery Image</h2></div></div><p>
Hard drive recovery works on the assumption that not all of the data on the
drive is bad. Generally speaking, if you have bad blocks on a hard drive,
they often are clustered together. The rest of the data on the drive could
be fine if you could only access it. When hard drives start to die, they
often do it in phases, so you want to recover as much data as
quickly as possible. If a hard drive has I/O errors, you sometimes
can damage the data further if you run filesystem checks or other repairs on
the device itself. Instead, what you want to do is create a complete image
of the drive, stored on good media, and then work with that image.
</p><p>
A number of imaging tools are available for Linux&mdash;from the classic dd
program to advanced GUI tools&mdash;but the problem with most of them is that
they are designed to image healthy drives. The problem with unhealthy
drives is that when you attempt to read from a bad block, you will get an
I/O error, and most standard imaging tools will fail in some way when they
get an error. Although you can tell dd to ignore errors, it happily
will skip to the next block and write nothing for the block it can't read, so you
can end up with an image that's smaller than your drive. When you image an
unhealthy drive, you want a tool designed for the job. For Linux, that tool
is ddrescue.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15b5580.0x16ada90"></a>
ddrescue or dd_rescue</h2></div></div><p>
To make things a little confusing, there are two similar tools with
almost identical names. dd_rescue (with an underscore) is an older rescue
tool that still does the job, but it works in a fairly basic manner. It starts
at the beginning of the drive, and when it encounters errors, it retries a
number of times and then moves to the next block. Eventually (usually after
a few days), it reaches the end of the drive. Often bad blocks are clustered
together, and in the case when all of the bad blocks are near the beginning of
the drive, you could waste a lot of time trying to read them instead of
recovering all of the good blocks.
</p><p>
The ddrescue tool (no underscore) is part of the GNU Project and takes the
basic algorithm of dd_rescue further. ddrescue tries to recover all of the
good data from the device first and then divides and conquers the remaining
bad blocks until it has tried to recover the entire drive. Another added
feature of ddrescue is that it optionally can maintain a log file of what
it already has recovered, so you can stop the program and then resume
later right where you left off. This is useful when you believe ddrescue
has recovered the bulk of the good data. You can stop the program and make
a copy of the mostly complete image, so you can attempt to repair it, and
then start ddrescue again to complete the image.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15b5580.0x16adbf0"></a>
Prepare to Image</h2></div></div><p>
The first thing you will need when creating an image of your failed drive is
another drive of equal or greater size to store the image. If you plan to
use the second drive as a replacement, you probably will want to image
directly from one device to the next. However, if you just want to mount the
image and recover particular files, or want to store the image on an
already-formatted partition or want to recover from another computer, you
likely will create the image as a file. If you do want to image to a file,
your job will be simpler if you image one partition from the drive at a
time. That way, it will be easier to mount and fsck the image later.
</p><p>
The ddrescue program is available as a package (ddrescue in Debian
and Ubuntu), or you can download and install it from the project page. Note
that if you are trying to recover the main disk of a system, you 
clearly will need to recover either using a second system or find a rescue disk
that has ddrescue or can install it live (Knoppix fits the bill, for
instance). 
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15b5580.0x16add50"></a>
Run ddrescue</h2></div></div><p>
Once ddrescue is installed, it is relatively simple to run. The first
argument is the device you want to image. The second argument is the device
or file to which you want to image. The optional third argument is the path to a
log file ddrescue can maintain so that it can resume. For our example,
let's say I have a failing hard drive at /dev/sda and have mounted a large
partition to store the image at /mnt/recovery/. I would run the following
command to rescue the first partition on /dev/sda:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo ddrescue /dev/sda1 /mnt/recovery/sda1_image.img
/mnt/recovery/logfile
Press Ctrl-C to interrupt
Initial status (read from logfile)
rescued:        0 B,  errsize:   0 B,  errors:       0
Current status
rescued:  349372 kB,  errsize:   0 B,  current rate: 19398 kB/s
   ipos:  349372 kB,   errors:   0,    average rate: 16162 kB/s
   opos:  349372 kB
</pre>
</p><p>
Note that you need to run ddrescue with root privileges. Also notice that I
specified /dev/sda1 as the source device, as I wanted to image to a file.
If I were going to output to another hard drive device (like /dev/sdb), I
would have specified /dev/sda instead. If there were more than one
partition on this drive that I wanted to recover, I would repeat this command
for each partition and save each as its own image.
</p><p>
As you can see, a great thing about ddrescue is that it gives you constantly
updating output, so you can gauge your progress as you rescue the
partition.
In fact, in some circumstances, I prefer using ddrescue over dd for regular
imaging as well, just for the progress output. Having constant progress
output additionally is useful when considering how long it can take to rescue a
failing drive. In some circumstances, it even can take a few days,
depending on the size of the drive, so it's good to know how far along you
are.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15b5580.0x16ae010"></a>
Repair the Image Filesystem</h2></div></div><p>
Once you have a complete image of your drive or partition, the next step is
to repair the filesystem. Presumably, there were bad blocks and areas that
ddrescue could not recover, so the goal here is to attempt to repair enough
of the filesystem so you at least can mount it. Now, if you had imaged
to another hard drive, you would run the fsck against individual partitions
on the drive. In my case, I created an image file, so I can run fsck directly
against the file:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo fsck -y /mnt/recovery/sda1_image.img
</pre>
</p><p>
I'm assuming I will encounter errors on the filesystem, so I added the -y
option, which will make fsck go ahead and attempt to repair all of the errors
without prompting me.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15b5580.0x16ae1c8"></a>
Mount the Image</h2></div></div><p>
Once the fsck has completed, I can attempt to mount the filesystem and
recover my important files. If you imaged to a complete hard drive
and want to try to boot from it, after you fsck each partition, you would
try to mount them individually and see whether you can read from them, and then
swap the drive into your original computer and try to boot from it. In my
example here, I just want to try to recover some important files from this
image, 
so I would mount the image file loopback:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo mount -o loop /mnt/recovery/sda1_image.img /mnt/image
</pre>
</p><p>
Now I can browse through /mnt/image and hope that my important files
weren't among the corrupted blocks.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15b5580.0x16ae3d8"></a>
Method of Last Resort</h2></div></div><p>
Unfortunately in some cases, a hard drive has far too many errors for fsck
to correct. In these situations, you might not even be able to mount the
filesystem at all. If this happens, you aren't necessarily completely out of
luck. Depending on what type of files you want to recover, you may be able
to pull the information you need directly from the image. If, for instance,
you have a critical term paper or other document you need to retrieve from
the machine, simply run the strings command on the image and output to a
second file:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo strings /mnt/recovery/sda1_image.img &gt;
/mnt/recovery/sda1_strings.txt
</pre>
</p><p>
The sda1_strings.txt file will contain all of the text from the image
(which might turn out to be a lot of data) from man page entries to config
files to output within program binaries. It's a lot of data to sift
through,
but if you know a keyword in your term paper, you can open up this text
file in <tt  >less</tt>, and then press the / key and type your
keyword in to see whether it
can be found. Alternatively, you can grep through the strings file for your
keyword and the surrounding lines. For instance, if you were writing a term
paper on dolphins, you could run:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo grep -C 1000 dolphin /mnt/recovery/sda1_strings.txt &gt;
/mnt/recovery/dolphin_paper.txt
</pre>
</p><p>
This would not only pull out any lines containing the word dolphin, it
also would pull out the surrounding 1,000 lines. Then, you can just browse
through the dolphin_paper.txt file and remove lines that aren't part of
your paper. You might need to tweak the -C argument in grep so that it
grabs even more lines.
</p><p>
In conclusion, when your hard drive starts to make funny noises and won't
mount, it isn't necessarily the end of the world. Although ddrescue is no
replacement for a good, tested backup, it still can save the day when
disaster strikes your hard drive. Also note that ddrescue will work on just
about any device, so you can use it to attempt recovery on those scratched
CD-ROM discs too.
