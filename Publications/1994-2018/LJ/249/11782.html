Renewal</h4><p>
Sorry guys, I just can't hack reading PDF files. When you switched,
you effectively stopped me from renewing when my subscription finally
ran out. My eyes are worn out from sitting in front of a computer ten
hours a day and spending another hour or more reading the PDF just doesn't
cut it. I'll go to purchasing a CD every couple years instead, thank you
very much. I realize it probably saved the mag and increased revenue,
but I am just not cut out to be a subscriber to a PDF. It won't stack
up on my shelf and allow me to thumb through it.

I'm not sure if you are specifically talking about the PDF version, or
if you are referring to all the digital formats. Although the PDF does visually
resemble the print magazine more than the other formats, EPUB and Mobi are
often the better choice for reading the content, especially on smaller
devices. With the Mobi version, it's possible to read <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span> on
an E Ink Kindle, for instance. Either way, I'm sorry the experience has
been unpleasant for you. Hopefully in the future, some combination of
hardware and format will bring you back.&mdash;Shawn Powers

EdgeRouter Lite</h4><p>
It's great that you sing the praises of the EdgeRouter Lite to your readers,
but be ready to point them to the community-provided fix when it
stops working. [See Shawn Powers' &ldquo;EdgeRouter Lite&rdquo; piece in
the October 2014 UpFront section.]
</p><p>
Part of the cost-saving has been achieved through using a poor quality
USB stick as the Flash memory. Many, including mine, start to die after
a year of read/write operations. When it does, it is a simple fix, but
you need to get yourself a serial cable, a new USB drive of the correct
size and head over to the community forum for dmbaturin's rescue kit.
</p><p>
Best to be prepared, or you might spend a week without a network while
you work out what's happening.

I haven't experienced any issues, and as such, haven't had to look for
fixes. So thank you very much for pointing me and our fellow readers
to the fix! (Open Source communities, we really do make the world a
better place.)&mdash;Shawn Powers

I'm Back</h4><p>
I had a subscription for many years to the print edition. I really
enjoyed all of the articles, and over all, the journal helped me in my
everyday administration of Linux servers in my company. Well, things
change, and I let my subscription go.
</p><p>
But, now I'm back. I just subscribed again last night, and I'm going
through some of the old editions. While I must admit I do like having a
paper version, I find the EPUB editions work very nicely on my Kobo
e-reader. I was a little skeptical at first, but since I moved from paper
books to e-books, I thought I would give it a go. Of course, I don't get the
pictures in colour, but that's no a big deal.
</p><p>
I just wanted to say thanks for keeping the magazine alive and well. I know
digital-only isn't everyone's cup of tea, but it's better than just closing
the doors.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Stephen   <br><br>
</p><p>
Thank you Stephen, and welcome back! I'm still nostalgic for the paper
version of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>, but I'd be lying if I didn't admit the digital
versions have some advantages over the dead-tree variety. And whether
it's a full-color PDF on a big 10" tablet, or the Mobi version on a
Kindle Paperwhite under the covers at night, having <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span> with
me everywhere is pretty awesome.&mdash;Shawn Powers

Dave Taylor's daysago.sh</h4><p>
I've only just recently been able to catch up on a stack of back issues,
and Dave Taylor's efforts to calculate the number of days between dates
(see Dave's column in the July to September 2014 issues) has been excruciating to watch, to say the least. There
are much more clever ways to go about this.
</p><p>
The key is to find a way to map dates onto consecutive integers. Zeller's
Congruence (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeller%27s_congruence" target="_self">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeller%27s_congruence</a>) is one way
to do it that has existed since the 1880s; I have implemented a slightly
modified version below. Once you have such a function, calculating days
between dates or the day of the week for a particular date becomes trivial:


<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/sh

# Calculate the number of days to the given date,
#  starting from March 1 "year 0"
zeller () {
    year=$1
    month=$2
    day=$3

    # Adjust the year and month so that the "year" 
    # starts on March 1, and
    # therefore the "leap day" occurs at the end of 
    # the year.
    year=$(( $year + ($month+9)/12 - 1 ))
    month=$(( ($month+9) % 12 ))
    # Calculate the number of days to the 
    # start of the given "year"
    leap_val=$(( ($year*365 + $year/4 - $year/100) 
     &#8618;+ $year/400))
    zeller_val=$(($leap_val + $month*30 + 
     &#8618;(6*$month+5)/10 + $day + 1))
}

# Get today's date
eval $(date "+thismon=%m;thisday=%d;thisyear=%Y")

# Calculate its zeller value
zeller $thisyear $thismon $thisday
ztoday=$zeller_val
echo Zeller value for $thisyear-$thismon-$thisday 
 &#8618;is $ztoday

# Do the same thing for the given date
zeller $1 $2 $3
echo Zeller value for $1-$2-$3 is $zeller_val

# Show the difference
echo difference is $(($ztoday - $zeller_val)) days
</pre>

<span   class="bold"><b>Dave Taylor replies:</b></span>
Sorry that you find my column excruciating, David, but we each know only so
much and then just push ahead from there. I've never heard of
Zeller's Congruence, but it's definitely interesting. Your code is
definitely more efficient than mine.
</p><p>
Do keep in mind, however, that my column has never been about &ldquo;the
optimal solution for a problem&rdquo;, something that's rarely a shell
script at all, but rather &ldquo;the process of solving a problem within the
shell&rdquo;. I'm interested in the journey far more than the destination
from a philosophical perspective.
</p><p>
Hope that clarifies things, and thanks again for your sample code.

ZFS and BTRFS</h4><p>
I read Russell Coker's article covering ZFS and BTRFS in the September 2014
issue, but the quoted passage
below doesn't make sense:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
ZFS supports even greater redundancy via the copies= option. If you
specify copies=2 for a filesystem, then every data block will be
written to two different parts of the disk. The number of copies of
metadata will be one greater than the number of copies of data, so
copies=2 means that there will be three copies of every metadata
block. The maximum number of copies for data blocks in ZFS is three,
which means that the maximum number of copies of metadata is four.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
The last sentence is plain wrong. Each ZFS block is limited to a
maximum of three copies.
</p><p>
I'm no ZFS expert nor a ZFS developer, but I think I strongly believe
the ZFS copies property works like this:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Number of data blocks for ordinary files: <tt  >min(copies,
3)</tt>.
</p></li><li><p>
Number of data blocks for directories: <tt  >min(copies+1,
3)</tt>.
</p></li><li><p>
Number of data blocks for metadata: <tt  >min(copies+2,
3)</tt>.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
That is, with copies=1, ordinary files are stored once, directories
are stored twice, and metadata are stored three times.
</p><p>
With copies=2, ordinary files are stored twice, and both directories
and metadata are stored three times.
</p><p>
With copies=3, all of the ordinary files, directories and metadata, are
stored three times.

Long Live EPUBs</h4><p>
Just a word of thanks, for the interesting content first of all, but more
important, for the choice of format that make a real difference to me.
It was about a year ago that I was first tempted to try out a subscription to
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>, having generally abandoned magazine reading over the past
few years while living in a place with no chance of receiving physical
media. What finally made me a subscriber was your offer of non-DRM
EPUB files. It's now a piece of cake on the first of every month to
download the EPUB and transfer it to my e-reader, Android tablet and
a backup on my hard drive. It works great and ensures that I have great
reading material even where there's no network connection. To those
who say the world of magazine publishing has come to an end, a great
user experience like this one is a good reminder that it's just beginning!
Raising a glass to the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> team for many years of success
and an epub every month.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Randall Wood  <br><br>
</p><p>
Thank you for the kind words, Randall!
</p><p>
One of the best things about the switch to digital was the ability to
offer several formats, and releasing them to all our readers via e-mail,
app and so on. And we respect our readers enough that we wouldn't wrap the
issues in DRM&mdash;that only causes frustration for the folks we consider
family. Plus, it would be a bit strange when I had to write an article
on stripping DRM from our own magazine, LOL!&mdash;Shawn Powers
