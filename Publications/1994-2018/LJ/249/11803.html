Vagrant can be overwhelming, but don't let that stop you from taking
advantage of this awesome tool.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x139c580.0x1494358"></a></h2></div></div><p>
I admit it, some tools confuse me. I know they must be amazing, because
programs don't get popular by being dumb (well, reality TV, but that's
another story). I have the same sort of confusion with Vagrant that I
have with Wine, Docker, Chef and countless other amazing tools people
constantly rave about. So in this article, I'm going to break down Vagrant into
its simplest form.
</p><p>
Don't get me wrong, I could follow along with the tutorials and get a
virtual machine running by typing the magic <tt  >vagrant
up</tt> command. The
thing is, I really don't like magic when it comes to computers. I like
to know what is happening, why it's happening and where to look when
things go wrong. Ultimately that's my goal, to be able to fix it when
it breaks. Without an understanding of how things truly work, it gets
really scary when the magic button quits working.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x139c580.0x14945c0"></a>
What It Is</h2></div></div><p>
Simply put, Vagrant is a front end to an underlying virtualization
program. By default, the back-end program is VirtualBox, although Vagrant
can work with other underlying virtualization systems. This realization
was important for me, because the line between what had to be inside
VirtualBox and what Vagrant actually did on its own was murky. If you
use Vagrant, you don't ever need to start VirtualBox&mdash;truly. It won't
hurt anything if you do start it, but Vagrant uses VirtualBox more like
a tool than a system.
</p><p>
Another reason this is important is because it means there is no
intermingled dependencies between Vagrant and VirtualBox. By that I mean
you can take your Vagrantfiles to another computer, and it will work
just fine. It simply will use the copy of VirtualBox you have installed
on the new computer and work exactly the same.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x139c580.0x1494720"></a>
When Does It Make Sense to Use Vagrant?</h2></div></div><p>
Much like brushing your teeth with a hairbrush doesn't make much sense,
using Vagrant for setting up your permanent data center might not be
the best idea. Sure, you could use it, but Vagrant really excels at
building VMs very fast and destroying them when you're finished. In fact,
most people use Vagrant for one of two things: creating a development
environment to test their code and creating temporary servers on demand
when the workload requires it.
</p><p>
One of the nice side effects of using Vagrant is that it forces you to
think of your persistent data as separate from your server. I've found
that even in situations where I'm not using Vagrant, I'm now smarter about
making sure my data isn't dependent on a single point of failure. An
example is my /usr/local/bin folder. Most of my machines have tons of
little scripts I've written that live in the /usr/local/bin folder. Since
I've been using Vagrant, I think about my scripts as something that
should be accessible by my machines, but maybe not stored in the local
file space on a server. Sure, I have backups, but if I can keep my data
separate from my server filesystem, moving to a new server is much easier.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x139c580.0x14948d8"></a>
What It Actually Does</h2></div></div><p>
I already mentioned that Vagrant is a front end to VirtualBox. Of course,
VirtualBox already has a command-line interface, but Vagrant is far
more powerful. Rather than install an operating system, Vagrant takes a
&ldquo;template&rdquo; of a fully installed machine and creates a clone. That means
you can have a fully running system in seconds instead of going through
the installation process. The &ldquo;templates&rdquo; are referred to as
&ldquo;boxes&rdquo; in
the Vagrant world, and there's no need to make your own. You can download
generic boxes of most Linux distributions, which means zero setup time.
</p><p>
There are three main pieces to the Vagrant puzzle. Figure 1 shows a diagram
of those parts and their connection to each other.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11803f1.large.jpg"><img src="11803f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. There are really only two locations to worry about: the 
.vagrant.d folder in your home directory and the project folder you
create.
</p></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>1) The Virtualization System:</b></span>
</p><p>
By default, this is VirtualBox. It is the engine that makes Vagrant boxes
work, but it doesn't keep track of any VM files or configuration. It's
a bit like using Python. The Python executable needs to be installed,
but it's just an interpreter that executes the Python code. With Vagrant,
it's the same sort of thing. VirtualBox is just the program Vagrant uses
to run its own code. If VirtualBox is installed, your work is done.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>2) The .vagrant.d Folder:</b></span>
</p><p>
This actually took me a while to figure out. Those &ldquo;boxes&rdquo; I mentioned
earlier are downloaded to this folder so that when you create a new VM,
it doesn't have to re-download the box, it just uses your local cached
copy. Once I knew where the folder was, it was easier to fix things
when I messed up. I tend to learn by experimentation, and so I invariably
break things. At first, I couldn't figure out how to get rid of the boxes
I incorrectly downloaded, but clearing them out of the .vagrant.d folder
in my home directory did the trick.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
3) The Project Folder:</b></span>
</p><p>
My favorite feature of Vagrant is that every VM lives inside its own
folder. Everything to do with the VM is in that folder, so you don't have
to worry about the configuration file being in one folder, the hard drive
image being in another folder and so on. The folder can also be created anywhere,
and it functions independently from other project folders. They don't even
depend on the original &ldquo;box&rdquo; once they're created, because the box is
cloned into the project folder when you create the Vagrant instance.
</p><p>
The project folder contains the Vagrantfile, which is the single
configuration file for the virtual machine. It contains the settings
for what type of hardware you want to have VirtualBox use (how much RAM and
so on), and it can contain startup scripts that will customize your VM as
it is created. In fact, a common thing to do with the Vagrantfile is to
start Chef and automatically configure the entire machine from a Chef
server! Thankfully, the Vagrantfile can be very simple, and Vagrant
creates one for you by default the first time you create a VM.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x139c580.0x1495170"></a>
The Step-by-Step Process</h2></div></div><p>
I'm almost to the point where most Web tutorials start, which is
to create a VM with Vagrant. Now that you know what Vagrant is doing,
the process is far more interesting and less mysterious. Here is the
step-by-step process:
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
1) Install VirtualBox and Vagrant:</b></span>
</p><p>
On a Debian-based distro like Ubuntu, you simply type:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo apt-get install vagrant virtualbox
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x139c580.0x14953d8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
and allow the programs to be installed. There's no need to open
VirtualBox, just have it installed.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
2) Download a Box File:</b></span>
</p><p>
This is how you populate the .vagrant.d folder in your home directory
with a template or box file. To choose what box you want, head over
to <a href="http://vagrantbox.es" target="_self">vagrantbox.es</a>, and copy the URL of whatever base you want to
start with. Lots of contributed boxes are available, so pick one
that makes sense for you, and copy the URL to your clipboard. Then, to
get the box to your local cache, type:


<pre     class="programlisting">
vagrant box add NAME http://example.com/boxurl/mybox.box
</pre>
</p><p>
Note that <tt  >NAME</tt> is just an arbitrary name that you pick to name your
box. If you go with an Ubuntu 14.04 image, you could name it something
like &ldquo;trusty64&rdquo; so you can reference it easily later. The command will
download the box file and store it with whatever name you chose.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
3) Create a Project Folder:</b></span>
</p><p>
Somewhere on your system, create a folder for the VM. It truly can be
anywhere. I usually make it on my desktop at first, so I easily can see
it&mdash;basically:

<pre     class="programlisting">
mkdir ~/Desktop/myfirstvm
</pre>
</p><p>
Then, switch into that folder:

<pre     class="programlisting">
cd ~/Desktop/myfirstvm
</pre>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>4) Initialize Your Vagrant Image:</b></span>
</p><p>
Now you simply type:

<pre     class="programlisting">
vagrant init NAME
</pre>
</p><p>
The vagrant program will create a Vagrantfile with a default
configuration. Basically, it contains information on what box file to use
when creating the VM. If you want to do advanced configuration on the
Vagrantfile (I'll touch on that later), you can edit it, but by default,
it will work with the file untouched.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
5) Start Your VM:</b></span>
</p><p>
The VM configuration file has been created in the myfirstvm folder,
but the VM hasn't been created yet. In order to do that, type:

<pre     class="programlisting">
vagrant up
</pre>
</p><p>
Note that you have to be inside the myfirstvm folder in order to have
this work. Because you could have multiple folders with VMs (mysecondvm,
for instance), the only way to tell Vagrant what VM you want to start is
to be in the correct folder. Vagrant now will create a virtual machine
based on the box file you downloaded earlier. The virtual hard drive
and all configuration files will be stored in a folder called .vagrant
inside the myfirstvm folder (refer back to Figure 1 for details). On
the screen, you will see the computer starting, and once it's all set,
you have a fully running VM.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>6) Do Something with Your VM:</b></span>
</p><p>
This was another stumbling point for me. I had a running VM, but how to
interact with it? Thankfully, Vagrant offers a cool feature, namely
SSH. Still inside that myfirstvm folder, type:

<pre     class="programlisting">
vagrant ssh
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x139c580.0x188e128"></a></h2></div></div><p>
and you will be logged in via SSH to the running VM! Even though you
don't know any passwords on the machine, you always can access it via the
<tt  >vagrant ssh</tt> command because Vagrant automatically creates a keypair that
allows you to log in without entering a password. Once you're logged in,
you can do whatever you want on the system, including changing passwords,
installing software and so on.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
7) Manipulate Your VM:</b></span>
</p><p>
After you exit out of your VM, you'll drop back into your local machine
inside the myfirstvm folder. The VM still is running, but you can do
other things with Vagrant:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
<tt  >vagrant halt</tt> &mdash; shuts down the VM.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >vagrant suspend</tt> &mdash; pauses the VM.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >vagrant resume</tt> &mdash; resumes a paused VM.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >vagrant destroy</tt> &mdash; erases the VM (not the
Vagrantfile).
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x139c580.0x188e808"></a>
Where to Go from Here</h2></div></div><p>
I hope that makes the Vagrant workflow clear. If it seems simple
enough, but not terribly useful, that's about all the basics will get
you. Although it's cool to be able to create and destroy VMs so quickly,
by itself, the process isn't very useful. Thankfully, Vagrant bakes in
a few other awesome features. I already mentioned the <tt  >vagrant
ssh</tt>
command that allows you to SSH in to the VM instantly, but that is only
the tip of the iceberg.
</p><p>
First, you have the /vagrant folder inside the VM. This is a folder that
is mounted automatically inside the running VM, and it points to the
project folder itself on the main system. So any files you store in
&ldquo;myfirstvm&rdquo; alongside the Vagrantfile will be accessible from inside the
VM in the /vagrant folder. What makes that useful is that you can destroy
the VM, create a new VM, and the files in your project folder won't be
erased. That is convenient if you want to have persistent data that isn't
destroyed when you do a <tt  >vagrant destroy</tt>, but it's even more useful when
you combine it with the scripting capability of the Vagrantfile itself.
</p><p>
Admittedly, it gets a little complicated, but the Vagrantfile can be
edited using basic Ruby language to automate the creation and bootup of
the VM. Here's a simple example of an edited Vagrantfile:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# Sample Vagrantfile with startup script
VAGRANTFILE_API_VERSION = "2"
Vagrant.configure(VAGRANTFILE_API_VERSION) do |config|
config.vm.box = "NAME"
config.vm.provision :shell, path: "startup.sh"
end
</pre>
</p><p>
The only line I added was the config.vm.provision line. The other
lines were created automatically when I initially typed <tt  >vagrant
init</tt>. Basically, what the provision statement does is tell Vagrant that
once it starts the VM to execute the startup.sh script. Where does it
find the startup.sh file? In that shared space, namely the
&ldquo;myfirstvm&rdquo;
folder. So create a file in your myfirstvm folder alongside the
Vagrantfile itself called startup.sh:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# This is the startup.sh file called by Vagrantfile
apt-get update
apt-get install -y apache2
</pre>
</p><p>
Make sure the file is executable:

<pre     class="programlisting">
chmod +x startup.sh
</pre>
</p><p>
Then, have Vagrant create a new VM. If you haven't &ldquo;destroyed&rdquo;
the existing VM, do that, and then type <tt  >vagrant up</tt> to create a new
one. This time, you should see the machine get created and booted, but
you also should see the system download and install Apache, because it
executes the startup.sh file on boot!
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x139c580.0x188ee90"></a>
That Was the Light-Bulb Moment for Me</h2></div></div><p>
Once I understood how Vagrant can call a script when it creates the VM,
I started to realize just how powerful and automated Vagrant can
be. And
truly, that's just scratching the surface of the things you can do with
the Vagrantfile commands. Using that file, you can customize the settings
of the VM itself (RAM, CPU and so on); you can create port-forward settings so
you can access the Vagrant VM's ports by connecting to your local system's
ports (that's actually how <tt  >vagrant ssh</tt> works); and you can 
configure a VM fully by running a program like Chef when the VM is created.
</p><p>
Vagrant isn't the perfect tool for every job, but if you need a fast,
highly configurable virtual machine that can be automated and scripted,
it might be the right tool for you. Once I understood how Vagrant
worked, it seemed much less like a magic button and much more like an
awesome tool. And if you totally mess up your configuration files while
you're experimenting? Just erase the files in your /home/user/.vagrant.d/
folder and start with a fresh project folder. All the configuration is
done inside the Vagrantfile itself, and even that is created for you
automatically when you type <tt  >vagrant init</tt>.
</p><p>
If you want to learn more about the various advanced options Vagrant
offers, check out its very nicely organized documentation site:
<a href="https://docs.vagrantup.com/v2" target="_self">https://docs.vagrantup.com/v2</a>. At the very least, try the
example I showed
here. It's really cool to see how fast and automated Vagrant makes
the entire virtualization experience.
