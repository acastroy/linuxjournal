MetaCase's MetaEdit+</h2></div></div><p>
The new v5.1 release of MetaEdit+ from MetaCase adds a wide range of new features to
the company's flagship domain-specific modeling and code generation tool. MetaEdit+ 5.1 is
aimed at expert developers who seek to generate efficient, complete code directly from
domain-specific models. MetaCase notes the advantages of MetaEdit+, which gives language
engineers the means to create graphical domain-specific languages and code generators in a
few hours. The new MetaEdit+ offers collaboration for both language creation and use:
multiple team members can define domain-specific modeling languages together and share
them instantly to the whole team. As a result, domain-specific languages created by
different language engineers can be integrated, tested and shared easily. MetaCase further
notes the advantages of collaboration in language development, for which MetaEdit+ 5.1
offers &ldquo;unparalleled support&rdquo;, for improving both the quality and acceptance of
domain-specific languages. Versions of MetaEdit+ are available for Linux, Windows and Mac
OS X.

Panasas ActiveStor</h2></div></div><p>
Though the claim about its new ActiveStor 16 appears counterintuitive, Panasas says it's
real. The company promises that the ActiveStor 16 hybrid scale-out NAS appliance delivers
an industry first: performance that increases with scale alongside enterprise-grade
reliability that improves at scale. With help from the company's most advanced storage
operating system release to date, PanFS 6.0, ActiveStor eliminates the fundamental
compromises between performance, capacity and reliability that storage users 
previously have come to accept, states the company. The means to reach the increased
performance results from the ActiveStor 16 appliance's 50% increase in storage density and
from PanFS 6.0's delivery of RAID 6+ triple-parity data protection for a 150x increase in
reliability over dual-parity products.

SUSE Linux Enterprise</h2></div></div><p>
More than six years have passed since the last major release of SUSE Linux Enterprise, but the
company says that it is worth the wait. The SUSE Linux Enterprise 12 platform release,
with its array of operating systems and extensions, is now available. The most notable
innovations are to be found in SUSE Linux Enterprise Server for x86_64, IBM Power Systems
and IBM System z. A feature sampling includes full system rollback, live-kernel patching
ability, software modules, integration of both BTRFS and XFS filesystems, more advanced
Linux containers technology and the Docker framework as an integral part of the OS. Also
noteworthy is the updated customer portal, the SUSE Customer Center, which features a new
dashboard that simplifies subscriptions, access to patches and updates and communication
with SUSE customer support. Finally, SUSE integration with Microsoft now will be easier as
well thanks to a new Virtual Machine driver pack for Windows servers. The upshot of the
these and many other additions, says SUSE, is that the new platform helps enterprises stay
agile, reclaim budget and easily leverage future open-source innovation, helping them
compete more effectively.

Bruce A. Tate, Fred Daoud, Ian Dees and Jack Moffitt's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Seven More Languages in
Seven Weeks</em></span> (Pragmatic Programmers)</h2></div></div><p>
The publisher Pragmatic Programmers compares programming languages to spoken languages.
Both can make you smarter and give you new tools and abstractions to address problems that
come your way. They add that if you make the commitment to read books like <span   class="emphasis"><em>Seven More
Languages in Seven Weeks: Languages That Are Shaping the Future</em></span>, you will experience
profound change in how you perform. And how you perform over time will require
&ldquo;radical improvement&rdquo;, because the industry is changing in profound
ways&mdash;that is, from
object-oriented to functional languages. The publisher says that with this book, it aims
higher than simply a &ldquo;Hello, World&rdquo; treatment, instead taking readers on a
step-by-step journey through the most important paradigms of our time. This profound
journey occurs through exploration of the Lua, Factor, Elixir, Elm, Julia, MiniKanren and
Idris languages.

Charles Platt's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Encyclopedia of Electronic Components</em></span>, Volume 2 (Maker Media/O'Reilly
Media)</h2></div></div><p>
If you are anything like the geek writing this blurb, you see books like Charles Platt's
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Encyclopedia of Electronic Components</em></span>, Volume 2, and you feel an insatiable instinct to
browse. This second book of a three-volume set covers signal processing, including LEDs,
LCDs, audio, thyristors, digital logic and amplification. Photographs, schematics and
diagrams are included. Readers will learn what each component does, how it works, why it's
useful and what variants exist. No matter how much readers know about electronics, says
publisher Maker Media, they'll find fascinating details they've never come across before.
The <span   class="emphasis"><em>Encyclopedia</em></span> is targeted at teachers, hobbyists, engineers and students of all ages
and abilities who seek reliable, fact-checked information right at their fingertips.

Thinlabs Device Manager</h2></div></div><p>
Administering your thin-client or PC environment is the job of the upgraded Thinlabs
Device Manager 4.0, a solution for Linux and Windows embedded systems. TDM 4.0 features an
intuitive graphical interface powerful enough to manage both PCs and thin clients over a
LAN, large multi-site WAN or isolated devices behind a NAT firewall router. Advances
vis-&agrave;-vis the previous edition include remote script deployment and execution, automatic
provisioning of new or existing devices using profiles and silent software distribution.
TDM 4.0 is included with all Thinlabs integrated thin clients and thin-client computers or
is also available on a per-site or per-seat license model with non-Thinlabs products.

Zentyal Server</h2></div></div><p>
What is slick about Zentyal Server 4.0 is that it integrates both Samba and OpenChange
technologies, enabling native support for mixed IT environments that include Linux,
Windows and Mac OS clients, as well as mobile devices with ActiveSync. Therefore, Zentyal
Server 4.0 is able to offer full native Microsoft Outlook compatibility without plugins or
connectors. Zentyal says that the Small Business Server can be set up in less than 30
minutes and is both easy to use and affordable. Complementary to the version 4 release's
mail and mail-related directory features, other improvements also have been added, such as
a restructured and improved L2TP module, free configuration backup in the cloud via the
Zentyal Server UI and quality-assurance processes that improve the stability of product
releases.
