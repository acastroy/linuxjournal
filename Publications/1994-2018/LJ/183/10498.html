Blackmagic Design's Broadcast and Post-Production Products</h2></div></div><p>
The company Blackmagic Design recently announced a wholesale move to
the Linux platform of its formerly Windows- and Mac OS-only products.
Linux support was added to the new Media Express 2.0, a video capture
and playback software application compatible with all Blackmagic Design
DeckLink, Multibridge and Intensity products. This new version is a major
update that adds support for direct capture and playback of DPX, AVI and
QuickTime files, as well as list-based batch capture and playback, plus
a major UI overhaul. Also adding Linux support are the DeckLinux
(video cards), Intensity (HDMI/analog editing component) and Multibridge
(external capture and playback solution) products. A free, cross-platform
SDK is included. Finally, the DeckLink Optical Fiber, which Blackmagic
calls &ldquo;the world's first 10-bit SD/HD broadcast capture card with both
optical fiber SDI and regular SDI&rdquo;, now has a Linux driver and SDK.
The card is designed for high-end broadcast and post-production customers
who work in large facilities needing lots of creative workstation seats
and seek to use both types of cabling.

PureCM</h2></div></div><p>
Software development companies should take note of the new PureCM 2009-1,
a Software Configuration Management (SCM) solution that controls, tracks
and visualizes changes to digital assets. PureCM facilitates software
development in team environments, accommodating best practices, such as
task-based version control, parallel development and build automation.
One key new feature involves greater advance insight into and control
of changes that need merging. Merge conflicts also can be resolved
pre-integration using a visual resolve tool. A second key feature is
a new and simplified cross-platform GUI, allowing developers to see
on which files their colleagues are currently working within their
private workspace. They also can preview their completed changes
before integrating them automatically into the workspace. PureCM
is cross-platform for Linux, Mac OS and Windows, and it offers native
integration with Eclipse and Visual Studio.

ASUS VH Series LCD Monitors</h2></div></div><p>
Greening your computing experience keeps getting easier, thanks to
the efforts of companies like ASUS, whose new VH Series LCD monitors
garnered a Gold rating under the EPEAT environmental standard. The VH
series offers five models with screen sizes ranging from 20"&ndash;24".
Each model has been certified by the EPEAT organization, which evaluates
PCs based on their environmental attributes. EPEAT's standards demand
exceptional performance in areas such as reduction or elimination
of hazardous materials, design for end of life, product longevity,
resource conservation, end-of-life management, corporate performance
and packaging. Gold is EPEAT's highest rating. ASUS says that with the
VH monitor series, it perfected new manufacturing techniques to reduce
mercury and utilize post-consumer recycled plastic without affecting
product performance and reliability.

Andy Lester's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Land the Tech Job You Love</em></span> (Pragmatic Bookshelf)</h2></div></div><p>
If you're laid off or stuck in a dead-end career, Andy Lester's new book
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Land the Tech Job You Love</em></span> from Pragmatic Bookshelf may land you a gig
that springs you out of bed each morning. The book will help techies learn the job-search techniques that
work for finding an fulfilling career. Lester claims that we techies have
a tougher time finding and winning the right job, because companies are
ever-more demanding and our competition is smart, tech-savvy and resourceful.
The reader will learn skills such as how to uncover hidden jobs that
never get publicized, perform effective social networking, craft an
effective r&eacute;sum&eacute;, understand the mindset of hiring managers and perform
well in interviews. The book is further peppered with real-life stories
about what works and hilarious tales of what doesn't.

Virident's GreenCloud Server Family</h2></div></div><p>
Virident recently released a new class of servers, which the firm says
&ldquo;is the first to be designed with the Internet in mind&rdquo;. The GreenCloud
Server Family is optimized to deliver high-performance, as well as energy-
and cost-efficient computing for data-centric, query-rich applications
that predominate in the Internet data center. The first two members
of the product line are GreenCloud Server for MySQL and for Memcached.
Each server is based on the GreenCloud Architecture, which, says
Virident, transforms an industry-standard server into a data-centric
&ldquo;in-memory server platform&rdquo;. The architecture allows applications to
&ldquo;directly interact with large volumes of data hosted in memory tightly
integrated into the CPU complex, which ensures optimal utilization
of all server elements&mdash;compute, memory and I/O&rdquo;. The resulting
&ldquo;Storage Class Memory&rdquo;, a new memory tier that bridges the performance and
persistence gap between main memory and mass storage in traditional server
architectures, works in tandem with a co-optimized software stack within
an industry-standard x86 server platform. The result, says Virident,
is &ldquo;orders of magnitude higher performance and previously unattainable
capabilities to data-centric applications&rdquo;.

JetBrains' TeamCity</h2></div></div><p>
And the award for most visually stimulating company name goes to
JetBrains, who recently released version 4.5 of TeamCity, a distributed
build management and continuous integration tool. JetBrains says
that with TeamCity, one can set up a build server within minutes and
enjoy out-of-the-box continuous unit testing, code-quality analysis
and early reporting on build problems&mdash;all without leaving the IDE.
Furthermore, TeamCity is &ldquo;the place to find all kinds of information about
your projects&mdash;from their current status and health, to the detailed
change history with metrics and statistical trends&rdquo;. The company also
cites TeamCity's gentle learning curve that allows users to 
improve release management practices quickly by gradually adopting its advanced
features and capabilities. New in version 4.5 are improved integration
with Visual Studio and Eclipse with added support for VCS systems, and 
enterprise-level features, such as user groups and LDAP support, and
multiple UI improvements.
