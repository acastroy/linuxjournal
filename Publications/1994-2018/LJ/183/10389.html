Turn a Western Digital MyBook II into a personalized,
portable Linux server.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28fb580.0x29f32a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
In the past few months, a small community has been budding around the
Western Digital MyBook II, a popular paperback-sized external hard drive.
It quickly was discovered that the Ethernet-capable version was powered by
an embedded Linux system, and a word-of-Web process started to break its
security to gain SSH access, install additional services, tune
functionality and more. It resembles the phenomenon spawned by the
hacking-friendly Linksys WRT54G, albeit on a smaller scale.
</p><p>
Thrilled by what I was seeing, I started to consider building a small
appliance of my own, and Western Digital's sudden revamping of its
product line brought the eBay prices of older models below the $100
mark, which converged nicely with my manager's request for a daily
backup scheme enabling downtimes of less than a day should the worst happen
to my laptop.
</p><p>
So, off I went, intent on hacking out my own Linux-based NAS. I acquired
two units: the smaller, single-drive 500GB model (less than $100
on eBay at the time of this writing) and a larger, RAID-capable, twin-drive model spanning one terabyte ($300 for a used unit). Given the
ever-falling prices of hardware and the expanding product offering, you
should be able to purchase these at lower prices or with larger capacities.
It also is worth noting that nothing prevents carefully opening up the
device's innards and replacing the enclosed SATA drives with larger-capacity ones. One final bit of shopping advice: the drives addressed in
this article are Ethernet-capable World Edition models,
all of which have entirely white cases.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28fb580.0x29f3510"></a>
The Hardware</h2></div></div><p>
Upon first inspection, the device resembles a small book, with a
perforated, Morse-code patterned edge that enables venting&mdash;if you
actually decode the message, you will find a few words and a couple
typos in it. The unit is rather silent and generates no more noise than
the average hard drive. The front of the device sports two concentric LED
rings, circling a single button used to power on and off the
device. In addition to showing the on/off state of the device, the
LEDs also are used to visualize disk activity as well as to provide
a stylish disk capacity gauge (Figure 1).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10389f1.large.jpg"><img src="10389f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. The Single-Drive Device Lurking on the Author's Desk
</p></div></div><p>
On the inside are one or two 500GB 7,200 RPM SATA drives and a small
board housing an Oxford Semiconductor 0XE800 ARM CPU with an ARM926EJ-S
core, a 32MB Hynix RAM chip and the Via Cicada Simpliphy vt6122 Gigabit
Ethernet chipset. The device also includes an externally accessible USB
port to supplement the RJ-45 Ethernet connector, and it supports AES-128
encryption in-hardware. Despite its limited RAM capacity, Linux's
conservative use of resources puts little bounds on the uses the device 
reasonably can be put to by your creativity. Do not plan to saturate the
Gigabit Ethernet link, however, because the CPU will not carry you much
beyond 5MB/sec&mdash;a limitation that does not affect single-user backup or
applications involving several users.
</p><p>
The drives are ext-3 formatted in the World Edition series, as NAS access
shields the predominant Windows and Macintosh user population from the
actual filesystem choice&mdash;a detail that is exceedingly convenient, as it
allows you to pull drives from the device and mount them in any Linux host
for recovery should the support board ever fail.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28fb580.0x29f38d8"></a>
First Packets</h2></div></div><p>
Initially, you need to boot in the &ldquo;World of Warcraft&rdquo; partition of your
system&mdash;the one running one of those proprietary operating
systems&mdash;and
install the Western Digital MioNet Access tools. You will need these
only for the initial step&mdash;to find out what IP address your as-of-yet
uncommunicative device has received from DHCP; you will not need the WD
tools afterward. If you have a network sniffer set up, it may be faster
for you simply to catch the DHCP assignment as it happens and save the
time of registration and download. You also can check your DHCP server
tables, if you have access to them, or simply read the data off the mounted
Windows share that will be set up once you install the tools. Either way,
once you are in possession of the IP address the device is using, you will
point a Web browser to it and configure the settings that the Web interface
exposes. You will be asked to provide authentication, which will match the
credentials you created during the WD setup process, or, if you used a more
exotic process, it will use the system defaults (&ldquo;admin&rdquo;, with a password
of &ldquo;123456&rdquo;).
</p><p>
The device's built-in WD Shared Storage Manager (Figure 2) is a very lightweight and
useful application, which you will leave enabled, even in this Linux-centric
setup, as a convenient way to create users and carry out the most common
configuration tasks. I recommend you take the time to configure most
settings exposed here as part of your initial customization, as the
convenience simply cannot be outdone. At a minimum, you should iterate over
the General Setup section and configure your device name and workgroup
(these configure Samba), date and time, and review your network settings.
As preparation for the next step, you need to create a user (File
Sharing&rarr;User Management) that you will use to log in at the console, as
access via your existing Web administrator account will not be permitted.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10389f2.large.jpg"><img src="10389f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. The built-in Web interface provides easy access to basic Samba
configuration.
</p></div></div><p>
One more change you should consider at this point is whether to
set up RAID. The device supports two modes of operation: data
striping (RAID 0), which has performance advantages and offers the total
capacity of both drives combined, and data mirroring (RAID 1), which
provides the storage capacity of only one of the drives but protects you
by creating two fully redundant copies of your data. The default
setting (Drive Management&rarr;Change Drive Type) is data striping&mdash;should
you want to change it, this is the time to do it. Once a RAID rebuild is
started, all data on the shared, nonsystem part of the drive will be lost.
More important, although the drive shares will become writable in a few
minutes while the rebuild is still underway, wait until it has
completed entirely as you will need to tinker with the device's firmware upgrade
path next (and triggering reboots while the RAID array is rebuilding is a
surefire way to tempt fate into bricking your device). Just let it run
overnight and come back to it the next morning. You can see whether the rebuild
has completed by checking the drive status in the Shared Storage Manager;
it will switch back from synchronizing to OK.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28fb580.0x29f3d50"></a>
Voiding Warranties</h2></div></div><p>
To start unlocking the multifaceted abilities of this wonderful device, you
first need to obtain console access. To be clear, this voids the
device's warranty, as Western Digital obviously is not in the business of
supporting Linux servers in all their possible configurations and software
options, and that kind of flexibility is precisely what we are
after. Bear
in mind that although these steps were researched and verified
conscientiously, the author and <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> accept no liability for
rendering your device inoperable as a result of these instructions&mdash;proceed at your own risk.
</p><p>
The WD Hacking community was spawned by Martin Hinner's creation of a
backdoor process that uses the drive's built-in firmware update process to
reset the device's root password, spawn the SSH d&aelig;mon and generate the
SSH host keys. Just like everyone else, let's head to Martin's Web page
(see Resources) and follow the instructions found there. In effect, all
you have to do is navigate to a URL on your device.
The URL includes a GET parameter for the upgrade script to run.
The parameter references a script on Martin's site,
but this script, rather than performing an upgrade, generates
SSH keys, clears the root password and starts the SSH d&aelig;mon.
</p><p>
Once the &ldquo;upgrade&rdquo; is initiated, you will not
receive feedback on the Web page that it has completed, and you 
probably should not do anything to your device in this interval, lest you rouse
those bricking fairies. Simply wait three minutes, then start attempting
to log in via SSH with the user (not administrator and not root)
account you created earlier in the Shared Storage Manager. As soon as you
see the SSH d&aelig;mon respond with a login prompt, you will know the
break-in succeeded. If you set up your
user account correctly, you will be able to log in. If you are having
trouble logging in, take care that your user name is spelled in CAPS
(<tt  >ssh
USER@ipaddress</tt>), as you will note that the user management Web interface
creates all accounts in that fashion. One more troubleshooting tip: the
latest firmware revisions actually output a message that the update has
failed, although the SSH d&aelig;mon has, in fact, been spawned successfully and is
ready for your connection.
</p><p>
Once successfully logged in to your device, you can escalate your
privileges by switching user to root (<tt  >su -</tt>) as the superuser password is
now blank. You will need to carry out a few tasks&mdash;the
first one of which is adding the SSH d&aelig;mon to the default startup
list to ensure that
your newly gained access lasts past your next reboot. Head to
/etc/inittab,
and add the following after the system startup section:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# Start a few good daemons
::sysinit:/usr/sbin/sshd
</pre>
</p><p>
After making your changes, make sure they have been written to disk
by doing a &ldquo;sync&rdquo;, and fix a few details of your user account, such as granting
yourself a home directory and possibly a lowercase user name. Do all your
/etc/passwd and /etc/shadow housekeeping before rebooting to verify that
the SSH d&aelig;mon is now spawning by default and that your user accounts are working as
intended.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28fb580.0x29f4220"></a>
Grand Tour</h2></div></div><p>
You're past the most difficult point; now you can proceed to explore the system and
tweak it to your heart's content. Unless you plan to use the MioNet
service, some recommend switching its d&aelig;mon off, as it is a Java process
that weighs on both CPU and RAM. As the MioNet service enables wide-area
file sharing, I elected to turn off the service, but to do so cleanly, in
case I decided I needed the functionality after all. Edit
/etc/init.d/post_network_start.sh, and comment out line 17 of the script:


<pre     class="programlisting">
    $SCRIPTS_PATH/crond.sh start
#    $SCRIPTS_PATH/mionet.sh start
    touch $POST_NETWORK_STARTED_FILE
</pre>
</p><p>
This stops the d&aelig;mon
from being spawned automatically at boot, but if you need its
services, you can start it up from the Shared Storage Manager interface
(General Setup&rarr;WD Anywhere Access) as needed, giving you the best of both
worlds.
</p><p>
The system is built around a 2.6.17.14 kernel, with BusyBox
centralizing many of the command-line tools. There are no man pages, but
the system is an otherwise reasonable minimal Linux instance, including the
majority of the common management levers (ps, top, free, ifconfig, wget and
so on) as well as a development toolchain with all the trimmings (gcc 3.4.2,
gmake and so on), enabling you to build any software that may be missing. The
mounts show a good picture of the device:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# df -h
Filesystem   Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
rootfs       2.8G  277M  2.4G  11% /
/dev/root    2.8G  277M  2.4G  11% /
/dev/md3     950M   19M  884M   3% /var
/dev/md4     455G  199M  455G   1% /shares/internal
</pre>
</p><p>
It also is worth mentioning that on the dual-drive unit, the system
partitions are mirrored by default, regardless of the RAID state of the
share space:

<pre     class="programlisting">

# cat /proc/mdstat
Personalities : [linear] [raid1]
md1 : active raid1 sdb1[1] sda1[0]
     2939776 blocks [2/2] [UU]

md2 : active raid1 sdb2[1] sda2[0]
     104320 blocks [2/2] [UU]

md3 : active raid1 sdb3[1] sda3[0]
     987904 blocks [2/2] [UU]

md4 : active linear sdb4[1] sda4[0]
     1945407104 blocks 64k rounding

unused devices: &lt;none&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
Another important detail is the behavior of the power button: regulated by
a small d&aelig;mon also controlling the LEDs, it will bring the device down
performing a proper reboot if pressed for two seconds, or it will cause a soft
shutdown if held for four seconds&mdash;train yourself to recognize the light schemes by
looking at the device when you issue software reboots (the device has a
hard reset button on the back were it to become seriously wedged). Besides
looking wicked cool, the LED rings visualize both disk activity and
available disk space, as well as RAID failures, joining form and
function.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28fb580.0x29f4640"></a>
Network and Discovery</h2></div></div><p>
If you followed my advice to set the device name and workgroup earlier,
your hostname is taken care of already. The device boots in DHCP mode by
default, which can be altered easily for those who want a tiny,
power-conscious but rather homebound server at their disposal. I find the
greatest promise of the WDMBII in its easy mobility, however, and that poses
the question of how to recognize its location quickly in a new
setting&mdash;nothing that a good bit of scripting cannot fix. 
</p><p>
The first approach to
this is to have the device notify you of its IP address as it boots. I
personally leverage instant messaging for these sorts of system
notifications and have an &ldquo;automation&rdquo; group in my contact list featuring
several borg-looking avatars that are authorized to send me all manner of
alerts when the situation warrants. The key to this script is the SendXMPP
tool (see Resources), which provides the ability to send instant messages
with ease from the console. SendXMPP carries a few Perl module
dependencies that you need to download from the CPAN archive and
build. Retrieve the tarfiles via wget, extract and follow the customary
<tt  >perl Makefile.PL; make; make install</tt> procedure as
root&mdash;the CPAN shell
does not seem to work in the strict RAM confines of the WDMBII. After
building two or three modules, you will be able to include the following
one-line wizardry in /etc/init.d/post_network_start.sh (line 20):


<pre     class="programlisting">
#    $SCRIPTS_PATH/mionet.sh start
     touch $POST_NETWORK_STARTED_FILE

     # Announce IP address of operation to admin
     OUT=`ifconfig | grep -A2 "eth0"`; \
         echo -e "(lander) now operational: \n$OUT" \
             | /usr/local/bin/sendxmpp -r lander-notifier \
                 -f /root/.sendxmpprc lucifred@jabber.org
fi
</pre>
</p><p>
The script parses the current network configuration and sends it with
appropriate text wrapping and an XMPP resource (-r) describing the device
to one of my notification accounts. The user ID and password are retrieved
from /root/.sendxmpprc (-f). Once the script is installed, the device will
notify me of its IP address at every bootup in any network where DHCP is
enabled and access to the Jabber server in question has not been
restricted. The result message is very effective in allowing me to locate the
device and possibly even troubleshoot occasional connectivity glitches:


<pre     class="programlisting">
(lander) now operational:
eth0     Link encap:Ethernet
              HWaddr 00:90:A9:15:DD:73
         inet addr:164.99.120.96
              Bcast:164.99.121.255
              Mask:255.255.254.0
         UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1
</pre>
</p><p>
This approach will serve most road warriors willing to put up with
connecting to IP addresses. But, power users controlling their own domains
can do even better. By setting up a dynamic DNS subdomain, one can enable
the device to update at boot a fully qualified domain name, valid to the
Internet at large. The intricacies of DNS zone configuration are beyond
the scope of this article, but the Perl script to leverage a properly
configured domain remains relatively simple:


<pre     class="programlisting">
# Variables to configure the script's operation
my $hostname   = 'ooga';                     # Device hostname
my $domain     = 'dynamic.booga.org.';       # Domain name
my $nameserver = 'ns1.booga.org';            # Primary nameserver
                                             # for your zone
my $keyname    = 'md5key';                   # Name of the key
my $key        = 'se64bAsE64BASE64BasE64=='; # HMAC-MD5 TSIG key
my $interface  = 'eth0';                     # Interface whose IP
                                             # is to be published
</pre>
</p><p>
Refer to the Resources section of this article for a reference
to the Web page where the author maintains the script. This more extensive
solution makes our briefcase-friendly, quick-booting mini-server a
full-fledged participant in the Internet.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28fb580.0x29f4bc0"></a>
Adding Services</h2></div></div><p>
The most obvious workload for our portable server is file-centric: well
equipped with SMB support from Samba and NFS support built in to the
kernel, as well as the lighttpd Web server and the rsync client, the system
is ready to shine in this space. Enterprising users have built HOWTOs
describing how to expand further the array of services to FTP and even
BitTorrent, but I should not forget to mention that the system has a
healthy complement of essential d&aelig;mons: ntp, cron and even Apple's mDNS
are at your disposal out of the box.
</p><p>
The built-in toolchain enables the compilation of packages natively, but
cross-compilation also is a possibility for jobs requiring more RAM than
the device has available. It is, however, possible to find prebuilt
packages for a number of services, as the device shares the ARM core of
many others, its closest cousin being the Gumstix micro-board (check the
many Gumstix sites for suitable binaries before starting a large
cross-compiled build).

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
The WD Mybook II World Edition is clearly a device warranting the attention
of hardware hackers looking for a small, cheap, low-power platform on which to build
their projects. Western Digital's wisdom in not stripping the system
portion of the device should be recognized in that it has provided us
with a wonderful target for our tinkering. Although sporting only 98
BogoMIPS, its hardware has unusual capabilities (hardware AES encryption
and native support for Java bytecode among them) that provide further
application levers for our appliance-building projects. I introduced here
the hardware, its capabilities, how to breach its security and how to
enable it with top-class network configuration at bootup on nearly any
network. I hope you, the reader, will follow me and others in this
exploration of what our imaginations can make of this small hardware
wonder.
