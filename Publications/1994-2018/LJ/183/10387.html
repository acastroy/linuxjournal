Small screen? Crummy touchpad? Not a problem for Conkeror.

Conkeror is a Web browser with an Emacs-style look, feel and
configuration. It uses Firefox's HTML rendering engine and works with
most Firefox extensions, but it provides a keyboard-driven interface and
makes excellent use of screen space. It's a fitting Web browser for
Netbooks with their imprecise touchpads and small screens. Conkeror uses
the same free software license as Firefox.

Installing Conkeror</h2></div></div><p>
Users of Debian Lenny, Debian Sid and Ubuntu Jaunty should install the
conkeror and conkeror-spawn-process-helper packages. Users of other
distributions should install the XULRunner package (xulruner-1.9 or
xulrunner). If you installed the Firefox package, that package installed
XULRunner for you. After you install XULRunner, download a Conkeror
snapshot and unpack it into your usual software directory&mdash;you don't
need to compile anything. See Resources for a link to
the Conkeror snapshot download.
</p><p>
To put the Conkeror launcher in one of your regular executable
directories so that you can start Conkeror from a command prompt or
application launcher, create a symbolic link from the
conkeror/contrib/run-conkeror file to one of your usual executable
directories. For example:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ln -s /usr/local/share/lib/conkeror/contrib/run-conkeror \
        /usr/local/bin/conkeror.
</pre>
</p><p>
If your distribution doesn't include Firefox, download XULRunner from
Mozilla and unpack it into your usual software directory. Then, download
a Conkeror snapshot and unpack it also into your usual software
directory. See Resources for links to the downloads.
</p><p>
You must perform an extra step to make the Conkeror launcher
work. First, copy the xulrunner-stub file from the XULRunner directory
into the Conkeror directory. Then, create a symbolic link from that file
to one of your usual executable directories. For example:



<pre     class="programlisting">
$ cp /usr/local/share/lib/xulrunner-1.9/xulrunner-stub \
     /usr/local/share/lib/conkeror/xulrunner-stub
$ ln -s /usr/local/share/lib/conkeror/xulrunner-stub \
        /usr/local/bin/conkeror.
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x262c580.0x2724988"></a>
Browsing the Web with Conkeror</h2></div></div><p>
You don't need to configure Conkeror to get started; simply start 
the conkeror executable you installed. Conkeror's start page lists which
keys perform which actions (keybindings). The first keybinding listed,
g, goes to the URL you specify. For example, load the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span>
home page by pressing g and
typing <tt  >linuxjournal.com</tt>. Follow links by clicking
them, as you would do in Firefox, and press B to return to previous
pages or F to advance to later pages.
</p><p>
Return to the basic list of keybindings on the start page by
pressing, C-h i. In Conkeror and Emacs, C- stands for, &ldquo;hold Ctrl
and press the next key&rdquo;. For example, C-h i stands for &ldquo;hold Ctrl,
press h, release Ctrl and h, and press i&rdquo;. Conkeror uses other Emacs
keybinding abbreviations also: M- means hold the Meta key (the Alt
key on PC keyboards and the Option key on Macintosh keyboards); S-
means hold the Shift key. For a complete list of Conkeror keybindings,
press C-h b.
</p><p>
Although you can follow links by clicking them, you should learn to
follow them using the keyboard to get the most out of Conkeror. To
follow a link with the keyboard, press f. Conkeror places a small
number next to each link (Figure 2), including link images. Enter a number to
follow its link or type letters from the name of the link you want. As
you type letters, Conkeror removes the numbers from links that don't
match those letters and renumbers the remaining links. Even on a slow
computer, this happens instantly. If only one link matches the letters
you entered, Conkeror automatically follows it.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10387f2.large.jpg"><img src="10387f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Following Links in Conkeror
</p></div></div><p>
For example, let's assume the three link names:
foo, bar and baz. Typing f and 3 follows the third link, baz.
Typing f and baz also follows the baz link. Typing f and b
removes the number next to foo, so that you can press 1 to select bar
or 2 to select baz.
</p><p>
As in Firefox, you can start a search within Conkeror. Press g, type
&ldquo;google&rdquo;, type your search term, and press Return to go to the Google
result for your search term. Replace &ldquo;google&rdquo; with
&ldquo;lucky&rdquo; to go
straight to the first Google result, or replace it with any of the
following words to use another search engine: &ldquo;wikipedia&rdquo;
&ldquo;sourceforge&rdquo; or &ldquo;dictionary&rdquo;. When you search Google, Conkeror asks
Google to guess what you're searching for and displays the best matching
results in a list. Press Tab to select the top result, use the keyboard
arrow keys to select an alternative result, or simply finish typing your
search terms and press Enter. This also works for Wikipedia searches.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x262c580.0x2725170"></a>
Using Conkeror's Buffers</h2></div></div><p>
Firefox uses tabs to keep separate Web pages in the same browser;
Conkeror uses buffers to do the same thing. To open a link in a new
buffer, press C-u f and select the link using the link-following
instructions above. For example, say you're back on the page with the foo,
bar and baz links. To open baz in a new window, press C-u f and
type <tt  >baz</tt>. Press C-u before any command that opens a Web page to load that
page in a new buffer. For example, C-u g goes to a URL or loads a
search result page in a new buffer, and C-u C-h i loads the start page
in a new buffer. Also, links that try to open a new window will be
opened in a new buffer.
</p><p>
Return to the previous buffer by pressing M-p (Alt-p on PCs and Option-p on
Macs); advance to the next buffer by pressing M-n. Press C-x b to
display a list of open buffers (Figure 3). Each buffer in the list has a
name&mdash;its URL plus its title. Select a buffer name from the list using the
keyboard arrow keys or narrow the list by typing part of a buffer's
name. Press Enter at any time to show the selected buffer.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10387f3.large.jpg"><img src="10387f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. The Buffer List
</p></div></div><p>
Close a buffer&mdash;in Conkeror's terminology, kill a buffer&mdash;by
pressing C-x k to display the list of buffers. Select a buffer the same
way you did above, and press Enter to kill it. Conkeror selects the
current buffer by default, so you can kill it quickly by pressing C-x k
&lt;Enter&gt;. When you close the last buffer, Conkeror exits. Close Conkeror
and all its buffers automatically by pressing C-x C-c.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x262c580.0x2725590"></a>
Some Other Keybindings</h2></div></div><p>
Power users of any Web browser often edit the URL to go to a different
part of the Web site they're visiting. Press C-x C-v to edit the
current URL in Conkeror. Combine this with C-u to open the modified URL
in a new buffer: C-u C-x C-v.
</p><p>
Bookmarking a URL in Conkeror lets you return to it using Tab completion
when you change URLs. Press b to bookmark the current URL, choose a
name for the bookmark (Conkeror fills in the page title by default), and
press Enter. Press g to go to a new URL, type in a few letters from
either the bookmark title or the bookmark URL, and press Tab. Conkeror
shows you a list of bookmarks that match the letters you typed; use the
keyboard arrow keys to select a bookmark and press Enter to go to it.
</p><p>
Sometimes when you try bookmarking a page, Conkeror asks you to choose a
frame. It places a number next to each frame on the page and lets you
choose a frame by entering its number. If you want to bookmark the URL
containing all the frames, enter the number 0.
</p><p>
Access all of Conkeror's commands&mdash;even those that aren't bound to a
keybinding&mdash;by pressing M-x, typing the command name and pressing
Enter. Press Tab to complete any command name; for example, press M-x,
type <tt  >print</tt>, and press Tab to make Conkeror select the print-buffer
command. If you press M-x and Tab without typing anything, Conkeror
lists all of its commands. I suggest you review this list to get an idea
of everything Conkeror can do.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x262c580.0x27257f8"></a>
Conkeror's Modes</h2></div></div><p>
Conkeror includes special scripts, called modes, that change its
behavior on specific sites&mdash;for example, the simple XKCD mode for the
xkcd.com comic-strip site. When you visit xkcd.com in Firefox, it
displays the comic's title when you move your mouse over the image. When
you visit xkcd.com in Conkeror, it activates XKCD mode (Figure 4) and displays the
title below the image in a special font&mdash;you don't need to move your
mouse over the image.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10387f4.large.jpg"><img src="10387f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. XKCD Mode in Action
</p></div></div><p>
The Gmail mode redefines many of Conkeror's default keybindings so that
you can use the default Gmail keybindings. Other modes include a Google
Maps mode, a Reddit mode and a YouTube mode.
</p><p>
When you visit a site that has a mode, for example Google Maps, Conkeror
loads that site's mode. When you leave the site, Conkeror automatically
unloads the mode. You can try using modes on other sites by loading the
mode's command through the M-x menu. For example: M-x
<tt  >xkcd-mode</tt>.
However, most modes don't make sense on alternative sites.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x262c580.0x2725bc0"></a>
Advanced Configuration, Advanced Features</h2></div></div><p>
Firefox has a pretty Preferences configuration screen. Conkeror doesn't.
But, you can change any browser setting in Conkeror on the about:config
page. Press g, type <tt  >about:config</tt>, and press Enter to go to the page
and double-click the settings you want to change. Conkeror shows changed
settings in bold. Use the search bar that appears on the top of the page
to find specific settings quickly. For example, enter
<tt  >proxy</tt> to find
all the proxy settings.
</p><p>
Although you can find and change settings easily in about:config, some
users prefer a dynamic Emacs-style configuration file. This file can
change about:config settings, define keybindings, add new commands, load
external modules and define events using JavaScript. You can turn any
file into a Conkeror configuration file, but the file must exist before
you try using it. For example, add the following line to the file
.conkeror.rc to prevent Conkeror from displaying a warning message
before showing the about:config page:

<pre     class="programlisting">
user_pref("general.warnOnAboutConfig", false);
</pre>
</p><p>
After creating the configuration file, you must tell Conkeror where to
find it. Go to the Conkeror start page by pressing C-h i, scroll to
the Conkeror RC File section, and enter the full pathname of the
configuration file in the text box. For example, I entered the following
text: /home/harding/.conkeror.rc. Press the Set RC File button. You 
need to do this only once.
</p><p>
Just below the Set RC File button, Conkeror lists several example
directives for you to put in your configuration file. For instance, one
line tells Conkeror how to use a custom search engine when you press
g. You also can add new commands and new keybindings to Conkeror.
For more examples, follow the Conkeror Wiki link in the Resources
section of this article.
</p><p>
The next section tells you how to use Firefox extensions in Conkeror,
but some Firefox extensions don't want to work with a browser that
isn't named Firefox. Most Firefox extensions work in Conkeror if you
tell the extension you're really using Firefox. I suggest you put
the following line in your configuration file to make Conkeror
ignore compatibility problems:

<pre     class="programlisting">
user_pref("extensions.checkCompatibility", false);
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x262c580.0x2b1e1d8"></a>
Using Firefox Extensions in Conkeror</h2></div></div><p>
Most Firefox extensions work in Conkeror, but if you're used to Firefox
extensions, installing an extension in Conkeror may feel like a step
backward. First, find the extension on the Mozilla Web site (or another
Web site), and download it to your computer. (Firefox extension filenames
end in .xpi.) Then, press M-x, type <tt  >extensions</tt>, and press Enter to
start the extension manager. Choose the Extensions tab, click the
Install button, use the file navigator to select the file you
downloaded, and click Open. As in Firefox, you must restart Conkeror to
load the extension.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x262c580.0x2b1e390"></a>
Using an External Editor</h2></div></div><p>
Conkeror lets you edit HTML text boxes in an external text editor&mdash;for
example, Emacs (Figure 5). Conkeror copies the text box's contents to a temporary
file, opens your text editor on the file and reads the changed file
back into the text box when you close your editor. To use this feature,
you must compile Conkeror's small helper program, conkeror-spawn-helper.
(If you used the instructions above to install the two Conkeror packages
in Debian or Ubuntu, you may skip this paragraph.) Go to the Conkeror
source directory you installed and run the following command:
<tt  >make</tt>. You
don't need to run <tt  >make install</tt>, because make compiles the program in
the directory Conkeror uses.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10387f5.large.jpg"><img src="10387f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. Editing a Wikipedia Article in Conkeror
</p></div></div><p>
Next, you need to tell Conkeror which text editor to use. Conkeror looks
for the editor command in the $EDITOR environmental variable, but if
$EDITOR isn't set, Conkeror starts Emacs. Most distributions let you set
the $EDITOR variable by adding the following line to your ~/.xsession
and ~/.xinitrc files: 

<pre     class="programlisting">
export EDITOR=my_editor
</pre>
</p><p>
Replace <tt  >my_editor</tt> above with the name of the editor
you want to use&mdash;for example, for the graphical VIM editor, gvim; the GNOME editor, gedit; or
the KDE editor, kate. If you want to use a console editor, prefix the
environmental variable's value with the name of a terminal emulator&mdash;for
example: 

<pre     class="programlisting">
export EDITOR="xterm -e vim"
</pre>
</p><p>
However, if you use external editors in other programs, you may not want
to do everything in a graphical editor. To make Conkeror alone start a
specific editor, add the following line to your Conkeror RC file and
don't set the $EDITOR variable: 

<pre     class="programlisting">
editor_shell_command = "my_editor";
</pre>
</p><p>
After all that configuration, using the external editor should seem
simple. Use the Tab key or the mouse to place the input cursor in a text
box and press C-i. You can edit small boxes&mdash;for example, a box for
your name&mdash;or large boxes&mdash;for example, the edit box in a Wikipedia
article. Conkeror grays out the text box while you edit. When you finish
editing by closing your text editor, Conkeror restores the original
background color.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x262c580.0x2b1e9c0"></a>
Documentation</h2></div></div><p>
The Conkeror start page links to its built-in tutorial, which you
activate by pressing C-h t. The tutorial teaches you how to browse the
Web with Conkeror.
</p><p>
Similar to Emacs' help, Conkeror's help can describe its own commands.
The C-h f keybinding describes commands, and the C-h k keybinding
describes keybindings. For example, to find out what the print-buffer
command does, type C-h f and <tt  >print-buffer</tt>. Conkeror will tell you
that, &ldquo;print-buffer is an interactive command in commands.js [to] print
the currently loaded page.&rdquo; Similarly, press C-h k and f, and
Conkeror tells you &ldquo;f is bound to the command follow in
bindings/default/content-buffer/element.js.&rdquo;
</p><p>
For complex problems, Conkeror can help you search its wiki. Press g, and
type
<tt  >conkerorwiki</tt>, and enter your search terms. Conkeror searches its wiki,
which includes troubleshooting information and lots of ways to get the
most out of Conkeror. Of course, you always can go directly to the
Conkeror wiki using the link in Resources.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
I hesitated before trying Conkeror the first time. As a longtime vi
user, I wasn't interested in anything based on Emacs. But, I did need a
Web browser that could make the most of my Netbook's 5"-tall
screen and crummy touchpad. Conkeror fit the bill, and I tried it. It
impressed me. Although Conkeror may seem complicated in its
sophistication, I spent most of my time going to pages, following links
and editing text boxes&mdash;three things Conkeror makes easy and quick.
After I slowly learned to use its other features, I found no reason I
shouldn't enjoy the advantages of an advanced keyboard-driven Web
browser on my desktop as well.
