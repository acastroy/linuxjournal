Too many businesses still aren't getting the clues from open code.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2567580.0x265f358"></a></h2></div></div><p>
For the many years I wrote Linux for Suits and the SuitWatch newsletter, I
always insisted that Linux and business were joined by
<span   class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span> logic rather
than <span   class="emphasis"><em>or</em></span>.
</p><p>
I still believe that's true. But, I also believe that many
businesses&mdash;especially the big ones&mdash;still don't get Linux, free software, open
source or even the Internet itself. That's because they remain, in the
immortal words of Walt Whitman, &ldquo;demented with the mania of owning
things&rdquo;.
</p><p>
Oddly, the things they want to own most are not things at all, but
customers. These companies still harbor the illusion that customers can be
&ldquo;acquired&rdquo; like slaves and &ldquo;managed&rdquo; like cattle. The nicest ranches for
customers are politely called &ldquo;walled gardens&rdquo;. I prefer an equally
agricultural metaphor: silo.
</p><p>
The definition of silo I like best is &ldquo;a tall cylindrical structure,
usually beside a barn, in which fodder is stored&rdquo;. (That's from the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Free
Dictionary</em></span>.) Fodder, in the case of business, is customer data. That data
includes specifics, such as name, address, purchase history and call records.
It also might include customers' stated or inferred preferences, status
with the company (frequent flyer grades, for example) and other variables.
</p><p>
The crowning irony of business silos is that they are built to maximize BI
(Business Intelligence), yet they are blind to how they're not
working. This form of inward-gazing ignorance is familiar to techies who
have watched many silos come down in the computing and networking fields.
Mainframes, closed on-line services and proprietary e-mail systems all come
to mind. The Internet and its open protocols killed all those things, yet
the lessons remain lost on every business that continues to believe that
good &ldquo;intelligence&rdquo; about what customers actually want can be found inside
the company's customer data silo.
</p><p>
For evidence I offer three examples: call centers, loyalty cards and
mobile phones. All three are shining examples of a form of architecture
that has been discredited, if not defeated, by the successes of Linux, FOSS
and the Internet.
</p><p>
Look up &ldquo;call center hell&rdquo; in Google, and you'll get millions of results.
(This morning, 8.65.) Two of the three top search results on Twitter are by
people working in call centers. Most of these are &ldquo;hold
centers&rdquo;, because
putting callers on hold is what they do best. Conversation is not their
fort&eacute;. If you ever reach a human being at the end of a choice maze, you
too often interact with a script rather than a human being. After an
accident involving my rental car a couple years ago, the woman at the other
end of the line reacted to my anger at her uncooperativeness by admitting
that her options were limited, literally, by a script. There were only
certain things she was allowed to say or hear. When the conversation
stepped outside those lines&mdash;as it had to, since the accident was novel
in several ways&mdash;both of us went nonlinear. The call crashed as badly as
the four cars (including one cop car) involved in the pile-up.
</p><p>
Loyalty cards are the silliest thing since Green Stamps. By the middle of
the last century, nearly every store gave away green stamps, achieving zero
differentiation from every other store and adding friction to the entire
economy in the process. Today, instead of collecting stamps and sticking
them in books (to redeem later for a crappy grill or something), we collect
cards that fatten our wallets without making us richer. Loyalty cards
require retailers to maintain dual pricing for merchandise and add friction
at the checkout counter, where too often the only benefit to the customer
is a coupon for something they just bought. Worse, loyalty programs can't
tell when or why people don't shop at a store. My family likes to
shop at Trader Joe's, because that store avoids the hassles of both loyalty
cards and coupons. There is nothing in other stores' loyalty programs that
welcomes hearing this useful information.
</p><p>
Perhaps the worst business silos are the Siamese ones formed by cell-phone
equipment makers and carriers. Although PCs&mdash;even closed ones with Apple and
Microsoft operating systems&mdash;are open to endless varieties of third-party
applications, we see nothing of the sort from the cell-phone business, with
the notable exception of the iPhone, which is (as I write this) enjoying
its billionth application download. That download, of course, will come
from exactly one source: Apple's iTunes. One might consider this a step in
the right direction&mdash;it's kind of like the one Windows 95 took by making it
easy for countless developers to write applications that would run on
even-more-countless PCs. The next step, however, has to come from outside
the silos of both the equipment makers and the phone system carriers. More
eyes make bugs shallower, as we say.
</p><p>
Time to debug some business silos.
