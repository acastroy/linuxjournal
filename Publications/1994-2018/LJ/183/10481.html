<span   class="bold"><b>Geert Uytterhoeven</b></span> has replaced the old,
dead <span   class="bold"><b>CVS</b></span> repository for the
<span   class="bold"><b>m68k Linux port</b></span> with a shiny new
<span   class="bold"><b>git</b></span> repository, and added a <tt  >make
install</tt> build target, as well as various other code fixes.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Steven Rostedt</b></span> has updated <span   class="bold"><b>ftrace</b></span> to let users turn kernel tracepoints
on and off simply by setting values in files in the /debug directory.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Jaswinder Singh Rajput</b></span> has added some
performance-counting features to
<span   class="bold"><b>AMD K7</b></span> and later processors. A range of data can be tracked, including
processor cycles, number of executed instructions, page faults and
context switches. The patches seem likely to go into the kernel soon.
<span   class="bold"><b>Ingo Molnar</b></span> has given his endorsement and offered some bug
reports to which Jaswinder responded quickly.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Matthew Wilcox</b></span> has done a major rewrite of
the <span   class="bold"><b>MSI HOWTO</b></span>. The Message
Signaled Interrupts (MSI) HOWTO had not been updated significantly 
since 2004. It provides a mechanism for triggering interrupts on <span   class="bold"><b>PCI
devices</b></span>, entirely in software. Previously, PCI devices needed to have
a physical pin corresponding to the desired interrupt. MSI is much
more flexible, and proper documentation will be quite useful. <span   class="bold"><b>Grant
Gundler</b></span> and <span   class="bold"><b>Michael Ellerman</b></span> offered their own technical feedback to
the HOWTO, and <span   class="bold"><b>Randy Dunlap</b></span> and <span   class="bold"><b>Sitsofe Wheeler</b></span> helped polish up the
language.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Cheng Renquan</b></span> has enhanced the <span   class="bold"><b>KBuild system</b></span>, so that when viewing
help for any given compilation option, the currently selected build
choice is visible at the same time. He also made various less user-visible
changes, and Randy Dunlap has signed off.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Alex Chiang</b></span> has submitted a bunch of
<span   class="bold"><b>PCI patches</b></span>, including code to
create /sys/bus/pci/rescan, a user-controlled file that can force a
rescan of all PCI buses on the system. He added several other files to
the /sys/ directory to give greater and greater PCI control to the
user.
</p><p>
It's nice to remove features that no one uses. For one thing, it can
simplify kernel code greatly. <span   class="bold"><b>H. Peter
Anvin</b></span> wanted to remove the
<span   class="bold"><b>zImage build target</b></span> recently and asked if anyone was still using it.
As it turns out, <span   class="bold"><b>Woody Suwalkski</b></span> noted
that <span   class="bold"><b>ARM</b></span> still used
zImage. H. Peter probably will remove it from the x86 tree and leave
ARM alone.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bartlomiej Zolnierkiewicz</b></span> has expunged the
<span   class="bold"><b>IDE floppy</b></span> and <span   class="bold"><b>tape drivers</b></span>
from the kernel and the MAINTAINERS file and listed them in the
CREDITS file instead. He thanked <span   class="bold"><b>Gadi
Oxman</b></span> and <span   class="bold"><b>Paul Bristow</b></span> for all the work they
did in the early days on those drivers.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Michael Kerrisk</b></span> has removed his name as the official maintainer of the
<span   class="bold"><b>kernel man pages</b></span>. The <span   class="bold"><b>Linux Foundation</b></span> funding has run out, and a
supplemental round of <span   class="bold"><b>Google</b></span> funding also
has run out, so now he'll
have to focus on other things. He still plans to support the project
as best he can, but he cautions that the man pages likely will be
orphaned soon, if no further funding or willing maintainer steps
forward.

<h2 class="title">bc&mdash;When Integers Aren't Enough</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Joey Bernard</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #183, July 2009</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Most people have the need to do some kind of math when they are using a
computer. In shell scripts, you can make integer calculations by using
functionality in the shell itself. But what if that's not enough? Luckily,
the POSIX standard includes a very useful command-line utility called bc.
With this, you can do arbitrary precision arithmetic. Actually, it is a
complete, C-like language that can do some pretty sophisticated
programming, supporting variables and functions.
</p><p>
In bc, numbers are all represented internally as a decimal number. They
have a length, which is the total number of digits, and a scale, which is the
number of decimal spaces. You can find these values by using the built-in
functions length() and scale(). For example, the number 10.23 would have a
length of 4 and a scale of 2. The variable scale holds the number of
decimal places to keep when internal functions are executed. The default
value is 0. bc supports all number bases from 2&ndash;16, with base-10 being
the default. The input and output base of numbers can be set by using the
variables ibase and obase. All of the basic mathematical operations are
supported in bc. You can multiply, divide, add, subtract, do mod and
exponentiation. There are all of the standard comparison operations too.
Less than, less than or equal to, greater than, greater than or equal to,
equal to and not equal to all give results of 0 for false and 1 for true.
This is very useful in the conditional statements available in bc.
</p><p>
bc can be used in shell scripts or on the command line as a very
effective calculator. It will read from a list of files given on the
command line or read from standard input. On the command line, expressions
simply can be echoed through a pipe to bc:

<pre     class="programlisting">
echo "1+1" | bc
</pre>
</p><p>
The above will give the answer of 2. As a more complex example, the sine of 5 can be
assigned to a shell variable with the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
RESULT=`echo s(5) | bc -l`
</pre>
</p><p>
The -l command-line option tells bc to load the math library, giving
access to the trigonometric functions.
</p><p>
As a bit of a contrived example, say there are two values and you need
to find out which one has a larger sine. With the math library and the
built-in comparison operations, you can do this with the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">

echo "s(5) &lt; s(10)" | bc -l

</pre>
</p><p>
The result 1 is printed out on standard output, verifying that the sine
of 5 is less than the sine of 10. bc can print out a text string
telling the user whether the result is true or false with the following:


<pre     class="programlisting">

echo 'if (s(5) &lt; s(10)) print "true\n" else print "false\n"' | bc -l

</pre>
</p><p>
This prints out the word true. If this string is to be stored in a
variable, the newline characters would be removed from the executable line.
This value then can be used later in a shell script by saving it to a
shell variable.
</p><p>
What if you have a data file of input values and you want to apply some
function to them? Say you need to calculate the logarithm base-10 of each
value and dump it into another file. The following example takes a list of
the first ten numbers, calculates the logarithm base-10 of each number and
writes the value into the file output.lst:

<pre     class="programlisting">
LIST="0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9"
for INPUT in $LIST
do
echo "l($INPUT)/l(10)" | bc -l &gt;&gt;output.lst
done
</pre>
</p><p>
These examples already have done some useful work, but what if the
requirements are more robust? Does this necessitate a move to a heavyweight math program, like Mathematica or Maple? Not necessarily. With bc,
you can create and use functions to make more
complicated calculations. Even recursive functions can be written, like in
this example to calculate a factorial:

<pre     class="programlisting">

define f (x) {
   if (x &lt;= 1) return (1);
   return (f(x-1) * x);
}
print "Factorial:"; factorial = read();
print f(factorial); print "\n";
quit

</pre>
</p><p>
This can be dumped into a file called fact.bc and run through bc to get
the factorial of some number by executing:

<pre     class="programlisting">
bc fact.bc
</pre>
</p><p>
This script asks the user for a number and then finds the
factorial. It can be used without interaction simply by feeding the
number in to standard input with a pipe:

<pre     class="programlisting">
echo 10 | bc fact.bc
</pre>
</p><p>
This prints out the factorial of 10 (3628800) to standard output. But,
how fast can such a program be? For a variety of values run on a generic
laptop, the following times were measured:

<pre     class="programlisting">
10       0.004s
100      0.004s
1000     0.028s
10000    3.099s
</pre>
</p><p>
These times were averaged over three runs to account for varying system
load. It seems more than fast enough to be useful for a lot of heavy
work.
</p><p>
For a more scientific example, the following bc script finds
how long it takes for an object to fall from a series of heights:

<pre     class="programlisting">
define t(h) {   
   g = 9.81;
   return (sqrt(2 * h / g));
}
</pre>
</p><p>
Now there is no excuse for abandoning a shell script simply because it can't
handle some mathematical problem. With bc, you can do a lot of really useful work straight from the command line. Go forth and enumerate.

<h2 class="title">EFI-X: When Dual Boot Isn't Enough</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #183, July 2009</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
I recently was contacted by the folks selling the EFI-X. It's a small USB
device that allows EFI-booting operating systems to boot on traditional
BIOS-based machines. The big selling point for such a device is that
it allows native booting of Apple OS X on off-the-shelf PC hardware.
I couldn't get any specifics as to why a Linux user would benefit from
such hardware, but at the same time, I guess it's useful to know Linux
is fully compatible with EFI-booting technology.
</p><p>
So although the $240 it takes to buy an EFI-X module won't really benefit
your Linux install very much, if you want to install OS X on your trusty
Linux machine, you now can do so. It most likely violates EULA terms
with Apple to install on non-Apple hardware, but it doesn't require
a hacked and pirated version of OS X to install. I bought an EFI-X,
and OS X installed from the retail DVD right next to my Linux install.
It takes a separate drive for each operating system, but I now have
a triple-booting quad-core computer that cost less than $800. If you
don't want to buy Apple hardware, but would like to dual- (or triple-)
boot your system, check it out: <a href="http://www.expresshd.com" target="_self">www.expresshd.com</a>.

IronPython is an implementation of Python that runs on the .NET
framework as well as on Mono.
The current version of IronPython is compatible with Python 2.5, and
an alpha release of a Python 2.6-compatible version also is available.
IronPython is written entirely in C#, and
the current version is built on top of the Dynamic Language Runtime (DLR).
</p><p>
IronPython features an interactive console that does full dynamic
compilation of Python code to .NET. It provides full access
to all .NET libraries while maintaining compatibility with the
Python language.
</p><p>
There also is a Visual Studio plugin called IronPython Studio
that supports the creation of Python-based GUI applications.
In addition to IronPython, there are &ldquo;Iron&rdquo; versions of Ruby and Scheme (LISP).
If you like Python but crave static typing, check out BOO for .NET/Mono.
</p><p>
IronPython is licensed under the terms of the &ldquo;Microsoft Public
License&rdquo;, which
was approved by the Open Source Initiative (OSI) in October 2007.
The license allows redistribution of compiled code for either commercial
or noncommercial use (similar to a BSD license).
For this reason, although it is recognized as a &ldquo;free&rdquo; software license
by the Free Software Foundation, it is considered incompatible with the GPL.
And, if getting too close to Microsoft makes you nervous, be aware
that the IronPython Project is hosted on a Microsoft-controlled site:

<h2 class="title">Netbooks&mdash;Dying or Evolving?</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #183, July 2009</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
I'm just as guilty as everyone else that jumped on the Netbook bandwagon
when it started with the 7" Eee PC. After a few weeks, the limitations
of such tiny notebooks become fairly clear. The Netbook market has
evolved to the point that it's almost laughable. What are the latest features
of that market? Bigger screens! Ten- to twelve-inch screens are becoming the
new rage in the &ldquo;Netbook&rdquo; world.
</p><p>
Um, we had 12" screens before. We called them notebooks. I'm not
sure if the Netbook fascination is wearing off or if low-power laptops
are just going to become the norm. Because &ldquo;low power&rdquo; is becoming a
misnomer as the CPU speeds creep up on ultra-portables, I think the term
Netbook might just die away.
</p><p>
Another option is that something like Android, Moblin or Ubuntu Netbook
Remix will standardize the tiny-screen laptop market, and it will become
more like a souped-up cell phone as opposed to a stripped-down notebook.
One thing seems clear, the days of a 7&ndash;9" screen running a customized
and minimal Linux distribution are fading away into history. Is the
Netbook a dying fad or still an infant going through growing pains?
Sadly, I think that depends on how hardware manufacturers choose to push
their upcoming models.
</p><p>
I certainly don't have the ability to see the future, but I hope
the future of Netbooks doesn't continue along the path of adopting
Microsoft Windows. Low-powered hardware just begs to have the Linux
kernel running on it. If the interface could be something standard that
ran familiar applications, we might have a chance to retake the entire
Netbook market. Only time will tell, and only hardware manufacturers
can pick the standard.

<h2 class="title">Stop Burning CDs; Burn USB Drives Instead</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #183, July 2009</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
It seems that every week there's a new version of some Linux distribution
available. I don't know about you, but I have enough burned &ldquo;last
version&rdquo; CDs to build a very reflective fort in the backyard. I'm also
really bad about labeling CDs when I burn them, so I end up burning the
same CD over and over. Thankfully, there is help for people like me&mdash;Unetbootin.
</p><p>
I did a video tutorial on this a while back, but the gist of Unetbootin is that
you create a bootable USB drive instead of burning an installer CD.
The application automatically will download the latest CD image, or you
can create a bootable USB drive from an already-downloaded ISO file.
Unetbootin even works in Windows, so if you're stuck with only a Windows
machine, you can create a bootable USB drive to install our favorite
operating system.
</p><p>
The great thing is that USB drives are easily rewritable. Most modern
systems will boot from them without issue. The only downside is that
it's harder to build forts out of USB drives. So, unless you really want
to build that highly reflective fort, I'd suggest checking out Unetbootin.
