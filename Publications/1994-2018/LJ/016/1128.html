Washington, DC, Randy Bentson attended the Internet World Show and
Arnold Robbins took in the sights at East Coast Comdex.</p><p>by Randolph Bentson and Arnold Robbins</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x122d580.0x13258c8"></a>EAST COAST COMDEX</h2></div></div><p>East Coast Comdex is held annually, with the Windows World
show, at the Georgia World Congress Center in downtown Atlanta.
This is one of the world's largest convention centers. Tens of
thousands of people attend, literally from all over the world, with
a pretty high concentration of people from the Southeast US. The
show lasts four days, from Monday through Thursday.
</p><p>If you come, <span   class="emphasis"><em>don't</em></span> attempt to drive to
downtown Atlanta and park. Instead, take MARTA, the local rapid
transit system, to the CNN-Omni station, and follow the crowds;
it's a short walk.</p><p>Getting free tickets to see the exhibits is usually pretty
easy. Chances are, if you know a vendor displaying there, they can
get you tickets. Later in the week, you may even find free passes
on the tables when you walk in. I had a press pass, courtesy of
<i  >Linux Journal</i>, although both my company and my wife's company had
booths.</p><p>It definitely pays to go on a day other than the first day.
The lines to get your badge are almost non-existent, which speeds
up the process enormously.</p><p>Comdex is just enormous. Imagine two huge halls, each of
which is bigger than several football fields, packed end to end
with display booths and people wandering through trying to see
everything. Imagine, if you will, <span   class="emphasis"><em>thousands</em></span> of
techno-nerds. Not just any nerds, but PC and Windows nerds. Along
with the size and the crowd comes the <span   class="emphasis"><em>noise</em></span>.
The vendors often put on little stage shows and demos. They all
have microphones. They all have sound effects. They all have music.
It's almost impossible to think while wondering around Comdex, much
less have a conversation with your wife (particularly if your wife
is like mine, and talks softly).</p><p>It also pays to bring your lunch; the food is expensive
there. The new owners of Comdex gave out coupons for a free (small)
drink, which was a nice touch.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x122d580.0x1325ce8"></a>What's Hot</h2></div></div><p>There were very few, if any, really new or interesting items
to be seen this year. Comdex was more of the same old thing;
Intel-based systems of various sorts being predominant.</p><p>Some cute things: Panasonic had a laptop with a keyboard that
raised up to reveal a CD-ROM drive. There was another company
showing a &ldquo;remote&rdquo; mouse that could be used from up to 40 feet
away.</p><p>The &ldquo;hot&rdquo; items were: 1) Windows 95. I'd say that over 95%
of the vendors were showing their product(s) working on Windows 95.
Not too suprising at the &ldquo;Windows World&rdquo; show, but discouraging
to an old Unix hacker like myself. 2) Internet. If a product could
even be remotely tied into the Internet somehow, it was. The
BellSouth ISDN booth was jumping like hotcakes. IBM's booth had a
picture of a nun saying &ldquo;I'm dying to surf the net.&rdquo; The Internet
has arrived, and the masses are diving in. America Online even had
a group of about 20 workstations all lined up so people could &ldquo;test
drive the Internet&rdquo;. Gack. 3) CD-ROM. You name it, somebody's got
it on CD-ROM.</p><p>Fortunately, Comdex made a lot of the vendors clean up their
acts; there weren't any pornographic CD-ROMs visible (unlike last
year, which generated a lot of complaints).</p><p>It was also pretty clear that OS/2-Warp is an also-ran. I
don't think I saw more than 5% of the vendors touting their product
running on OS/2.</p><p>Perhaps suprisingly, there were almost no PowerPC products.
The ones I saw were in the Apple booth, and there were PowerPC
systems in the IBM booth.</p><p>There was some Linux at the show, but not much. A few vendors
with Linux CD-ROMs and such. The most visible Linux was at the
bookstore in the lobby, with several Linux books prominently
displayed when you walked in, and on the shelves. The O'Reilly
books were the nicest looking.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x122d580.0x1326000"></a>Editorializing</h2></div></div><p>Comdex has changed over the years. It used to be a show for
the entire computing industry. Once upon a time, you could find
mainframe and mini-computer vendors showing (anyone remember Vax
VMS? DG AOS?). You could find Unix vendors showing, like Sun. You
also used to get lots of nice freebies.</p><p>It has changed. First of all, very few people were giving out
toys, much less nice ones. :-(. Secondly, it's a PC and Microsoft
world out there. There were fewer Macintoshs than I've ever seen,
and much less Unix than usual.</p><p>Those companies who were trying to sell server based systems
were selling Windows NT, with Unix &ldquo;also&rdquo; available. This included
companies like Pyramid, and even DEC was pushing NT on the Alpha.
It is no wonder that the Unix vendors formed COSE, there really is
something to be afraid of. It's a terrible shame that Marketing
Hype can sell so <span   class="emphasis"><em>much</em></span> Mediocrity to the
public, but that seems to be the reality.</p><p>The conclusion I'd draw for the Linux world is that if WINE
is going to go anywhere, it ought to concentrate on Windows 95
compatibility; i.e., some way to run a Win32 binary under Linux.
Skip the Win16 stuff; it'll be dead within a year.</p><p>All in all, this year's Comdex was a disappointment. I
usually enjoy it, but this year I didn't. It was also a bit
depressing to see so much Microsoft stuff everywhere. I have high
hopes for the free software world, but it's sobering to see what a
small part of the &ldquo;industry&rdquo; consists of free software.</p><p>On the other hand, there was some Linux. Great things can
come from small beginnings, and we're just at the beginning of the
growth curve for self-contained, reliable, usable, free software
based systems. I hope that in five years, my report from Comdex
will tell a much different story.(Arnold Robbins)</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x122d580.0x1326318"></a>THE INTERNET WORLD SHOW</h2></div></div><p>Depending on your measure, Spring Internet World 95 was a
great success or a slight disappointment. With respect to its
stated goal of presenting what is happening on the Internet, it was
excellent. While it can't yet boast the attendence numbers of
Comdex, 20,000 visitors and 190 exhibitors made this a respectable
conference and may well justify the claim of being the &ldquo;world's
largest Internet conference.&rdquo; It was held April 10-13 at the heart
of Silicon Valley in the San Jose Convention Center, thus it should
come as no surprise to learn that the registration was flooded with
people who just took some time off from work to check out the
show.</p><p>Many of the major hardware and software vendors were there.
Present were the the traditional vendors: Apple, Dell, DEC, IBM,
Microsoft, NCD, Silicon Graphics, Sun, and Tandem. In addition,
there were also strictly network product vendors: 3Com, FTP
Software, Rockwell, Telebit, Wollongong, and ZyXEL. (I know I'm
going to catch flak for this&mdash;I'm sure to have missed someone in
my list&mdash;but I'll press on.)</p><p>What made this different from other trade shows I've attended
was the focus on user-level access the Internet and the newly
discovered World Wide Web.</p><p>Everyone was touting some feature of their product that
allowed one to compose, access, view, process, or control access to
the web. I was amazed by the number of hypertext and HTML text
preparation tools that were being displayed. I'll refrain from
citing who did what, but some of the low end products were far from
magic&mdash;I keep seeing the guy behind the curtain. If I were a
cynic I would claim the pencil manufacturers were there to show how
pencils could be used to prepare hypertext, but that would be an
exaggeration.</p><p>Since I've worked with mark-up languages such as troff and
TeX, I don't find HTML at all difficult. In fact, I find it is
missing many of the features I've come to expect of such a
language. (Apparently so do others. The proposed HTML 3.0 is a move
in the right direction.) This viewpoint renders a lot of the HTML
preparation tools rather ho-hum.</p><p>Still, there were some products which were close to magic and
some other products which will have increased importance in our
lives. Specifically, I found the integration of database searches
with a web server to be a most natural outcome. Most applications
have two elements: the user interface and solving the problem
itself. The Common Gateway Interface is an elegent method of using
the http daemon and the WWW browser to implement a GUI interface
for user application. There were a number of vendors who offered
WWW integrated database products.</p><p>Another class of products were security related. As we become
more thoroughly connected to the network we also become more
exposed to malicious intrusions on our systems. By my count there
were eight vendors whose sole product was firewall or other
security hardware or software. In addition, products such as Secure
HTTP, will be integrated by Netscape to give secure interactions
over the network.</p><p>Of course, since this was a networking exhibition, there were
plenty of representation by Internet service providors. There were
a number of nation-wide and international vendors present: America
Online, BBN Planet, Netcom, Prodigy Services, PSInet, SPRY, and
UUNET. It was also interesting to note the number of local
providers at the show. If this is any indication, you should have
lots of choices for Internet service in any major city.</p><p>Finally, I was gratified to see the number of traditional
publishers who have recognized that the Internet is a marketplace
that they should serve. Present were divisions of Dun &amp;
Bradstreet, MacMillan Publishing, San Jose Mecury News, O'Reilly
&amp; Associates, Random House, Van Nostrand Reinhold, and John
Wiley &amp; Sons.</p><p>So what was the disappointment? The poor Linux visibility. I
guess this is a side effect of the commercial nature of the show.
After all, how can the developers of Linux, TCP/IP, Lynx and Mosaic
justify the expense of renting booth space?</p><p>This led me on a quest&mdash;that I didn't complete&mdash;looking
for Linux inside. I started at one end of the exhibition hall and
went from booth to booth asking about Linux support. I found some
solace in the responses. A number of vendors said it wouldn't be
long before a Linux version of the product would be available --
after all, that's what the developers inside the companies were
using at work or at home. There's a chance that next year even more
products will have &ldquo;Linux&rdquo; in their list of supported
systems, Randolph Bentson</p></div></div>
