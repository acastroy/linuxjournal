    Yes,
    the answer is there, but the book is more than many people need or

Vixie</p></li><li><p>Publisher: Digital Press</p></li><li><p>ISBN: 1-55558-127-7</p></li><li><p>Price: $29.95</p></li><li><p>Reviewer: Phil Hughes</p></li></ul></div><p>Many of us who have had to configure Sendmail think of it as
something similar to fixing the plumbing in our house - it has to
be done, we sort of know how to do it and we wish we could ignore
it and it would go away. Yes, Sendmail is powerful and, for most
systems, necessary, but it is complicated. To make matters worse,
you don't have to make changes often enough so that you actually
learn how to do it right and remember it.</p><p>When Eric Allman's book on Sendmail was published, I got a
copy and was immediately intimidated. Eric is the author of
Sendmail and his book is thorough - tipping the scales at almost
800 pages. Yes, the answer is there, but the book is more than many
people need or want to get into - sort of like reading the National
Electrical Code book to find out how to replace a fuse.</p><p>If this same thing happened to you, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Sendmail:
Theory and Practice</em></span> may be the right answer. In 262
pages Avolio and Vixie address just what the book title says:
theory and practice. It takes the fear out of Sendmail
configuration by first explaining the practical considerations
involved in electronic mail transfer and then goes on to show how
to configure Sendmail to accomplish the tasks.</p><p>The first 90 pages cover practical information about
addressing over networks, including the problems of mixed-type
addresses (that is, a combination of a uucp address and domain
address). These pages also cover mail user agents, their interface
to Sendmail and how aliases work in Sendmail. Or, more correctly,
how to use Sendmail aliases to do what you need in a reliable and
secure fashion. Again, the emphasis is on practical
application.</p><p>The next chapter offers the basics of macros and rules. This
is presented in a practical and non-threatening manner with an
emphasis on what you need rather than a lengthy look at all the
capabilities.</p><p>The next chapter addresses the IDA Kit extension to Sendmail.
It does a good job of showing how the DBM tables of the IDA kit tie
into the rules in the sendmail.cf file. While I personally had
hoped I didn't need to know this, the book gives enough information
to help you understand this without getting bogged down in
theory.</p><p>Even if you have what looks like a working Sendmail, the
chapter on &ldquo;Maintenance and Administration&rdquo; will help you feel a
lot better about your relationship with Sendmail. After going
through all the files related to Sendmail and all the command line
options, it looks at things you can check, why you might want to
check them, and how to check them. For example, a section on queued
mail offers five steps to help identify why mail is remaining in
the queue and what to do to get it on its way.</p><p>The book ends with a series of appendicies that offer
resources or pointers to resources that you need. These include
summaries of the options and mailer flags for the sendmail.cf file,
sample sendmail.cf files, logging and debugging information, and
even the form to be sent in to the InterNIC to register a
domain.</p><p>The main shortcoming of the book is that it does not address
Release 8 of Sendmail. The authors claim that the philosophy of R8
is the same as R5. Certainly the added functionality in R8 is not
covered. They may be absolutely right in their decision, however.
This book contains plenty to keep you thinking, and adding
complications of R8 could have detracted from the book's
usability.</p><p>If you are afraid of Sendmail but have to deal with it, this
is the right book to get. It doesn't tell you everything but it
does tell you more than most systems administrators need to know
and it is presented in a very practical manner from the point of
view of two people who see Sendmail as a tool and have learned to
use that tool to accomplish their tasks.</p></div></div>
