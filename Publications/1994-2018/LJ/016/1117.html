    This month, we inaugurate a bimonthly column for
    Tcl/Tk programmers. Stephen Uhler will cover some useful
    but perhaps poorly-known or poorly-understood features of
    the Tcl language and the Tk windowing toolkit.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x251e580.0x26163f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>For those new to the Tcl language, the
name of this column might be confusing: Tcl is pronounced &ldquo;tickle&rdquo;.
This column will be mainly for those who already know Tcl and Tk
and wish to learn how to improve their programming skills. For
readers who would like to learn about Tcl and Tck, they are amply
covered in John K. Ousterhout's book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Tcl and the Tk
Toolkit</em></span>, and <i  >Linux Journal</i> printed
an introductory article in the December 1994 issue as well.
</p><p>User interfaces are created in Tk with two steps. First, the
user interface elements (called widgets) such as buttons or
scollbars are created using the appropriate widget commands. Next,
they are arranged on the display with a geometry manager.</p><p>Tk comes with several different geometry managers to choose
from. The &ldquo;packer&rdquo; and &ldquo;placer&rdquo; are general purpose geometry
managers, whereas the &ldquo;text&rdquo; (in tk4.0) and &ldquo;canvas&rdquo; widgets can
also operate as geometry managers by positioning other widgets
inside themselves. Additional geometry managers are available in
some of the many extension packages, such as &ldquo;blt_table&rdquo; from the
BLT extensions by George Howlett.</p><p>Traditionally, the &ldquo;packer&rdquo; is called upon as the primary
geometry manager in Tk applications, because of the powerful
constraint based layouts it supports, whereas the &ldquo;placer&rdquo; is
reserved for beginners who have not yet mastered the packer's
intricacies. John Ousterhout, in <span   class="emphasis"><em>Tcl and the Tk
Toolkit</em></span> spends 15 pages describing the &ldquo;packer&rdquo;, but a
single paragraph on &ldquo;place&rdquo;, suggesting &ldquo;the placer is only used
for a few special purposes&rdquo;. In fact, the &ldquo;placer&rdquo; is an essential
tool for the power user because it affords exact control over
widget positioning. I'll demonstrate two example uses of the
&ldquo;placer&rdquo; that hint at its true power.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x251e580.0x2616710"></a>How to be a Pane in Tk</h2></div></div><p>For the first example, we'll write a special purpose geometry
manager entirely in TCL, using the &ldquo;placer&rdquo;, to construct a
Motif-like &ldquo;pane&rdquo; widget. The &ldquo;pane&rdquo; widget divides a window into
two halves, or panes, and provides a handle the user can use to
dynamically change the relative size of each half.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
frame .top
frame .bottom
frame .handle -bd 2 -relief raised -bg red \
    -cursor sb_v_double_arrow
</pre><p>We'll start off by creating two frames,
<b  >.top</b> and <b  >.bottom</b>, and a
resize <b  >.handle</b> to change the relative size of
<b  >.top</b> and <b  >.bottom</b>. In this
example, we'll put our &ldquo;pane&rdquo; widget in the top level
<b  ><i><tt>.</tt></i></b>, but it could be
used almost anywhere.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
place .top -relwidth 1 -rely 0 -height -1 \
    -anchor nw
place .bottom -relwidth 1 -rely 1 -height -1 \
    -anchor sw
place .handle -relx 0.9 -width 10 -height 10 \
    -anchor e
. configure -bg black
</pre><p>These 3 widgets are arranged by the &ldquo;placer&rdquo; in two steps. First we
specify the options to <b  >place</b> that won't change.
Both <b  >.top</b> and <b  >.bottom</b> will
span the entire width of the window (<b  >-relwidth
1</b>), with <b  >.top</b> anchored to the top
(<b  >-rely 0 -anchor nw</b>) and
<b  >.bottom</b> anchored at the bottom (<b  >-rely 1
-anchor sw</b>). The option <b  >-height -1</b> (a
new Tk4.0 feature) decreases the height of <b  >.top</b>
and <b  >.bottom</b> by 1 pixel, which leaves a &ldquo;gap&rdquo;
between the windows, so the root window will show through as a
black (<b  >.&lt;\!s&gt;configure -bg black</b>) line
between the 2 panes. Finally, we'll place
<b  >.handle</b> near the right edge.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
bind . &lt;Configure&gt; {
    set H [winfo height .].0
    set Y0 [winfo rooty .]
}
</pre><p>To calculate the relative placement of <b  >.top</b> and
<b  >.bottom</b> we'll need to know the position
(<b  >Y0</b>) and size (<b  >H</b>) of the root
window, which we'll compute any time either could change, by
binding the computation to a <b  >&lt;Configure&gt;</b>
event. Since the height (<b  >H</b>) will be used as a
floating point number, we'll tack on a <b  >.0</b>.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
bind .handle &lt;B1-Motion&gt; {
    adjust [expr (%Y-$Y0)/$H]
}
</pre><p>When the user moves the handle by dragging it with the mouse, we'll
compute the fraction of the way down the root window the mouse is,
and call <b  >adjust</b> to move the windows accordingly.
We need to use <b  >%Y</b>, the mouse position in &ldquo;root&rdquo;
coordinates, because <b  >%y</b> is relative to the
<b  >handle</b> and not the root window,
<b  ><i><tt>.</tt></i></b>.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
proc adjust {fract} {
    place .top -relheight $fract
    place .handle -rely $fract
    place .bottom -relheight [expr 1.0 - $fract]
}
</pre><p>The procedure <b  >adjust</b> takes a fraction between 0
and 1, changes the the height of <b  >top</b> and
<b  >bottom</b> windows, and updates the position of the
handle. Only the <b  >place</b> options that may have
changed need to be updated. That's all there is to it.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
proc stuff {root file} {
    text $root.text -yscrollcommand \
        "$root.scroll set"
    scrollbar $root.scroll -command \
        "$root.text yview"
    pack $root.scroll -side right -fill y
    pack $root.text  -fill both -expand 1
    $root.text insert 0.0 [exec cat $file]
}
</pre><p>To test it out, we need something to put in the top and bottom
halves. We'll create a procedure <b  >stuff</b> that
displays the contents of a file in a text widget with a scroll bar.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
adjust .5
stuff .bottom $env(HOME)/.login
stuff .top $env(HOME)/.cshrc
</pre><p>Now fill each pane, <b  >adjust</b> the two halves, and
off you go.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x251e580.0x2617a50"></a>What a Drag</h2></div></div><p>For our second example, we'll use the placer to permit a user
to interactively &ldquo;drag and drop&rdquo; a widget within a window. When the
user selects a widget, by clicking on it with the mouse, we'll lift
it up so it hovers over the window, and casts a shadow as we drag
it around. Releasing the mouse drops the widget in its new
location.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
label .label -text "drag me"\
  -borderwidth 3 -relief raised
frame .shadow -bg black
lower .shadow .label
place .label -x 50 -y 50
set hover 5
</pre><p>We'll start by creating a widget to drag,
<b  >.label</b>, and its shadow
<b  >.shadow</b>. We'll use <b  >lower</b> to
make sure the shadow is always &ldquo;below&rdquo; the widget, and we'll start
<b  >.label</b> in an arbitrary location, 50 pixels from
the top left corner of
<b  ><i><tt>.</tt></i></b>. The variable
<b  >hover</b> controls how high we'll lift the widget
above its window as we drag it.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
bind .label &lt;1&gt; {
    array set data [place info .label]
    place .label -x [expr $data(-x) - $hover]\
                 -y [expr $data(-y) - $hover]
    place .shadow -in .label -x $hover -y $hover \
                  -relx 0 -rely 0 -relwidth 1 \
                  -relheight 1 -width -2 -height -2 \
                  -bordermode outside
    set Rootx [expr %X - [winfo x %W]]
    set Rooty [expr %Y - [winfo y %W]]
}
</pre><p>When we first click on <b  >.label</b>, we need to lift
it up, add its shadow, and compute where it is relative to the root
window so we can figure out how to move it. The <b  >array
set</b> command (new in tcl7.4), takes name-value pairs and
creates an array from them. Fortunately, the <b  >place
info</b> command happens to report the current
<b  >place</b> options in the form of name-value pairs,
permitting us to access and modify individual place options using
array accesses. The first <b  >place</b> command simply
moves the widget up and to the left <b  >$hover</b>
pixels as we first press the mouse. I think the second place
command, which positions the shadow, uses every available place
option!</p><p>The <b  >-in</b> option, which would more
accurately be described as &ldquo;relative to&rdquo;, causes all locations
specified in <b  >.shadow</b> to be relative to
<b  >.label</b>, instead of <b  >.</b>, which
would be the default. The <b  >-x</b> and
<b  >-y</b> options, when added to
<b  >-relx</b> and <b  >-rely</b>, position the
shadow where <b  >.label</b> was before we
<b  >$hover</b>ed it. The <b  >-relwidth</b>
and <b  >-relheight</b> options make
<b  >.shadow</b> the same size as
<b  >.label</b>, and then the <b  >-width</b>
and <b  >-height</b> options make the shadow a little
smaller, so it will appear farther away. Finally, the
<b  >-bordermode</b> option instructs the placer to
include the border of <b  >.label</b> when computing the
sizes for <b  >-relwidth</b> and
<b  >-relheight</b>.</p><p>Finally, we compute the location of the mouse cursor, in
pixels, relative to the top left corner of the root window
(<b  >Rootx</b>, <b  >Rooty</b>), so it will be
easier to figure out how to track <b  >.label</b> with
the mouse.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
bind .label &lt;B1-Motion&gt; {
    place .label -x [expr %X - $Rootx] \
                 -y [expr %Y - $Rooty]
}
</pre><p>As the mouse moves, we reposition the widget to follow along.
Because we &ldquo;placed&rdquo; the shadow relative to the widget (using
<b  >the</b> -in option), it tags along all by itself.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
bind .label &lt;ButtonRelease-1&gt; {
    array set data [place info .label]
    place .label -x [expr $data(-x) + $hover] \
                 -y [expr $data(-y) + $hover]
    place forget .shadow
}
</pre><p>When we release the mouse button, the same <b  >array
set</b> trick as before is used to &ldquo;drop&rdquo; the widget back on
the window, then remove the shadow.
</p><p>As you can hopefully see from these two simple examples, the
&ldquo;placer&rdquo; can be a powerful tool for the dynamic placement of
widgets in Tk.</p></div></div>
