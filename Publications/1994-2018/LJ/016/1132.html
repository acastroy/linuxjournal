    As part of a regular series by and for novices, Dean gives a
    novice's point of view on some of the many spreadsheet and
    text editing programs that run under Linux.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf70580.0x1068450"></a></h2></div></div><p>This series has aimed at the Unix
beginner who has experience with MS-DOS. I have assumed that such a
person is exploring Linux primarily to learn Unix easily, cheaply,
and conveniently. This person may buy or download Linux, get it
running, and probably focus on the main veins&mdash;Networking,
X-Windows, GNU C/C++, etc.&mdash;without really exploring some of the
<span   class="bold"><b>other</b></span> offerings such as
<span   class="bold"><b>sc</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>oreo</b></span>, or
<span   class="bold"><b>xfractint</b></span>. I originally dismissed
these programs, thinking they couldn't have much substance being
freeware and certainly couldn't compare to what exists in DOS or
Windows.
</p><p>Then I realized that these freebies weren't necessarily equal
to the <span   class="bold"><b>latest</b></span> versions of
commercial programs like Lotus-123 or WordPerfect but perhaps would
be comparable to older versions. And I realized that, just like in
DOS/Windows, these freeware and shareware programs served to
fulfill an applications void or to present inexpensive alternatives
to their commercial counterparts or came into existance because
they were fun and a challenging exercise to develop.</p><p>This article will be the first of a small journey to seek out
these other programs and see what they have to offer. I will
concentrate on three main topics: spreadsheets and text editors,
databases, and seredipity. The general focus will be towards
business applications and things that would impress someone
visiting from a DOS/Windows environment.</p><p>For the majority of these programs, a major advantage over
commercial rivals is that the source code is included. Linux lovers
already know of that luxury. Unfortunately, that advantage usually
dissipates with the need to compile the source, a task that brings
anguish to many novices. As a note of reassurance to other novices,
I've found that recompiling isn't always a headache. With a swap
file active to boost memory, I've had few problems with compiles.
Many of the glitches I've had occur when the make files expect
certain files in certain places; that is, when file locations are
hardcoded in. And, of course, it helps to read the README
files.</p><p>A point to remember: many of these programs undergo constant
revision and by the time this article sees the light of print newer
versions may have been released. With the updates, changes may be
made to installation routines or requirements. Consequently the
procedures or problems I describe during installing or bugs that I
find may not always carry over to newer releases.</p><p>My goal is to see how these programs compare to known
DOS/Windows counterparts, not to imply that either operating system
is better, but simply to provide a frame of reference.</p><p>Finally, if no installation option was available from
Slackware I unarchived these programs under /usr as those more
experienced than myself in Unix have recommended.</p><p>Let's snoop around, shall we?</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf70580.0x1068978"></a>Interlude: The Agonies of Obsolescence</h2></div></div><p>I realized that my copy of Linux from October 1994 was old.
Factor in the time for publishing preparations and I was committing
a grave disservice. It was time to upgrade to Linux 1.2.1.</p><p>Although I had been using Morse Telecommunications' Slackware
Professional 2.1 I decided to try another Linux offering. Highly
recommended, and what I tried, is InfoMagic's Linux Developer's
Resource. This 4-CD monster is an amazing bargain. Archives of
Sunsite, TSX-11, and GNU, &ldquo;live&rdquo; Slackware, tons of everything
else, and best of all: a great price. For the novice, the package
may be too overwhelming&mdash;there's only a little manual for
installation. (Other documentation is on the main CD. InfoMagic
offers a beginning package&mdash;&ldquo;Linux Toolbox&rdquo;&mdash;that looks pretty good
and comes with a variety of printed help.)</p><p>I have two complaints. The first is when using the Windows
Boot/Root disk maker routine of the Distribution. The manual says
that the program will let you choose UMSDOS as a Root option but I
didn't see one and I had to create one manually from the CD. Not a
big deal and certainly not heart attack inducing.</p><p>The second complaint, not specific to InfoMagic's product, is
far worse, but it only applies, I believe, to those having a Sony
cdu31a/cdu33a CD-ROM. The auto-detect function was removed or
disabled from the kernels. This means that even when you
specifically choose the cdu31a kernel from the &ldquo;Q&rdquo; disks or
recompile the kernel your CD-ROM still will not be recognized. At
least it did not for me. Why the decision to remove this chunk of
code which worked in earlier versions, I don't know. But I went
through Linux-novice hell to get Linux working again.</p><p>[The reason that cdu31a/33a autodetect support was removed is
that the only possible way to autodetect these drives is so
dangerous that detecting it has the potential to hang the computer
at boot. This was causing immense troubles for thousands of people
without Sony CD-ROM drives, and so the autodetect capability had to
be removed, and it is no longer part of the standard Linux kernel.
&mdash;ED]</p><p>A positive change is in the X-Windows configuration routine.
Now it does all the dirty work. You do
<span   class="bold"><b>not</b></span> have to manually edit any
files afterwords. As before, however, you will need all the
information about your monitor and video card, but the entire
process is easy and quick. Kudos!</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf70580.0x1068c90"></a>Spreadsheets</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>sc</b></span> (6.21, on disk set 'AP')
and <span   class="bold"><b>oleo</b></span> (v0.03.2, from Sunsite)
are both simplified spreadsheets similar to early version of
Lotus-123 or Excel. Both programs have a fair variety of functions
but lack the <span   class="bold"><b>bang!</b></span> of their MS-DOS
counterparts. I had no problems installing either one because
binaries were included in the archives. Both ran without fault. The
problems I did have were primarily related to cursor movement. I'm
spoiled; I like to use the cursor keys and PageUp and PageDown.
Both programs used keys and combinations that may be familiar to
Unix users, especially Emacs users, but aren't familiar to this
Novice. For example, the Lotus-123 '/' command didn't bring up the
menu. Also you can't just type a number into a cell; you must first
hit the '=' key (like Excel). I received an out of memory error in
sc when I tried to get the cursor to (g)o to cell zz3000. Sure I
was running sc through X-Windows but the swapfile was active. Like
I said, I'm spoiled.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>xspread</b></span> (1.1L2, from
Sunsite) is an X-Windows spreadsheet based on sc. Like sc the data
is entered via '='. Unlike sc '/' does bring up a Lotus-123-like
menu. If you had to use any of the freeware spreadsheets mentioned
this would get my recommendation, simply because of the Lotus-like
menu.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf70580.0x1068f50"></a>Text editors</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>vi</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>Emacs</b></span> (GNU version) are the two
most popular and renowned text editors in Unix. Most of the
following appeared on the main Slackware CD and had installation
scripts available.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>vi</b></span> is on most every system
and is a useful compact program, though I don't care for it
personally. The commands and three operating modes aren't the most
intuitive&mdash;not that DOS's <span   class="bold"><b>edlin</b></span>
fares better by comparison (though DOS's newer
<span   class="bold"><b>edit</b></span> does shine). My advice to
novices is to learn it just in case. Again, this program is
everywhere so it helps you to have at least a basic understanding
of how to work it.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>GNU emacs</b></span> (19.27, on disk
&ldquo;E&rdquo;) is not a program, it's a lifestyle. Either you love it because
it can do almost anything or you hate it for its obscureness. I
know it overwhelms me. The X-Windows version is amazing. It has a
menu bar to make things easier and the menu choices are bizarre and
unique. You can read your mail or news, learn from the tutorial,
search by most anything. Choosing calendar lets you play with
Mayan, Islamic, Hebrew, and some other dates. &ldquo;Moon phases&rdquo; is an
option. A diary is available. As for word processing I didn't think
it so hot. In X-Windows, I expected the ability to change fonts or
typesizes and there was no obvious way to do so. Comparing emacs to
Microsoft's Word for Windows will show even greater inconveniences
for the would-be Unix word processor. But emacs can apparently do
so much for so many types of people&mdash;programmers, writers, e-mail
readers&mdash;that to focus on just one area doesn't quite give it a
fair appraisal.</p><p>[The reason that it doesn't compare well with work processors
is that it isn't one. Even in the DOS and Windows, world,
programmers don't use Word for Windows to write the programs, nor
do they use Brief to write theses, as a general rule&mdash;Ed]</p><p>A mild warning: if you don't have the option to run it from
CD, expect emacs to use a little over 20 megs of your hard
drive.</p><p>And that's all I will say about vi and emacs. If you want
more in depth information about any of the programs look for
HOW-TO's, FAQ's, and books. <i  >Linux Journal</i> had an article about
customizing emacs in the September 1994 issue. A good basic intro
to vi is in Matt Welsh's &ldquo;Linux Installation and Getting Started&rdquo;
guide.</p><p>A quick aside: I don't care for vi but I use it; I like the
X-Windows version of emacs but I don't use it yet. In general, I
find the non-X-Window command structure of the emacs programs too
arcane. In part, this is because I'm coming over from DOS where
most text editors have available the Wordstar-compatible commands
or where most everything is mouseable. Since I use a &ldquo;modern&rdquo; word
processor, many of the Unix programs I found seem outright brutal.
For me &lt;F1&gt; should always be the help key, not some ^h-?
combination requiring three hands.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf70580.0x10694d0"></a>Emacs clones</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>Lucid Emacs</b></span> (19.10) is a
clean variant of GNU Emacs and is very nice. Unlike the GNU version
it doesn't bombard you with a variety of unusual options. It
appears to focus on basic text editing and that's it! Cursor key
and mouse movement and all the other basics are there. The one
immediate nitpick I discovered is that when you change the font or
type size for a sentence, word, or a block, all the text in the
file gets changed. [This is because Lucid Emacs, like GNU Emacs, is
a text editor, and you are changing the font that the whole file is
displayed in&mdash;Ed] Like GNU Emacs, Lucid will eat up about 20 megs
of hard drive space so you may want to choose between the two
and/or run it from the CD.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>jove</b></span> (4.14.10, on disk &ldquo;AP&rdquo;)
stands for &ldquo;Jonathan's Own Version of Emacs&rdquo;. Unfortunately I
couldn't explore whatever differences exist between this and the
real emacs since I'm not an expert user of emacs. One obvious
difference is the amount of hard drive space used.
<span   class="bold"><b>jove</b></span> doesn't come close to the
over-20 megs that emacs consumes. Other than that, the same
annoying obscure commands are present.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf70580.0x1069738"></a>vi clones</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>vim</b></span> (3.0, on disk &ldquo;AP&rdquo;)
stands for Vi IMproved. I've already stated that I'm not enthused
about vi. Sadly, vim doesn't improve my opinion. It may be
improvement over vi but it still doesn't make the commands any more
intuitive or the vi idea any more palatable.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>fpted</b></span> is another clone.
Unfortunately I couldn't really try it because it crashed. It
looked like, at least, a help menu was easily available.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>celvis</b></span> required compiling,
which produced a multitude of warnings. Yet it ran without any
apparent problems. A unique aspect to this clone is that with the
proper terminal you can write in Chinese.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>vile</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>xvile</b></span> for X-Windows are yet more
vi clones. I liked these two because of the highlight bar at the
bottom which, in part, clearly tells the command for help. I keep
focussing on help because for novices it is perhaps the most
important command to know. Considering that many of these programs
do not include help files or tutorials, a menu bar saying that help
is ^h-? or something is a great benefit.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>nvi</b></span> (1.03) is&mdash;guess
what&mdash;yet <span   class="bold"><b>another</b></span> clone of vi but
without a helpful menu bar at the bottom. [It's the official &ldquo;new
vi&rdquo; from Berkeley&mdash;Ed]</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>xvi</b></span> needed compiling which I
passed on. My guess is this program is yet another variant on vi
and will run under X-Windows.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf70580.0x1069cb8"></a>Other editors</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>jed</b></span> (0.96, also on disk
&ldquo;AP&rdquo;) is a program that I like. It uses the cursor keys for easy
movement. There's a menu at the top and another available that
appears at the bottom when you hit ^h-?. However, one warning about
that: option 6 will not exit you from the secondary menu but from
entire program! [Jed can also use Emacs, EDT, and Wordstar keys,
and the curser keys work the same no matter what keyset you are
using, so most people will be comfortable with it one way or
another&mdash;Ed]</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>joe</b></span> (2.2, disk &ldquo;AP&rdquo;) is a
program I also like but not quite as much as jed. The screen is
cleaner, not as cluttered with a help menu, just a simple bar at
the top. <span   class="bold"><b>joe</b></span> uses Wordstar-like
commands so I had no problems with cursor movement and other
commands. The help was a bit tricky. ^k-h to turn it on but to page
through required an awkward ^[-. or ^[-, (for backwards).</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>ed</b></span> stands for &ldquo;standard
editor&rdquo; and I couldn't stand it. This is a very small program with
no obvious help command. In fact, to figure out the commands you
have to read the source code; fine for hackers, not so good for
novices. [Even most hackers avoid this like the plague. It
complains about errors with only a question mark; the manual says,
&ldquo;Experienced users will usually know what is wrong.&rdquo; &mdash;Ed]</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>ez</b></span> (7.0, ATK 6.3.1) provides
a clean X-Windows Word Processor that apparently can be used
standalone or part of the larger Andrew system. This program was
covered in <i  >Linux Journal</i>, issues 4 (August,
1994) and 5 (September, 1994). <span   class="bold"><b>ez</b></span>
certainly lives up to its name with mouse and cursor key control
and a good word processor with multimedia options. Despite its ease
it didn't have any obvious way to change fonts or type sizes,
unusual for a program of this quality. I discovered a window that
had the information about fonts and whatnot listed but again no
obvious way to make changes.</p><p>[<span   class="bold"><b>ez</b></span> can edit documents of
many different types transparantly. In order to access the word
processing features, you have to open the right kind of document by
giving the file the correct extension. Files ending in .d or .doc
will turn on ez's word processing capability, which will show up in
obvious menus; for instance, font changes are accessed through the
&ldquo;Font&rdquo; menu&mdash;Ed]</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>crisp</b></span> (v2.2e from the
Sunsite CD) is an editor that is like emacs in that it has great
expandability, obscure commands, and can be used for programming.
Untarring the binaries produced a barrage of files including the
two main executables cr and xcr (for the X-Windows version). Upon
startup of either you get a window with an information bar at the
bottom. For novices there is no obvious help command. ^-h didn't
work. crisp was the last package I looked at and I was determined
to at least figure some of it out. I used
<span   class="bold"><b>mc</b></span> and finally discovered user and
programmer help files under /usr/local/lib/crisp/help/org. The
user.hlp file said Alt-h would give help but back in crisp it
didn't; it gave gibberish that told me I probably had an emulation
problem. Enough, enough, I resign. For Crisp this is apparently the
last freebie version and they now have a snazzy graphical offering.
I hope it has an obvious help command.</p><p>Whew!!!</p><p>I probably missed a few spreadsheets and text editors while
scrounging through the CD's. My general impression is that for the
spreadsheets the level of the freeware is comparable to an early
Lotus-123 or Excel. But the programs work and will get you through
your basic spreadsheet needs.</p><p>There are quite a few choices of text editors available with
the majority of them clones of either vi or emacs. My personal
favorites are jed, joe, either X-Windows version of emacs, and
Andrew's ez. They get the job done fairly easily and Emacs can
apparently handle most anything. To conserve hard drive space, I
would probably choose GNU Emacs over Lucid or maybe have both
runnable off the CD. But to summarize my feelings: I guess I
expected programs that were more for word processing and for that I
gained disappointment. Maybe the WordPerfect demo would have met my
expectation could I have installed the beast. For word processing I
would stay with what I have in DOS or perhaps purchase a good
commerical UNIX word processor. As a writer, I need advanced
features and none of the above programs really satisfied that
criterion, instead being better for producing ASCII files and for
programming environments.</p><p>[Projects are now underway to provide more word processing
programs. We will cover them in <i  >Linux Journal</i>
when they are ready for public consumption&mdash;ED]</p></div></div>
