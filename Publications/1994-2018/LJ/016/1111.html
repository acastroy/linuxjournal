<span   class="emphasis"><em>What is your background and how did you learn of
Linux?</em></span>
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Steven</b></span>: I attended St.
Peters College, Oxford University, 1987-1990, studing the joint
honours school of Mathematics and Computation. This is where I was
first exposed to Unix (Sun3 with SunOS 3.5, and High Level Hardware
Orions under BSD 4.2 with some 4.3 extensions).</p><p>In summer 1990 I joined Papachristidis Ltd. (who do the
administrative and agency functions for Hellespont Group) as one of
a team of three. Various organisational changes mean I'm in charge
of the whole lot now...</p><p>The Hellespont Group is a Greek shipping company, based in
Piraeus, running a number of ULCC (Ultra Large Crude Carrier) and
VLCC (Very Large Crude Carrier) oil tankers&mdash;some of the largest
ships on the ocean, trading worldwide. There is an office in London
as well, and the two offices are connected by an analogue leased
line providing two speech and four data circuits. In the offices we
run a network of Unix machines, with the users accessing the
machine via dumb terminals (e.g. DEC VT320) and terminal servers.
Our primary interface is simply users running
<span   class="bold"><b>vi</b></span> and creating
<span   class="bold"><b>roff</b></span> documents. Admittedly, not
the most user-friendly of interfaces, but highly flexible and
capable of being run on many Unix systems. On top of this we have
written a large variety of shell scripts and C programs, also
highly portable, and a well-defined file tree which determines
where reports and files are to be stored, matching the hard-copy
filing.</p><p>Back in Novemeber 1991 I had just got Interactive Unix disks
(a real old version) and had installed it on my 386DX-20, when I
heard in one of the comp.unix groups about a free Unix clone and a
reference to alt.os.linux. I quickly found out where the kernel
was, and downloaded Linus' root and boot disks. I was
impressed.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Randolph</b></span>: <span   class="emphasis"><em>It's
clear that you enjoy working with Linux. How did you persuade your
firm to consider Linux?</em></span></p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Stephen</b></span>: I showed the early
Linux version to my Greek and American colleagues, who weren't
impressed. I passed through 0.11 and 0.12 kernels when Owen
LeBlanc's MCC-Interim Release 0.95 came out. 5 disks with a working
Unix on them! Threw away Interactive (which never worked properly)
and installed Linux. Peter MacDonald came out with his SLS package
and I spent a fortune on phone bills downloading the disks.</p><p>At this stage the shipboard project was being planned around
Sun Sparc systems (one per ship with VT terminals). My colleagues
didn't think Linux was capable. SLS changed their minds, so I have
Peter to blame (thank!) for convincing them. I offered to make
copies of SLS available for people in the UK who couldn't afford to
download it themselves, and Adam Richter sent me an Yggdrassil CD
free. Now that I had the source code I built my own setup, which
meant I could get around some of the problems SLS had.</p><p>From there it was a small step to experimenting in the
office, installing a small Linux system on my desk, and determining
if it could be used. Except for a few network problems (packet
storms), it all worked quite well.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Randolph</b></span>: <span   class="emphasis"><em>Can you
tell us more about how Linux is used on board?</em></span></p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Stephen</b></span>: Firstly, the system
now deals with 90% of the typed communications between ship and
shore. Using software on the office hub, messages can be sent to
the office and relayed out to third parties, using the much cheaper
landlines. Frequently, one message is sent to multiple parties, so
now the ship simply sends one message to the office and the
computer automagically sends it to all the other recipients. Of
course, the office doesn't just have telex either, and uses many
alternatives, but that's another story.</p><p>Next, ship's reports can be created on the system, and
printed, filed, sent to the office very easily. Similarly, reports
and procedures written in the office can be distributed in source
form to the ships for printing and local storage, making it an easy
way to update manuals.</p><p>We are now sending more traffic than we were before
installing the system, but the increase has had minimal cost effect
compared to our savings... When we first installed fax machines
onboard (many years ago) we initially saw a reduction in cost since
fax was cheaper than telex, but then costs exploded when everything
was faxed (even things that don't require it). Contrarily, the
email system actually takes traffic away from fax (sending data as
fixed-format email rather than fax) which has helped reduce costs
more! We anticipate costs to rise slightly above the current level
(to nowhere near the previous one!) as we send more data, but this
should improve efficiency and the ability of the office to monitor
shipside better, and so is an overall gain.</p><p>Spares and inventory control has been done on one of the
ships&mdash;the complete parts list from the ship's plans has been
entered, allowing an easy search for the official specifications
when needing to order replacement parts and so on.</p><p>Requisitions (spares, stores, etc) are already handled by a
structured document that is parsed by a script and printed in the
office, instead of needing to fax the document from ship to
shore.</p><p>The possibilities are endless.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Randolph</b></span>: <span   class="emphasis"><em>What was
involved in installing this on board?</em></span></p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Stephen</b></span>: At the time we had
a ship in drydock just outside Lisbon, so that was the perfect ship
to test on. The ship wasn't going anywhere, and we had access to
landside facilities in case we forgot something!</p><p>The initial design called for a computer and five terminals,
which would be placed in strategic locations in the ship (Captains
office, Chief Engineers, Ships Library, Cargo Control Room, and
Engine Control Room) allowing access to the main system for those
that needed it. Wiring through the ship was done with unshielded
twisted pair (3 pair) cables, terminating in RJ12 connectors, with
two sets of wire to each location. The main unit was placed in the
Radio Room. The wiring was chosen because it meant that the same
wires could be used for telephones, 10baseT ethernet, or serial
cables, simply by making the correct modular cables.</p><p>Installation was pretty straight forward. My American
colleague, also onboard with me, had spent the previous week buying
and fitting together the hardware, and making sure it was actually
capable of booting a minimal system. I also had my notepad running
Linux, so I could build an emergency boot floppy set if everything
failed with the tape.</p><p>This was the beginning of a daily find bug / fix bug cycle
that lasted through the two weeks we were onboard. While I did
this, my colleague installed the working files to make the file
tree look identical to that in the office. The end result was a
system that looked very close to that running in the office&mdash;on the
vastly more expensive Sun's.</p><p>After this, we left the ship to purchase some new equipment,
some different modems, and so on, with plans to return a month
later before the ship left dock.</p><p>When we returned, we replaced the terminals with smaller
Linux systems, so the setup we now have is a central 486DX2-66 and
three client machines, all running X and NFS'd together. The
central server acts as communications and printer server for the
network. To cope with a failure of the server machine a simple
script was developed to change some of the main configuration files
on one of the clients so that it acts as the server. Admittedly a
server without any of the user files, but enough that the
communications can be continued, and some simple work can be
done.</p><p>We have since installed a similar system on a further five
ships, this time using only 486SX-33 VLB machines (with VESA
graphics) as clients; machine prices dropped to a level that it
didn't make sense to use any with less power!</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Randolph</b></span>: <span   class="emphasis"><em>What
kinds of special problems do you find on board?</em></span></p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Stephen</b></span>: A ship is one of
the most electrically noisy environments I can think of, but only
the longest cable produced noise&mdash;and then only when left unplugged
from the terminal! We were quite impressed that the serial cables
worked over such a large distance.</p><p>Power for the system is also problem: the ships generate
their own power: 220V at 60Hz. To cope with this, we bought
American equipment, and had a transformer to convert from 220 to
110V. We had a Triplite UPS to cope with the inevitible power
fluctuations, and an Isobar to try and cope with any surges. A week
earlier, another ship's generator went overspeed and shot over 660V
through the mains&mdash;not something I wanted to risk on the PC!</p><p>Connecting the modem to the system was a lot of hard work.
(When in range of shore stations we use cellular phones and when at
sea we use the satellite based voice communication system Inmarsat
A.) This wasn't the fault of Linux though! The main problem was the
modem. Eventually we got reliable connections using Taylor UUCP.
Using the 'g' protocol we could get 300+ cps average throughput.
Not good compared to what v32 should be able to do, but a
<span   class="bold"><b>lot</b></span> better than telex! When we
upgraded the office Suns to use Taylor UUCP we managed to get 600+
cps average throughput using the 'i' protocol. The ship polls the
office at four fixed times a day (different ships have different
times to cut down on collisions).</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Randolph</b></span>: <span   class="emphasis"><em>How do
you administer these distant systems?</em></span></p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Stephen</b></span>: Basically we give
the radio officers some intensive training in the office on a
system configured the same as the server. We show them how to
perform basic admin tasks, such as backups, rebooting, sending
email, and so on. They are also shown the hardware, how to reseat
cards, and so on. A big problem on the ship is vibration, and so we
expect more hardware problems than software. That, along with
scripts and cron jobs, copes with most of the forseable problems.
For the others...well, I'm only a phone call away!</p><p>In fact, from the problems we have had so far, our
expectation of hardware failure being the biggest problem seems
correct. One PC failed with a bad power supply (luckily this was on
the first ship in the month we were upgrading the modems and so on,
so we set up a new server and put that onboard at the same time).
One laser printer failed to feed properly. One Boca board port
blew. But the hardware is cheap and spares can be sent to a port
where the ship is due, and the radio officers can perform the
physical swap out. Only one software problem has occured (and
unfortunately recurs because I haven't found a fix yet&mdash;printer
daemons on slaves sometimes &ldquo;stick&rdquo;).</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Randolph</b></span>: <span   class="emphasis"><em>What are
your plans for future development?</em></span></p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Stephen</b></span>: Well, we are still
building the network. We consider the configuration to be a success
and are planning to add a similar configuration to our remaining
ships.</p><p>The office communications hub has recently been replaced with
a Linux server that now routes most messages for the group,
including our external email connections. A longer-term plain is to
upgrade the office, replacing the dumb terminals with networked
Linux machines.</p><p>One thing we will <span   class="bold"><b>not</b></span> do is
&ldquo;version chase&rdquo;. The kernel and libraries we are using are out of
date. <span   class="bold"><b>But</b></span> while it is doing what
we want adequately there is no need to upgrade. If I did, then I
would spend most of my time sending updates to the ships and doing
little else!</p><p>Linux has proven itself extremely reliable. The cheapness of
the hardware has meant that we could and did build a network
onboard the ships vastly superior to one that would have been made
based around Sun equipment. The extra facilties of email over
telex, and the relative cheapness of the connection has meant that
shipboard data can be sent to the office in a more usable
form.</p><p>Since Inmarsat A costs are approximate US $1 for 6 seconds,
message size becomes an important consideration! We want to develop
a system that is 8 bit clean, allows routing of traffic via various
media (direct uucp logins, internet email, modem dialup etc) and
provides a sophisticated &ldquo;receipt&rdquo; system so the sender knows when
the message has reached the destination (e.g. we don't want the
ship to generate a receipt because it will cause extra ship-shore
traffic (expensive) so the shore based hub will generate it once it
knows the ship has collected it). Because all routing will be by my
software, it can ensure the message survives whatever the transport
restrictions are&mdash;e.g. with direct uucp it could gzip the file for
sending, email it could uuencode, etc.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Randolph</b></span>: <span   class="emphasis"><em>When can
I get a tour? I live in Seattle.</em></span></p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Stephen</b></span>: Our ships (when
they go to the USA) are mainly the other side&mdash;Galveston (for
lightering, so they're offshore and you'd need helicoptor ride to
reach them) and LOOP (Louisiana Offshore Oil Port&mdash;not easy to get
to), so a tour of the ship is highly unlikely, I'm afraid. Of
course, most of the time they spend away from any visible land
travelling across the Atlantic Ocean, but sometimes they go to
European ports (e.g. Rotterdam's Europort).</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Randolph</b></span>: <span   class="emphasis"><em>Besides
sending Linux to sea, what other claims to fame can you
make?</em></span></p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Stephen</b></span>: I'm the originator
of the &ldquo;I hate Linus Torvalds&rdquo; thread in c.o.l where I said I hated
him for making me upgrade my PC so I could run the excellent OS he
had written (and was flamed by lots of people who never read the
second page! Linus recognised it as a joke thankfully!)</p><p>I never did get round to sending him the postcard that was
requested in the early release notes...</p></div></div>
