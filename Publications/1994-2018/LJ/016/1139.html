    What does that mean to the average
    Linux user? What is ELF, anyway?
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ace580.0x1bc6240"></a></h2></div></div><p>The ELF tools for Linux have just been
publicly released, after months of testing. What does that mean to
the average Linux user? What is ELF, anyway?
</p><p>ELF is a advanced new binary file format for executables,
libraries, and object files (which are used to create libraries and
executables). It is the native binary file format of Unix System V
Release 4, and is far more powerful and flexible than the original
binary file format used on Linux, which is often called
&ldquo;a.out&rdquo;.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ace580.0x1bc63a0"></a>Why do I care?</h2></div></div><p>The people who really <span   class="emphasis"><em>care</em></span> about this
are the programmers who make it possible for you to run a Linux
system. They care because ELF makes several things much easier for
them to do, and even makes some things that were previously
practically impossible easy. This will allow them to develop better
and more interesting software&mdash;which every Linux user gets to
use.</p><p>Also, the ELF shared libraries are much more flexible than
the old a.out DLL shared libraries which have been the Linux
standard for a few years now. Backwards compatibility will be much
easier to maintain with the ELF libraries, which will give all
Linux users a more stable platform. &ldquo;Wizardry&rdquo; should no longer be
required to upgrade libraries or compilers, once you are using
ELF.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ace580.0x1bc6558"></a>Do I want to upgrade?</h2></div></div><p>Probably not yet. If you use Linux because it is an
adventure, or to learn, then you probably do want to upgrade.
However, if you just want to get work done, then you probably do
not want to upgrade quite yet.</p><p>There are two ways to upgrade. One is to simply install the
ELF libraries, and if you compile your own kernels, make sure that
your kernel has been compiled with ELF binary support. This will
allow ELF binaries to run on your system with no further work on
your part. The first problem with this is that using both the older
a.out shared libraries and the ELF shared libraries at the same
time will use more memory than using all binaries of one type or
the other, and therefore will almost certainly slow your system
down. Therefore, this is only recommended it you want to be able to
run occasional ELF binaries. The second problem with this is that
you are required to rearrange some files in order to install the
ELF libraries.</p><p>The other way is to wait until your favorite distribution of
Linux is available in an all-ELF form, and re-install your system.
As drastic as this sounds, it will lead to higher performance,
especially if you want to run ELF binaries regularily. Hopefully,
most distributions will make this easier than it sounds, perhaps by
having an option to only install binaries. Distributions with
package maintenance options should give you the option to uninstall
your old packages and install new ELF-based ones without a fully
reinstalling your system.</p><p>You will probably want to wait to reinstall your system until
your favorite distribution has provided a (relatively) easy way to
upgrade. If you want to use a new program available only in ELF
(i.e., play with a new toy), your time will probably be better
spent simply installing the new libraries. Unfortunately for normal
users, it is not as easy as making a directory and dropping a few
files in it. It requires installing a new
<span   class="bold"><b>ld.so</b></span> and moving libraries. There
has been some talk of a script to automate the process, and it will
probably have been written by the time you read this, but I can't
tell you where to get it because as I write this it doesn't yet
exist.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ace580.0x1bc67c0"></a>This isn't wizardry?</h2></div></div><p>The unfortunate fact is that to get to the state where it is
so much easier to upgrade will require harder work initially. If
you are patient, someone else may do the work for you; either
someone who writes a generic upgrade script (this is only really
possible thanks to the Linux File System Standard, which was
explained in the July issue of <i  >LJ</i>) or the
maintainer of your favorite distribution. But there is no free
lunch; either you have to do the work, or someone else does. The
difference with ELF is that once that difficult work has been done
once, the <span   class="emphasis"><em>next</em></span> time you need to upgrade your
shared libraries, it will be easier than it ever has been&mdash;for
whoever does the work.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ace580.0x1bc6978"></a>Update on Linux/Alpha</h2></div></div><p>For those following the Linux/Alpha port, Jim Paradis of DEC
recently announced that the networking code in the Alpha port is
starting to work, a few weeks after work on networking commenced.
This rapid progress, which has been characteristic of the Alpha
port, suggests that DEC is likely to meet their projected fall
release of the full system.</p></div></div>
