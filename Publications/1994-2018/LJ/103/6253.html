companies that claim to support Linux with their products, but fail
to deliver. InterVideo
(<a href="http://www.intervideo.com" target="_self">www.intervideo.com</a>)
claims to have ported their windvd player to Linux, but their web
site keeps telling us this:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>LinDVD, InterVideo's Linux software DVD player,
is currently available only to manufacturers for evaluation and
integration. Linux users should be aware that we are engaged with
top computer, Internet appliance, and set-top box manufacturers to
provide the highest quality DVD playback for their devices.</p></blockquote></div><p>Cyberlink claims to have ported PowerDVD. Status: same as
above.
</p><p>Bioware keeps telling paying Neverwinter Nights customers
that the Linux client will come, but every week the reason why it
doesn't come yet is a different one. Last week, the coders were on
vacation; this week we can't get status updates because &ldquo;the PR

important elements in the value-net that surrounds the Linux

been a great source of inspiration to many of us all along. You'll

[<i  >LJ</i>, September 2002] to get 1TB of storage.
Now, if these are 120GB drives, 8 of them adds up to almost 1TB,
but not if you use RAID-5, because you need to use at least one
disk for parity partition, so you are down to 7.</p><p>&mdash;Fedor</p><p>We used 160GB drives and should have said so in the

leaks that was not mentioned in Cal Erickson's &ldquo;Memory Leak
Detection in Embedded Systems&rdquo; [<i  >LJ</i>, September
2002]. The bounds checking patches for GCC can check local and
static variables in C modules, which makes it much more powerful
than a malloc debug library. Check the GCC Extensions page at

Choice Award for Communication Tool to the Evolution mailer, saying
&ldquo;We like the idea of being able to compose more than one message
at once.&rdquo; It has been possible to do this for more than a decade
using MH, and now nmh. This suite of e-mail commands fits nicely
with the UNIX shell, providing separate commands for scanning a
mail folder, searching e-mail and composing new messages. Draft
messages sit in their own folder giving an effectively unlimited
number. Myself, I still have drafts to finish dating back to 1999!
For more information on nmh, see

a word about one of the latest Linux distributions from right here,
the Eastside? I am talking about Redmond Linux, now called Desktop
Linux from Lycoris. What gives? They have not bought any
advertising space?</p><p>&mdash;Joe Pannon, Bellevue, Washington</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11ba580.0x12b3898"></a>Debit on the Left, Credit on the Right</h2></div></div><p>I would like to know what accounting program to suggest when

Linux Box. Each year was more powerful than the last. But I had
other things to take care of, so I would read and dream.</p><p>Last year was different though, I was actually able to build,
albeit slowly, your dual Athlon screamer! Was I happy? No way to
describe it. I finally finished it this past summer with the
purchase of a couple of fast SCSI drives. What a difference that
made! What more could I possibly want except the nice case with all
that wonderful cooling. But that will have to wait.</p><p>Why wait you ask? It's because in this latest (September
2002) issue you have now written another of these articles, and now
I no longer have what you call the Ultimate Linux Box! I can't
believe it? Do I go with the upgrade thing again? What is a guy to
do? I worked so hard to get up with the rest of the fast crowd, and
now I won't be at the top anymore. What a letdown. I'm totally
disillusioned. I just don't know what to do. Perhaps next year when
I read the article I'll have a chance to upgrade again. Until then,
keep up the great work you do for the Linux community.</p><p>&mdash;Mike</p></div></div>
