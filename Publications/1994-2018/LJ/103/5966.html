It also has one of the greatest divides between rich and poor in
the world, and this divide is most evident in the technology area.
The IT world unwittingly has excluded the masses as technology has
raced on leaving many South Africans behind. Socio-economic
circumstances, imbalanced education policies under the apartheid
regime, as well as language barriers, are some of the factors
recognised in this exclusion.
</p><p>Dr Neville Alexander, political activist, who was imprisoned
on Robben Island during ex-president Nelson Mandela's time there,
and director of the Project for the Study of Alternative Education
in South Africa, has been a key player in the language debate. He
emphasises the need to move away from being a monolinguistic
society:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>An English-only, or even an English-mainly,
policy necessarily condemns most people, and thus the country as a
whole, to a permanent state of mediocrity, since people are unable
to be spontaneous, creative and self-confident if they cannot use
their first language.</p></blockquote></div><p>Navigating the cyber world is daunting enough for first-time
travelers, without having to do it in a language that is not their
own. The translation of computer programmes into South African
languages such as Xhosa was virtually uncharted territory until
last year. Most computer software is only available in English and
poorly supported in South Africa's second language, Afrikaans. The
other nine official languages are not visible in any form of
software&mdash;interesting when considering that Zulu is the most
commonly spoken language in South Africa, with Xhosa a close
second.
</p><p>To address this, translate.org.za
(<a href="http://www.translate.org.za" target="_self">www.translate.org.za</a>)
has been set up to translate computer software into various
official languages of South Africa. This is the first project of
The Zuza Software Foundation, a nonprofit organisation aiming to
promote development and open-source software in Africa. Zuza,
meaning &ldquo;gift given freely&rdquo; in a local African language, is
working on proposals directed at internationalisation, business
development and education using open-source software. Zuza is
responsible for another project, Linuxlab
(<a href="http://www.linuxlab.org.za" target="_self">www.linuxlab.org.za</a>),
which provides disadvantaged schools with refurbished computers and
free support.</p><p>The translation project began with KDE, but the focus has
changed due to the fact that it is not cross-platform. KDE 3.0
includes Xhosa, Zulu and Venda. The translation and technical teams
are now focusing on Mozilla and OpenOffice because they run on
Windows, Linux and Mac, making it easier for any computer user to
install it and exposing a greater user base to open source. Zuza
unashamedly uses these products to promote OSS.</p><p>The translation is done using gettext, the GNU localisation
architecture and tools. The advantage of gettext is that it
separates programming from translating&mdash;translations can be added
or improved because they are not compiled into the application. The
team is using KBabel to do the actual translation. A GUI tool is
vital, as the translators are not highly technical, and it is an
easier environment in which for them to work. Mozilla and
OpenOffice have their own format of translatable text, which is
very different from gettext PO files.</p><p>Founder and Director of translate.org.za Dwayne Bailey says
one tool is better than three:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>We have invested a lot in learning KBabel, which
works on gettext PO files, and expecting our team of translators to
learn a new tool or to edit files manually is not productive. We
don't want an environment where they need three tools, but would
rather allow all of our work to be used seamlessly across all three
projects.</p></blockquote></div><p>In order to address this, the team built scripts to convert
Mozilla DTD files to PO files and similarly, use scripts to convert
OpenOffice to PO and back. These shield the translators from the
different formats and allow the teams to reuse existing work across
all projects easily. And, the conversion of these formats is in the
hands of technically skilled people and not the translators.
</p><p>Internationalisation in Linux with KDE is well advanced but
as new languages are added, shortcomings are highlighted, and this
brings new features to the internationalisation framework. In
projects like Mozilla and OpenOffice, you can observe a certain
internationalisation immaturity in that they don't adequately cater
for different plural forms, something that KDE is managing well.
However, one of the advantages of open source is that these
shortcomings are addressed quickly. Another area that would help
develop the project and assist internationalisation would be the
creation of a web-based translation tool to allow remote
translators to contribute to the project easily without having to
install software or even use Linux.</p><p>Bailey clarifies why he puts so many hours into the
translation project:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>The Free Software community conveys a spirit of
cooperation and sharing, and after you have worked in the
environment for a while and realise how much you have gained, you
often feel compelled to contribute something back&mdash;even if it is
just a well-thought-out bug report. And deep down, there is
probably a feeling of some fame. The bug reports got boring after a
while, and localisation was an area I felt I could contribute to
without major programming expertise.</p></blockquote></div><p>It is not only about the technical side of the
project&mdash;language is a highly sensitive issue in South Africa.
Neville Alexander states &ldquo;...language policy and practice in our
post-apartheid society is a critical component of the ensemble of
antiracism strategies on which we depend for the real and visible
transformation of this country.&rdquo;
</p><p>No commercial software vendors have addressed adequately the
language issue in South Africa, but in one year the Open Source
community has. Bailey explains,</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>In South Africa many languages have been
marginalized through the history of apartheid, which has led to a
lack of language pride. Seeing Linux users working in German and
French environments made me realise that this could do the same for
South African languages. I hope that simply allowing people to use
the computer in their mother tongue will stimulate pride in their
language. Also, learning something in your mother tongue is
naturally easier.</p></blockquote></div><p>South African Linux support and development company, Obsidian
Systems, developed and sponsored this project, sharing their
premises, resources and expertise to get the translation up and
running. The Shuttleworth Foundation, recently publicised due to
its founder's trip to space as the &ldquo;First African in Space&rdquo;, has
provided the finances for this project that has just begun to
scratch the surface of endless opportunity in computer
accessibility. Mark Shuttleworth, who sold Thawte to VeriSign for
$575 million, developed his product on open-source software. One of
his foundation's key aims is to develop open-source software in
South Africa, which is beginning to gain inroads into the lifeblood
of the mainstream IT sector, both governmental and private.
</p><p>The translation team is targeting the 11 official languages
of South Africa first. Once those projects are mature, the team
will look beyond their borders to other parts of the African
continent. &ldquo;Open source provides a way for Africans to help
themselves&mdash;not to have to wait for the first world&mdash;but to get up
and do it for themselves! Nobody else is going to translate
software into Swahili&rdquo;, says Bailey.</p><p>At this stage translate.org.za is also providing employment
for young university graduates who are the translators, as well as
students who are working off their fees owed to the University of
Cape Town through bursaries.</p><p>Obviously the issues that surround language, inequality and
poverty are broad and impact every sphere of life, but Zuza aims to
play their part. &ldquo;Translation does not remove all barriers to
computer access&rdquo;, says Bailey, &ldquo;but it helps to eliminate one.
This together with low-cost computers, open-source software and
low-cost internet access will go a long way to making a dramatic IT
impact on South Africans, especially the disadvantaged.&rdquo;</p><p>The first step is getting software translated, but without
actually getting people in front of computers, the translation
would not have the intended impact. This is where a relationship
with the second arm of Zuza, Linuxlab, is vital. The two projects
need to work hand in hand. Linuxlab is looking at low-cost,
thin-client solutions for disadvantaged schools. In South Africa
these schools often serve people whose first language is not
English.</p><p>Linuxlab's mission is to promote universal access to
computers and Internet in schools, allow educators to create and
refine open content and empower learners with a high-quality,
high-tech IT learning environment. The project's director, Dr Evan
Summers, believes that the culture of learning and sharing of
knowledge in the scientific tradition is furthered by the GNU Free
Software Foundation, which respects learners as participants in the
software community, encourages unhindered enthusiasm for
information technology and fosters a culture of collaboration in
our information society.</p><p>The first Linuxlab to be deployed was the Alexander Sinton
School in Cape Town, using a Linux server sponsored by The
Shuttleworth Foundation and recycled 486 PCs as diskless X
terminals with the goal of achieving a cost-per-seat of under $100
including network and server.</p><p>Mexico's Red Escolar (Schools Network), a similar concept,
failed due to the way the programme was implemented. Dr Edgar
Villanueva Nunez states in a widely publicised rebuttal to the
general manager of Microsoft, Peru:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>... the driving forces behind the Mexican project
used license costs as their main argument, instead of other reasons
specified in our project, which are far more essential. Because of
the conceptual mistake, and as a result of the lack of effective
support from the SEP (Secretary of State for Public Education), the
assumption was made that to implant free software in schools it
would be enough to drop their software budget and send them a
CD-ROM with GNU/Linux instead. Of course this failed, and it
couldn't have been otherwise, just as school laboratories fail when
they use proprietary software and have no budget for implementation
and maintenance.</p></blockquote></div><p>In this attempt to introduce the masses to computer
technology, it is vital that high value is placed on skills
transfer. With this in mind, Dr Summers conducts regular free Linux
workshops for educators and has developed Precis, a new
Java-inspired programming environment suitable for teaching Linux
programming in schools. The schools drive the project with
involvement from both educators and learners, with Linuxlab helping
to get the initial &ldquo;seed&rdquo; lab up and running, transferring skills
and offering ongoing support to the school. What Linuxlab asks in
return is that these schools co-opt educators from neighbouring
schools to participate in the Linux workshops and that they in turn
assist those schools in setting up their own labs when they are
e-ready. And so the process continues.
</p><p>The goal to have a high-quality IT learning environment
available to all learners is not a mission impossible. Summers
explains:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>An interesting trend is that organisations in
Europe and the US are looking to offload large quantities of old
PCs that are not suitably upgradeable for Windows XP, since dumping
them would contravene US environmental legislation owing to their
lead content. It is predicted that the number of PCs that will
become obsolete in the US alone over the next ten years is in the
hundreds of millions. This could give further impetus to the PC
refurbishing industry in South Africa, creating welcome employment
opportunities and increasing the availability of inexpensive
low-spec refurbished computers, which are suitable as diskless
Linux X terminals for school labs.</p></blockquote></div><p>Linuxlab assists schools in identifying potential sources for
old PCs that can be recycled as diskless X terminals. At Alexander
Sinton School the server uses the Linux Terminal Server Project and
the KDE desktop, including the localisation from translate.org.za.
Volunteers from the Cape Town Linux community deploy the labs. The
school recruits members from the community and neighbouring schools
to assist with preparing the lab, including the network cabling and
furniture, in order to keep the costs of the seed lab under $1,000.
This empowers educators in disadvantaged schools to realise the
dream of providing a high-quality IT learning environment for their
learners.
</p><p>The gap between those empowered by technology and those who
have been excluded must not widen. The only thing that needs to be
broadened is the thinking of those who believe technology is for
the privileged few. The Open Source philosophy flouts this belief.
Translate.org.za and Linuxlab.org.za are two projects that are
striving to make technology accessible to all South
Africans.</p></div></div>
