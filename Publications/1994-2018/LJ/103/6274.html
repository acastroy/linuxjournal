    Thanks to open minds, Linux is catching on in Panama.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x275a580.0x28524a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>When many folks think of emerging markets
for Linux, I'm sure they look at the success stories of DreamWorks
and many others. While these may be good markets for Linux, they're
not the only ones. In fact, the real emerging markets are outside
US borders in third-world countries, such as Panama, where I'm
presently living. When I arrived in Panama, almost no one I had
contact with had even heard of, much less tried, Linux. That's
changing rapidly. It started slow, but is growing faster every day;
a few firewalls here, then a few mail servers. Now, especially with
the help of some specialized distros like Knoppix
(<a href="http://www.knopper.de" target="_self">www.knopper.de</a>), which
allows people to test-run Linux without buying a new drive or
wiping out their old OS, Linux is taking over the point of sale and
desktop strongholds. It's going slower in the US, where the
entrenched mindset is hard to break through, but here, the minds
are as open as the wallets are empty.
</p><p>My four- and seven-year-old daughters both log in to Linux to
surf the Net and play games, and they have no clue any other OS
exists. The Barbie.com and CartoonNetwork.com/PowerPuff Girls web
sites are among their favorites. And <span   class="emphasis"><em>Galaga</em></span>
and <span   class="emphasis"><em>Gcompris</em></span> keep them entertained off-line.
Don't let America loose the edge; your kids can learn to love Linux
too. So when thinking of emerging markets, think young and
global.</p><p>Genmenu
<a href="http://projects.gtk.mine.nu/genmenu" target="_self">projects.gtk.mine.nu/genmenu</a></p><p>This Bash script will generate a menu for Blackbox, Fluxbox,
Enlightenment or Window Maker. You don't need to be root to use it,
because the edits will be written to your $HOME directory. I do
suggest you make a backup first, as Genmenu will clobber your old
file at the moment (though that may be fixed by the time you read
this). If you know Bash scripting, you can easily change this
script to look for your favorites (or not look for some others).
Using it could help maintain a large number of systems uniformly,
if it's run during each login. Requires: Bash.</p><p>HTun
<a href="http://htun.runslinux.net" target="_self">htun.runslinux.net</a></p><p>If you need to bypass a firewall that has only one or two
open ports, but you need to connect to other systems on different
ports, HTun may be your answer. You will need to run HTun on an
internet-connected system (your home system perhaps), but you can
create a VPN and use your home system as a proxy to reach those
systems not accessible from behind your firewall. You'll want to
take some security measures to make sure your internet-connected
system isn't abused, but this is a handy tool for working around
restrictive firewall policies. Requires: libpthread, glibc.</p><p>Shared Recording Server
<a href="http://oktober.stc.cx/source/erec.html" target="_self">oktober.stc.cx/source/erec.html</a></p><p><span   class="bold"><b>erec</b></span> is designed for raw
audio streams, and it works by attaching to a sound device and
acting as a front end. As it listens, it opens port 6130 so other
programs (even multiple programs) can attach and listen to whatever
sounds are coming from your sound card. Requires: libargh
(included), libstdc++, libm, glibc.</p><p>Simple Expense Manager
<a href="http://www.angelfire.com/tn3/petbath" target="_self">www.angelfire.com/tn3/petbath</a></p><p>This expense manager is so easy to use, you might use it
solely for that reason. Until now I added my expenses into my
accounting program, but sometimes that's too hard to do every day.
While these transactions still need to be added to my accounting
program, I can do it as aggregated totals at the end of the week or
month instead of fighting with it daily. Requires: Perl, Perl
module Apache::Htpasswd.</p><p>ProBIND
<a href="http://probind.sourceforge.net" target="_self">probind.sourceforge.net</a></p><p>I'm always looking for better ways to handle DNS
administration (among other things). This particular application
does a good job, although it is lacking in the security area if you
have multiple users updating only their DNS server. It works
extremely well if either users are all trusted or only one person
is updating many zones. Another drawback is the requirement to have
the PHP CGI module, the standalone interpreter. But if you have a
lot of DNS zones to handle, I'd look closely at this application.
Requires: MySQL, PHP with MySQL (both as a module and as a
standalone interpreter), Apache, Perl, Perl module Net::DNS,
OpenSSH (optional).</p><p>graphical Process Statistics
<a href="http://www.gps.seul.org" target="_self">www.gps.seul.org</a></p><p>Among the choices of software I looked at three years ago
were DHCPXD, still a great choice for a DHCP client, and gPS. A lot
of good software exists that will show you what you need to know
about processes running on your system; the ps and pstree CLI
utilities come to mind. But if you want to see something different
using CLI, you have to rerun it, and gPS will change dynamically.
You even can watch processes on other systems by running an
included remote gPS poller on the remote systems. Requires: libgtk,
libgdk, libgmodule, libglib, libdl, libXi, libXext, libX11,
libpthread, libstdc+ +, libm, glibc. Until next month.</p></div></div>
