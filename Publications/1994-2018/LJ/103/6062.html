      version of this article</a>, was later published on the <i>Linux Journal</i>  web site.</em></span>
</p><p>Deep inside the warm green interior of Guinea, centered in
the frontal lobe of West Africa, international rescue workers in
the widely scattered towns of Dabola, Kissidougou and
Nz&eacute;r&eacute;kor&eacute; now enjoy regular internet e-mail,
delivered straight to their own desktops. There isn't a telephone
line or satellite dish in sight. Instead we are moving the mail
over distances of hundreds of miles&mdash;over jungled mountains and
high palmy savannahs&mdash;using high-frequency (HF) radio. Our project
is called Radio E-mail, and here is its story.</p><p>The Republic of Guinea is a cashew-shaped nation on the
Atlantic, ten degrees north of the equator in West Africa. It is a
beautiful and resource-rich nation, about the size of Oregon. As
far as African countries go, Guinea is a calm pocket of peace and
stability and generally doesn't attract a lot of attention. But
Guinea quietly has played a heroic role in the theater of world
events in recent years, providing a safe and welcome refuge for as
many as half a million people displaced by brutal wars and civil
upheavals in the neighboring countries of Sierra Leone and
Liberia.</p><p>The International Rescue Committee (IRC) has one of their
largest operations in Guinea, providing services and support to a
population of up to 200,000 refugees in many camps established
throughout the country. I became involved with IRC when my wife
accepted the position of country director for the program in the
summer of 2001. Soon we were traveling on an inspection tour of the
camps, making the long road trip to visit the program's three field
offices &ldquo;up-country&rdquo;.</p><p>Traveling outside the capital city of Conakry, one
immediately finds that Guinea has little infrastructure, especially
in the way of electrical grid and telecommunication systems&mdash;to say
nothing of broadband access to the Internet. So IRC field offices
must provide their own infrastructure: diesel generators for
electricity and HF radio sets to communicate with other offices and
mobile units, which can be up to hundreds of miles apart.</p><p>Expecting this isolation and general lack of connectivity, I
was quite astonished to find a radio operator using his equipment
to make a binary file transfer from his desktop PC to another field
office&mdash;wirelessly! On top of the operator's radio set, connected
to the serial port of his PC, sat a dingy black box labeled &ldquo;9002
HF Data Modem&rdquo;. The operator used a proprietary, MS-DOS-based
program to make his file transfers, but I immediately began
wondering. If this device is moving binary data over the ether of
radio, why couldn't we set it up with Linux and network with PPP
connections as well?</p><p>Since IRC owned most of the equipment already and because we
would be using Linux and other freely available software, the
system could be implemented at negligible cost. I developed a
design and specification for the system, and the project we call
Radio E-mail has been continuously operational since January
2002.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14ff580.0x15f7a28"></a>HF Goes the Distance</h2></div></div><p>If you have been making the move to wireless lately, most
likely you are working with the microwave, high-bandwidth
frequencies of 802.11b. If so, you know that on a clear day you
<span   class="emphasis"><em>maybe</em></span> can get a line of sight connection out
ten miles or so. HF radio is another animal. Its longer waves
reflect off the ionosphere to follow the curvature of the earth,
giving HF signals a range in the hundreds of miles. From Conakry to
Nz&eacute;r&eacute;kor&eacute; (IRC Guinea's most distant field
office), HF easily covers a straight-line distance of over 375
miles (600 kilometers).</p><p>So the great advantage of HF is it can go the distance,
leaping the obstacles in its path with aplomb. Now for the bad
news: where HF wins the wireless game in range, it loses its pants
in data capacity. If 802.11b is considered broadband, think of HF
as slim-to-none-band. The radio modems we are using here are spec'd
at an anorexic 2,400 baud!</p><p>And wait, it gets worse. Two-way radio is the classic
half-duplex medium of communication. That is, you are either
transmitting (push to talk) or receiving, not both at the same
time. This, plus the robust error-checking protocols implemented by
the modem hardware, means the actual link experience is more on the
order of 300 baud. Does anyone remember 300 baud? Unless you
measure your patience with radio-carbon, your dreams of remote
login sessions will be dashed and splattered.</p><p>However, for classic store-and-forward applications like
text-based e-mail, the bandwidth limitation of HF radio is
workable. We do need to pay close attention to our configuration
and try to optimize as much as possible. With HF radio, every
packet is precious.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14ff580.0x15f7c90"></a>Radio Network Topology</h2></div></div><p>Given these capabilities and limitations of HF, our design
strategy for the project uses radio modems in a topology of field
offices, as shown in the reference network of Figure 1. In Conakry
we have a full-time internet gateway on the host coyah, and the
radio modem on the host congo serves as the dial-in hub for each of
the three field offices. We establish periodic PPP links between
the field and Conakry and use our choice of carefully selected
client/server protocols over TCP/IP. Although we might have
implemented e-mail to the field using UUCP instead, our TCP/IP
system is easier to configure and integrate with the existing
network and e-mail system. This setup also is converted readily to
use faster telecommunications linkups, such as land lines or
satellites, if and when these become available in the field.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6062f1.large.jpg"><img src="6062f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1. Radio Network Topology</p></div></div>
</p><p>For now, though, we don't have the luxury of dedicating our
radios to full-time connections for data communications. In fact,
voice communication continues to be the central purpose of the
radio equipment. Our implementation and procedures must supplement
this lifeline, not impair it. Because data sessions over the radio
block voice calls at each end of the link, we have policies and
configurations to hold connections to less than 15 minutes per
session to keep the radios free for voice contact. In the field,
radio operators have procedural protocols for making their periodic
&ldquo;dial-up&rdquo; connections with Conakry for e-mail exchange at regular
intervals throughout the day. Radio operators adjust the schedule
and break sessions as necessary to accommodate urgent voice
communications. For these reasons, all dial-ups are necessarily
under the control of the radio operators, rather than set up with
cron jobs or diald.</p><p>The equipment used in this project is made by Codan, an
Australian manufacturer. Although there are other manufacturers,
including Motorola, Kenwood and Yaesu, Codan seems to be the radio
of choice for international aid organizations in this part of the
world. Their big white Land Cruisers with official markings have
substantial Codan whip antennas bolted conspicuously to every front
bumper. The symbolic authoritative value of these thick black
whips, such as when crossing the many military checkpoints, is
certainly their most dominant feature.</p><p>The modem used in this project is their 9002 model. These
modems are equipped with a basic Hayes-like AT command set, so they
are easy to configure, operate and troubleshoot with any
telecommunications application.</p><p>There are some significant differences between this modem and
the family Sportster, however. For one thing, the Codan unit
actually is built as DTE (data terminal equipment) rather than DCE
(data communication equipment). To connect it to your serial port,
you will need a DB-9 null modem cable, wired as diagrammed in David
Lawler's Text-Terminal-HOWTO
(<a href="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Text-Terminal-HOWTO.html" target="_self">www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Text-Terminal-HOWTO.html</a>).
Not all cables described as null modem are wired the same, so this
detail is crucial. Also, the AT commands are not as extensive as,
and vary slightly from, the standard command set. And, of course,
this modem moves data more slowly than you can possibly
imagine.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14ff580.0x15f8160"></a>Configuring mgetty and PPP</h2></div></div><p>The Conakry radio host congo, aliased as radiohub, is
configured as a PPP server, ready to accept dial-in connections
over the radio from offices in the field. As with a conventional
telephone dial-in configuration, we use mgetty to watch the serial
line, initialize the modem, wait for incoming calls, answer the
&ldquo;ring&rdquo; and fire off the PPP d&aelig;mon.</p><p>The 9002 works pretty much as mgetty expects. We start by
setting the modem to a known state with the factory defaults
(AT&amp;F) and then get defensively redundant. We set all command,
local and remote echo off (E0 L0 R0); ignore carrier (X0); use
hardware flow control (&amp;K3); auto-answer off (S0=0 &amp; A=0);
and reset the station address (&amp;I=<span   class="emphasis"><em>nnnn</em></span>,
where <span   class="emphasis"><em>nnnn</em></span> is like a phone number, the unique
identifier that other radios call to reach this particular
station).</p><p>After mgetty answers the &ldquo;ring&rdquo; and gets a &ldquo;connect&rdquo; back
from the the other end, then what? This is controlled by mgetty's
login.conf file. It is common in dial-in systems to let mgetty look
for incoming PPP packets and then start the PPP d&aelig;mon
automagically, typically using CHAP in the link negotiation process
for authentication. Such a configuration is handled by the line
starting with the magic string <b  >/AutoPPP/</b>.</p><p>In our experience, though, the high latency of the radio link
makes an /AutoPPP/ configuration slow to kick in. What we do
instead will be shocking: we dispense with conventional
authentication entirely! In our configuration, the login name
provided by the chat script of the incoming connection is used to
start the PPP d&aelig;mon directly. When mgetty matches a login
name with an entry in the first field of the login.conf file, such
as Pklogin, it then runs the program specified in the fourth field,
such as /usr/local/sbin/pppd.login.kenya. In essence, then, the
login name used by the remote system serves to control access. Note
that Pklogin is bogus as a system account, and you can be sure I
haven't told you the string we are really using! (Note also that we
have an implicit system of human authentication even before a
connection is made, when operators agree by voice to lock on a
specific channel before starting the link.)</p><p>When mgetty gets a login name listed in the login.conf file,
it then passes control to the corresponding start-up script, such
as pppd.login.kenya. This in turn starts the PPP d&aelig;mon, using
an options file for the particular remote host, such as
options.kenya.</p><p>To spare yourself bitter trials of sweat, tears and other
emotional excretions, and pay attention to the lcp-restart and
ipcp-restart options. These parameters give the time, in seconds,
that pppd will wait to receive a reply to that particular phase of
PPP negotiation before trying again. The default value of these
parameters is three seconds, which is generally more than adequate
when using regular telecommunications.</p><p>Over the radio, though, if these restart defaults are not
extended, you'll only snag yourself a useless snarling hair ball.
Here's what happens. As pppd starts up, each peer begins a
negotiation process with the other to agree on all parameters for
the connection. During these initial discussions, when one end of
the link doesn't hear back from the other within its restart
interval, pppd repeats the transmission. In the meantime, though,
the remote end <span   class="emphasis"><em>has</em></span> received the original
transmission and sends back its reply. The local end gets this
response back to its first transmission, thinking it has a proper
response to its second, and proceeds to the next step of
negotiation. But then the local server gets what is now the
unexpected response back from its <span   class="emphasis"><em>second</em></span>
transmission, and the negotiations break down in unresolved
chaos.</p><p>By extending the lcp-restart and ipcp-restart parameters, you
can delay sending out repeat transmissions for a sufficient amount
of time for the peers at each end to receive a response. We have
configured a generous 16-second delay and have not had any more
problems.</p><p>Turning our attention up-country, each remote host in the
field is configured to dial up the radio server in Conakry. After
all our testing, failures and ordeals of travel, it was a happy and
amazing day when we finally got our first link across radio waves
spreading invisibly through the Guinean atmosphere. From kenya we
actually made SSH connections with congo simply to express our
exuberance over &ldquo;talk&rdquo; sessions with the radio operators watching
their terminal screen in Conakry&mdash;&ldquo;Greetings from Kissi!&rdquo;</p><p>With the configuration details finally worked out, we found
that the PPP link, although slow, would come up reliably and remain
stable at all times of the day, even over channels that otherwise
sounded fuzzy and had considerable static. Of course, all radios
and antennas should be tuned for their best performance. But once
you are able to establish a link, it is reassuring to find that the
radio modems are quite capable of maintaining it, even when
conditions are less than optimal. Because somehow, conditions
always have a way of being less than optimal.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14ff580.0x15f8738"></a>qmail in the Bush</h2></div></div><p>D. J. Bernstein, author of qmail, also has developed a number
of special-purpose tools and applications perfectly suited to the
Radio E-mail Project. Central among these, qmail includes a QMTP
server, implementing Bernstein's own Quick Mail Transport Protocol.
QMTP is a supplemental suite of programs designed for moving mail
over slow connections.</p><p>As shown in the reference network in Figure 1, qmail runs on
five hosts: the central mail server coyah, the radiohub server
congo and each of the three field office hosts.</p><p>Once qmail considers the message delivered, we wait for the
next PPP connection with the remote host kenya in Kissidougou. Then
we can make use of the serialmail package to blast (relatively
speaking) all the mail collected in the
/var/qmail/qturn/kissidougou/.QMAIL.PPP/ mailbox across the link
using QMTP.</p><p><a href="6062t1.html" target="_self">Table 1. qmail
Components</a></p><p>Each of the radio e-mail servers in the field run headlessly,
controlled from a simple command-line interface via Telnet session
from the operator's desktop PC. The basic interface consists of
four commands, usually run in the following sequence:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ppp.start
mail.get
mail.send
ppp.stop
</pre><p>These commands are simple shell scripts that perform their
respective tasks, each providing the operator with a modest amount
of feedback about what is happening at the time. The functions
could be further collected into a single command, such as mail.run,
but we want to enable the operator to maintain some discretion over
radio access, depending on the demands for voice communication.
</p><p>We don't try to get and send mail simultaneously; we first do
one, and then the other. This is another accommodation for the
anemic, half-duplex bandwidth of the HF radio link. As far as
network traffic goes, this link is like a one-lane back road&mdash;more
than a little traffic creates a long skinny parking lot.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14ff580.0x15f8b00"></a>An Algorithm for Africa</h2></div></div><p>As we may have mentioned, the HF radio link is a tad on the
slow side. Nevertheless, we manage to move a decent amount of mail
with it. On an average day, over 300 messages travel the air waves
between Conakry and field offices, over two to three brief
connections per office. And as is typical with all internet
technologies, every taste stimulates an even greater
appetite.</p><p>Given the limitations inherent in radio e-mail, we try to
maintain a usage policy that is as open as possible. For example,
staff members are free to use radio e-mail for personal
correspondence with friends and family anywhere in the world, and
there is no limit to the number of messages any user may send. Our
only explicit policy restriction is the request that users not
subscribe to mailing lists.</p><p>To prevent the radio links from getting choked-up for hours
on huge attachments, such as large documents and graphic files, all
qmail servers connected to radios (that is, the radiohub in Conakry
and each of the field office servers) are run with a message size
limit of 8,000 characters. This is sufficient for three to four
pages of text. Whatever can be squeezed into the 8,000-byte limit
by way of attachment and file compression is free to go.</p><p>The system has proven extremely reliable. Despite the
intermittent power outages typical in Conakry, we do try to keep
the mailhub server coyah running at all times by using a generator
and battery backup. So far, these measures have kept this machine
serving flawlessly since it was first installed, with a continuous
uptime at this writing of over three months without reboot.</p><p>Yet this reliability would mean nothing if the system were
not sustainable over the long term. Two months before we installed
the first radio server in the field, we formed a Network Users/UNIX
Group (IRC-NU/UG) among interested and capable IRC staff. This
group meets regularly and enthusiastically to learn Linux/UNIX and
to develop network administration skills. The group now has a
number of functional production systems on which to work and play,
using mostly recycled hardware. The Linux servers installed for
this project also host a typical range of other servers and
services, including DHCP, DNS, NATD, Apache, FTP, Samba and
PostgreSQL. The IRC-NU/UG provides a human network that will
continue to sustain and grow the technical network in the years to
come.</p><p>The successes of this project are readily duplicated anywhere
in the world. Schools, government ministries and other
organizations can build remote networking solutions easily over HF
radio where access is otherwise not available and do it at a
minimal cost. Once installed, these systems are almost trivial to
administer and may be adapted quickly to alternative TCP/IP
carriers. Maintenance of the e-mail system itself involves only the
routine addition and deletion of user accounts and keeping the
/etc/aliases files up-to-date.</p><p>We are now serving mail to over 50 desktops and 150 staff in
four offices throughout Guinea. The entire wide area network is
serviced behind a single public IP address, at a total ISP cost of
$150 US per month. Best of all, the system has deployed standard
network and internet technologies throughout the organization (and
throughout Guinea) utilizing freely available technologies. Not
only does this plant grassroots networking infrastructure where
there is no Internet yet, it helps build the core competencies and
capabilities essential for Africa's connected future.</p><p><a href="6062s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
