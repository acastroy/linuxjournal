    The votes are in, and&mdash;big surprise&mdash;they're not much
    different from last year.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22ef580.0x23e7558"></a></h2></div></div><p>Judging by the results of this year's
Readers' Choice Awards, things in the world of Linux are holding
steady. Almost 6,000 voters participated this year, casting ballots
in such categories as favorite distribution, office suite and
development tool&mdash;a total of 25 categories. All in all, while a few
nominees switched places, this year's results aren't that much
different from 2001's results. Perhaps this represents a
solidification of the market? Have the best products made it to the
top of the heap and are only improving their offerings? Or will
2003 bring something revolutionary&mdash;assuming politics and Hollywood
haven't outlawed open source and the Internet completely by then,
of course.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22ef580.0x23e7660"></a>Favorite Distribution</h2></div></div><p>1. Mandrake Linux</p><p>2. Red Hat</p><p>3. Debian</p><p>The distributions in the top three spots have been the same
for several years now, but the lineup this year is different. For
the first time in three years, Red Hat isn't in the number one
position, having been outvoted by Mandrake Linux. The most popular
write-in distribution was Russia's ASPLinux. For some, it doesn't
seem to matter what the distribution is, as one voter wrote, &ldquo;I'm
addicted to the installation process, so I switch all the time.&rdquo;
Yeah, that's good fun.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22ef580.0x23e7870"></a>Favorite Graphics Program</h2></div></div><p>1. The GIMP</p><p>2. CorelDraw</p><p>3. ImageMagick</p><p>I swear, I don't know why we even bother with some of these
categories&mdash;like favorite graphics program. In the entire time
we've had this category (six years), nothing has come close, ever,
to beating The GIMP. The GIMP: good for graphics, bad for
contests.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22ef580.0x23e7a80"></a>Favorite Word Processor</h2></div></div><p>1. OpenOffice</p><p>2. StarOffice</p><p>3. AbiWord</p><p>Our voters certainly won't complain about getting a free,
featureful processor (or office suite, for that matter), especially
when the original StarOffice it's based on is no longer free of
charge. StarOffice drops to second place (OpenOffice received over
a 1,000 more votes), and the love for AbiWord keeps
spreading.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22ef580.0x23e7c90"></a>Favorite Text Editor</h2></div></div><p>1. Vim</p><p>2. vi (and vi clones)</p><p>3. GNU Emacs</p><p>Are Vim users &ldquo;a rabid pack of fanatical lunatics&rdquo;? The Vim
web site denies it, so we won't push the matter. Vim is simply a
wonderful tool and, apparently, much better than vi, which received
half as many votes. Now if you want to talk fanatical, look no
further than the users who made Emacs the third-place editor; those
guys are nuts. Over on the write-in side, Kate is proving popular
enough to be on our official list next year.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22ef580.0x23e7ea0"></a>Favorite Desktop Environment</h2></div></div><p>1. KDE</p><p>2. GNOME</p><p>3. Window Maker</p><p>The top three picks this year were the same as those from
last year, in the same order, with about the same percentage of
votes for each (twice as many votes for KDE as for GNOME). Looking
beyond the mainstream, the most popular write-in was fluxbox. Quite
a few voters also like the minimalist approach to window management
employed by Ion.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22ef580.0x23e80b0"></a>Favorite Office Suite</h2></div></div><p>1. OpenOffice</p><p>2. StarOffice</p><p>3. KOffice</p><p>The OpenOffice love grows even stronger in the office suite
category, beating StarOffice by almost 2,000 votes. A lot of
write-ins said they use Microsoft Office because that's &ldquo;what the
office uses&rdquo; or for compatibility. The next year could change all
of that based on rumors of what's being planned for Linux on the
desktop.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22ef580.0x23e82c0"></a>Favorite Programming Language</h2></div></div><p>1. C</p><p>2. C++</p><p>3. Perl</p><p>C++ kicked Perl out of the second-favorite position this
year, and only 17 votes kept C++ out of the top spot. In its first
year on the &ldquo;official&rdquo; list, Kylix/Object Pascal came in fourth.
Following that was a close vote spread between PHP, Java and
Python, in that order. One quite reasonable voter wrote in that he
uses &ldquo;whichever is best for the project&rdquo;. And to the voter who
felt bad about preferring bash shell scripting, don't worry, you're
not alone.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22ef580.0x23e84d0"></a>Favorite Development Tool</h2></div></div><p>1. GCC</p><p>2. Kylix</p><p>3. Emacs</p><p>GCC won by a country mile again this year, but Kylix made a
strong second-place showing in this category, collecting two-thirds
as many votes as GCC. Fans of the ever-flexible Emacs kept it in
the top three again this year. The write-in list for this category
was extensive and included Vim, Visual Works Smalltalk, Visual
SlickEdit and mod_perl.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22ef580.0x23e86e0"></a>Favorite Shell</h2></div></div><p>1. bash</p><p>2. tcsh</p><p>3. zsh</p><p>The printout of votes collected in this category is always
the shortest, tidiest of the bunch. It's not that people don't vote
in the favorite shell category&mdash;over 5,000 people did&mdash;it's that
everybody's so quiet about it. So what can be said about bash? It's
dependable, flexible, extendable, hardworking and 83% of voters
chose it as their favorite.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22ef580.0x23e88f0"></a>Favorite <i  >Linux Journal</i>
Column</h2></div></div><p>1. Cooking with Linux</p><p>2. Kernel Korner</p><p>3. Paranoid Penguin</p><p>Marcel Gagn&eacute; will be very happy to learn that he's
your favorite for the second year in a row. Maybe poor
Fran&ccedil;ois can have a glass of wine to celebrate instead of
running to the cellar all night. To those of you who wrote in that
all the articles are your favorite, thank you; the checks are in
the mail.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22ef580.0x23e8b58"></a>Favorite Processor Architecture</h2></div></div><p>1. AMD Athlon</p><p>2. Intel Pentiums</p><p>3. AMD Duron</p><p>Athlon and the various Pentiums were the big winners this
year. Combined, the two processors received 74% of the total votes,
with about two-thirds of that percentage going to Athlon. Not too
many write-ins for this category, but Itanium, Power4 and Zilog
Z-8000 (!) all made appearances.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22ef580.0x23df5f8"></a>Favorite Communications Board</h2></div></div><p>1. Cyclades</p><p>2. Digi International</p><p>3. Sangoma</p><p>Okay, guys, we explained this category last year, but once
more: the communications board category includes things like
internal WAN router cards that let servers act as WAN routers and
multiport serial cards to connect printers, point-of-sale devices
and the like. Of the votes collected, Cyclades is the favorite for
another year.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22ef580.0x23df808"></a>Favorite Database</h2></div></div><p>1. MySQL</p><p>2. PostgreSQL</p><p>3. InterBase</p><p>By a two-to-one margin, MySQL is the voters' favorite again
this year. MySQL won the <i  >LJ</i> Editors' Choice
Award this year too. Last year's third-place winner, Oracle,
slipped to fourth place this time, replaced by InterBase. The
write-in favorite is Firebird, a commercially independent
relational database based on InterBase source code. To the voter
who asked&mdash;no, a &ldquo;haphazard arrangement of XML files&rdquo; does not
count.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22ef580.0x23dfa70"></a>Favorite Backup Utility</h2></div></div><p>1. tar</p><p>2. Amanda</p><p>3. Arkeia</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>tar</b></span> won by a landslide again
this year, receiving just under 2,000 more votes than its closest
competitor and 90% of the total votes in the category.
<span   class="bold"><b>rsync</b></span> is the big write-in
favorite. Of course, the point is moot because &ldquo;real men don't
need backups&rdquo;&mdash;right? Well, maybe only the guy who followed up
that comment with the admission he'd deleted his hard drive
twice.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22ef580.0x23dfd30"></a>Favorite Programming Beverage</h2></div></div><p>1. Coffee</p><p>2. Water</p><p>3. Tea</p><p>The write-ins for this category are always fun, because we
get to catch up on all the new sodas and coffee drinks available,
especially those available abroad. Sometimes the emotions run as
high here as they do in the favorite distribution category. What we
learned: Coca-Cola <span   class="emphasis"><em>cannot</em></span> be lumped in with
the more general Soda category; some of you actually like Vanilla
Coke; they still make Afri Cola; Hi-C isn't only for kids; and
Swedish coffee kicks wussy-American coffee's butt. Between caffeine
and sugar, you people are wired to the gills.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22ef580.0x23dff98"></a>Favorite Linux Game</h2></div></div><p>1. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Quake 3</em></span></p><p>2. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Tux Racer</em></span></p><p>3. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Freeciv</em></span></p><p>We collected 3,514 total votes in the favorite game category,
and the first-place winner, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Quake 3</em></span>, only
received 473 votes. Do you know what that means? It means a lot of
games are out there, and each one is somebody's favorite. Among
write-ins, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Frozen Bubble</em></span> and <span   class="emphasis"><em>Return
to Castle Wolfenstein</em></span> are the most popular.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22ef580.0x23e03b8"></a>Favorite Web Browser</h2></div></div><p>1. Mozilla</p><p>2. Galeon</p><p>3. Konqueror</p><p>Last year's winner, Netscape, fell to fourth and fifth place
this year (we split it out into Netscape 4.x and Netscape 6.x), as
Mozilla overwhelmingly claimed the title of favorite web browser.
Galeon, the GNOME browser based on the Mozilla rendering engine,
picked up the slack and rushed in to second place. Thankfully, the
number of Internet Explorer write-ins dropped significantly.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22ef580.0x23e05c8"></a>Favorite Web Site</h2></div></div><p>1. Slashdot</p><p>2. LinuxFR</p><p>3. Freshmeat.net</p><p>Maybe all the Francophiles who picked Cooking with Linux as
their favorite <i  >LJ</i> column are also fans of
LinuxFR.org, Da Linux French Page, which took second place this
year. As always, Slashdot's endless stream of updates on open
source, digital rights and new Mandrake user Wil &ldquo;Ensign Wesley
Crusher Must Die&rdquo; Wheaton makes it the most popular web site one
more time. PCLinuxonline.com is the most popular write-in
vote.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22ef580.0x23e0830"></a>Favorite E-Mail Client</h2></div></div><p>1. KMail</p><p>2. Evolution</p><p>3. Mozilla</p><p>In a monster shake-up, the GUI mailers swept the top three
for the first time this year. The highest-ranked text-based mailer,
mutt, fell to number 4. Last year, Netscape won; this year, it's in
sixth place. It looks like the release of KDE 3.0 encouraged some
switching to KMail, the only client from last year's top three to
return this year. Ximian's Evolution entered the category in second
place.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22ef580.0x23e0a40"></a>Favorite Instant-Messaging Client</h2></div></div><p>1. gaim</p><p>2. Licq</p><p>3. Xchat</p><p>This year's favorite IM client is gaim, which didn't make the
top of last year's list nor did it make much of an appearance in
last year's write-in votes. Trailing not too far behind with less
than 50 votes is Licq, a multithreaded ICQ clone with a Qt/KDE
interface.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22ef580.0x23e0c50"></a>Favorite Distributed File-Sharing System</h2></div></div><p>1. Gnutella</p><p>2. audiogalaxy</p><p>3. MORPHEUS</p><p>Remember the good ol' days when you could go to Napster and
download every last b-side of some obscure '60s Britpop band or see
just how many people had covered Dolly Parton's song &ldquo;Jolene&rdquo;? Or
were those the bad ol' days? Well, the music industry still is
trying to figure out what to do with music on the Internet (the
Musicnet and Pressplay services didn't even show up among the
write-ins), but Gnutella is going strong, receiving 800 more votes
than its nearest competitor.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22ef580.0x23e0e60"></a>Most Indispensable Linux Book</h2></div></div><p>1. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux in a Nutshell</em></span> by Ellen
Siever</p><p>2. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Running Linux</em></span> by Matt Welsh, et
al</p><p>3. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux System Administration</em></span> by Vicki
Stanfield</p><p>These three titles have been at the top of their class pretty
much since we started these awards. It's amazing to see how many
titles in Linux and Linux-related areas are published every year.
Judging by the ever-increasing list of write-in votes, everybody's
found an indispensable book to call their own&mdash;except for those of
you who see no need for books because &ldquo;everything is available on
the Web and in man pages.&rdquo;</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22ef580.0x23e1178"></a>Favorite Ad-Filtering Tool</h2></div></div><p>1. Junkbuster</p><p>2. Homemade</p><p>3. SquidGuard</p><p>The top three vote-getters this year are an exact repeat of
last year's. Not too many voters responded to this particular
category, so perhaps you've got a quick trigger finger and zap
those guys, or you suffer through them. Three write-ins even said
it was morally wrong to filter ads, but they're in a very small
minority. According to write-ins, a lot of you at home are using
Mozilla's pop-up blocking option.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22ef580.0x23e1388"></a>Favorite Embedded Distribution</h2></div></div><p>1. MontaVista Linux</p><p>2. Qtopia</p><p>3. Lineo</p><p>This is the first year that favorite embedded distribution
was included in the survey. Not a lot of votes were collected, but
MontaVista had one-third of the total votes, making it the
favorite. A few of you are building or have built your own.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22ef580.0x23e1598"></a>Favorite Audio Tool</h2></div></div><p>1. xmms</p><p>2. Vorbis Tools</p><p>3. mpg123</p><p>By far, xmms is the winner of the favorite audio tool award,
and perhaps by the biggest margin of any category&mdash;2,300 votes
between it and the second-place Vorbis Tools. Noatun, the KDE media
player, is the favorite among write-ins.</p></div></div>
