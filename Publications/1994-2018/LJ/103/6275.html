    Using the APM application to install, distribute and remove
    packages specifically used in database applications.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a8b580.0x1b83500"></a></h2></div></div><p>One of the core ideas of software
engineering is to divide a large project into separate modules.
Modularization makes it easier to customize a system for your own
specific needs, allowing you to write new modules and remove
unnecessary ones. Using modules also makes it easier to distribute
the work among many different programmers. A quick review of the
available Linux, Apache, Perl and Python modules freely available
on the Internet makes this point very clear.
</p><p>OpenACS 4 (Open Architecture Community System), the toolkit
for creating on-line communities that was initially examined here
last month, dramatically improves on earlier versions in a number
of ways. But perhaps the most important change is the division of
functionality into modules, which are called &ldquo;packages&rdquo; in the
OpenACS world. Because each package is self-contained, and because
it is possible to connect any package with any URL, OpenACS 4 has
made it easier than ever to create flexible community web
sites.</p><p>This month, we take an initial look at OpenACS packages,
including how we can install and use them. (This article assumes
that you already have installed PostgreSQL, AOLserver and the core
OpenACS functionality, as described in the last two installments of
At the Forge.) Since most OpenACS sites use some of the
functionality that comes with the built-in applications, rather
than write everything from scratch, installing packages is
something every OpenACS administrator needs to know how to do soon
after installing the core system.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a8b580.0x1b836b8"></a>Web/Database Packages</h2></div></div><p>Consider the following simple CGI program written in
Perl:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;
use CGI;
my $query = new CGI;
print $query-&gt;header();
print $query-&gt;start_html(-title =&gt; "Testing");
print "&lt;p&gt;This is some text&lt;/p&gt;\n";
print $query-&gt;end_html();
</pre><p>If I install this program as test.pl in my web server's CGI
directory, others can see the results of its execution by
retrieving
<a href="http://www.lerner.co.il/cgi-bin/test.pl" target="_self">www.lerner.co.il/cgi-bin/test.pl</a>.
If I want this program to be available under a number of different
names, I can copy it; the name that I choose will be reflected in
the URL.
</p><p>Things get a bit trickier if my server-side application
consists of several CGI programs rather than a single program. If I
want to have several copies of such an application suite running on
my system, I must copy all of the program files. In many cases,
it'll be easier to place all of the files in a directory, then copy
the directory and all of its contents each time I want the
application to run somewhere else.</p><p>Making such copies carries potential synchronization
problems: if I fix a problem in one copy of a program, I will have
to make the same change to every copy of the program. I can resolve
some of these problems with CVS, but I also could eliminate this
issue by keeping only one copy of my program on the filesystem.
Then I could configure the web server (either Apache or AOLserver)
to treat one or more URLs as requests for my program.</p><p>Now consider what happens if this application suite takes
advantage of a relational database. Installing the application is
no longer as simple as copying files or configuring the HTTP
server. Now, we also need to have some way of resolving potential
conflicts and confusion between the copies of a single application,
such that the forums at /foo/bboard don't get confused with
/bar/bboard in the database. If and when we remove our application
from the system, we also will need a way to remove the database
tables it used.</p><p>In OpenACS, the solution to this problem is APM, the
ArsDigita Package Manager. APM was originally written by ArsDigita,
a now-defunct consulting company that wrote the predecessor to
OpenACS. ACS worked only with an Oracle database server, whereas
OpenACS works with both Oracle and PostgreSQL.</p><p>APM handles a number of different issues inherent in
server-side applications that use a database, including version
control, scripts for table creation and removal and database
independence. APM also has been designed to allow each copy of an
application to have independent configuration variables and to be
associated with one or more separate URLs.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a8b580.0x1b83a80"></a>Filesystem Layout</h2></div></div><p>An APM really is nothing more than a .tar.gz file with an
.apm extension. The file is typically named like this:
<span   class="emphasis"><em>packagename</em></span>-0.5d.apm&mdash;where
<span   class="emphasis"><em>packagename</em></span> is the unique name associated with
the package. This example package contains development version 0.5.
Opening a package with <b  >tar -zxvf</b> reveals a
standard file and directory structure:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>packagename.info, an XML file describing the
contents of the package. This file, normally created automatically
by the OpenACS APM application, tells OpenACS which files are
associated with the package and which configuration parameters are
available for the user. It also indicates whether the application
is a singleton (i.e., provides services for the rest of the system)
or an application (i.e., can be run from a particular URL).</p></li><li><p>The sql directory is where the table-creation (and
table-destruction) scripts are located. Originally, when ACS
supported only Oracle, this directory normally would contain two
files: <span   class="emphasis"><em>packagename</em></span>-create.sql and
<span   class="emphasis"><em>packagename</em></span>-drop.sql. The APM installer would
run the <span   class="bold"><b>create</b></span> script when the
package was installed and the <span   class="bold"><b>drop</b></span>
script when it was removed. (The create script often runs INSERTs
as well, seeding database tables with standard data for later
use.)</p></li></ul></div><p>Now that OpenACS supports PostgreSQL as well as Oracle, this
directory structure has changed somewhat. Within the sql directory
are oracle and postgresql directories that have parallel scripts
for creating and dropping the tables. Each installed copy of
OpenACS knows which databases it supports (based on the value of a
variable in AOLserver's nsd.tcl configuration file), and thus
chooses the most appropriate script.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The tcl directory contains Tcl files containing
procedure definitions. These procedures are loaded into AOLserver
at startup time, giving them a speed advantage over those defined
inside of .tcl (or .adp) pages elsewhere in the OpenACS
system.</p></li><li><p>The www directory contains what we normally expect
to be associated with a web application. This is where we put our
.tcl and .adp pages, as well as any graphics and auxiliary files
associated with the application. OpenACS's query dispatcher, which
makes it possible for server-side programs to support multiple
database servers, works with XML files with an .xql extension;
these also go in the www directory.</p></li><li><p>Because of how the OpenACS templating system works,
it's not unusual for a single web page to use three files: a .tcl
file for setting variables, an .xql file that defines the SQL query
used to retrieve rows from the database and an .adp file that is
responsible for turning the information into HTML.</p></li></ul></div><p>APMs also may contain a number of other files, such as
database upgrade and migration scripts (for those users who are
upgrading from a previous version of the package), regression tests
(to ensure that the package works correctly), administration
facilities (under www/admin) and HTML-formatted package
documentation (under www/doc).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a8b580.0x1b842c0"></a>Loading and Installing Packages</h2></div></div><p>The first step in working with an APM package is to load it,
which normally means copying it into the filesystem where your
OpenACS system resides. If your OpenACS system is under /web/atf/,
then all packages go under /web/atf/packages. (For this reason,
each package needs a unique name; many OpenACS developers use an
Emacs-style package naming convention, in which the package name is
preceded by the developer or client name. This helps to avoid
conflicts between the foo-attributes and the bar-attributes
packages.) Copy the package's entire directory structure into
/web/atf/packages, making sure the files and directories are
readable (and writable) by the user ID under which AOLserver
operates.</p><p>An easier and more reliable way to install APMs is to click
on the load packages link within the package manager. OpenACS will
ask you for the URL of the APM or the name of the directory in
which one or more packages reside. OpenACS then will find all of
the .apm files located there, unpack and load them into the
system.</p><p>Once a package has been loaded into the filesystem, you must
install its data model and register it with the system. This is
done through the web-based package manager, which normally is found
under the URL /acs-admin/apm on an OpenACS system. Typically, only
the site administrator has access to the package manager.</p><p>The main package manager screen shows all of the packages
that are loaded in the system and indicates whether each has been
installed, superseded by a newer version or is yet to be installed.
Using the menu options at the top of the page, you can ask to see
different subsets of the packages on the system, including only
those that you are personally responsible for developing and
managing.</p><p>The package manager is the main way in which you create,
modify, update and install packages:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>You can install the data model for a package and
register the package with OpenACS. The next time OpenACS restarts,
files in the package's tcl subdirectory will be loaded into
AOLserver's memory. Your package can be connected to a URL via the
OpenACS site map, as we will soon see.</p></li><li><p>You also can use the package manager to create a
new OpenACS package. Indeed, the first step in creating a new
OpenACS package is to use the package manager to set up a new
directory and .info file.</p></li><li><p>You can examine any package currently loaded into
the system and retrieve a list of parameters, files or any other
information associated with the package.</p></li><li><p>You can modify a package, changing parameters,
files and other information associated with the package.</p></li></ul></div><p>To install a new package, click on the install packages link
at the bottom of the page. The package manager will scan the
packages directory for any new packages, allowing you to choose
which packages should be installed. (When you first install
OpenACS, no packages are installed, so this is a very long list.)
Each package can depend on one or more other packages. If you try
to install a package without its prerequisite dependencies already
installed, the package manager will require confirmation before
continuing.</p><p>The installer lets you decide whether you want to install a
package's data model or also enable the package for use on the
site. Personally, I always enable any package I install, but I'm
sure there are reasons why you might not want to do this. After
checking the appropriate boxes, click on the Next button, which
installs the data model. Following this, you must restart the
AOLserver, because many packages depend on Tcl libraries loaded
into AOLserver at startup. Therefore, the packages will not work
until the server has been restarted.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a8b580.0x1b848f0"></a>Mounting a Package</h2></div></div><p>Once you have restarted AOLserver, go to the package manager
and look at the list of enabled packages. All of the packages you
loaded should be visible on this list. From here, you can modify
the packages, load more packages or begin to turn the loaded
packages into an actual web site. This process is known as mounting
and is performed using the OpenACS site map. In one of the more
confusing parts of OpenACS administration, the site map is not part
of the site-wide administration page; rather, it is part of the
main site administration page. In other words, you manage packages
under /acs-admin/apm, but you manage the site map under
/admin/site-map. There are some good reasons for this, but it tends
to confuse people more than it helps them.</p><p>The site map tells OpenACS how to connect a URL to an
application. For example, you might want the OpenACS bboard package
to be under the /forum URL or the /bboard URL. In some cases, you
actually might want to have it in both places. The site map allows
you to do this by clicking the mouse.</p><p>To connect a package to a URL for the first time, click on
the New subfolder link to the right of the / path. You are asked to
name the URL under which the new application should be mounted. To
install the bboard package under /forum, you would enter
<b  >forum</b> (without the leading slash).</p><p>If you stop here, you can treat the new subfolder as nothing
more than a folder in which new folders and/or static documents are
placed. But you also can click the New application link associated
with this folder, choosing an installed application package and
giving it a human-readable name that will be used in titlebars and
headlines. So while you might put the forums under the /bboard URL,
you might want to give it the name Discussion forums. This title
cannot be changed all that easily, so give this process some
thought.</p><p>The new application link creates a new package instance and
then attaches it to the directory you have created. To make an
alias to this application, you can create a new subfolder and then
use the mount link. It took me a while to understand that mount
lets you connect to existing application instances, while new
application creates an entirely new instance. This makes more sense
when you consider that unmounting an application (using the unmount
link to the right of the pathname) does not delete it but makes it
unreachable. To delete an instance of an application completely,
you must click on the unmounted application link from the site map,
and then click on the delete link next to the unmounted
application.</p><p>Each instance of an application has its own permissions and
its own parameters. I have found parameters to be a particularly
useful part of OpenACS, in that they let me create an application
once and use it many times, but give each instance its own
configuration. Following the appropriate links on the site map, you
can view or change the parameters associated with a package
instance.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a8b580.0x1b84c08"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>OpenACS packages, distributed as .apm files and managed with
the APM application within CVS, make it possible to create and
distribute web/database applications. Once imported, an APM package
can be instantiated multiple times, each with its own permissions
and associated parameters. As we will see next month, you also can
use APM to create your own web/database application packages and
distribute them easily to coworkers and other community
members.</p><p><a href="6275s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
