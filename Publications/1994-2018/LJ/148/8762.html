An overview of the suitablilty, viability and liability of Linux on
mobile phones.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd54580.0xe4c298"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Although mobile handset manufacturers are embracing Linux as an emerging
platform for next-generation smart phones, development and deployment
of those devices still face key technical challenges.  In particular,
mobile phone OEMs must deliver devices with power management, fast boot
up, integrated radio (GPRS) interfaces, advanced multimedia capabilities,
attractive small form-factor GUIs and differentiated PIM application
sets (browser, phone book and so forth)&mdash;all integrated and running in a
modest memory footprint.  This is a particular challenge for embedded
Linux developers because, unlike PCs, phones aren't built to a standard
architecture.
</p><p>
This article examines various technical challenges that face developers
of Linux-based mobile phones.  It addresses availability and maturity
of key enabling Linux capabilities and also of open-source projects
that support phone application development.  In addition, it discusses
technical and economic challenges presented by the stringent and numerous
requirements of mobile network operators.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd54580.0xe4c3f8"></a>
Linux and the Mobile Phone Marketplace</h2></div></div><p>
The global mobile phone market is growing at an explosive pace.
Industry analysts at IDC report that in Q2/2005, the handset market
grew 34%, as almost 700 million handsets made their way from device
OEMs into people's hands and onto the global voice and data networks.
Analysts at Gartner predict that by 2009, the global installed base
will number more than 2.6 billion mobile phones.
</p><p>
For the Linux-centric segment of the IT industry, these numbers are
tantalizing&mdash;orders of magnitude greater than total Linux shipments and
installed base for servers, and far greater in volume than the worldwide
desktop market.  As such, the mobile phone market represents both an
opportunity to &ldquo;break out&rdquo;, reaching significant market share in client
devices and to complement the already significant presence of Linux in
the communications infrastructure (based on carrier grade and other versions
of enterprise and embedded Linux).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd54580.0xe4c5b0"></a>
Why and Whither Linux?</h2></div></div><p>
In the past few years, Linux has made significant gains as a mobile
phone platform OS.  Device manufacturers LG, Motorola, NEC, Panasonic
and Samsung today ship two-dozen smart phone models based on Linux,
complemented by Chinese brands like Datang, e28, Haier, Huawei and ZTE.
Nokia and others also are beginning to ship Linux-based wireless VoIP
clients.
</p><p>
Device OEMs, large and small, are choosing Linux as the strategic platform
for their smart phones for a mix of technical and economic reasons.
On the technical side, OEMs look to Linux for performance, robustness,
&ldquo;gold standard&rdquo; TCP/IP networking (especially routing) and flexibility.
On the economic front, Linux offers OEMs lower development and deployment
costs, more choice of vendors (including &ldquo;roll your own&rdquo;), a larger
open and commercial technology ecosystem, and an opportunity to unify
the divergent and costly product lines and engineering efforts needed
to support multiple product tiers (smart phones, feature phones and
entry-level devices), network types (GSM, CDMA, analog and Wi-Fi) and
carrier requirements.
</p><p>
For all of these strong technical and economic benefits, Linux phones
account today for between 1&ndash;2% of the total market.  On smart phones,
the fastest-growing segment, Linux enjoys a stronger position.  Smart
phone share is growing at 85% per year, and Linux owns 25% of the smart
phone segment (Q2/2005 Gartner), far ahead of Windows Mobile and others,
but behind SymbianOS by a factor of two or more.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd54580.0xe4c818"></a>
Pick Your Phone</h2></div></div><p>
Categorizing phone types is not an exact science, nor even an exacting
marketing exercise.  Features that once differentiated phones strongly
(like e-mail or imaging) are now commonplace across tiers and price
ranges.  Moreover, what is smart today may be a common feature in six
months.  Feature phones for which you pay good money at the holidays
can end up as entry-level giveaways toward the end of their market
lifetime the following spring and summer.

The Smart Phone Trap</h2></div></div><p>
Although delivering Linux-based smart phones is no mean feat, it is still
easier and more viable than putting the open-source OS on lower-tier
phones.  Why? Because smart phones, with higher prices and more
ample margins, have more room in the BOM (Bill of Materials)&mdash;room
for hardware dedicated to key phone functions (multimedia, display
control, baseband RF and so on) and for software to enable that hardware.
Often the application OS (Linux, WindowsMobile and so on) runs on a
dedicated application processor, with additional CPU and DSP cores
handling voice, multimedia and RF functions.  Smart phone buyers are
also typically early adopters, eager for the latest technology and
more tolerant of some marginal behaviors, especially of shorter battery
life in technology-rich devices.
</p><p>
Smart phones, however, represent only about 6% of the total phone market.
If the Linux industry and developer communities want truly ubiquitous
phone-based deployment, a Linux phone platform also must be able to
support the technical and economic requirements of the broader middle-tier
or feature phone space.  These handsets don't sport all the technical
goodies of smart phones, and the underlying hardware doesn't come with all
the support hardware either.  A cost-down BOM means that Linux on the
application CPU is directly exposed to the vagaries of software support
for voice, data, RF and graphics.  Place that burden on a single CPU
running between 0&ndash;200MHz as needed for energy management, in a much
more modest memory footprint, and Linux can't make the middle-tier cut.
</p><p>
Social projects aimed at bridging the digital divide also envision
open-source phones for low-income populations in developing countries
(think tiny Ubuntu).  But just as the $100 desktop is proving elusive,
so likely will the free Linux-based cell phone.
</p><p>
Over time, the specs for middle- and even low-tier phones might rise to
meet Linux base capabilities, but margins also get much thinner on these
same devices.  Battery technology is not improving at an appreciable
rate, meaning that applications can't make up the difference with faster
clocks either.  So, if Linux is going to break out of the smart phone
trap, it must acquire a series of new capabilities and enhance and
unify many existing ones to meet the challenge.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd54580.0xe4d840"></a>
Technical Challenges</h2></div></div><p>
OSDL kicked off a new initiative (see the OSDL MLI sidebar) to foster Linux
adoption on mobile telephony handsets.  As its first order of business,
MLI is cataloging gaps and requirements to make Linux a more apt phone
platform OS.  The following list and discussion is representative of
input from MLI participants and other interested parties, especially
handset manufacturers and phone silicon suppliers.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd54580.0xe4d948"></a>
Power Management</h2></div></div><p>
Today, if a portable device manufacturer wants to offer a Linux-based and
power-managed device, he or she faces a boggling choice among variously
divergent paradigms (Table 2).
</p><div class="table"><a name="N0xd54580.0xe4da50"></a><p class="title"><b>
Table 2. Available Power Management Schemes</b></p><table     summary="&#10;Table 2. Available Power Management Schemes8762t2.qrk" border="1"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><tbody><tr><td><span   class="bold"><b>APM&mdash;Advanced Power
Management</b></span></td><td>The most widespread technology for Linux, but not 100% compatible
with more ubiquitous ACPI.</td></tr><tr><td><span   class="bold"><b>ACPI&mdash;Advanced Configuration and Power
Interface</b></span></td><td>The most ubiquitous x86/IA-32 notebook power management scheme
(backed by Intel, Toshiba and Microsoft).  Very BIOS-dependent.</td></tr><tr><td><span   class="bold"><b>PMU&mdash;Macintosh PowerBook Power
Management Unit</b></span></td><td>Power management scheme very specific to G3/G4 PowerPC systems
from Apple.</td></tr><tr><td><span   class="bold"><b>Longrun</b></span></td><td>Mostly transparent hardware-based power management specific to
Transmeta Crusoe.</td></tr><tr><td><span   class="bold"><b>DPM&mdash;Dynamic Power
Management</b></span></td><td>MontaVista Software framework for driving ARM (especially TI OMAP
and Intel XScale) CPU clocks and operating voltages among
&ldquo;operating points&rdquo; in response to policy and system
events.</td></tr><tr><td><span   class="bold"><b>IEM&mdash;ARM Intelligent Engery
Management</b></span></td><td>ARM Ltd.  Power management scheme for ARM core licensees with
dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (compatible with but different from
DPM).</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>
OEMs can look to the desktop where notebook-centric schemes like ACPI and
APM dominate, and indeed occupy most discussions of Linux power management
on the kernel mailing list.  For non-x86/IA-32 notebook hardware, OEMs
can turn to PMU for Apple PowerPC hardware.  Embedded OEMs deploying
ARM-licensed silicon can leverage the ARM Ltd.  IEM framework, or work with
the various power management schemes present on silicon from dozens of
ARM licensees (FreeScale, Intel, NEC, Samsung, TI and others).  There also
exist unique and further divergent energy conservation protocols from
MIPS and MIPS licensees, from FreeScale for its CPU lines, from IBM for
Power Architecture, from Renesas and Hitachi, and so on across the silicon
supplier universe.  OEMs also can choose schemes like MontaVista's DPM
and other embedded Linux supplier solutions.
</p><p>
Although choice is a good thing, too much choice can lead to fragmentation.
In response to this power management smorgasbord, members of OSDL MLI
and other embedded industry consortia have expressed a desire to see
either a unified cross-processor power and energy management scheme,
or a mainstream high-level &ldquo;umbrella&rdquo; that covers embedded, desktop and
even blade-based thermal management.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd54580.0xe44e38"></a>
Radio Interface</h2></div></div><p>
Motorola has been building radio sets for nearly a century.  They and
other handset manufacturers like NEC, Nokia and Panasonic leverage
their hard-won RF know-how to build their popular phone product lines.
New entrants and also new designs from existing suppliers, however, must
overcome a range of designs challenges before they can build handsets
that meet the requirements of carriers, operators and regulators, and
do so cost effectively.
</p><p>
In today's crop of Linux-based smart phones, the GPRS interface resides
in an encapsulated &ldquo;modem&rdquo; device that can contain an additional
CPU core, a DSP and RF hardware to support wireless communications.
It really behaves like a modem&mdash;many smart phones communicate with these
embedded processors via AT modem commands over a dedicated serial port.
Offloading the radio function makes it easier to build a smart phone,
but it impacts costs by adding components to an already heavy BOM.
</p><p>
Some experimental designs today remove the modem and expose the baseband
interface to the application OS (as with Nucleus in mid- and low-tier
phones), but doing so exposes Linux to hard real-time requirements
that stretch beyond the limits of recent advances in Linux real-time
(preemption and open-source real time&mdash;see below).  GSM and also
CDMA wireless protocols predicate signal frame times in the 800&ndash;900
microsecond range.  For x86/IA-32 and PowerPC processors with
500MHz&ndash;1.5GHz CPU clocks, submillisecond worst-case response is now
commonplace, but with clock-scaled ARM processors running at 0&ndash;200MHz,
hard real-time interrupt response and preemption are still marginal.
</p><p>
A separate challenge arises from the use of legacy telephony stacks
ported &ldquo;as is&rdquo; to Linux.  This software was written and optimized for
legacy phone OSes like Nucleus and REX.  These proprietary multilayer
stacks were implemented with unique thread contexts for each layer,
and when ported to Linux can exhibit 20&ndash;30 microsecond context switch
latencies layer to layer.  As such, just traversing the stack with a
single packet can consume a large portion of available compute time,
leaving few CPU cycles for other tasks.
</p><p>
If Linux is going to participate in cost-down mid- and low-tier
phone designs, it will need both more spritely context switching
and/or optimized and open native ports of key GPRS and CDMA protocol
implementations.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd54580.0xe45150"></a>
Real Time</h2></div></div><p>
During the past five years, Linux has progressed toward offering
significant native real-time responsiveness.  Today, Linux is replete with
native real-time options, including capabilities like the preemptible
kernel, O(1) scheduler, FUTEXes and the recent Open Source Real-Time
Linux Project (now merged
into preemption patches maintained by Ingo Molnar&mdash;see the on-line
Resources).  There also exist dual kernel and
virtualization technologies like RTLinux, RTAI, Adeos and proprietary
Jaluna OSware that offer RTOS-like responsiveness by virtue of embedding
an actual RTOS into the Linux stack.
</p><p>
OSDL MLI members and others in the community would prefer to see native
Linux solutions do real-time response.  For exposed RF interfaces, and
time-sensitive and QoS capabilities like multimedia and voice processing,
the consensus is that Linux needs continual nudging in the direction
of native RTOS-like responsiveness.  In mobile designs, Linux must meet
deadlines and switch context with agility in systems whose clocks can
scale erratically to conserve battery power, jumping from 200MHz peak
performance down to 40MHz (or even 0MHz) and back in response to system
policies and peripheral inputs.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd54580.0xe452b0"></a>
Small Footprint</h2></div></div><p>
Today's smart phones can ship with 128MB of Flash and 64MB of RAM.
However, a phone OS need not seek to occupy every last byte of
available storage.  Every byte used by the OS and middleware is a
byte not available to OEMs for value-added content.  On the plus side,
embedded Linux can theoretically deploy in a footprint of 1MB or less;
real phone configurations are much larger.
</p><p>
Embedded developers, platform providers and maintainers of the Linux
kernel itself provide a range of configurations and tools to shrink the
platform footprint:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Linux Tiny: this build option/patch set was introduced during 2.6 and results in
otherwise mainstream kernels with footprints well under 2MB.  Linux Tiny
also features other space-saving patches, like SLOB, a space-efficient
replacement for the SLAB allocator; tools for tracking memory allocation,
counting in-line function use and for comparing function sizes across
builds; and kgdb configurations for systems without serial ports (see
Resources).
</p></li><li><p>
ARM Thumb and MIPS16: embedded CPU architectures like ARM and MIPS offer special execution
modes and small word instruction sets that shrink application size by
generating and executing smaller code and data.  These methods and modes
are best employed to shrink user-space code, but in doing so require
special mode/size-specific library and system call versions to accommodate
8/16-bit instructions and operands where standard implementations expect
a full 32 bits.  More recently, silicon suppliers and maintainers of
appropriate architecture trees of the Linux kernel have begun building
and maintaining special versions of their trees to accommodate these
hyper-efficient execution modes.  Even if mainstream kernel builds
do support such execution modes, such support will likely be all or
nothing, making it difficult or impossible to support mixed mode systems
and integration of prebuilt (binary) third-party code.
To learn more about ARM Thumb or MIPS16, see Resources.
</p></li><li><p>
XIP&mdash;Execute in Place:
if you have truly parsimonious RAM requirements and can spare a little
Flash (and perhaps more performance), you can configure the Linux
kernel and/or individual applications to run directly out of Flash.
Instead of copying compressed images from NOR Flash (or other types of
ROM), there exist several schemes to support execution of uncompressed
program images directly in place (XIP).  Note that because Flash access
cycles are usually slower than those for DRAM, XIP programs can run much
more slowly than with RAM-based execution; although, kernel XIP can be
used to speed up boot time by removing the need to copy and decompress
the kernel image to RAM.
To learn more about about User Space XIP with CramFS and on raw NOR Flash
kernel XIP, see Resources.
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd54580.0xe45678"></a>
Other Ways to Shrink the Kit</h2></div></div><p>
There are myriad methods, tips and tricks for reducing the user-space
memory burden.  These include using uClibc
instead of glibc as a standard library, deploying BusyBox
and TinyLogin
instead of standard shells and multiple utilities, and using compressed filesystems like CramFS and YAFFS.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd54580.0xe45780"></a>
Carrier and Operator Requirements</h2></div></div><p>
Phone manufacturers, however innovative they wish to be, cannot simply
build the phone of your dreams&mdash;or of theirs.  Rather, they must
respond to the expansive and exacting requirements presented to them
by their customers, the mobile carriers and operators (think Cingular,
Vodaphone and others), predicated by the networks those companies build
and maintain, which are highly regulated by national governments and
even some international bodies.  These requirements come in the form of
phonebook-sized tomes, comprising 5,000 or more distinct specifications,
and many of these specs are themselves highly complex and multifaceted.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd54580.0xe45888"></a>
The Once and Future Open Phone</h2></div></div><p>
Governments, especially the US Government, jealously guard their
control of the electromagnetic spectrum.  The US Federal Communications
Commission (FCC) auctions and doles out grants of radio spectrum use and
has very particular ideas about bandwidth, signal strength, security and
as we've (re)learned in the last six years, about content on the
&ldquo;public&rdquo;
airways.  Other governments and regulatory bodies around the world
are similarly disposed toward open and free uses of radio frequencies.
Devices that do not conform to these (overlapping) regulations and do
not pass regulatory muster (homologation) do not earn approval and are
not licensed for sale.  Violations carry nasty fines and even criminal
penalties.
</p><p>
Mobile carriers and operators, in response to these regulatory regimens,
are understandably reluctant to experiment with open device architectures.
Ditto for their suppliers, at least on the &ldquo;thin&rdquo; end of the
wire (carrier-grade Linux and other implementations are today powering a growing share
of wireless infrastructure).  Carriers and operators are not completely
averse to openness, but tend to think only in terms of secure delivery of
value-added services.  By establishing careful sandbox environments
and limiting API sets on the technical end, and by even more careful
political negotiations, the chain of manufacturing, deployment and
regulation have begun to crack the lid on otherwise closed handsets.
As such, mobile phone users and market watchers have seen a handful of
&ldquo;can openers&rdquo; emerge during the last five years, principally Mid-P Java
and BREW, with mixed results, especially in performance.  More recently,
a slew of native applications has emerged for phones based on SymbianOS
and on Windows Mobile 5.0.
</p><p>
Linux-based phones offer up the promise of further prying open the
clamshell by leveraging the OS to provide a secure application programming
environment (in user space); it also comes with a well-established
community of skilled developers.  Whether Linux-based handsets will be
truly open platforms, remains an open question.  Phone deployed so far,
although based on a Linux kernel and many familiar OSS components (like
versions of Qt), are by no means open devices.  Hackers cannot (easily or
at all) rebuild the kernel, OS and application components, or even add
functionality to the stack.  These devices are not designed to accept
logins, let alone reflashing.  The &ldquo;can opener&rdquo; for these Linux-based
mobile devices, like those based on proprietary OSes, is Java, even if you
can download source code for the OS and portions of the application stack.
</p><p>
There do exist after-market resources to support hacking
Linux-based phones.  One such project is Harald Welte's Open-EZX (see
Resources).  This project, still in its early stages,
strives to build a 100% open phone stack for Motorola mobile phones like
the A780 and e680.  The project's wiki is
replete with warnings about rendering your phone unbootable and losing
regulatory approval, but also with useful information on how to get
a shell and how to cross compile for these devices (they're based on
Intel XScale Architecture PXA processors).
</p><p>
Motorola's chief phone architect definitively disavowed support for such
efforts.  Why? Principally, liability issues stemming from its customers'
concerns for the integrity and security of their mobile networks and
the complex burden of supporting millions of devices with potentially
divergent versions of the Open-EZX software stack.  Then why call it
Open-EZX? Because device OEMs like Motorola do want to encourage the
evolution of developer communities around their devices and platforms.
They just need to foster that evolution in a way that is amenable to
carrier, operator and regulatory sensibilities.  Today, that means
offering SDKs to hand-picked ISVs.
</p><p>
Hopefully soon, through educational efforts and persistence, this very
conservative and careful audience of network operators and government
regulators will be more comfortable with mobile phones as computing
platforms, not mere mono-function radio devices.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd54580.0xe45ca8"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
OSDL MLI</b></p><p>
To bolster the nascent adoption of Linux by mobile phone manufacturers,
OSDL is creating an initiative called MLI (Mobile Linux Initiative) to
bring together mobile chipset manufacturers, Linux-based platform
suppliers, ISVs, handset manufacturers, integrators, carriers and
operators, and open-source developers.  In Beijing during October 2005,
OSDL hosted the first meeting for this new initiative.
Although the ultimate requirements and development efforts will be driven by
the members of this new initiative, MLI has the general goal of
addressing a mix of technical and economic challenges, from the kernel
up, to accelerate Linux adoption on mobile phones and other converged
voice and data devices.</p><p>
When MLI met for the first time in October 2005, the new body appointed
interim governance and immediately got down to the job of requirements
gathering and gap analysis.  The first likely deliverables are use cases
and marketing output.  The most important deliverable, as with Carrier
Grade Linux, will be the instigation of the new open-source project work
to fill the gaps it identifies and to bring currently divergent
technologies (like those in this article) into the Linux mainstream.
