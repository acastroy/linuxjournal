I work in the Molecular Imaging group of Siemens Medical Solutions,
where my colleagues and I develop and maintain software used to run
Positron Emission Tomography (PET) medical scanners.  These machines
generate large amounts of patient data that our customers must archive
for later retrieval and review, so our software allows customers to
archive data to tape or Magneto-Optical (MO) disk.  Using tape is very
slow, so archiving to MO disk is generally preferred.  Unfortunately,
during the past few years, we've had a lot of problems with the MO hardware
sporadically corrupting the MO disks, leading to expensive and tedious
data recovery efforts and several replaced MO drives.
</p><p>
For many years, our customers have been asking for the ability to archive
their data to DVD.  DVD media is much cheaper than either tape or MO, and
it
can be read by any PC with a DVD drive.  This would be useful to many of
our customers, because there are free software tools they can use to
read our data files on a PC.  Because the MO drive vendor appeared unable
to resolve our hardware problems, we decided the time was right to
implement DVD archiving.
</p><p>
Unfortunately, we immediately hit a snag.  The control consoles for our
scanners are Sun UltraSPARC workstations running Solaris 2.6, Solaris 7
or Solaris 8.  Customer hardware ranges from an Ultra 2 to a Sun Blade
2500.  With so many different machines to support, we clearly needed an
external SCSI DVD burner.  But, we couldn't find a stable source for such
a device, and Solaris 2.6 and Solaris 7 have little or no support for
DVD burner hardware.
</p><p>
Because DVD burners are easy to get for x86 hardware and have been
well supported by Linux for years, we decided the best solution would be
to use a small Linux box with a high-quality DVD burner to do the work
of reading and writing the DVDs.  This would solve our hardware and OS-compatibility problems and make it easier to add support for new media
types in the future.  The Solaris workstations would communicate with the
DVD reader/writer machine over the network, so we named our creation the
NetDVD.

Finding a Vendor and Prototype Hardware</h2></div></div><p>
Because our business is building large medical scanners&mdash;not
computers&mdash;the first thing we needed was a company to put the devices
together for us and help select the hardware.  I did Web searches to find
appropriate companies and sent out several query letters.  Few of the
companies I contacted were interested in our project, and most required
a guaranteed minimum number of units to work with us.  We have about 700
scanners in the field, and it's likely we'll sell NetDVD devices to a
few hundred of those, but I didn't have the authority to make any kind
of commitment.
</p><p>
Thankfully, MBX Systems was very helpful.  Their representative, Ed
Jamison, quickly suggested some possible hardware solutions, including
one using a mini-ITX motherboard in the C134 case from Casetronic, shown
in Figure 1.  This case is actually a bit smaller than the external MO
drives we've been using, so it looked like the perfect choice.  We
eagerly ordered one with a 1GHz processor, 256MB of RAM, a 40GB hard drive
and a laptop-size DVD burner.

Selecting the Linux Distribution</h2></div></div><p>
Once we had the prototype, we had to decide what Linux distribution we
would put on it.  My fellow developer and Linux enthusiast, Dan
Duckworth, had just been reading about how great this new Ubuntu
distribution was, so we decided to give it a try.  We downloaded the
Ubuntu 4.10 Warty Warthog CD image, and it installed beautifully.
Ubuntu is based on Debian, which I've been using for several years, so I
found configuring it very easy to do.  It worked so well for us that we
never even tried another distribution.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13ee580.0x14e6978"></a>
The NetDVD TCP/IP Protocol</h2></div></div><p>
While we were picking out a vendor, hardware and a Linux distribution, I
was putting a lot of thought into how client machines would talk to the
NetDVD.  The client computer must be able to read a DVD, write to a DVD
and create a copy of a DVD to provide redundant archive backups.  To
manage this, I decided to combine a custom TCP/IP protocol with Network
File System (NFS).
</p><p>
To use a NetDVD, the client machine connects to it using our custom
NetDVD TCP/IP protocol.  If the device is already busy serving another
client, it will respond with a BUSY error message and drop the
connection.  This ensures that only one client can control the device at
a time.  If the device is not busy, it will send a brief message stating
the highest version of the NetDVD protocol it understands.  At the time of
this writing,
the only version of the NetDVD protocol is 0, but we may create new
versions of the protocol later to add new features.
</p><p>
If the client connects successfully, it immediately sends an
initialization command to the NetDVD.  This command tells the device both
the version of the NetDVD protocol the client will use to communicate
with it and what the client believes the current time to be in Universal
Coordinated Time.  The NetDVD sets its clock to match the client, so the
machines will be in agreement on filesystem timestamps.
</p><p>
Also during the initialization command, the NetDVD uses NFS to export an
empty directory on its hard drive with read/write permission strictly to
the client's IP address.  This is a working directory for the client to
fill with files it wants to write to DVD.  It is on a large disk
partition separate from the operating system, so filling it up will not
cause the device to misbehave.
</p><p>
To read a DVD in the NetDVD's drive, the client sends a mount command.
This causes the device to mount the media in its drive and export it via
NFS strictly to the client's IP address.  When the client is finished
reading, it can simply unmount it or unmount and eject it using an
appropriate command.
</p><p>
To write files to a DVD, the client first mounts the NetDVD's working
directory via NFS and fills it with the files and directories it wants
to write to the DVD.  Once finished, it sends a <tt  >burn working
directory</tt> command to the device and specifies whether this is supposed to be a new
DVD or data appended to a DVD written previously.  The ability to append
data was crucial to our use of the device to archive data incrementally.
</p><p>
To copy a DVD in the NetDVD device's drive, the client sends a special
copy command.  The device then copies the directory structure on the
media to a special directory on the same partition with the working
directory.  Once the copy is done, the client may send a <tt  >burn
copy</tt>
command to the device one or more times to write the copied directory
tree to as many DVDs as it likes.  This method will
<span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span>
make viewable copies of video DVDs, because the data on those disks must
be written in a very specific order that we don't preserve.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13ee580.0x14e6d98"></a>
User Control without a Keyboard or Monitor</h2></div></div><p>
Although we usually had a monitor and keyboard hooked up to the NetDVD
device during development, it is meant to appear to the customer as if
it were a network-based peripheral, like a network printer.  Because the
user cannot type <tt  >shutdown -h now</tt> to tell the NetDVD to shut down, it
must do a clean shutdown when the user presses the power button.
</p><p>
Conveniently, modern motherboards supply the Advanced Configuration and
Power Interface (ACPI).  When the user presses the power button, the
motherboard sends a signal to the processor.  Then the processor is
responsible for actually shutting the computer off.  Linux has good
support for this interface, so all we had to do was install the acpid
Ubuntu package.  This package comes already configured to do a clean
shutdown when the power button is pressed.
</p><p>
But, a clean shutdown takes several seconds to complete.  If the device
doesn't appear to respond immediately to the power button press, a user
is likely to press it repeatedly, maybe even hold it down for several
seconds.  This is both frustrating for the user and potentially harmful
to the device, because holding down the power button forces the machine
to power off immediately before the shutdown is complete.
</p><p>
So, we needed a way to tell the user, &ldquo;I got your message.  I'm turning
off now.  Give me a minute.&rdquo; As the NetDVD has no display, the natural
choice was to beep using its PC speaker.  For this we used the beep
program written by Johnathan Nightingale.  The beep package isn't part of
the base Ubuntu installation, but it's still available from Ubuntu's
Universe archives.  Using this program, I wrote some init scripts that
would make the machine start beeping once per second during boot up or
shutdown and finish with an upward or downward arpeggio of beeps,
respectively.  This had the added benefit of informing the user when the
device was ready for client connections.  Unfortunately, it wasn't quite
enough.
</p><p>
Several seconds still would pass between the user pressing the power
button and the first beep.  To make the NetDVD start beeping immediately,
I edited the shell script responsible for responding to the power button
press, /etc/acpi/powerbtn.sh, so it invokes my beep-start init script
immediately before running the shutdown command.  With this change, the
NetDVD starts beeping immediately in response to the power button press.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13ee580.0x14e70b0"></a>
Handling Network Configuration</h2></div></div><p>
Because the NetDVD device must communicate over a TCP/IP network, the user
must have some way to tell it what IP address, network mask and default
router to use.  This is a tricky problem, because you can't easily
communicate with a machine that doesn't have its network parameters set
properly.  Thankfully, all machines on the same subnet can receive UDP
broadcast packets even if they aren't configured properly for that
subnet.  So, I designed a simple protocol allowing a client machine
to locate and configure NetDVD devices on its subnet using UDP
broadcast.
</p><p>
To locate NetDVD devices on its subnet, the client program broadcasts a
packet asking all NetDVD devices to respond.  When a NetDVD device sees
this packet, it responds by broadcasting its Ethernet MAC address and
other network parameters to the UDP port specified in the request.  The
client program receives this information and displays it to the user.
Users will know which NetDVD device they want to configure, because
every NetDVD device has a label displaying its Ethernet MAC address.
</p><p>
To reconfigure a NetDVD device on its subnet, the client program
broadcasts a packet containing the target device's Ethernet MAC address
and the network parameters it should use.  The target NetDVD will
reconfigure its network parameters and broadcast a response back to the
client's UDP port.  All other NetDVD devices ignore the request.
</p><p>
In order to make this scheme work, I had to disable the spoofprotect
Linux kernel feature by changing <tt  >spoofprotect=yes</tt>
to <tt  >spoofprotect=no</tt>
in /etc/network/options on the NetDVD device.  The spoofprotect feature
causes the kernel to ignore packets that come from the local subnet but
appear to come from an invalid IP address for that subnet.  If we left
this feature enabled, a NetDVD with incorrect network parameters would
ignore the UDP packets intended to correct them.

Hardware and OS Problems</h2></div></div><p>
Once we got things working and started really exercising our prototype,
we began having problems with burn failures.  After discussing the
issue with Ed Jamison at MBX, we decided the problem was the
laptop-size DVD burner.  Due to their small size, these burners have more
reliability problems than the full-size drives.  He recommended switching
to a Plextor PX-716A 16x Double Layer DVD+RW/-RW drive.  Plextor has a
reputation for making extremely reliable DVD burners, and this drive is
also capable of faster burn speeds than the laptop drive we were using,
which our customers will appreciate.
</p><p>
Sadly, this meant we couldn't use the little Casetronic C134 case we
loved so much.  But, moving to a larger case meant we could move to
hardware that was less expensive and more stable overall.  As a result,
we got a faster processor, a faster and larger hard drive and a Gigabit
Ethernet interface.  Just as important, we reduced the problems we'll
have in the future due to obsoleted hardware, because desktop hardware
generally stays on the market much longer than laptop hardware.  Because we
still were trying to minimize the size of the device, Ed recommended the
Aria case from Antec shown in Figure 2.

</p></div></div><p>
By this time, we were using Ubuntu 5.04 Hoary Hedgehog, but when I
tried to install it on the new machine, it hung while detecting network
devices.  After a little research, we discovered that the SysKonnect
SK-98xx Gigabit Ethernet interface on the Intel D915GUXLK motherboard we
were using wasn't supported properly by the Linux 2.6.10 kernel provided
with Ubuntu 5.04.  Luckily, a kernel patch was available from the
manufacturer, so I downloaded the kernel source code, applied the patch
and rebuilt the kernel.
</p><p>
That fixed the problem with the Ethernet controller, but the kernel also
had trouble with the motherboard's ACPI.  This caused a lot of boot error
messages and prevented the machine from handling a power button press
correctly.  To fix this problem, I had to upgrade to Linux 2.6.12.2 and
apply the Gigabit Ethernet driver patch to that.  This was difficult to
get right, because Ubuntu didn't have a package for that version of the
kernel.  I had to do a lot of experimentation with kernel parameters
before I was sure I had all of the kernel features that Ubuntu relied
upon.
</p><p>
Once the kernel problems were settled and we had the machine functioning
as a NetDVD, we discovered another problem.  The DVD burns actually
were taking longer than they had with the original hardware, and the DVD
activity light showed that the drive was frequently idle during the
burn.  The Ubuntu installation had not enabled Direct Memory Access (DMA)
for the drive, so the drive wasn't getting data fast enough.  Once we
corrected this, the burns came up to the speed we had expected.  It's
really a tribute to the quality of the Plextor DVD drive that it
successfully burned several DVDs even when it was starved for data.
</p><p>
When Ubuntu 5.10 Breezy Badger came out, I was pleased to find it
corrected all of the problems that required a custom kernel build, but
it introduced another problem I had no idea how to correct.  In Ubuntu
5.10, exportfs fails sporadically, though it always exits with a 0
status.  This isn't much of a problem for static exports, but as all of
our exports are dynamic, it's a serious problem for us.  So, we had to go
back to Ubuntu 5.04.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
In our testing, we've seen only one failure in hundreds of burns since
moving to the new hardware, so we're confident that the NetDVD will be
the stable archiving solution we need.  As I write this, we are on the
brink of installing NetDVD devices at two very enthusiastic beta sites.
They've seen how it works already, and based on their reactions, I
think we'll have a lot of NetDVD orders once it's officially released.
</p><p>
It has taken us about 15 months to reach this point, but most of that
time was spent working on software that goes on our Solaris workstations
and other things not related to the NetDVD.  I'm extremely grateful to
Ariel King and Dan Duckworth for their excellent work developing the new
DVD archiving software for our workstations.  That software was actually
much harder to get right.  I don't think we spent more than three
developer-months working on the NetDVD device itself.  Using Linux and
other open-source software made that the easy part.
