Separating the truth from fairy tales about pony tails.

I like seaside bars and restaurants, particularly those that are right on the
beach.  You are walking along the sand, right at the waterline, and when you
crave a refreshing drink, you simply walk up, sit down and order one.  You are
probably barefoot and bare chested (assuming you are a man, but in some places
women too), and you enjoy the warmth of the sun on your face and body while you
eat your meal and drink your beverage.  &ldquo;No shoes, no shirt, no
problem!&rdquo;
</p><p>
There are a lot of restaurants in the United States, even those right
on the beach with signs saying, &ldquo;No shoes, no shirt, no
service!&rdquo;
Whether this be an issue of health code, puritanical residuals or the
fact that some people do not like to look at hairy bodies while they
eat, I am not sure, but these signs show up in the most unlikely places,
not just where you might expect them.
</p><p>
I always have believed that if people do their jobs right, show
enthusiasm, are respectful of other people and are relatively clean and
free of body odor, that how they dress or wear their hair should be their
own choice.  Particularly their hair, because it is hard to cut and grow
your hair due to a nine-to-five job schedule.  A person could put on a
suit or a tie if the occasion called for it, and I have done that from
time to time.  I even have a picture of me wearing a tuxedo aboard the
first Linux Lunacy cruise.  I think I looked rather dashing, but I still
prefer to wear shorts and a T-shirt.
</p><p>
In June 2000, <i  >Linux Journal</i> had a rather ugly guy on the front
cover, dressed in a suit, with a mirror in the background which showed
his barefoot refection wearing shorts and T-shirt.  The reflection
was pointing at him with a combination of horror and dismay, but the
message was that Linux was moving into the world of big business, and the
&ldquo;barefoot days&rdquo; had to make a little room for the suits.
</p><p>
Still, it amazed me recently when an IT manager who is an advocate of Free
Software was in New Zealand for the Australian Linux User's Group meeting
and made the statement that part of the trouble with Free Software was
that people went around talking about it with &ldquo;sandals and
pony-tails&rdquo;.
</p><p>
Of course, the press had a field day with this.  I was still getting
questions about it four months later at LinuxWorld Toronto, when a
reporter for <span   class="emphasis"><em>Report On Business</em></span>, a cable TV show, brought it up in an
interview.  Fortunately, I had time both to talk to the manager who had
made the comment and to formulate an answer, so I was ready.
</p><p>
The manager, of course, has nothing against either sandals or pony-tails,
but his off-hand remark was generated to show the lack of real business
knowledge that goes with a lot of (not all) Free Software advocates
and businesses.  Many advocates of Free Software are programmers
themselves (or system administrators or people who have been
in the computer industry for a long time), so the concept of going in and changing the
software, tracking the changes, integrating the changes back into the
original source code pool is not mysterious.  What does seem to be
mysterious is a lack of understanding about how large corporations
(or even small businesses) really work.
</p><p>
Likewise, the bulk of the business people making decisions today have
never written a line of code, or if they did, it was back in their
college days
when they almost failed that &ldquo;stupid programming course&rdquo;.
In fact, most business people would love not to have to worry about
computers at all.  This desire is what leads to the e-business
advertisements by IBM and to &ldquo;Business on Demand&rdquo;.
</p><p>
Business people <span   class="emphasis"><em>do</em></span> understand, however, that their business cannot
survive in the relatively short run if they do not have any computer
resources.  Some businesses could not provide service with outages measured
in seconds&mdash;catch-22.
</p><p>
So, when the sandal wearers come up and say, &ldquo;Free Software&rdquo;, the business
people say, &ldquo;24-hour, seven-day-a-week-support&rdquo;.  The sandal wearers
kind of shuffle their feet and go, &ldquo;Well, maybe eight-hour,
five-day-a-week.&rdquo;
The answer is not good enough.
</p><p>
The business people say, &ldquo;I need these applications&rdquo;, and the sandal
wearers tell them (with a wave of the hand but no concrete examples) that
they can &ldquo;do it all with thin clients and a Web site&rdquo;.  Not good enough.
</p><p>
The business people say, &ldquo;I need support in Hong Kong, Brazil, New York and
Moscow&rdquo;, and the sandal wearers offer them support in Silicon Valley.
Not good enough.
</p><p>
The business people say, &ldquo;I need some type of road map to show me where
Linux is going, so I can plan better.&rdquo; The sandal wearers tell them
to read the mailing lists.  Not good enough.
</p><p>
The business people say, &ldquo;I need binary compatability between the
distributions so I can protect my investment in software.&rdquo; The sandal
wearers tell them to do &ldquo;everything in source&rdquo;.  Not good enough.
</p><p>
The sandal wearers complain that the large companies do not support
Linux up and down their product lines, not
understanding the economics of how much it costs these companies to
qualify the (several) distributions of Linux for which customers might ask.
</p><p>
The sandal wearers have great ideas for doing business with Free
Software, but no written business or marketing plan showing how the
idea might be successful, and although it is true that a business and
marketing plan does not guarantee success, it at least shows that you gave
thought to it.
</p><p>
These examples of lack of knowledge and understanding are what gets the
Free Software community the image of being sandal wearers.
</p><p>
So far, I have wailed on about the sandal wearers, but the suits
also have their foibles.  There are many examples of the suits not
understanding the sandal wearers, or even trying to &ldquo;let their hair
down&rdquo;.  Although I will cover most of these in a later column, I think the
most famous of these types of considerations was the casual Friday,
where people were encouraged to come to work in more casual clothes.
It was reported that one large company had to hire psychologists to help
its middle management employees through their personal crisis of not wearing
a suit.
</p><p>
I often ask myself if the fun is disappearing in Free Software.
I remember in the early days of Linux how we had fun at events like the
Linux Expo and the Atlanta Linux Showcase.  Paintball contests, hot
sauce judging contests, a contest for designing a new desktop for Linux
and other fun things in which the community could participate.  It seems
to me that even with a larger number of people now involved with Free
Software that the number of people actively having fun appears to be
decreasing, or at least not increasing in the same proportions as users.
</p><p>
If there is one thing that Linus has taught me in my association with him,
it is to strive always to have fun.  There are, of course, days when you
have more fun, and days that are not as much fun, but over all, it
should be fun.  Maybe if you are not having fun, you are really in
the wrong business.
</p><p>
[Speaking of fun, the 15th anniversary of the first Linux release of
code is coming up in September 2006&mdash;we should all plan for some fun
to help celebrate it.]
</p><p>
So, although I will keep my suit pressed for those more formal presentations
and cruise-ship parties, maybe I will keep my beard and long hair to
remind me to have fun.  On the other hand, maybe I will not totally put
away my sandals, but I will polish my wing-tips while continuing to learn
what businesses need to function and help the Free Software community
supply those things to the business community.  I will try even harder
to walk that line between sandals and pony-tails and suits.
</p><p>
In the meantime, you will find me at the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Alideia dos
Piratas</em></span>, digging my
toes in the sand and having a drink with the warm sun shining on my back.
