Silo-free identity systems begin to emerge and converge.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18d1580.0x19c92f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Last September's cover story examined the Identity Metasystem, proposed
by Kim Cameron and his team at Microsoft, in support of personal
identities that are independent of any vendor's silo.  Microsoft's
inaugural member of the Identity Metasystem is an identity selector
called InfoCard and is due for inclusion in Vista when that operating
system arrives in 2007.  (It will be back-implemented for XP as well.)
</p><p>
Since then, the Identity Gang has grown in number, and it has held a
series of meetings and workshops where progress has been dramatic and
encouraging.  In a meeting at Harvard in December 2005, Paul Trevithick of
Social Physics introduced Higgins, a framework for building user-centric
identity-enabled services.  At the Internet Identity Workshop in
January 2006 in Berkeley, creators of OpenID, LID and XRI/XDI joined various
pieces to create Yadis: a new and simple combined lightweight identity
system.  At the Mountain View IIW in May 2006, a large conference room was
packed with participants from Red Hat, Higgins, Identity Commons,
XRI/XDI, the IETF, LID, Novell/SUSE, VeriSign, Tucows, OpenID and other
interested parties, to engage Kim Cameron and Mike Jones of
Microsoft&mdash;and to talk about open-source implementations of InfoCard.
</p><p>
That conversation has since been formalized in a series of phone calls
and a mailing list called OSIS (Open Source Identity Selector).  A
report on the first of the weekly OSIS conference calls began with this:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
We reaffirmed that the initial goal of the project is to build
InfoCard selector implementations for non-Windows platforms that are
compatible with the Microsoft implementation, with targets possibly
including GNOME, KDE, Mac and mobile devices.
</p><p>
We agreed that the goal is to move quickly, enabling deployment of
interoperable implementations by the time that Windows Vista ships.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Since then, progress has been so rapid and varied (within and between
different participants) that it's hard to follow exactly what's going
on.  When I asked Paul Trevithick to summarize it for <i  >Linux Journal</i>
readers, he wrote back:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
The situation is extremely fluid.  The Red Hats, Novells, independents and
others are all bouncing around trying to understand what's really going on.
</p><p>
There are now at least three efforts afoot that as either a total or
a partial goal include creating an open-source capability to
interoperate fully with Microsoft's InfoCard system and especially the
specific ways that it uses WS-Trust and related protocols:
</p><p>
1) OSIS: effort appears to be defined as a clone of Microsoft's
InfoCard software but for Mac and Linux.
</p><p>
2) Higgins: one of the highest priorities is to provide full
interoperability with Microsoft's InfoCard and thereby
to provide equivalent functionality on non-Windows platforms.
(Higgins also has goals that are beyond authentication and
security, and it will support other protocols.)
</p><p>
3) The UNC Lab of Information Integration, Security and Privacy
Project (<a href="http://www.sis.uncc.edu/LIISP" target="_self">www.sis.uncc.edu/LIISP</a>) under Dr Gail-Joon
Ahn, which was presented at IIW2006.
</p><p>
...and there may be others.  Kim has stated that Microsoft will
provide technical support to any and all groups to enable them to
achieve interoperability.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Two additional points.  First, Dr Ahn's implementation is ready in
advance of Microsoft's own.  (To an enthusiastic reception by Microsoft
folks at the May 2006 IIW, where the system was demonstrated.) Second, I know
of at least one commercial InfoCard-compatible implementation, which
should be ready by the time this issue is published.
</p><p>
Phil Windley, author of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Digital Identity</em></span> (O'Reilly, 2005) and an
organizer of the Internet Identity Workshops, said:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
For us to have a
metasystem, we need identity selectors for Linux desktops, Macs and
other platforms.  It's impressive that the identity community accepts Kim
Cameron's vision&mdash;that there needs to be interoperability.  It's Kim's
political acumen that enables this.  He just put out the Laws and said,
&ldquo;Here's a system that obeys these, and it's open.&rdquo; It's important that
InfoCard isn't Microsoft Kool-Aid.  If Microsoft stopped, all this other
stuff could keep working.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
I've been impressed, all through this process, at how committed all
these different development projects are to staying open toward each
other, in the general directions where they might converge.  For example,
InfoCard and Yadis are solutions to different problems, yet there are
design decisions both communities can make today that will be
interoperable at some point in the future when their uses overlap.
</p><p>
As we know too well, being open source doesn't prevent market-halting
incompatibilities and failures to interoperate.  Why, other than
adherence to principles of niceness, are all these projects working to
keep things from breaking as they grow in converging directions?
</p><p>
Phil Windley says there may be a couple of subtle reasons.  First,
&ldquo;Sometime early last year, the competing participants got to the point
where they said, 'We don't have to be enemies.  We can work
together.'&rdquo;
Second:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Some of the developers realized that relying parties&mdash;say,
any Web site that has to rely on an identity credential from an identity
provider&mdash;don't have to support different systems.  It's the identity
provider&mdash;the Amazons and Googles and eBays of the world&mdash;that will
have to play in all those systems, if they want to be in the game.  They
have the incentive, as well as the ability, to interoperate.  If you're
Amazon, and want your customers' identities to be useful across a lot of
Web sites, you have an incentive to interoperate.  Now look at it the
other way around.  If the relying parties needed this, and not the
identity providers, interop would always be &ldquo;someday&rdquo;.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Instead, I think we're likely to see user-centric
&ldquo;independent&rdquo; identity
in widespread use sometime in the next two years.
