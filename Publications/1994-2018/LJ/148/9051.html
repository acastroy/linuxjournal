Want to bet you can find a problem in our final Blackjack script?
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1190580.0x12883f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
This is the last column in our <span   class="emphasis"><em>Blackjack</em></span> series, and
in this column, I
show the final snippets of code needed to weave all of the disparate
pieces of the game script into a playable game.  For obvious reasons,
I can't present the entire script here in the magazine (it's almost 300
lines long), so instead I highly encourage you to pop over to the
<i  >Linux Journal</i> FTP site and grab a copy of the script
as you read along (<a href="../listings/148/9051.tgz" target="_self">ftp.linuxjournal.com/pub/lj/listings/issue148/9051.tgz</a>).
</p><p>
As with many betting games, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Blackjack</em></span> has evolved to
have many esoteric
rules with splitting pairs, insurance and various other things that take
something relatively simple and make it more complex.  We'll ignore all
of that, however, and also ignore the betting component of the game too
(this is a [geek] family magazine, after all) and just focus on
the game play.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1190580.0x12886b8"></a>
Dealer Gets One Card Up</h2></div></div><p>
Therefore, the first thing we need to know is that the player can see
both cards as dealt and one of the two cards that the dealer
deals for itself.  That's the first piece of code we need to
add, and because we aren't allowing insurance or betting, it needs to be
included immediately after the tests for blackjack in the code:

<pre     class="programlisting">
echo -n "** Dealer's hand: "
showCard ${dealer[1]} ; echo -n "$cardname, "
echo "(card face down)"
echo ""
</pre>
</p><p>
From a strategic perspective, if you have even a rudimentary grasp of
probability, you'll know that cards with a value of ten are far more
likely than any other card value in the deck.  If the dealer has an eight
or nine showing, for example, odds are very good that it has 18
or 19 as a hand value.  That'll, therefore, change your own playing
strategy too, perhaps making it more likely that you'd take another
card if you have an interim hand value of 17; whereas, if the dealer had
a five showing, for example, you might be more likely to stick with a
hand value of 16.
</p><p>
In previous columns, you've already seen the basic script to display and
calculate a hand's value, so this is nothing new:

<pre     class="programlisting">
echo -n "** Dealer's hand: "
showCard ${dealer[1]} ; echo -n "$cardname, "
showCard ${dealer[2]} ; echo "$cardname"

handValue ${dealer[1]} ${dealer[2]}
</pre>
</p><p>
But, now we're going to add a loop below this that will keep taking
cards until the hand value is 17 or higher (that's standard Las Vegas
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Blackjack</em></span> rules: 16 and lower the dealer
&ldquo;hits&rdquo; or takes another card,
and 17 or higher the dealer &ldquo;stands&rdquo; or sticks with its hand).
</p><p>
This is a bit tricky, so take your time reading it:

<pre     class="programlisting">
while [ $handvalue -lt 17 ]
do
  dealer[$nextdealercard]=${newdeck[$nextcard]}

  showCard ${dealer[$nextdealercard]}

  nextcard=$(( $nextcard + 1 ))
  nextdealercard=$(( $nextdealercard + 1 ))

  echo """ ; echo "** Dealer takes: $cardname"

  handValue ${dealer[1]} ${dealer[2]} ${dealer[3]} \
            ${dealer[4]} ${dealer[5]}
done
</pre>
</p><p>
With some good routines and variables already in place, it turns out to
be surprisingly succinct to have the dealer play its hand out.  Hurray
for that bit of good design!
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1190580.0x1288b88"></a>
Who Won the Game?</h2></div></div><p>
Now that we have the game-play logic, it's simply a matter of having the
set of conditionals to figure out who won or whether the game ended with
a tie:

<pre     class="programlisting">
if [ $handvalue -gt 21 ]
then
	echo "**** Dealer busted!  Player wins with \
	$playerhandvalue!"
  playerwin=$(( $playerwin + 1 ))
elif [ $handvalue -eq $playerhandvalue ]
then
	echo "**** Dealer and player tie with \
	$handvalue points."
elif [ $handvalue -lt $playerhandvalue ]
then
	echo "**** Player wins with $playerhandvalue"
  playerwin=$(( $playerwin + 1 ))
else
	echo "**** Dealer wins with $handvalue"
  dealerwin=$(( $dealerwin + 1 ))
fi
</pre>
</p><p>
Whaddya think? Enough code listings?
</p><p>
Let's see how the game plays now:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sh blackjack.sh

**** Welcome to Blackjack.sh! ****

Dealer's hand: Queen of Hearts, (card face down)

You've been dealt: 2 of Spades, 7 of Hearts

H)it or S)tand? (recommended: hit) hit

You've been dealt: 10 of Diamonds

H)it or S)tand? (recommended: stand) stand

You stand with a hand value of 19

Dealer's hand: Queen of Hearts, 4 of Hearts

Dealer takes: Queen of Clubs

**** Dealer busted!  Player wins with 19!
</pre>
</p><p>
You can see that we had 2S and 7H (9 points), took a card, 10D, giving us 19 points.  We stayed with that,
and the dealer revealed that it had QH 4H, 14 points, and took another
card which proved to be QC, which took the dealer over 21 points.  We won!
</p><p>
There are a few more nuances to the program, including keeping track
of how many times the dealer or player wins, and at the point where
you're asked &ldquo;hit or stand&rdquo;, you now can type in
<tt  >quit</tt> (or q) to quit.
Then, it'll show you:

<pre     class="programlisting">
H)it or S)tand? (recommended: stand) q

Player quits.  Standings: dealer wins: 5 and player wins: 3
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1190580.0x1288fa8"></a>
There's Still a Bug</h2></div></div><p>
There's also one outstanding bug in the code, and I invite you to dig
around and figure it out.  If the dealer is dealt an Ace in play, it's
automatically counted as 11 points, not one or 11, as it should be.  Your
challenge: figure out where that problem arises and how to fix it.  If
you think you know, e-mail me your proposed solution (perhaps a diff
of your version versus the version on the <i  >Linux Journal</i> FTP site), and
we'll see how you did.
</p><p>
Next month, we'll crack open a completely different shell script task
and see what we can do to help your day-to-day Linux administrative
tasks, because we've probably wasted plenty enough ink on a casino game
for this year! See ya then.
