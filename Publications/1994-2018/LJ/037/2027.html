    When you need some help getting your web pages back in order,
    have the computer do it for you.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe4c580.0xf44348"></a></h2></div></div><p>There is something magical about writing
a web-based document that just doesn't exist with a regular linear
document. Something about getting all those links just right and in
the right sequence makes a web document come alive. Of course,
getting the links just right can be a big job, especially in a
document with many pages. I found that out when I tackled my first
multi-page document.
</p><p>I had been writing HTML for several months when an
opportunity came to make a presentation at our local Internet
Special Interest Group (part of a larger PC users group). At that
time, only a few of us were &ldquo;on the Net&rdquo;, but many people were
interested in what the Internet&mdash;and more specifically&mdash;what the
Web could do for them. I volunteered to give a talk on the basics
of HTML and putting together your own web page.</p><p>The group met in the library of a local university, and we
had a live Internet connection tied into an overhead projector in
the room. I decided it would be neat to write a presentation about
HTML in HTML. Each web page would be a single slide in the
presentation. Links between pages would allow me to move forward
(and backward) as the talk progressed.</p><p>So I put together about 15 pages of slides and linked them so
each page had a <span   class="emphasis"><em>next</em></span> link to the next page and
a <span   class="emphasis"><em>prev</em></span> link to the previous page. I put these
links at the top and bottom of each page, so there were four links
on every page (actually, I had links to the table of contents too,
but let's ignore those for the moment). Figure 1 shows how
consecutive pages are linked.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="2027f1.large.jpg"><img src="2027f1.jpg"></a></div><p>The talk went well, but I saw several places where I could
improve the talk. When I started adding pages to the document, I
made a very important discovery: inserting pages was a big pain. If
I wanted to insert a new page between existing pages A and B. I had
to update the NEXT links in page A, update the PREV links in page
B, and update both the NEXT and PREV links in the new page. And
because I had links at the top and bottom of the pages, there were
twice as many links to update. Figure 2 shows the revised
links.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2027f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Automation to the Rescue
</p></div></div><p>After struggling with manual updates to the pages, I decided
there had to be a better way. The <b  >relink</b> Perl
script was a result of that frustration.</p><p>Using <b  >relink</b> is simple. First you need a
file (called <b  >links</b>) containing a list of pages
in the order they are to be visited. Omit the &ldquo;.html&rdquo; portion of
the page name in the <b  >links</b> file,
<b  >relink</b> assumes the files end with that
extension.</p><p>For example, consider the following (very abbreviated)
version of my original HTML presentation. I start with an
introduction (<b  >intro.html</b>), have a page about
anchors (<b  >anchor.html</b>) and finish with a
conclusion (<b  >conclude.html</b>). The
<b  >links</b> file would contain:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
   # Pages for a simple presentation
   intro
   anchor
   conclude
</pre><p>Each HTML page contains a set of links to its next and
previous page. For example, the <b  >anchor.html</b> file
contains the following links at the top and bottom of the page.
<pre     class="programlisting">
   &lt;a href="conclude.html"&gt;
      &lt;img src="icons/next.gif" alt="NEXT"&gt;
   &lt;/a&gt;
   &lt;a href="intro.html"&gt;
      &lt;img src="icons/prev.gif" alt="PREV"&gt;
   &lt;/a&gt;
</pre>


After reviewing my short document, I feel that I really should
mention URLs and how they work before delving into anchors. So I
write a new page called <b  >url.html</b> and wish to add
it to my document. I simply edit the <b  >links</b> file
to contain:
<pre     class="programlisting">
   # Pages for an updated, but still
   # simple presentation
   intro
   url
   anchor
   conclude
</pre>


After running <b  >relink</b> with the new page order,
the links in the anchor page will now look like:
<pre     class="programlisting">
   &lt;a href="conclude.html"&gt;
      &lt;img src="icons/next.gif" alt="NEXT"&gt;
   &lt;/a&gt;
   &lt;a href="url.html"&gt;
      &lt;img src="icons/prev.gif" alt="PREV"&gt;
   &lt;/a&gt;
</pre>


Notice the previous link now points to the page about URLs, rather
than the introduction. The links in the other pages are updated in
a consistent manner to support the new page order. Pages can be
added, deleted, or simply rearranged just by editing the
<b  >links</b> file and specifying the new order.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe4c580.0xf450b0"></a>Identifying Links</h2></div></div><p>How does <b  >relink</b> find the HTML links in a
web page? It does so by looking for particular patterns on lines
containing a hypertext link. <b  >relink</b> will scan
through an HTML file looking for the pattern
<b  >/href\s*=/i</b> which matches the letters
<b  >href</b> followed by zero or more spaces followed by
an equal sign. The <b  >i</b> at the end of the pattern
allows matching without regard to upper and lower case. Lines
matching this pattern contain a hypertext link and are possible
candidates for updating.</p><p>Once a line containing a link is found, a list of
link-specific patterns is tested against that line. If a match is
found, that hypertext link is updated with information obtained
from the <b  >links</b> file, and the scanning process
continues on the rest of the file. For this process to work, it is
important that each hypertext link fit alone on a single line of
text. Also, link-specific patterns must be chosen that do not occur
normally in the body of the document. If a link-specific pattern
should accidently appear on the same line as an unrelated link in
the document body, <b  >relink</b> will automatically
(and incorrectly) update that unrelated link.</p><p>I use small GIF files for the next and previous icons, so the
link-specific patterns <b  >next.gif</b> and
<b  >prev.gif</b> are good choices for my pages (and
since I wrote <b  >relink</b>, these are the defaults).
You can override these defaults in the <b  >links</b>, if
your links look significantly different. If there are no unique
patterns identifying your links, you can add an HTML comment to the
link line and use that as a pattern.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe4c580.0xf45630"></a>The LINKS File</h2></div></div><p>We have seen a few simple examples of a
<b  >links</b> file in the discussion above. In addition
to page order, you can also specify user-defined link patterns
using the following line:</p><p><b  >link:</b> <span   class="emphasis"><em>linkname</em></span>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>pattern</em></span></p><p>The <span   class="emphasis"><em>linkname</em></span> identifies the type of link
(next, prev, index, or anything you can think of). The
<span   class="emphasis"><em>pattern</em></span> is a string of characters that must
appear on every link of that type. You may override the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>next</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>prev</em></span>,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>toc</em></span> (table of contents) and
<span   class="emphasis"><em>up</em></span> links that <b  >relink</b>
normally works with, and you may define your own links here.</p><p>A table of contents file may be identified using the
line:</p><p><b  >tocfile:</b>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>tocname</em></span></p><p>Links identified with the <span   class="emphasis"><em>toc</em></span> link
pattern will generate a link to this file. Unfortunately,
<b  >relink</b> will not update the table of contents
with new page orders, so you have to edit the table of contents
manually to keep it up to date. Perhaps a future version of
<b  >relink</b> can address this problem.</p><p>Nested pages can be specified by using a <b  >{</b>
on a line by itself to start a nested list and a
<b  >}</b> to end a nested list. The page immediately
preceding the nested list is called the parent page. The first and
last page of a nested list point to the parent page in there
<span   class="emphasis"><em>prev</em></span> and <span   class="emphasis"><em>next</em></span> links. In
addition, each nested page will have an <span   class="emphasis"><em>up</em></span>
link to the parent page. The <span   class="emphasis"><em>next</em></span> link of the
parent page will skip over the nested list to the following page.
(We assume that the parent page has explicit links into the nested
list.)</p><p>And finally, separate lists of HTML files can be specified by
using a line of dashes.
<span   class="emphasis"><em>next</em></span>/<span   class="emphasis"><em>prev</em></span> links will not
cross a line of dashes.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe4c580.0xf3ca70"></a>Summing Up</h2></div></div><p>I have found <b  >relink</b> to be a very useful
script in dealing with web documentation, making it very easy to
update pages in long documents without worrying about the details
of manually adjusting the page links.</p></div></div>
