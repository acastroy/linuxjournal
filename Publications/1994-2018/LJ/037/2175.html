    CGI.pm, for all of its
    useful and amazing features, is just one of the many terrific Perl 5
    modules that isn't included with the standard Perl distribution.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2835580.0x292d500"></a></h2></div></div><p>I have reached the point in my career as
a columnist when there is too much mail to ignore. I'm not drowning
in torrents of e-mail, mind you, but it's still a nice surprise to
receive responses from readers. Some of the mail that I have
received over the last month or two, though, warrants extended
response. In addition to answering some brief questions about
CGI.pm and the guestbook program that appeared in the January
issue, I will discuss security issues relevant to CGI programmers
and Web administrators.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2835580.0x292d608"></a>Where Is CGI.pm?</h2></div></div><p>One of the first questions that I received&mdash;from several
readers of my column in the January issue&mdash;is, &ldquo;Where is CGI.pm?&rdquo;
These readers were surprised that the programs included with my
column and which were supposed to work, were failing on them. In
particular, they were getting messages like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
   Can't locate CGI.pm in @INC at - line 1.
   BEGIN failed&mdash;compilation aborted at - line 1.
</pre><p>What was going wrong here? Why wasn't CGI.pm on their
systems?
</p><p>The simple answer to this question is that CGI.pm, for all of
its useful and amazing features, is just one of the many terrific
Perl 5 modules that isn't included with the standard Perl
distribution. Perl comes with a number of basic modules, but these
are only the tip of the iceberg. Most of the modules you might want
to use are available from CPAN, the Comprehensive Perl Archive
Network&mdash;such as those for database server access (obviating the
need for separate Perl executables, such as oraperl and sybperl),
manipulation of times and dates, handling of e-mail folders, and
many more.</p><p>CPAN is a set of FTP sites that mirror each other at regular
intervals, and which allow programmers to download the most recent
versions of various modules programmers have generously donated to
the Perl community. One of these modules, and one which I tend to
use often in my professional life and in my <i  >LJ</i>
column, is CGI.pm&mdash;which, as you might have guessed, is a module
that makes it relatively easy for us to write CGI programs.</p><p>The easiest way to get to CPAN is via the reflector at
perl.com, a site run and maintained by Tom Christiansen, one of the
luminaries of the Perl community. If you go to
http://www.perl.com/CPAN, making sure you leave off the final
slash, you will be able to select a site near you from which you
can download various Perl modules. Alternatively, you can include
the final slash, as well as the rest of the path name relative to
CPAN, and enter a random site from the full CPAN network, as
follows:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
   http://www.perl.com/CPAN/modules/by-module/
</pre><p>This URL will result in a listing of the various module
categories available for downloading. Each category contains one or
more modules; for CGI.pm, we need to enter the CGI category, where
we can find (as of this writing) the file CGI.pm-2.30.tar.gz.
</p><p>After downloading this file, use the gunzip program to
uncompress the file, and then the tar program to expand it. Do this
with these commands:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
   gunzip --verbose CGI.pm-2.30.tar.gz
   tar -xvvf CGI.pm-2.30.tar.gz
</pre><p>The doubled <b  >v</b> option specifies additional
&ldquo;verbosity&rdquo; when expanding files; while you can certainly untar
CGI.pm without using any verbosity, I prefer to see what I'm
expanding, rather than simply let the command go about its
business.
</p><p>If you are using a system with GNU tar (as is the case with
virtually all Linux systems), you can combine these two operations
by using the <b  >z</b> option with tar:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
   tar -zxvvf CGI.pm-2.30.tar.gz
</pre><p>After unpacking CGI.pm in this way, you should be able to
enter the newly-created directory (named
<b  >CGI.pm-2.30</b> in the above example), configure,
and compile the file with the standard Perl module installation
commands. Here is what that process looked like on my system:
<pre     class="programlisting">
   [1008] /downloads% cd CGI.pm-2.30
   [1009] /downloads/CGI.pm-2.30% perl Makefile.PL
   Checking if your kit is complete...
   Looks good
   Writing Makefile for CGI
   [1010] /downloads/CGI.pm-2.30% make
   cp CGI/Carp.pm ./blib/lib/CGI/Carp.pm
   cp CGI/Fast.pm ./blib/lib/CGI/Fast.pm
   cp CGI/Push.pm ./blib/lib/CGI/Push.pm
   cp CGI.pm ./blib/lib/CGI.pm
   Magnifying ./blib/man3/CGI::Fast.3
   Magnifying ./blib/man3/CGI::Carp.3
   Magnifying ./blib/man3/CGI::Push.3
   Magnifying ./blib/man3/CGI.3
</pre>


Now that you have configured and compiled CGI.pm, install it into
your system with the command <b  >make install</b>. In
order to do this, you will need to be logged in as the root user,
as shown here:
<pre     class="programlisting">
   [1001] /downloads/CGI.pm-2.30# make install
   Skipping /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/./CGI/Carp.pm (unchanged)
   Skipping /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/./CGI/Fast.pm (unchanged)
   Skipping /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/./CGI/Push.pm (unchanged)
   Installing /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/./CGI.pm
   Skipping /usr/lib/perl5/man/man3/./CGI::Fast.3 (unchanged)
   Skipping /usr/lib/perl5/man/man3/./CGI::Carp.3 (unchanged)
   Skipping /usr/lib/perl5/man/man3/./CGI::Push.3 (unchanged)

   Writing /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/i586-linux/auto/CGI/.packlist
   Appending installation info to /usr/lib/perl5/i386-linux/5.003/perllocal.pod
</pre>


That's it. Now, <b  >@INC</b> (the Perl variable that
knows where to look for Perl modules) will include CGI.pm, and you
will no longer get those nasty error messages complaining that Perl
cannot find the file.
</p><p>Note that Red Hat Linux users might want to use the RPM (Red
Hat Package Manager) version of CGI.pm (and other Perl modules)
rather than the standard distribution. The advantage of doing this
is that installation updates the RPM database and keeps track of
the files on your system in an elegant way. The disadvantage is
that it often takes a few days or weeks for the latest and greatest
version of CGI.pm to appear on the Red Hat servers&mdash;and other, less
popular modules are sometimes completely unavailable as RPMs. You
can find various RPMs at the Red Hat site (and its mirrors), at
ftp.redhat.com.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2835580.0x292dea0"></a>Guestbook Problems</h2></div></div><p>I also received several notes from readers alerting us to two
mistakes in the guestbook program in the January issue. Guestbooks,
as we all know, generally contain more than one greeting from a
user on a site. Thus, if we open the file using the Perl
command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
   open (FILE, "&gt;$filename") || &amp;error_opening_file($filename);
</pre><p>we are asking for trouble, since the single
<b  >&gt;</b> operator not only opens the file for
writing, but destroys any information the file might have contained
previously. The code should really have read:
<pre     class="programlisting">
   open (FILE, "&gt;&gt;$filename") || &amp;error_opening_file($filename);
</pre>


which means that we want to open the file named in
<b  >$filename</b> for writing, appending our new data to
whatever might have been there before. Note that the
<b  >&gt;&gt;</b> operator creates a file if none existed
before, so you should feel free to use <b  >&gt;&gt;</b>
for file creation and appending.
</p><p>The other problem in that program, which was noticed by
reader Bill Holloway, had to do with this section of code:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
   @names = $query-&gt;param;
   # Iterate through each element from the form,
   # writing each element to $filename. Separate
   # elements with $separation_character defined
   # above.
   foreach $index (0 .. $#fields)
   {
      # Get the input from the appropriate HTML
      # form element
      $input = $query-&gt;param($fields[$index]);
      # Remove any instances of
      # $separation_character
      $input =~ s/$separation_character//g;
      # Now add the input to the file
      print FILE $input;
      # Don't print the separation character after
      # the final element
      print FILE $separation_character
         if ($index
   }
</pre><p>Of course, since we have imported the HTML form elements into
the <b  >@names</b> array, we have to read them out of
<b  >@names</b>, and not out of
<b  >@fields</b>, which is what the above code does. Thus
the line:
<pre     class="programlisting">
   $input = $query-&gt;param($fields[$index]);
</pre>


should be replaced with:
<pre     class="programlisting">
   $input = $query-&gt;param($names[$index]);
</pre>


as you can see in the corrected version of the program, which
appears in <a href="2175l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a>.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2835580.0x292e528"></a>Individual Users and CGI Directories</h2></div></div><p>Another reader, Maro Shim (writing from Korea), noticed
something concerning what I said in the February issue about having
to add a <b  >ScriptAlias</b> or <b  >Exec</b>
directive to the HTTP server's configuration file each time a new
CGI directory needed to be added. Maro points out that this means
an administrator has to modify the files for each individual
user.</p><p>Let's get into the pros and cons of letting individual users
have their own CGI directories, using Apache as an example. Then
we'll discuss why this might not be the best thing to do. Finally,
we'll discuss giving each user CGI access, but not giving them the
run of the system.</p><p>Maro's suggestion is that administrators can create a
symbolic link inside the <b  >cgi-bin</b> directory
(which is <b  >/home/httpd/cgi-bin</b> by default for the
copy of Apache running on my Red Hat Linux box), and that this link
can point to a directory inside each user's
<b  >public_html</b> directory, which typically contains
the user's HTML files.</p><p>For example, here is a listing of my personal home directory
at the time of this writing:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
   [1068] ~% ls  -F
   800omni.pdf    News/          public_html/
   Consulting/    Text/          response1.txt
   Development/   cgicyrcode.pl  test.dgs
   Mail/          chap4de.doc
</pre><p>Because I have used the <b  >-F</b> option to ls,
directory names end with slashes, which makes them easier to
identify. You can also identify directories by color or boldface
text if you use the <b  >--color</b> option, but I'm too
old-fashioned for that. The <b  >public_html</b>
directory is where my personal HTML files reside, which are
available via a URL ending with <b  >~reuven/</b>, since
my username is <b  >reuven</b>, and the web server is
configured to look in a user's ppublic_html directory. Thus, if
there were a file <b  >index.html</b>, it would be
accessible via the URL:
<pre     class="programlisting">
   http://localhost/~reuven/index.html
</pre>


(substituting an appropriate hostname for
<b  >localhost</b>, of course).
</p><p>Personal HTML files are nice, and greatly reduce the amount
of work that a system administrator must do in order to run a web
server on which dozens, or perhaps hundreds, of users might want to
put their own home pages. But what about CGI programs? That's where
Maro's letter comes in: Inside the <b  >public_html</b>
directory we can create a subdirectory named
<b  >cgi-bin</b>, as follows:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
   [1071] ~% cd public_html/
   [1072] ~/public_html% mkdir cgi-bin
   [1073] ~/public_html% ls -F
   cgi-bin/   test.html
</pre><p>Now the personal HTML directory contains two items&mdash;a file,
<b  >test.html</b>, which (in this case) can access
<b  >~reuven/test.html</b>, and a directory named
<b  >cgi-bin</b>, the contents of which I can access as
<b  >~reuven/cgi-bin/</b>. Remember, there isn't any
magic in the name <b  >cgi-bin</b>&mdash;at this point, it
acts just like any other subdirectory. Indeed, if I were to place
the CGI program <b  >elephant.pl</b> inside
<b  >~reuven/public_html/cgi-bin</b>, I could access it
by going to:
<pre     class="programlisting">
   http://localhost/~reuven/cgi-bin/elephant.pl
</pre>


But rather than seeing the results of executing
<b  >elephant.pl</b>, we will see its source code. This
is true because we haven't told our server that it should execute
the program; we need to explicitly install
<b  >~reuven/cgi-bin</b> as a CGI directory. This is the
most common way to create personal CGI directories. By including
(under Apache) a <b  >ScriptAlias</b> directive in the
file <b  >srm.conf</b>, we can create new CGI directories
for each user on a system. Thus, if we were interested in turning
<b  >~reuven/cgi-bin</b> into a CGI directory, we could
use the line:
<pre     class="programlisting">
   ScriptAlias /~reuven/cgi-bin/ \
   /home/reuven/public_html/cgi-bin
</pre>


which would have the desired effect. However, this means that every
time we wish to give a user a CGI directory, we need to modify
<b  >srm.conf</b> and restart our HTTP server.
</p><p>Maro's alternative saves us this work by taking a different
approach: Rather than add new <b  >ScriptAlias</b>
directives to <b  >srm.conf</b>, we simply tell our HTTP
server that it should follow symbolic links within the CGI
directories that already exist, using the commands:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
   &lt;Directory /home/httpd/cgi-bin&gt;
   AllowOverride None
   Options FollowSymlinks
   &lt;/Directory&gt;
</pre><p>Once we have done that, we can create symlinks to any
directories that we want to turn into CGI directories. For example,
to turn <b  >/home/reuven/public_html/cgi-bin/</b> into a
CGI directory, we (as root, or another user with appropriate
permissions) would only have to create the symbolic link:
<pre     class="programlisting">
   ln -s /home/httpd/cgi-bin/reuven \
   /home/reuven/public_html/cgi-bin
</pre>


which would then let us use:
<pre     class="programlisting">
   http://localhost/cgi-bin/reuven/elephant.pl
</pre>


which physically exists in my own personal directory, but which
logically exists (as far as the HTTP server is concerned) in the
<b  >/cgi-bin</b> directory, which forces the server to
execute it.
</p><p>Before you turn on CGI directories for individual users,
consider the ramifications: CGI programs are potentially an opening
from the outside world into your server. If even one CGI program is
written with malice aforethought, an attacker could gain access to
your system&mdash;gathering information about your users, for example,
or using that information to alter or damage files. It might seem
convenient to give all users access to CGI programs, and it will
certainly save you time in the short run, but the security
implications are too serious to ignore.</p><p>If you cannot restrict CGI to a small subset of the users on
your system, then you should consider installing a CGI wrapper
program that performs safety checks before executing these
programs. A CGI wrapper is a program which takes a CGI program as
its argument. After the wrapper performs several security checks,
it executes the CGI program&mdash;under the owner's ID, rather than the
ID normally reserved for web programs. This prevents one CGI
program from reading or changing another program's data&mdash;an
increasingly possible problem as large numbers of unrelated sites
are hosted on the same system.</p><p>One such wrapper, known as suEXEC, comes with Apache 1.2.
Configuration and compilation of this program is relatively easy
and is described in detail in the Apache documentation. Simply put,
you compile suEXEC and set it to be SUID root, so it can change to
the user ID of the user, regardless of who that owner might be.
Finally, you will have to install the <b  >suexec</b>
program outside the normal CGI directory in a location defined in
the <b  >httpd.h</b> file in the Apache source
code.</p><p>Another popular CGI wrapper is CGIwrap, which works in a
similar way without being tied to a particular HTTP server. You can
read more about CGIwrap at:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
   http://www.umr.edu/~cgiwrap/
</pre><p>It is a good idea for these wrappers to run CGI programs
under a user ID other than your HTTP server's default, letting
individual users write and install various programs of their
choosing, the possibility of sending programs data that can
overflow buffers, or that might pass malicious arguments to
programs using the Unix shell is too great to ignore, particularly
with the security holes for which Unix is famous. You might want to
insist that any CGI program on your server written in Perl use the
<b  >-T</b> argument, which turns on Perl's
<b  >taint</b> system that prevents user data from being
passed to the shell without going through some sort of filter&mdash;but
of course, such checks can be ignored, and not all CGI programs are
written in Perl.
</p><p>In short, there isn't any perfect solution, which means that
at some point you will have to decide whether to make your system
safer (but with angry users), or more exposed to possible damage
(but with users satisfied with their ability to run CGI programs of
their choosing).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2835580.0x29262b0"></a>Permissions for CGI Programs</h2></div></div><p>While we're on the subject of security, this is probably a
good time for me to publicly wipe away some of the egg that remains
on my face in the wake of my February column, in which I suggested
that you should install CGI programs with permissions of 777, known
to non-numeric types as &ldquo;a+rwx&rdquo;, or permission for all users on
the system to read, write, and execute the program.</p><p>Suffice it to say that this is a grave error, as several
readers noticed. Computer security depends on plugging as many
holes as possible. On networked multiuser systems running programs
that come from various sources, it's almost certainly a bad idea to
install a program having permissions that let anyone on the system
modify the contents of that program, particularly when a simple
(and probably hard-to-notice) modification or two can turn a
seemingly innocuous program into a ravenous bug-blatter beast. On a
system not running one of the wrappers mentioned here, all CGI
programs are run with the same permission, meaning that someone
could write a program that can mess with the code or data of
another.</p><p>If you are the only programmer working on a particular CGI
program or Web site, then you can install your programs with 755
permission (u=rwx,ga+rx), so that others on the system&mdash;including
the HTTP server, which is generally responsible for running CGI
programs&mdash;can read and execute your code but cannot modify
it.</p><p>If you are working with others on a site or CGI program, you
can set the permissions to 775 (ug=rwx,a+rx), which lets everyone
read and execute the program, but allows only the owner and members
of the file's group to edit it.</p><p>There are probably times when it is appropriate to install a
CGI program with 777 (a+rwx) permission, but these are rare.</p><p>That's it for the mailbag for this time. Next month, we'll
return to a discussion of how to make life easier for
non-programmers who might want to modify entries in tables on disk,
by writing a few small CGI programs which can read and write files
efficiently and easily.</p></div></div>
