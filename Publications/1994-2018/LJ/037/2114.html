    Every time you are running as root, you are taking a chance.
    With a little programming, you can decrease the need to be root
    and make your life a little safer.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1731580.0x1829500"></a></h2></div></div><p>This article is more about ending a bad
habit than serious programming. How many of you regularly become
root to do some routine task? I thought so. And, worse yet, how
many of you just stay logged on as root because you know you can do
what you want? That's too many.
</p><p>One very common reason to become root is to run a shell
script needing root privileges. For example, starting PPP is
usually done by a script that must be run as root. For this
article, I use that example as the basis for the code shown in
<a href="2114l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a>. There is nothing
special about it&mdash;it just happens to be a common example. This same
program can be modified to run other scripts requiring root
privileges or to do other root-like tasks.</p><p>The first thing you need to understand is the meaning of the
phrase &ldquo;set UID on execution&rdquo;. This concept is the only patented
feature in Unix. It is the ability to &ldquo;look like another user&rdquo;
while executing a program. The most common example is running the
<b  >passwd</b> program to change your password. If you
look at the permissions on the password file you will probably see
something like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
-rw-r--r-- 1 root  1260
Nov  3 10:05 /etc/passwd
</pre><p>Notice that only root has permission to write to the file.
Now look at the permissions on the password program:
<pre     class="programlisting">
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root 10636 Jun 6 1996
/usr/bin/passwd
</pre>


Notice there is an <b  >s</b> where you would expect an
<b  >x</b> to indicate execute permission for the owner.
The <b  >s</b> indicates the &ldquo;set UID&rdquo; bit is set.
</p><p>Having the UID bit set means when you, as an ordinary user,
execute the passwd program, the program is executed as if you were
root. This enables you to change your password entry in
/etc/passwd, but you won't be able to do anything else. The program
itself (/usr/bin/passwd) is responsible for making sure you do only
reasonable tasks; since you don't have write permission to the
program, you can't change it.</p><p>If you understand set UID, you can now see how important it
is in guaranteeing program security. For example, if your program
has a way to get into the shell, it has a security hole.</p><p>While we are talking about security holes, one other approach
is allowing shell scripts to run set UID. This ability actually
exists in some Unix systems, and it opens huge security holes.
Ideally, you must be able to read the script and trust it.</p><p>The program I wrote to start and stop PPP is in Listing 1.
Its purpose is execution of the appropriate shell script to start
or stop PPP, depending on whether it is called with an argument of
<b  >on</b> or <b  >off</b>.</p><p>Most of the code is explained in the comments, but let me
further explain a couple of items. First, I chose to set the PATH
environment variable to a reasonable set of directories. It is
important to do this to guarantee it's impossible to sneak an
unauthorized executable into the program. Second, I used the
<b  >execle</b> system call to execute the appropriate
script. <b  >execle</b> passes the new environment to the
called program, so it inherits the search path I set instead of the
path of the calling user.</p><p>I also specified the full path name of the programs to run
(see the #define lines)&mdash;another security consideration. It should
be unnecessary after PATH has been set, but it's an inexpensive
safety precaution.</p><p>Finally, the program must be installed properly. Once you
have built the executable (<b  >make ppp</b>), you should
become root, move it to an appropriate directory (e.g.,
/usr/local/bin) and correctly set the permissions.</p><p>If you want anyone to be able to run the program, make sure
it is owned by root and set the permissions to 4711. The leading 4
specifies setting the set UID bit. If you have a particular group
of people you want to allow to run the program, change the group
owner of the program to the appropriate group with permissions set
to 4710.</p><p>That's it. If all goes well, you now have one less excuse to
work logged in as root.</p><p>If you need a system for allocating various root tasks to
ordinary users, solutions are readily available. Check out the
<b  >sudo</b> and <b  >super</b> programs,
which are included in most Linux distributions.</p></div></div>
