    Having fun using wireless modems as a LAN bridge between SSC offices.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x188c580.0x19843f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>Recently, SSC needed more room and rented
another office. The remote office needed a connectivity solution to
link it to the original office's LAN. Several options were
available to us:
<div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Frame relay (56k, T1...)Advantage: high
speedDisadvantage: high cost of line and hardware</p></li><li><p>ISDNAdvantage: relatively high speedDisadvantage:
potentially expensive hardware, long wait for installation</p></li><li><p>28.8k serialAdvantage: cheap hardware, readily
availableDisadvantage: low speed</p></li><li><p>Wireless networkingsimilar to ISDN</p></li><li><p>Guerrilla Ethernet (run our own coax down the
street) Advantage: 1.555-&gt; 2.5 Mbits fastDisadvantage: street
sweepers</p></li></ol></div>

</p><p>We explored each possibility, and decided that outside of the
probably illegal guerrilla Ethernet, wireless modems would be the
most fun to install and use. We contacted various vendors for
wireless products and found Freewave had the highest-speed wireless
modems available. Freewave sent us a pair of modems to test at the
office.</p><p>The Freewave modems we received were small and easy to
configure. The manual stated they could potentially be used at a
range of 20 miles, line-of-sight. We would soon see if that was a
true statement.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x188c580.0x1984978"></a>How Wireless Modems Work</h2></div></div><p>Freewave wireless modems act as a null-modem cable, and
unlike regular modems, do not need dialing. The modems
<span   class="emphasis"><em>look</em></span> for other modems on their frequency and
link to them. Wireless modems can link point-to-point, i.e., two
modems, or multiple modems can be connected to a single modem that
acts as a hub. Point-to-point, the modems are configured as a
master and a slave. One calls the other and a link is established.
The <span   class="emphasis"><em>number</em></span> they call is an internal, firmware
encoded number.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x188c580.0x1984b30"></a>Configuration</h2></div></div><p>The firmware of the Freewave modem is accessed by pressing a
dimple on the front plate of the unit, which puts the modem into
configure mode. Connecting to the serial device with
<b  >minicom</b> or <b  >xc</b> at 38400 bps
enables you to access the firmware menu. You then have the options
to configure the speed the unit will use to talk with other modems,
the numbers of the other Freewaves to call, and the behavior of the
unit with the other modems&mdash;as a slave or a master.</p><p>Since we wanted point-to-point usage, the number was set to
the number of the second modem, and the speed was set to 115200
bps.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x188c580.0x1984d40"></a>Getting the Modems Talking</h2></div></div><p>Exiting the firmware puts the unit back in communication
mode. It took several configuration tries to get each Freewave
configured with the right speed as master and slave. Finally, the
status lights on the units showed us a link, and flashes of packets
could periodically be seen. We noticed that at 115200 bps, with the
modems 20 feet apart, we weren't communicating well. Characters
could not be sent either way even though a link was definitely
established. Our communication test initially consisted of using
minicom to send &ldquo;Hello? Is it working? See this?&rdquo; back and forth
between modems.</p><p>We dropped the speed back to 9600 and established a reliable,
clean link. We also discovered that sometimes the firmware on one
of the modems would suddenly configure itself to be the master
instead of the slave and talk at odd baud rates like 230400
bps.</p><p>After an hour or two of playing with the firmware, we were
able to get a reliable 115200 bps connection at 20 feet. Now it was
time to test a link between the two offices. The new office is
south of the old at a distance of approximately 1500 feet with a
large nursing home and several houses in between (read: not
line-of-sight). After spending 2 or 3 hours beating on bad serial
ports and slow 16450 UART-equipped hardware, we finally built a
system with 16550As and were able to test the modem. The modem was
placed in the window, just in case an extra wall might make a
difference. After a bit more banging on the firmware, we finally
established a connection with the office at 115200. We had link
speed and reliability with a couple of transfers of the Linux
kernel back and forth, and we also met with some problems.
Occasionally the link would freeze, which meant resetting the
modem, which in turn sometimes caused a glitch in the firmware.
Other times it would transfer flawlessly at 7-8Kbytes/sec, a
respectable performance. All in all, we decided that this
performance, though quite good, was not robust enough to act as a
LAN bridge to the remote office. Therefore, we packed up the modems
and sent them back to Freewave.</p><p>I believe that with line-of-sight or at least
minimally-blocked usage these modems could yield quality results.
They're the fastest wireless modems we found&mdash;others we researched
had maximum rates of 9600 bps. The initial cost was high, at about
$1500 per unit, but given the costs of similar performance
hardware, such as ISDN routers, DSU/CSUs and such, the overall cost
was actually low, since there are no line charges. With improved
reception (boosters were very costly) these units would have served
their purpose quite well. Without it we decided to use an ISDN
instead.</p></div></div>
