    In a sequel to his &ldquo;Perl and Sockets&rdquo; article in the
    March 1997 issue of <i  >Linux Journal</i>, Mike Mull demonstrates how
    Perl can be used for the server end of a socket connection.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16ca580.0x17c2450"></a></h2></div></div><p>In my previous article in Issue #35 of
<i  >Linux Journal</i>, I wrote about the socket
library functions in Perl with an emphasis on writing Internet
client programs. Perl is also a good language for Internet servers,
not only because of the socket capabilities and the ease of dealing
with files and data, but because it also has a special mode for
improving security. In this article I cover several aspects of
writing Perl servers, including how to use the basic socket
functions, how to best handle multiple connections, asynchronous
communication and security issues. In the process we'll develop a
simple Internet server similar to fingerd that works through the
Web.
</p><p>Socket communication may be either connection-oriented or
connectionless. Connection-oriented protocols, like the Internet's
Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), establish a link between
client and server before exchanging any data. Connectionless
protocols, like the User Datagram Protocol (UDP), simply read or
write data, specifying the client or server address each time. Most
servers use a connection-oriented scheme, and we use this approach
in our example server (see <a href="2064l1.html" target="_self">Listing
1</a>). However, I discuss the connectionless approach
below.</p><p>Any Internet server, from the simplest to the most
complicated, first uses the two functions <b  >socket</b>
and <b  >bind</b> to establish an identifiable
communications endpoint. The server uses <b  >socket</b>
to create a socket with the desired type and protocol. Recall the
syntax for this function is:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
   socket SOCKET, DOMAIN, TYPE, PROTOCOL
</pre><p><b  >SOCKET</b> here is a Perl file handle
initialized by the call to socket. For Internet TCP applications
<b  >DOMAIN</b> is <b  >AF_INET</b> and
<b  >TYPE</b> is <b  >SOCK_STREAM</b>. The Perl
5 Socket package defines the constants <b  >AF_INET</b>
and <b  >SOCK_STREAM</b> as well as other socket-related
constants and functions; refer to the previous article for details.
The
</p><p>An Internet server must bind a network address to the socket
with the <b  >bind</b> function. A client can bind an
address, but it is not usually necessary in connection-oriented
clients. This is also referred to as &ldquo;naming the socket&rdquo;. This
process specifies the network address to which a client must
connect to start communicating with the server. The syntax of
<b  >bind</b> is:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
  bind SOCKET, NAME
</pre><p>The <b  >SOCKET</b> argument is still the file
handle created by the call to <b  >socket</b>.
<b  >NAME</b> is the address that is bound to the socket.
The contents of this argument can be quite complicated (again,
refer to the previous article for details). For versions of Perl
from 5.2 on, a function in the Socket package called
<b  >sockaddr_in</b> returns a value for the
<b  >NAME</b> argument given a port number and an
Internet host address. If you're writing something like an ftp or
HTTP server, you can use the reserved &ldquo;well-known&rdquo; port number
(see the file /etc/services for these numbers). Otherwise, any
positive 16-bit integer will suffice as long as it is not one of
the reserved numbers. For servers the special argument
<b  >INADDR_ANY</b> can be used for the Internet address,
which lets the kernel pick an address for the socket.
</p><p>For connection-oriented servers like our example program we
now can use the <b  >listen</b> function to tell the
operating system that we'll accept connections on the socket. This
function looks like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
  listen SOCKET, QUEUESIZE
</pre><p>We all know what <b  >SOCKET</b> is by now.
<b  >QUEUESIZE</b> specifies the number of attempted
connections that can be kept waiting; the symbol
<b  >SOMAXCONN</b> is the maximum for this argument
(usually 5). This lets the server handle several near-simultaneous
connection requests, a crucial feature for HTTP servers or daemons
like inetd.
</p><p>Now a client program could attempt to connect to the server,
but we need more code to actually create the link. For many
servers, the <b  >accept</b> function is called,
typically in a loop of some sort, directly after
<b  >listen</b>. The syntax of <b  >accept</b>
is:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
  accept NEWSOCKET, GENERICSOCKET
</pre><p>This function opens <b  >NEWSOCKET</b>, a file
handle that you can read from or write to in order to communicate
with the connecting client. <b  >GENERICSOCKET</b> is any
open, named socket. For our server, this is the named socket we've
already created with <b  >socket</b> and
<b  >bind</b>. <b  >accept</b> returns the
address of <b  >NEWSOCKET</b> in the same form as the
<b  >NAME</b> argument to <b  >bind</b>.
</p><p>Note that the <b  >accept</b> call waits until a
connection request arrives, so no processing can occur until it
completes. This usually poses no problem since it matches the way
most servers work: they wait for a request and then service it.
Sometimes, though, an application might perform other tasks, like
calculation or system monitoring, that can't be stopped to wait for
client connections. If so, communication can be done
asynchronously&mdash;that is, processing can be interrupted temporarily
using a signal handler to make the socket connection and to process
the client's request. I don't cover this in detail since that
requires a lengthy digression into the <b  >fcntl</b>
system call and signal handlers, but
<a href="2064l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2</a> illustrates the basic
idea.</p><p>UDP does not guarantee reliability; extra user code must deal
with problems caused by packets that don't make it to their
destinations. The Internet's main connectionless protocol is called
UDP, or User Datagram Protocol. A <b  >datagram</b>
contains all of the information required to send it to the right
place. needed. For a connectionless server,
<b  >listen</b> and <b  >accept</b> are not
needed. A connectionless client usually does need to use
<b  >bind</b> so that a valid return address gets passed
to the server in the client's data packets, but we won't worry
about the client side here. To use UDP on our socket rather than
TCP, we simply replace the <b  >socket</b> argument
<b  >SOCK_STREAM</b> with <b  >SOCK_DGRAM</b>
and the <b  >getprotobyname</b> argument
<b  >tcp</b> with <b  >udp</b>.</p><p>In C we use the system functions <b  >sendto</b>
and <b  >recvfrom</b> to send data between client and
server with UDP, but Perl doesn't implement these directly.
Instead, Perl uses <b  >send</b> and
<b  >recv</b> for both connection-oriented and
connectionless protocols. After setting up the socket with
<b  >socket</b> and <b  >bind</b>, a
connectionless server would usually call
<b  >recv</b>:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
   recv SOCKET, SCALAR, LEN, FLAGS
</pre><p>This function blocks until data becomes available on
<b  >SOCKET</b>, then reads LEN bytes into the scalar
variable <b  >SCALAR</b>. <b  >FLAGS</b> are
the same flags as for the <b  >recv</b> system call.
<b  >recv</b> returns the address of the client, which
can then be used to send information back with the
<b  >send</b> function:
<pre     class="programlisting">
   send SOCKET, MSG, FLAGS, TO
</pre>


<b  >TO</b> is the client address. The socket code in the
simplest connectionless server would look something like this:
<pre     class="programlisting">
   socket(S, AF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM, \
      getprotobyname('udp'));
   bind(S, sockaddr_in( $port, INADDR_ANY) );
   $cli_addr = recv S, $request, 80, 0;
   send S, $message, 0, $cli_addr;
</pre>


Now back to our TCP server. Remember I mentioned earlier that
several connection requests can get queued up so the server can
respond to each in turn. This might be inefficient (and probably
annoying to the client user) if the server does something that
takes a significant amount of time, like querying a database or
running an external program. To get around this problem, many
servers fork a new process to handle a request once they accept a
connection. Look at our example server code for details. The only
slightly tricky part is the <b  >CHLD</b> signal handler
used to clean up zombie processes.
</p><p>Servers often run as setuid or setgid programs, meaning the
processes have the privileges of the user or group that owns the
executable file regardless of who runs the program. At the very
least, a server program will run under your own user ID. Since
anyone can, in principle, use an Internet server, you can see
security is of the utmost importance. You must make sure the server
does not give privileged access to important system files or your
own confidential data. Usually this requires checks on environment
variables, file privileges, external program execution, etc., so
that it's hard to be thorough. Fortunately, Perl helps us out here
with its <span   class="emphasis"><em>taint mode</em></span>, a mode that checks for
common security violations. The <b  >-T</b> command line
switch turns on this mode, so we just add this to the &ldquo;shebang&rdquo;
line at the top of the script.</p><p>The <b  >exec</b> function in the example server
might cause security concerns for at least two reasons. First,
executing an external program implies the use of the
<b  >PATH</b> environment variable. This variable is
considered to be tainted until we set it explicitly in the script,
since it could be modified to cause the execution of a program
other than the one we intended. Second, we separate the arguments
to <b  >exec</b> into the program name and the argument
list, which prevents <b  >exec</b> from calling the shell
to do metacharacter substitutions. If these modification were not
made, the taint mode would send warnings to the terminal and stop
the program (in fact, that's how I found these problems). Keep in
mind taint mode does not guarantee security, but it does make it
much easier to identify well-known problems.</p><p>Network servers are among the most complex pieces of
software, which is to say, you should by no means consider this
article a comprehensive treatment of the subject. Still, you'll be
surprised to find how many of the elements of our simple example
program show up in even large, complicated servers. Perl does
reduce some of the complexity though, since you already have
convenient tools at hand to do the hard parts, like parsing
protocols and manipulating files. Even if you ultimately decide to
write the program in C or some other compiled language, Perl can't
be surpassed for prototyping server applications. The price is
right too, but I don't need to convince Linux users of the value of
&ldquo;free&rdquo; software.</p></div></div>
