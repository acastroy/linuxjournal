    Gary is now
    SSC's Technical Editor and I am Managing Editor of <i  >Linux Journal</i>

Phil Hughes waved his hands and Gary Moore and I traded positions
on February 1. As a result, Gary is now SSC's Technical Editor and
I am Managing Editor of <i  >Linux Journal</i>. This is
one of those win-win situations&mdash;Gary gets to spend more time
editing and I get to tell everyone what to do. I love managing
things. I suppose I have a strong controller streak to my psyche.
</p><p>I have worked with computers for over 15 years now, mainly
programming scientific applications in Fortran for geophysical
(oil) companies. I also did a lot of technical writing in the form
of software documentation. The writing was always the most fun, so
I've enjoyed my work here at SSC and expect to continue to do so as
Editor of <i  >Linux Journal</i>. Since coming to work
for SSC, I've done editing of reference cards, such as Java and
HTML, as well as lots of copy editing for <i  >Linux Journal</i>. And of course, I made sure that <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Gazette</em></span> got posted every month. Actually, it was the
time spent on <span   class="emphasis"><em>LG</em></span> that convinced me that I
could handle the job for <i  >LJ</i>. I have retained
custody of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Gazette</em></span>. I have too much fun
with <span   class="emphasis"><em>LG</em></span> to give it up, and I intend to have
just as much fun with <i  >Linux Journal</i>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22b0580.0x23a8660"></a>A Couple of News Items</h2></div></div><p>The project led by Alan Cox for Linux users to sponsor a
penguin at Bristol Zoo in Swansea, UK is now complete. The
sponsorship was done in Linus Torvalds's name as a 1996 Christmas
present. Details can be found at http://penguin.uk.linux.org.
Sounds like a fun project for user groups.</p><p>The first virus able to infect a Linux system has been found
by McAfee Associates. The virus, named Bliss, has spread to Linux
systems, as many Linux users play Internet games while logged in as
root. To learn how to avoid this danger, check out this month's
article &ldquo;Safely Running Programs as Root&rdquo;, by Phil Hughes.</p><p>If you have a spare Linux CD to give away, you can list your
e-mail address at http://emile.math.ucsb.edu:8000/giveaway.html.
Those people who need them will contact you, send you a
self-addressed stamped envelope and then you can send them the CD.
If you would prefer to lend a Linux CD locally, you can also sign
up to do that at the site. This is a worthy project that should
help to spread the word about Linux.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22b0580.0x23a8818"></a>This Month</h2></div></div><p>This month our focus is on Linux ports, and we have several
articles on different ports including Alpha, Mac and the PowerPC.
Also, thanks to Alessandro Rubini, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Kernel
Korner</em></span> has returned to our pages.</p><p>Beginning with this issue <i  >Linux Journal</i>
will have tar, gzip files containing the listings for our articles.
You can grab the files for this issue from
ftp://ftp.linuxjournal.com/lj/listings/issue37. As time permits, we will add
files containing article listings from previous months.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22b0580.0x23a8a28"></a>Next Month</h2></div></div><p>Next month we'll focus on networking. Planned are articles on
multi-platform networking with Linux, on communicating between home
and office and on setting up a Sun SPARCstation.</p><p>Send me any ideas or suggestions you might have for articles
