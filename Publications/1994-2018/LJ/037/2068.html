    Python has evolved since we last had an article on it. Andrew
    Kuchling brings us up to date in this article, and we invite readers to
    submit suggestions for Python topics Andrew might cover in future issues
    of <i  >Linux Journal</i>.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1adc580.0x1bd4240"></a></h2></div></div><p>What's been happening to Python since J.
Bauer's article in <i  >Linux Journal</i> #35? Like
most free software, Python is being continually developed and
enhanced. At the time of the original article, Python was at
version number 1.2, and betas of 1.3 were floating around. Since
then, version 1.3 has been officially released, only to be replaced
by 1.4 in late October.
</p><p>Versions 1.3 and 1.4 have both added new features to the
language. The really significant new item in 1.3 was the addition
of keyword arguments to functions, similar to Modula-3's. For
example, if we have the function definition:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
def curse(subject="seven large chickens",
          verb="redecorate",
          object="rumpus room"):
    print "May", subject, verb, "your", object
</pre><p>then the following calls are all legal:
<pre     class="programlisting">
curse()
curse('a spaniel', 'pour yogurt on', 'hamburger')
curse(object='garage')
curse('the silent majority', object='Honda')
</pre>


Arguments not preceded by a keyword are passed in the usual
fashion; non-keyword and keyword arguments can be used in the same
function call, as long as the non-keyword parameters precede the
keyword parameters. By that rule, the following call is a syntax
error:
<pre     class="programlisting">
curse(object='psychoanalyst', 'a ancient philosopher')
</pre>


and the following call would cause an error at runtime, because an
argument is being defined twice:
<pre     class="programlisting">
curse('the silent majority', subject='Honda')
</pre>


As a pleasant side effect, adding keyword arguments required
optimising function calls, reducing the overhead of a single
function call by roughly 20%.
</p><p>Most of the changes in the 1.4 release made Python more
useful for numeric tasks. Many of the changes were proposed by the
members of the Matrix special interest group (or Matrix-SIG), which
has defined a syntax and built a data type for manipulating
matrices. (The Python SIGs are small groups of people tightly
focused on one application of Python, such as numeric programming
or database interfaces; see http://www.python.org/sigs/ for more
information about the existing SIGs.)</p><p>One such enhancement is support for complex numbers. The
imaginary component of a complex number is denoted by a suffix of
&ldquo;J&rdquo; or &ldquo;j&rdquo;; thus, the square root of -1 is symbolized as 1j .
The usual mathematical operations such as addition and
multiplication can be performed on complex numbers, of
course.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;&gt; 1+2j*2
(1+4j)
&gt;&gt;&gt; (1+2j)*2
(2+4j)
&gt;&gt;&gt; (1+2j)/(2+1j)
(0.8+0.6j)
</pre><p>The presence of complex numbers also requires mathematical
functions that can perform operations on them. Instead of updating
the existing math module, a new module called cmath was added; old
software might malfunction if an operation returns a complex value
where an error was expected. So math.sqrt(-1) will always raise a
ValueError exception, while cmath.sqrt(-1) will return a complex
result of 1j.
<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;&gt; import cmath
&gt;&gt;&gt; cmath.sqrt(-1)
1j
&gt;&gt;&gt; a=cmath.log(1+2j)
&gt;&gt;&gt; print a
(0.804718956217+1.10714871779j)
&gt;&gt;&gt; cmath.exp(a)
(1+2j)
</pre>


For the sake of users comfortable with Fortran's notation, the
<b  >**</b> operator has been added for computing powers;
it's simply a shorthand for Python's existing pow() function. For
example, 10**2 is equivalent to pow(10,2) and returns 100.
</p><p>One minor new function has been requested by several people
in comp.lang.python. Python has long had a tuple() function which
converts a sequence type (like a string or a list) into a tuple;
the usual idiom for converting sequence types to lists was
map(None, L). (The function map(F,S) returns a list containing the
result of function F, performed on each of the elements of the
sequence S. If F is None, as in this case, then no operation is
performed on the elements, beyond placing them in a list.)</p><p>Many people found this asymmetry&mdash;tuple() existed, but not
list()&mdash;annoying. In 1.4, the list() function was added, which is
symmetric to tuple().</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;&gt; tuple([1,2,3])
(1, 2, 3)
&gt;&gt;&gt; list( (1,2,3,4) )
[1, 2, 3, 4]
</pre><p>An experimental feature was included in 1.4 and caused quite
a bit of controversy: private data belonging to an instance of a
class is a little more private. An example will help to explain the
effect of the change. Consider the following class:
<pre     class="programlisting">
class A:
    def __init__(self):
        self.__value=0
    def get(self): return self.__value
    def set(self, newval): self.__value=newval
</pre>


Python doesn't support private data in classes, except by
convention. The usual convention is private variables have names
that start with at least one underscore. However, users of a class
can disregard this and access the private value anyway. For
example:
<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;&gt; instance=A()
&gt;&gt;&gt; dir(instance)  # List all the attributes of the instance
['__value']
&gt;&gt;&gt; instance.get()
0
&gt;&gt;&gt; instance.__value=5
&gt;&gt;&gt; instance.get()
5
</pre>


A more significant problem; let's say you know nothing about A's
implementation and try to create a subclass of A which adds a new
method that uses a private __value attribute of its own. The two
uses of the name will collide. Things are slightly different in
1.4:
<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;&gt; instance=A()
&gt;&gt;&gt; dir(instance)
['_A__value']
</pre>


Where did this new value come from? In 1.4, any attribute that
begins with two underscores is changed to have <b  >_</b>
and the class name prefixed to it. Let's say you have a class
called <b  >File</b>, and one method refers to a private
variable called <b  >__mode</b> the name will be changed
to <b  >_File__mode</b>.
<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;&gt; instance.get()
0
&gt;&gt;&gt; instance.__value=5
&gt;&gt;&gt; instance.get()
0
&gt;&gt;&gt; dir(instance)
['_A__value', '__value']
</pre>


Now, this still doesn't provide ironclad data hiding; callers can
just refer explicitly to <b  >_A__value</b>. However,
subclasses of A can no longer accidentally stomp on private
variables belonging to A.
</p><p>This feature is still controversial and caused much debate in
comp.lang.python when it was introduced. Thus, its status is only
experimental, and it might be removed in a future version of the
language, so it would be unwise to rely on it.</p><p>Both the 1.3 and 1.4 releases included some new modules as
part of the Python library, and bug fixes and revisions to existing
modules in the library. Most of these changes are only of interest
to people who've written code for earlier versions of those
modules; see the file Misc/NEWS in the Python source distribution
for all the details. If you're just coming to the language, these
changes aren't really of interest to you.</p><p>The news isn't just limited to the software. The first two
books on Python were published in October: <span   class="emphasis"><em>Programming
Python</em></span>, by Mark Lutz, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Internet Programming
with Python</em></span>, by Aaron Watters, Guido van Rossum, and
James C. Ahlstrom. At least one more book is scheduled for release
next year.</p><p>Two Python workshops have taken place, one at the Lawrence
Livermore National Labs in California last May, and another in
Washington, D.C. in November. Speakers discussed all sorts of
topics: distributed objects; interfacing C++ and Python, or Fortran
and Python; and Web programming. See
http://www.python.org/workshops/ for more information about the
workshops and the papers presented.</p><p>In November 1996, the 5th Python Workshop was held, in
association with the FedUnix '96 trade show. The two most common
topics were numeric programming and Web-related programming. For
numeric work, there's a lot of interest in using Python as a glue
language to control mathematical function libraries written in
Fortran or C++. Code can be developed quickly in Python, and once
the program logic is correct it can be ported to a compiled
language for speed's sake. There's also a benefit from using a
general programming language like Python, instead of a specialized
mathematical language; it's easier to make the numeric code
accessible with a GUI written in Tk, or with a CGI
interface.</p><p>Another popular topic was Web-related programming. The Python
Object Publisher was an especially interesting system, which
enables accessing Python objects via HTTP. To take an example from
the Object Publisher presentation, a URL like:</p><p>http://www.here.com/Car/Pinto/purchase?name=Bob</p><p>causes a Python Car object named Pinto to be located, and its
purchase() method will be called with 'Bob' as a parameter. Other
presentations discussed generating HTML, writing tools for system
administration, and collaborative document processing. Brief notes
on the papers are at http://www.python.org/workshops/1996-11/, with
links to HTML or PostScript versions.</p><p>As you read this, plans for the next workshop are probably in
progress, though there's no news at the time of writing; see the
Python Web site for the current status. In the past, the meetings
have alternated between the Eastern and Western U.S., so workshop
#6 will probably be on the West Coast.</p><p><a href="2068s1.html" target="_self">References</a></p></div></div>
