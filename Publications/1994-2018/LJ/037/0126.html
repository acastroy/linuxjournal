management.</em></span>
</p><p>c-tree Plus is a professional developer's package. It has a
complex set of features and can produce commercial grade multi-user
applications. It will work on almost every platform with a C
compiler and applications written on one platform can quickly and
easily be ported to others. It can even work around most of the
platforms' native file handling weaknesses. If you aren't a
professional programmer odds are that you may have never heard of
FairCom or c-tree Plus. The manual says:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>c-tree Plus is a sophisticated file management
product designed to be used in a variety of operating system
environments. Written in the C language it is designed to be
integrated with your C application program to provide easy to use,
yet flexible data file manipulation and indexing.</p></blockquote></div><p>Wow, what a mouthful! Let's cover the basics first. For those
of us who don't eat and sleep C programming, a simple, and
therefore good, way to think of c-tree Plus is as a library of C
functions that manage data files and indices similar to the way
Borland's dBase worked on old DOS platforms. You'll see later that
this is professional development package with a lot more to offer
than DOS dBase, but bear with me.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xce4580.0xddc818"></a>The Basics</h2></div></div><p>In the simplest application, like a business's database of
customers, a single data file can be accessed through multiple
binary tree (btree) index files. Each time your application
accesses the data through a different index, your data looks like
another data file sorted by the index you are using. You may create
one index on the customer's name and another on the customer's
account number. Looking though the customer name index the data
appears to be sorted by customer name. Use the account number index
and through the magic of btree indexing the same data appears to be
a new data file sorted by account number.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xce4580.0xddc920"></a>How to Use ISAM with c-tree Plus</h2></div></div><p>Let's run through an outline of how a simple application is
built. c-tree Plus offers a full suite of Indexed Sequential Access
Method (ISAM) functions that can perform multiple file and index
operations in a single ISAM function call. The low-level c-tree
Plus functions are also available if you really need to have
complete control, but the author and FairCom recommend that you
stick with the ISAM functions. In order to be fully compatible
across a wide variety of platforms, c-tree Plus uses it own data
types. For example, an &ldquo;int&rdquo; may be a two-byte integer on one
system and a four byte integer another. With c-tree Plus you use
COUNT, which is always a two-byte signed integer.</p><p>C-tree also provides a pointer to its custom types in the
form of pCOUNT, which is the equivalent to COUNT *. One of the most
important custom data types is the IFIL, which defines the
parameters for an ISAM file instances. You can declare your data
structure in your sources or use separate parameter files. I like
using the structures in my sources because when you open and close
files individually with ISAM parameter files it's all or
nothing.</p><p>The IFIL structure is pretty straightforward&mdash;it contains a
pointer to the file name, a file number, the data record length and
pointer to an IIDX index file structure. Next you'll declare the
parameters for the index keys within the data records for each
instance of the data using an IIDX structure containing a key
length, key type and flags if duplicate keys or null keys are
allowed, and a pointer to the index file name. The ability to have
duplicate keys is an important feature of the c-tree package. When
you use duplicate keys, the c-tree system actually pads each to
make it unique. Your application doesn't have to deal with any of
it&mdash;it's all taken care of for you.</p><p>The last structure is an ISEG which tells c-tree where to
find the key values in data records via a segment length and
offset. That's it! Just three basic structures and your data schema
is laid out. The functions to work with the file structure are well
thought out and very intuitive. CreateFile, OpenFile, AddRecord,
GetRecord and DeleteRecord all do exactly what you'd expect.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xce4580.0xddcb30"></a>A Mode for Every Occasion</h2></div></div><p>Now a few words about modes. There are four c-tree modes, two
single-user and two multi-user. The features vary between each but
the base functionality is the same. The simplest, single-user mode,
gives you get all the features except file security. The other mode
adds Online Transaction Processing (OLTP). C-tree's OLTP suite is
awesome; you can roll back transactions, use all kinds of save
points, and enjoy wonderful logging and easy recovery. In the
author's biased opinion, OLTP is really a must for mission-critical
business applications&mdash;this package does it right.</p><p>Now for the multi-user modes, where the horsepower of this
package really shines. First is the non-client/server mode. It uses
the traditional methods for file and record locking to which Unix
programmers are accustomed. Using Linux's NFS capabilities you
could use this mode to create a client/server application, but
you'll give up OLTP and a lot of c-tree's file buffering. We
compiled some simple applications and found that this mode quickly
slowed as you added users. For small businesses where OLTP would
not unduly hold things up, using NFS and multi-user mode may be a
very cost-effective solution for shared data applicants.</p><p>Now for the crown jewel of the c-tree suite: client/server
mode. The package includes one FairCom server binary for the
platform you specify (Linux, OS/2, Netware, DOS, NT, etc.); this is
the only portion of the package for which source code is not
available. I was surprised to find there are servers for just about
every platform&mdash;yes, even lowly DOS can run the FairCom server and
handle record locking and file security.</p><p>On multi-tasking platforms such as Linux, the server runs in
the background and is very well-behaved. When you use client/server
mode you get the full set of OLTP, file security, and file and
record locks. The FairCom server seems to be fast, but I don't have
the facilities to really load it up. Your applications communicate
with the server via TCP/IP sockets, shared memory or message
queues. I ran it using TCP/IP over Ethernet and PPP dial-up and
found the performance to be very good. Another neat trick is that
in client/server mode you're able to transparently access the local
disk with or without OLTP at the same time. For the most part, you
can change modes by recompiling your applications with the right
c-tree libraries for that mode. This is very cool, since you can go
from a single-user OLTP application to a client/server application
by recompiling with a different c-tree library.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xce4580.0xddcd40"></a>The Installation</h2></div></div><p>The installation is a snap&mdash;just follow the Installation
&amp; Quick Start Guide. First, run <b  >tar -xvf
/dev/fd0</b> for each of the two Unix floppies that come in
the box. Then run <b  >tar -xvf ctreeX.tar</b> to unpack
the sources&mdash;yes, you get the full c-tree Plus source code. FairCom
provides its own make programs to walk you through the build
process. It's in this area that FairCom could do a little better. I
found the process of compiling the make program&mdash;running the
<b  >mtmake</b> configurations utility which sets up the
compiler flags, then running FairCom's make program,
<b  >mk</b>--a little tedious. Especially when you have
to repeat the last steps three times if you want the stand-alone,
multi-user and client/server mode libraries. In addition you may
want to edit the <b  >ctree.mak</b> file by hand and add
your favorite compiler flags. I added <b  >-O</b> and
<b  >-Wall</b>--yes, I'm paranoid and like to see lots of
warning messages. On the plus side their <b  >make</b>
programs will work the same on any platform.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xce4580.0xddd108"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>FairCom's c-tree Plus is a proven winner that's been around
for a long time (since 1979). It's a wonderful base to build
serious business applications. And with FairCom's per developer,
not per platform, license a Linux system c-tree is a very
cost-effective, cross-platform development tool.</p><p>The Linux community needs more professional development tools
like this. If you are a professional or &ldquo;wanna be&rdquo; professional
developer looking to build mission critical business applications,
I highly recommend that you take a look at c-tree Plus and its
report generator and 4GL companions r-tree and d-tree. You can get
more information at http://www.faircom.com/.</p></div></div>
