contained fifty-nine papers, fifty-seven from the Fourth
International World Wide Web Conference (held in Boston in December
1995) and two from regional conferences. The range of topics
covered is immense. To list just a few (in no particular order):
why the GIF and JPEG formats aren't good enough for really high
quality graphics; low-level security in Java; the results from the
3rd WWW Survey; an analysis of Metacrawler use; caching systems; a
filtering system to provide restricted access to the Web; a PGP/CCI
system for Web security; the Millicent system for financial
transactions involving small sums; smart tokens; and better support
for real-time video and audio. There are also papers on the use of
the Web in education, on cooperative authoring tools, on Web
interfaces to database and software systems, and a cornucopia of
other things.</p><p>Issue 2 was a disappointment. It consisted solely of
standards documents: Requests For Comment (RFCs) numbers 1630
(URIs), 1808 (Relative URLs), 1736 (IRL recommendations), 1866
(HTML 2.0), 1867 (Form-Based Upload), and unallocated (HTML
Tables); Internet drafts on HTTP 1.0, PEP HTTP/1.1, and HTML
Internationalization; and W3C drafts on PNG and Cascading Style
Sheets. Since all of these documents are freely and easily
available on-line and several have already been superseded, this is
really of limited value. (Nicely formatted bound versions of
standards documents are useful, but only for the standards that
have some sort of permanence.)</p><p>Though shorter, issues 3 and 4 strike a better balance
between background material, standards and technical papers. As
background material, issue three contains an interview with Tim
Berners-Lee and descriptions of other World Wide Web Consortium
staff. The technical papers are mostly about Web demographics and
&ldquo;geography&rdquo;: the Nielsen/CommerceNet, GVU, and White House
surveys; systems for statistical analysis of traffic; visualisation
of Web connectivity and traffic; and the implementation of national
Web cache systems in the United Kingdom and New Zealand. Issue 4 is
mostly devoted to HTTP: it contains technical specifications for
and informal descriptions of HTTP 1.1, as well as papers on state
management (cookies), digest authentication, and future directions
for HTTP. There are also papers on PICS, PNG, distributed objects,
and distributed authoring.</p><p>Though few assume much technical background, the papers in
<span   class="emphasis"><em>World Wide Web Journal</em></span> are mostly technical in
focus: they are not for everyone who runs a Web server or authors
HTML. However, for those concerned with the future of Web
technology&mdash;because they are directly involved in protocol or
system development, because they need to prepare for future
applications or out of simple curiosity&mdash;the journal is a good way
of keeping up with the most important developments. As a quarterly
journal, it fills a niche between books and information sources on
the Web itself.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>World Wide Web Journal</em></span> can be sampled on
