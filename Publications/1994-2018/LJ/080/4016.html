    Mr. Haddad exposes the design philosophy and essential features of
    the Jigsaw web Server, an open-source project
    from W3C, and provides a brief guide for installing it on Linux.
    </p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4016f6.jpg"></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1679580.0x1771710"></a></h2></div></div><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4016f5.jpg"></div>
 Jigsaw is the World Wide Web Consortium's (W3C) leading-edge web
server platform. It is a full functioning, object-oriented web
server written in Java that provides a sample HTTP 1.1
implementation, and offers a variety of features on top of an
advanced architecture.
</p><p>The Jigsaw Web Server is designed to be a demonstration in
technology rather than a full-fledged release. Initially, it was
intended as a project to experiment new technologies. However, as
of Jigsaw 2.0, the server broke the rules of test platforms to be
more robust than the average web server, making it worthwhile to
take a serious look at its features, potentials and possible future
deployment.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1679580.0x1771978"></a>Design Philosophy</h2></div></div><p>The design philosophy of Jigsaw is to make it as portable,
flexible and extensible as possible, while still providing a
functional and robust web server. The design goals are met by
having the Jigsaw server run within any Java-supported
environment.</p><p>At its core, having an object-oriented design and
implementation, Jigsaw is nothing more than a set of Java classes
and extension modules. Therefore, adding capabilities to the server
is not complicated. We can dynamically add our own modules where
every resource available to the server is an object, as opposed to
a CGI script, and any object is available to end users via HTTP.
The server can thus be extended by writing new resource objects.
This is the replacement for CGI, where server extensions have to be
written as processes. Jigsaw also supports CGI for use with
existing CGI scripts.</p><p>Jigsaw's developers emphasize providing a well-structured
source code, a full set of core Application Program Interfaces
(APIs) and a high-quality set of documentation.</p><p>These factors offer a complete experimental platform that can
be used by as many researchers as possible. This contributes to the
success of Jigsaw as an open-source project providing a valuable
draft to the future of the HTTP protocol and object-oriented web
servers.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1679580.0x1771b88"></a>Supported Platforms</h2></div></div><p>The Jigsaw server runs on any platform supporting Java. It
has been tested on Windows 95/NT and Solaris
2.<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span>. Many people have also reported successful
installation and use on other platforms such as OS/2, MacOS, BeOS,
Linux, AS-400 and AIX. I installed the Jigsaw server on two
workstations powered by Red Hat 6.1 and 6.2, with JDK 1.1.8 and JDK
1.2.2 respectively, and in both cases it worked fine.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1679580.0x1771ce8"></a>Getting Started</h2></div></div><p>To install the Jigsaw server, you need to have JDK installed
on your system. Downloading the latest version from
<a href="http://java.sun.com" target="_self">http://java.sun.com/</a> is
recommended.</p><p>After installing JDK, you need to set up the PATH permanently
in the startup file to have access to the JDK bin directory. If you
are using the C shell, edit the ~/.cshrc file in your home
directory and add the following line:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
set path=(/usr/local/jdk1.2.2/bin $path)
</pre><p>Please note that you need to change the path according to
your own installation path. Then load the startup file
<b  >~/.cshrc</b> to activate the changes just applied.
<pre     class="programlisting">
% source ~/.cshrc
</pre>


Now you will be able to access the Java binary directory without
typing the full path.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1679580.0x1772000"></a>Downloading Jigsaw</h2></div></div><p>The latest (non-stable) distribution, Jigsaw 2.1.1, can be
downloaded from the W3C home page. It contains the Java source
code, the documentation and the pre-compiled classes. The 2.1.1
version, released in March 2000, includes new features such as
XML-based serialization, Servlet 2.2 implementation, a new RFC2616
compliant cache, image metadata extraction using content
negotiation, as well as digest authentication and ACL-based
authentication.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1679580.0x1772108"></a>Installation Procedure</h2></div></div><p>Having installed JDK and set your path, you can proceed to
install Jigsaw on your Linux system by following three
steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Unpack the distribution file</p></li><li><p>Set up the environment</p></li><li><p>Build the property files</p></li></ol></div><p>In the following subsections, we will examine each of these
steps.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1679580.0x17724d0"></a>1. Unpack the Distribution File</h2></div></div><p>The distribution comes in the form of jigsaw-x.x.x.tar.gz.
You need to choose a place to unpack it. I installed it under
/usr/local/Jigsaw. However, you can install it in a directory of
your choice. Since the selection of the installation directory will
not be the same for all of us, we will call this directory INSTDIR.
You have to change INSTDIR with the absolute path where you have
unpacked the distribution.</p><p>To unpack the distribution, at the shell prompt you
apply:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
% tar -xzvf jigsaw-x.x.x.tar.gz
</pre><p>This will create a number of directories under the Jigsaw
main directory:
</p><p>Jigsaw/src jigsaw sourcesJigsaw/scripts sample scripts to
start the Jigsaw server and the JigAdmin serverJigsaw/classes
pre-compiled classesJigsaw/lib native code support for
SolarisJigsaw/Jigsaw the root directory to run the server in</p><p>The Jigsaw/Jigsaw directory contains:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The configuration directory for the server</p></li><li><p>The configuration directory for the administration
server</p></li><li><p>The directory for log files</p></li><li><p>The directory for caching when using Jigsaw as a
caching proxy</p></li><li><p>The exported file space</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1679580.0x1772b58"></a>2. Set up the Environment</h2></div></div><p>Next, we specify to the Java interpreter the place where
Jigsaw classes are stored. We do this by setting the CLASSPATH
environment variable. For Jigsaw 2.1.0 and up, we set it as
follows:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
% CLASSPATH=INSTDIR/Jigsaw/classes/jigsaw.jar:INSTDIR/Jigsaw/classes/sax.jar:INSTDIR/Jigsaw/classes/xp.jar:.% export CLASSPATH
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1679580.0x1772cb8"></a>3. Build the Property Files</h2></div></div><p>The last step is to build the property files. We do that by
switching into the Jigsaw subdirectory:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
% cd INSTDIR/Jigsaw/Jigsaw
</pre><p>and execute:
<pre     class="programlisting">
% java Install
</pre>


</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1679580.0x1769758"></a>Running Jigsaw</h2></div></div><p>After completing the installation procedure, we are set to
run Jigsaw. We switch into the installation directory and type in
the following command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
% java org.w3c.jigsaw.Main -host host -root INSTDIR/Jigsaw/Jigsaw
</pre><p>where host is the full IP hostname of the machine, and
<b  >INSTDIR</b> is the absolute path of the location
where we have unpacked the distribution file.
</p><p>Alternatively, we could run the provided script that would
start the Jigsaw sever for us:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
% ./script/jigsaw.sh &amp;
</pre><p>Jigsaw will run and produce a debug message such as the
following:
<pre     class="programlisting">
[root@byblos ]# ./scripts/jigsaw.shloading properties from: /usr/local/Jigsaw/Jigsaw/config/server.props

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1679580.0x1769b78"></a>Testing the Installation</h2></div></div><p>To verify that the Jigsaw server is up and running, start
your favorite web browser and point it to your workstation address
at port 8001, which is the default port for the Jigsaw server.
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Et voil&agrave;!</em></span> We get the Jigsaw server home
page (see Figure 1), similar to the Apache installation home
page.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4016f1.large.jpg"><img src="4016f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1. Jigsaw Server Home Page</p></div></div>
</p><p>Similarly, to check if the JigAdmin server started properly,
we follow the same procedure except that we specify port 8009,
which is the default port for the JigAdmin Server.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1679580.0x1769f40"></a>Setting Jigsaw to Run at System Startup</h2></div></div><p>Now the Jigsaw server is up and running. However, if you
reboot the machine, Jigsaw will not automatically start. To set up
Jigsaw to start at boot time, you need to follow three
steps:</p><p>1. Create a file called, for instance, jigsawstart with the
following contents:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/sh# Jigsaw Launcher Script
#
# Note:
# The paths JIGSAW_HOME and LD_JIGSAW_LIBRARY_PATH need
# to be adjusted to reflect your own installation
# Define Jigsaw Path
JIGSAW_HOME=/usr/local/Jigsaw/
export JIGSAW_HOME

# Define Jigsaw libraries Path
LD_JIGSAW_LIBRARY_PATH=${JIGSAW_HOME}/lib
export LD_JIGSAW_LIBRARY_PATH

CLASSPATH=${JIGSAW_HOME}/classes/jigsaw.jar:${JIGSAW_HOME}/classes/sax.j
ar:${JIGSAW_HOME}/classes/xp.jar:${JIGSAW_HOME}/classes/servlet.jar
export CLASSPATH
/usr/local/jdk1.2.2/bin/java -Xms16m -Xmx128m org.w3c.jigsaw.Main
-root
${JIGSAW_HOME}/Jigsaw $*
</pre><p>2. Save the file in /bin or /usr/bin and allow execution
permission on it by typing <b  >% chmod +x
jigsawstart</b>
</p><p>3. Edit /etc/rc.d/rc.local and add an entry to start up the
jigsawstart script. All we need to do is add the following lines at
the end of rc.local:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
echo "Running Jigsaw ..."/usr/bin/jigsawstart &amp;
</pre><p>This procedure guarantees Jigsaw start up at boot time.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1679580.0x176a2b0"></a>Administration Tool</h2></div></div><p>Jigsaw comes with an administration tool called
<span   class="bold"><b>JigAdmin</b></span>. JigAdmin is a graphical
interface that communicates with the JigAdmin Administration
Server. This server can administer multiple Jigsaw servers running
on the same machine, provided that those servers have been launched
by the same Java Virtual Machine.</p><p>The version of JigAdmin that comes with Jigsaw 2.1.1 is built
with Swing components; it is easy to use with drag-and-drop
features. Additionally, it comes with an extensive documentation
explaining how to run JigAdmin, the command-line options, and a
complete explanation for its menus and their functionality.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1679580.0x176a468"></a>Starting the JigAdmin Server</h2></div></div><p>The default configuration files provided by the default
installation are designed to start two servers, an instance of the
Jigsaw server and one JigAdmin Server. However, to start the
JigAdmin, we can also use the provided sample script:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
% ./scripts/jigadmin.sh &amp;
</pre><p>We get the authentication window (see Figure 2). The realm
used to access the server is admin, the default user is admin and
the default password is also admin. It is highly recommended to
modify the username and password after you log in the first time.
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4016f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Jigadmin Authentication Window
</p></div></div>

</p><p>After the authentication phase, we receive the JigAdmin main
window (Figure 3), from which we control the server configuration
(Figure 4).</p><p>

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1679580.0x176ac50"></a>JigAdmin Client</h2></div></div><p>Now that the JigAdmin server is running, we can access it
with the following command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
% java org.w3c.jigadmin.Main [-root root] [url]
</pre><p>The default root is your current directory. So if you are in
the same directory where you started Jigsaw, you do not need the
<b  >-root</b> option. If you are running the
administration server on the same machine, using the default port
8009, you do not need to provide a URL; it is the administration
server's. However, if you are not in the root directory, you can
access the administration server with:
<pre     class="programlisting">
% java org.w3c.jigadmin.Main -root INSTDIR/Jigsaw/Jigsaw/
</pre>


</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1679580.0x176aeb8"></a>Jigsaw Documentation</h2></div></div><p>Jigsaw comes with a very organized and rich set of
documentation that is divided into six sections:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>A Quick Start document covering the basics on how
to install and run the server.</p></li><li><p>A Basic Concepts document discussing Jigsaw's
design, authentication and access control.</p></li><li><p>The Jigsaw Configuration Manual covers the basics
of installing and running the server to descriptions of the most
complex configurations you can do with Jigsaw.</p></li><li><p>A Frequently Asked Questions document that answers
all the FAQs about Jigsaw and its use.</p></li><li><p>A Programmer's Documentation guide describing
Jigsaw from a programmer's point of view and indicating how to
extend it to fulfill your own needs.</p></li><li><p>A User's Guide.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1679580.0x176b438"></a>Other Jigsaw Packages</h2></div></div><p>W3C released a Jigsaw Proxy Package that is a ready-to-run
Jigsaw server configured as a proxy server. It is configured with a
pre-installed caching proxy module and comes with an HTTP/1.1
server and client. Jigsaw also supports SSL with Jigsaw-SSL 2.01
beta which is public domain software that allows Jigsaw to use
iSaSiLk as an SSL-provider. IAIK Jigsaw-SSL provides a SSLv3
supporting extension to the W3C HTTP Jigsaw server architecture for
dealing securely with any incoming client request. IAIK JigsawSSL
has been updated to operate on W3C's Jigsaw version Jigsaw
2.0.1.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1679580.0x176b540"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>Jigsaw is not the sort of web server around which you would
build an enterprise-level Internet presence. Nonetheless, if you
are serious about staying ahead of the curve on web protocols and
infrastructures, you will want to have a test-bed machine running
Jigsaw.</p><p>W3C is responsible for overseeing web standards, and anyone
wishing conformity with HTTP/ 1.1 and the upcoming HTTP-NG (Next
Generation) will want to do some testing with Jigsaw, as the latest
version is totally HTTP 1.1-compliant. I highly recommend trying it
out.</p><p><a href="4016s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
