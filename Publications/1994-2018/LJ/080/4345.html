year. Shortly after the millennium, along came the first major
release of Perl since the middle of the last decade, when Perl 5
made its debut. Perl 5.6 was a long time cooking, but it is here
now. And, of course, we can't have a new release of Perl without an
update to &ldquo;The Camel&rdquo;, the Perl bible: Larry Wall's
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Programming Perl</em></span>.</p><p>The third edition of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Programming Perl</em></span>
starts being different from the second edition as early as the
cover. It's right there, at the top, the Perl mantra: &ldquo;There's
More than One Way to Do It.&rdquo; This phrase, more than anything else,
sums up why Perl differs so dramatically from most other
programming technologies. Perl isn't just a programming language,
it's a culture, and this book&mdash;more than any other&mdash;is your guide,
introduction and reference to the culture that is Perl.</p><p>It's not just the cover that's different. Practically all of
the content in this edition has been rewritten, revised,
reorganized and expanded upon. There's now well over 1,000 pages,
up from the 600 or so pages in the previous edition. What used to
take nine chapters, now takes five parts and a whopping 33
chapters! This reflects the extent of the rewrite that this third
edition represents.</p><p>Part I, &ldquo;Overview&rdquo;, is a high-level introduction to the
Perl language and its culture. The goal is to give the reader an
idea of the flavor of Perl, and the authors succeed at doing just
that. But, be warned, this is not a tutorial for those of you
wishing to learn to program Perl. In fact, this is the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>wrong</em></span> book if you are new to Perl. This book
is a reference. I like to tell people that &ldquo;The Camel&rdquo; is the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>second</em></span> Perl book they should buy.</p><p>Part II, &ldquo;The Gory Details&rdquo;, is just that&mdash;gory. In 13
chapters, the reader is bombarded with a very detailed description
of Perl as a programming technology. This can be very heavy going
if you read the book straight through (as I did for this review),
but, when used as a &ldquo;dip in and sample&rdquo; reference text, the
material is easier to digest. Again, this book isn't a tutorial&mdash;it
is the definitive description of the language. There's an awful lot
of good material here. I was pleased to see regular expressions
(Perl's programming language within a programming language) get its
own chapter, as well as a greatly expanded treatment. There's over
60 pages of patterns and regular expressions in Chapter 5,
&ldquo;Pattern Matching&rdquo; and, although it's all great stuff, my head
was spinning by the end of it!</p><p>Part III, &ldquo;Perl as Technology&rdquo;, has chapters covering
Perl's support for Unicode, IPC, Threads and Compilation. When it
comes to Unicode and Threads, Perl is playing catch-up with other
programming technologies (most notably Java). But, hey, the thought
of using Java fills most Perl-folk with dread, so having to wait
for these features to appear in Perl has always been tolerable,
even though their implementation may still be classed as
&ldquo;experimental&rdquo; in Perl 5.6 (as is the case with Threads).
Additional chapters cover using Perl from the commandline as well
as using the debugger. An extra (and very welcome) chapter on
extending Perl with, and embedding Perl in C, rounds off this part
of the book.</p><p>Part IV, &ldquo;Perl as Culture&rdquo;, is all about community. The
reader learns the importance of sharing their code with others (to
help make the world a better place), as well as how to protect
their code both from themselves and from an increasingly unfriendly
Internet. The chapter &ldquo;Common Practices&rdquo; is full of useful advice
both for the novice and the expert Perl programmer. Another welcome
addition is a chapter on the issues surrounding code portability,
and things to look out for when writing Perl code that will be
deployed on disparate systems. A good programmer is a
<span   class="emphasis"><em>lazy</em></span> programmer in the Perl world, and rather
than have everyone ask you the same questions over and over again
about your code, you produce documentation to go along with (and
append to) any Perl modules you write. To this end, Perl provides
POD (plain old documentation) and Chapter 26 tells you all you
would ever want to know about this simple markup technology. The
final chapter in Part IV is called &ldquo;Perl Culture&rdquo;. As everyone
likes a good story, we are presented with a brief history of how
Perl came to be. And what would a culture be without poetry? Also
included are samples of the Perl poetry phenomenon. Competitions
are held on a regular basis and poetry contributions are
welcome.</p><p>Part V, &ldquo;Reference Material&rdquo;, provides details on Perl's
built-in variables, functions, standard library and Perl's
diagnostic messages. A nice touch in the &ldquo;Functions&rdquo; chapter is
the use of descriptive icons to indicate the side-effects each of
the built-in functions have on the Perl run-time environment. I was
disappointed to see all of the standard modules listed but only a
handful of them discussed in detail. The authors cite space
constraints as the reason for this, but I will miss this material.
Granted, all of the standard module documentation is available
on-line (and it comes with the Perl distribution), but there is
something to be said for having it in printed form. Perhaps the
time has come for a separate volume on the Perl standard
library?</p><p>To round things off, there's 29 pages of &ldquo;Glossary&rdquo;. You
will not find a more entertaining glossary in any other computing
text, anywhere. Imagine that, the word &ldquo;entertaining&rdquo; and the
word &ldquo;glossary&rdquo; in the same sentence! Check out the entries for:
algorithm, bucket, C, conditional, dweomer, eclectic, freely
redistributable, funny character, hubris, impatience, invocation,
laziness, Pern, portable, RTFM, script kiddie, shebang, string and
(my personal favorite) UNIX.</p><p>My copy of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Programming Perl, 3rd Edition</em></span>
was a very early printing and suffers a bit as a result. The
authors fell over themselves trying to finish the book in time for
the Summer 2000 Perl Conference, and a few things made it through
the quality control checks that shouldn't have. For instance, in my
copy, the black chapter tabs for Chapter 31 and 32 are
reversed&mdash;what reads &ldquo;Modules&rdquo; should read &ldquo;Pragmata&rdquo; and vice
versa. Another minor annoyance surfaced while I worked my way
through Chapter 15 on Unicode. The author's discussed the
<b  >utf8</b> pragma, so I looked up <b  >use
utf8</b> in Chapter 31, &ldquo;Pragmatic Modules&rdquo;, in Part V,
only to find that it wasn't there! The material's there, in Chapter
15, but it should <span   class="emphasis"><em>also</em></span> be in the Reference
Part of the book. The index needs a little bit of tidying up, too.
The on-line errata maintained at
<a href="http://perl.oreilly.com" target="_self">perl.oreilly.com</a>
indicates that the authors are aware of these problems and that
some have already been fixed in more recent printings.</p><p>All in all, this is a great book, and the third Camel is the
best Camel yet. It is written in a style and humor that is all its
own (and which I suspect comes mostly from Larry Wall). The authors
are all respected members of the Perl community&mdash;there's the
Inventor (Wall), the Caretaker (Christiansen) and the Chronicler
(Orwant). Between them, they know more about Perl than any mere
mortal could possibly be expected to remember, which helps explain
why this book is the <span   class="emphasis"><em>essential</em></span> Perl reference.
You will not find a more authoritative treatment of the language in
any other book. Just remember: when buying your copy, make sure
it's the most recent printing.</p></div></div>
