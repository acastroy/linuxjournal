    Network probes are important clues in detecting intrusions. In this
    article, Lawrence Teo explains two common network probes and what can be done to
    detect them.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10cb580.0x11c3660"></a></h2></div></div><p>Almost any system administrator of a
large network will tell you that their network has been probed
before. As cracking tools become more popular and increase in
number, this trend is likely to continue. Although network probes
are technically not intrusions themselves, they should not be taken
lightly&mdash;they may lead to actual intrusions in the future. As the
saying goes, better be safe than sorry. In this article I'll
explain the concepts behind two common network probes, as well as
how they're performed and what can be done to detect them.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10cb580.0x11c3768"></a>Port Scans</h2></div></div><p>The most common type of network probe is probably the port
scan. A port scan is a method used by intruders to discover the
services running on a target machine. The intruder can then plan an
attack on any vulnerable service that she finds. For example, if
the intruder finds that port 143 (the IMAP port) is open, she may
proceed to find out what version of IMAP is running on the target
machine. If the version is vulnerable, she may be able to gain
superuser access to the machine using an &ldquo;exploit&rdquo; (a program
that exploits a security hole).</p><p>A port scan is actually very simple to perform. All we have
to do is to connect to a series of ports on the machine and find
out which ports respond and which don't. A simple port scanner can
be written in under 15 minutes by a good programmer in a language
such as Java or Perl. However, this kind of port scan is easily
detectable by the operating system of the target machine. Listing 1
shows the traces produced by such a port scan in a log file
(usually <b  >/var/log/messages</b>) on a Linux box.
Notice that a series of connections to various services occurred in
a short span of three seconds. Since it's so easily detectable,
most intruders will not run this kind of port scan against a
machine these days.</p><p><a href="4234l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a></p><p>Another sneakier, &ldquo;stealthier&rdquo; kind of port scan is called
the &ldquo;half-open&rdquo; SYN scan. In this scan, the port scanner connects
to the port but shuts down the connection right before a full
connection occurs (hence the name &ldquo;half-open&rdquo;). Since a full
connection never happened, the operating system of the target
machine usually does not log the scan. This concept will be clearer
if you're familiar with the inner workings of TCP/IP. In a normal
TCP/IP connection, two devices need to complete a three-way
handshake before initiating transmission. In a &ldquo;half-open&rdquo; SYN
scan, the three-way handshake is never completed&mdash;the port scanner
judges whether the port is open by the response given by the target
machine.</p><p>Now that we've covered the basic concepts of port scanning,
let's talk about the most popular and powerful network probing tool
available today&mdash;Nmap (Network Mapper). Nmap is capable of
conducting both types of port scans that I've discussed so far.
It's also capable of performing other kinds of probes&mdash;some of
which I'll cover later. Listing 2 shows a typical Nmap scan against
a machine.</p><p><a href="4234l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2</a></p><p>Now (you might be thinking) if &ldquo;stealth&rdquo; port scans are
possible, how are we supposed to detect them? The good news is that
such port scans are detectable using special tools. Solar Designer
has developed such a tool called scanlogd, which is a d&aelig;mon
that runs in a background and listens on the network interface for
port scans. If a port scan is detected, scanlogd writes one line
describing the scan using the syslog mechanism. Listing 3 shows a
scan detected by scanlogd.</p><p><a href="4234l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3</a></p><p>There are other tools that can detect port scans as well.
I'll not cover them in this article, however. If you're interested,
you can check out the Resources section at the end of this article.
You might in particular want to check out tcplogd, a configurable
TCP port scan detector (you can specify what kind of packets to
log, avoid flooding and specify trusted hosts with it).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10cb580.0x11c3c90"></a>Ping Sweeps</h2></div></div><p>A ping sweep is another kind of network probe. In a ping
sweep, the intruder sends a set of <b  >ICMP ECHO</b>
packets to a network of machines (usually specified as a range of
IP addresses) and sees which ones respond. The whole point of this
is to determine which machines are alive and which aren't. It's a
bit like knocking on your neighbors' doors at 3 a.m. to see who's
asleep and who's not (okay, don't try that). Once the intruder
knows which machines are alive, he can focus on which machines to
attack and work from there. Note that there are legitimate reasons
for performing ping sweeps on a network&mdash;a network administrator
may be trying to find out which machines are alive on a network for
diagnostic reasons.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>fping</b></span> is a tool that can be
used for conducting ping sweeps. fping takes a list of IP addresses
and sends ping packets to them. Unlike normal ping, fping sends one
ping packet to one IP address, and then proceeds immediately to the
next IP address in a round-robin fashion. Listing 4 shows a simple
Perl script that is used to generate a list of Class C IP addresses
(<b  >192.168.0.1</b> to <b  >192.168.0.20</b>,
in our example). Listing 5 shows how that Perl script can be used
in conjunction with fping to discover which machines in that IP
address range are alive on the network. The <b  >-a</b>
switch is used to show only machines that are alive without it
(fping will show machines that are unreachable as well).</p><p><a href="4234l4.html" target="_self">Listing 4</a></p><p><a href="4234l5.html" target="_self">Listing 5</a></p><p>Like port scans, ping sweeps are detectable using special
tools as well. <span   class="bold"><b>ippl</b></span> is an IP
protocol logger that can log TCP, UDP and ICMP packets. It is
similar to scanlogd, where it sits in the background and listens
for packets. Listing 6 shows a line in the log file that
demonstrates a ping packet being intercepted by ippl. Be careful
when using ippl though&mdash;if you're on a busy Ethernet network, you
might find that your ippl log files (usually at
<b  >/var/log/ippl/*</b>) may fill up rather
quickly.</p><p><a href="4234l6.html" target="_self">Listing 6</a></p><p>There are other ping detection tools available besides
ippl&mdash;unfortunately, I haven't been able to look at them in detail.
One that caught my interest was
<span   class="bold"><b>pingd</b></span>, which is a userland
d&aelig;mon that handles ICMP traffic at the host level. One neat
feature of pingd is that it integrates with TCP Wrappers to allow
you to specify who can ping you and who can't in TCP Wrappers'
access control files (/etc/hosts.allow and /etc/hosts.deny).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10cb580.0x11c4370"></a>Other Network Probe Features</h2></div></div><p>Port scans and ping sweeps are just two of many types of
network probes. Current network-probing tools have matured
significantly. Their continued development and availability means
that system administrators will see more interesting probe patterns
in the future.</p><p>To examine some of these other network probes, let's go back
to Nmap. Nmap is able to perform decoy scans. When such a scan
occurs, you'll see scans from unique IP addresses on your system,
but you won't be able to pick out which one is the real IP address
that scanned you. The point of this is to confuse the system
administrator, of course.</p><p>Besides decoy scans, Nmap also has the ability to remotely
identify the operating system running on the target machines. This
is done using a technique called TCP/IP stack fingerprinting. We
have already seen this in Listing 2, where Nmap correctly
identified my target machine as running Linux 2.1.122 - 2.2.14 (my
machine was actually running 2.2.12). At the time of writing, the
current version of Nmap (2.53) is capable of identifying 465
different versions of operating systems, routers and other devices.
Such ability is useful for the intruder because it enables the
intruder to identify the weaknesses on a machine since security
holes are usually operating system-specific.</p><p>If you're interested in other kinds of probe patterns, I
highly recommend that you read Stephen Northcutt's book (see
Resources). Fyodor's articles on port scanning and TCP/IP stack
fingerprinting in <span   class="emphasis"><em>Phrack</em></span> magazine are also
interesting.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10cb580.0x11c45d8"></a>An Ongoing Process</h2></div></div><p>I hope that this article has been useful to you in
understanding two common network probes and how they can be
detected. However, security, as always, is an ongoing process.
Network probes are going to increase, new security holes are going
to be discovered and you'll definitely read about these things in
the news almost every day. It pays to be up-to-date. For that
reason, I recommend that you subscribe to a security mailing list
(BUGTRAQ is highly recommended!) or visit newsgroups and
security-related web sites frequently.</p><p><a href="4234s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
