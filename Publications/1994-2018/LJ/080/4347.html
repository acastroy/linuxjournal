electronic device, are very sensitive to utility power quality.
According to American Power Conversion definitions (see Table 1)
power anomalies can be classified as sags (better known as
brownouts), blackouts, spikes, surges and noise. These power events
may damage your electronic equipment, or cause loss of data if
allowed to pass through the power supply to sensitive devices.
</p><p><a href="4347t1.html" target="_self">Table 1. Power
Anomalies</a></p><p>The solution for all or part of these power anomalies is to
connect an Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) to sensitive devices.
Key to the UPS' function is a battery, used like a buffer, where
power is accumulated when the utility power is normal, and released
during low-voltage or blackout events. For high-voltage events, the
UPS is usually equipped with filtering electronics that are capable
of reducing the voltage. UPS output power is guaranteed to be
sinusoidal alternating current kept within utility power
specifications.</p><p>While a UPS alone can solve the immediate problem of utility
power anomalies, when a blackout occurs the UPS' battery is used
continuously, and its discharge time is faster in proportion to the
load applied on the UPS output. Obviously, if a blackout is long
enough, the battery charge will eventually be completely exhausted
and cease to deliver power to the connected devices.</p><p>If a computer is connected to an exhausted UPS, it will
suffer a system crash due to lack of power, as if the utility power
suffered a blackout event. To overcome this problem, most UPSes on
the market today have a built-in interface to communicate their
status and to receive commands from a computer. This interface has
traditionally been a serial port, but UPSes are now being shipped
with USB interfaces.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a04580.0x1afc7c0"></a>UPS Alerts</h2></div></div><p>Because this article is about apcupsd, we will focus on
American Power Conversion (APC) brand UPSes. UPSes from other
manufacturers share the same general behavior but, to date, apcupsd
does not communicate with non-APC UPSes.</p><p>A UPS protocol must accomplish two main tasks. The first and
most important task is to asynchronously notify when power events
happen. Second, and perhaps less important, is to allow the
computer to query the UPS for status information.</p><p>Table 2 lists the UPS events that are sent by APC UPSes to
the computer through the serial line. Looking at this table, we
find that some of these events are paramount for computer integrity
during utility power anomalies.</p><p><a href="4347t2.html" target="_self">Table 2. UPS Events</a></p><p>Now let's see the most important events at work. In Figure 1,
the state machine of a UPS is described in a simplified form. When
the utility power is present, the UPS monitors it for failures. If
a failure is detected, the UPS sends a Line Fail alert to the
computer and switches itself to battery power. At this time, the
computer is powered by the UPS' battery. The UPS starts monitoring
for battery power failures. If the utility power returns, the UPS
sends a Return from Line Fail alert and switches back to utility
power. If the battery power goes down, below a security level, the
UPS sends an About to Shutdown alert and, after a defined amount of
time, switches itself off.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4347f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1. UPS State Machine</p></div></div>
</p><p>On the computer side, the alerts sent by the UPS are very
important because they can be used to decide the actions to be
executed during utility power anomalies. When the UPS switches to
batteries, it could be wise to deny user logins. When the UPS is
about to switch off, it is very important to shut down the computer
operating system. The UPS will usually switch off after a defined
delay that in some cases can even be configured, and this delay is
usually long enough to allow the computer to shut down
itself.</p><p>It is clear now why having an UPS does not mean, by itself,
that our computer is safe. To make it really safe, the computer
must constantly monitor the UPS and must be able to take actions in
response to UPS alerts.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a04580.0x1afcd40"></a>Monitoring Software: apcupsd</h2></div></div><p>APC, in its catalog, offers a number of different monitoring
software packages for its UPSes. Unfortunately, at the time we
needed it in 1996 and 1997, no APC software for Linux was
available. Nowadays there are at least four Linux products that can
be downloaded from the APC ftp server including the one described
here, apcupsd.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a04580.0x1afce48"></a>Brief History</h2></div></div><p>In late 1996, Andre M. Hedrick started a Linux project called
apcupsd, a d&aelig;mon whose purpose was to monitor APC UPSes for
power alerts and to shut down the computer when needed. Development
of this software was possible because of information gathered by
the Internet, and by directly analyzing APC's protocols.</p><p>I joined the project in October 1997 after having bought a
Smart UPS v/s 650 that I still have. However, due to old age, its
battery is now dead. (Many thanks to APC who gave me a new Smart
UPS 1400INET, allowing me to continue development of
apcupsd.)</p><p>From the beginning, apcupsd had been licensed under the GNU
Public License (GPL). The GPL license was chosen because apcupsd
was intended to be software for anyone, with full sources
distributed without charge, and with the best support its
developers were able to give.</p><p>In mid 1998, legal issues raised by APC forced Andre to
remove apcupsd from its public place and distribute it as a
binary-only package, removing the GPL license from its source code.
This caused a lot of discussion in the Internet community during
the following year.</p><p>On April 7, 1999, APC withdrew its legal objections and
started actively helping our team. This allowed apcupsd to return
to its original license. Nowadays, APC monitors our project on our
development mailing-list and gives help on technical issues.</p><p>In September 1999, Kern Sibbald joined the project. Being an
experienced software developer, he quickly became one of the main
apcupsd developers.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a04580.0x1afd108"></a>Theory of Operation</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>apcupsd</b></span>'s main task is to
monitor the UPS status continuously, and take action based on
information received from it. Of course in real life it is not so
simple.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>apcupsd</b></span> must be run at
startup time, when the operating system services are loaded: in
fact, apcupsd is just another OS service. Typically, apcupsd is run
as a d&aelig;mon (i.e. in the background) with root privileges, in
order to be able to take the actions needed to keep the computer
healthy. Usually, it is run by the system startup scripts when the
system goes multiuser.</p><p>Because of its tight relationship with the OS, the source
tree contains automated installation of startup and shutdown
scripts. During the compilation stage the apcupsd, initialization
and control scripts are customized for the local OS. Let's see
which system files are modified, and which new files are installed
by apcupsd's installation process in a SuSE Linux system.</p><p>apcupsd's main init script file is installed in:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/sbin/init.d/apcupsd
</pre><p>This script is responsible for starting up apcupsd during
system startup and shutting down apcupsd during system shutdown. It
is also symbolically linked to these paths:
<pre     class="programlisting">
/sbin/init.d/rc2.d/K20apcupsd
/sbin/init.d/rc2.d/S20apcupsd
/sbin/init.d/rc3.d/K20apcupsd
/sbin/init.d/rc3.d/S20apcupsd
</pre>


They are present only on runlevel 2 and 3 because apcupsd is run
only in multiuser runlevels; that means runlevel 2 or 3 on SuSE
Linux OS.
</p><p>To be able to shutdown the computer properly on power
failures, apcupsd relies on its own service script located
in:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/etc/apcupsd/apccontrol
</pre><p>and on a patched halt script. When apcupsd detects a
situation that needs an emergency shutdown, it first creates two
files called <b  >/etc/nologin</b> and
<b  >/etc/apcupsd/powerfail</b>.
</p><p>Then it initiates the system shutdown. apcupsd will be killed
by the system during this phase. The no login file is needed to
inhibit user logins during emergency, while the power-fail file is
needed during system shutdown. It is used by
<b  >/sbin/init.d/halt.local</b> as shown in Listing 1.
This script will be run during system shutdown after the main halt
script is run. When shutting down a computer connected to a failing
UPS, we must make sure that UPS power will be removed well after
all processes have been killed, and the system disks have been
unmounted. In order to do this, apcupsd installation modifies the
halt.local file to execute the needed actions. If the power-fail
file is present during a system shutdown, all processes are killed,
then all the local disks are remounted read-only, and finally we
send a power shutdown command to the UPS. The final effect is that,
first of all, the system is put in a safe state, and only then is
the UPS power is switched off.</p><p>The computer is switched off as well by lack of power, but
its main switch button is left in the ON position. When utility
power returns, the UPS will, after a delay to make sure the power
is stable, switch on the output power, and the computer will be
restarted automatically. No user intervention is needed during
these operations.</p><p><a href="4347l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a04580.0x1afd840"></a>Running apcupsd</h2></div></div><p>When apcupsd is run, it first initializes the serial port and
tries to determine if there is a UPS connected. Once it finds a
UPS, it spawns a number of child processes, each doing a specific
task. This is a design decision, due to the number of things that
apcupsd must do simultaneously.</p><p>The main apcupsd process creates an IPC-shared memory pool
and an IPC semaphore, then forks the apcmain task, becoming a
d&aelig;mon, before exiting. The job of apcmain is to fork all the
other asynchronous tasks, wait for child termination, and listen
for signals. It acts as a watchdog to avoid zombies or lost
signals, and it does so simply by waiting with the wait() system
call.</p><p>After becoming a d&aelig;mon, apcmain forks more processes
depending on which configuration has been selected in the
configuration file. Figure 2 shows the operations of apcupsd once
started. Let's see them in detail.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4347f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>Figure 2. Startup Actions</p></div></div>
</p><p>If the UPS is local to the computer apcupsd is running on,
the first task that is started is apcser. This task listens to the
serial port for UPS alerts, and chats with the UPS to gather all
the information needed to know the status of the UPS. In this
configuration, apcser is the most important process running on the
system, because, besides chatting with UPS, it executes all the
actions needed to run and shut down, if necessary, the computer
safely during power failures. In addition, this task generates the
reports that are written to system and private log files for
history purposes.</p><p>Also, if apcupsd is asked to act as a Network Information
Server, it will start <span   class="bold"><b>apcnis.</b></span>
apcnis is a task that accepts connections from clients on the
network and delivers information gathered from the UPS to
them.</p><p>If the UPS protecting local computer's power utility is
managed from a remote computer on the network, instead of starting
apcser, the apcmain task will start the
<span   class="bold"><b>apcslv</b></span> task. apcslv is a slave
task that sits on a socket waiting for a connection from an apcupsd
remote master. This process is the most important task of a
networked apcupsd slave. When the network master sends the UPS'
alerts to the slave, apcslv executes the same action routine
executed by apcserial. This means that a slave that receives a
battery-exhausted alert from its master will shut down the computer
to ensure data and hardware safety.</p><p>Finally, if the UPS is local and it powers a utility line
with other slave computers connected, apcupsd will start apcmst,
the master process for network alert. apcmst's task is to send, at
defined intervals, the status of the UPS to every slave configured.
Also it is very important for the slaves because if the UPS sends
alerts to the computer, apcmst bypasses the time-outs and reports
them immediately to the slaves. In this way we can make sure that
the slaves receive power alerts almost immediately.</p><p>It is interesting to note that apcupsd processes communicate
with each other through IPC shared memory areas and semaphores.
This means that apcupsd will not run on a computer where System V
IPC or some equivalent (such as memory mapped files) is not
present.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a04580.0x1af4700"></a>Apupsd Configuration</h2></div></div><p>Before running apcupsd it is necessary to configure the
d&aelig;mon to work as needed with the local hardware configuration
and the desired behavior. In a standard installation, the
configuration file is in</p><pre     class="programlisting">
 /etc/apcupsd/apcupsd.conf
</pre><p>This file is a plain ASCII file that contains all the
configuration directives needed by apcupsd.
</p><p>The directives must be properly configured before apcupsd can
operate correctly. With these directives you specify the kind of
cable, the model of UPS connected to the computer, the device where
the UPS is connected, how to operate on power failures, logging
options and much more.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a04580.0x1af4910"></a>Stand-Alone Configuration</h2></div></div><p>A typical stand-alone configuration includes a computer and a
UPS connected to its serial port.</p><p><a href="4347l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2</a></p><p>Listing 2 shows a configuration file for a stand-alone
SmartUPS connected to the first serial port of the computer. On
power failure, apcupsd will shut down the computer when the battery
level falls below 5% of full charge or the UPS remaining run-time
falls below three minutes, whichever happens first. apcupsd will
send messages to user consoles every five minutes sending the first
message one minute after the power failure occurs. apcupsd will not
disallow user logins during a power failure. UPS events are logged
in <b  >/etc/apcupsd/apcupsd.events</b>. The UPS status
can be read from our CGI interface or from
<b  >/etc/apcupsd/apcupsd.status</b>, which is updated
every minute.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a04580.0x1af4bd0"></a>Networked Configuration</h2></div></div><p>When you have a UPS that is powering more than one computer,
and you want to protect every computer from power failures, you can
configure apcupsd to work as network master/slave service. Listing
3 and 4 describe how to configure apcupsd as master and a slave in
order to shut down both in case of a power failure.</p><p><a href="4347l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3</a></p><p><a href="4347l4.html" target="_self">Listing 4</a></p><p>The master apcupsd is configured as described above in
stand-alone configuration, with the exception that the
configuration directive NETACCESS is now true and the master will
use port 6666 to communicate with slaves. The apcupsd master will
connect to the slave at my.network.slave.com in order to
communicate alerts and power events. The slave apcupsd shares the
same configuration except that instead of using the serial port, it
will listen to my.network.master.com to get all the information
needed to operate correctly.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a04580.0x1af4e90"></a>Advanced Configuration</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>apcupsd</b></span> configuration is
very flexible. But adding to this flexibility, you can also
configure your control scripts to execute customized actions, and
you can even configure your UPS eeprom to suit your needs.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a04580.0x1af4ff0"></a>Customizing apcupsd Actions</h2></div></div><p>When apcupsd detects anomalies from your UPS device, it will
make some decisions that usually result in one or more calls to the
script located in /etc/apcupsd/apccontrol. The apccontrol file is a
shell script that takes the first argument that apcupsd passes to
it to do actions. These actions are set up by default to sane
behavior for all possible situations apcupsd is likely to detect
from the UPS. Nevertheless, you can change the apccontrol behavior
for every action. To do so, simply create a file with the same name
as the action you want to customize, which is passed as the first
argument (argv[1], or $1 for shell scripts). Place your script in
the <b  >/etc/apcupsd/</b> directory. The arguments that
apccontrol can recognize are shown in Table 3.</p><p><a href="4347t3.html" target="_self">Table 3. Arguments apccontrol
Recognizes</a></p><p><a href="4347l5.html" target="_self">Listing 5</a></p><p>If, for example, you want to write your own routine for the
on-battery action, you can write your own shell script, as shown in
Listing 5, called onbattery and put it in the
<b  >/etc/apcupsd/</b> directory. Doing so will run the
customized script before the default action. In case you don't want
the default action to be taken, terminate your customized script
with an exit code of 99. If you want to write customized scripts to
replace the default behavior, you are encouraged to edit the
apccontrol script and at least mimic its behavior in your own
script. Please be aware that writing faulty scripts may cause your
system to crash during power failures.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a04580.0x1af5360"></a>Configuring the UPS eeprom</h2></div></div><p>In SmartUPSes there are at least 12 different values stored
in the eeprom that determine how the UPS reacts to various
conditions such as high line voltage, low line voltage, power down
grace periods, etc.</p><p>In general, for the moment, it is not recommended to change
eeprom values unless absolutely necessary. There have been several
reported cases of problems setting the Low Transfer Voltage.
Consequently, if at all possible, do not attempt to change this
value.</p><p>If, despite these warnings, eeprom vales must be changed, we
recommend to connect your UPS to a Windows machine running
PowerChute and making the changes.</p><p>In the absence of alternatives, eeprom values can be changed
also with apcupsd. Before doing so, it is recommended that you make
a printed copy of UPS parameters as they are before any eeprom
changes, so that they can be checked against the changes made. This
can be done by printing a copy of the output from apcaccess status
and also of the output from apcaccess eprom.</p><p>Once this is done, choose which eeprom values you want to
change. Choose the new values from the list provided by apcaccess
eprom. For the battery date, and the UPS name, you can use any
eight characters.</p><p>To make the eeprom changes with apcupsd you must first stop
the apcupsd d&aelig;mon. See &ldquo;Stopping Apcupsd&rdquo; in the
appropriate section of apcupsd manual. Then edit the appropriate
configuration directive in
<b  >/etc/apcupsd/apcupsd.conf</b>.</p><p>It is recommended to change one eeprom value at a time, by
defining only one configuration directive at a time. After each
change, check that everything is okay before proceeding to the next
value you wish to change.</p><p>To actually change the eeprom, as root with the apcupsd
d&aelig;mon stopped, enter:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
apcupsd -c
</pre><p>When it has completed the reprogramming of the eeprom, it
will print the new STATUS report. Check that you got the expected
results before continuing.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a04580.0x1af57d8"></a>Apcupsd Security Issues</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>apcupsd</b></span> runs as root. This
needs to be considered when installing the software. It needs
access to the serial port, System V IPC services and the shutdown
program.</p><p>If you have switched on the NETSERVER directive in your
apcupsd.conf file, be aware that anyone on the network can read the
status of your UPS. This may or may not be a problem. If you don't
consider this information privileged, there is little risk. In
addition, if you have a firewall between your servers and the
Internet, intruders will not have access to your UPS information.
Additionally, you can restrict access to your apcupsd server by
using the INETD services and using access control lists with a TCP
wrapper.</p><p>If you are running master/slave networking, with a single UPS
powering multiple machines, be aware that it is possible for
someone to simulate the master and send a shutdown request to all
of your slaves. The slaves do check that the network address of the
machine claiming to be the master is the same as the address
returned by DNS corresponding to the name of the master as
specified in your configuration file.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a04580.0x1af59e8"></a>apcupsd's Clients</h2></div></div><p>To ease UPS monitoring, apcupsd offers quite a lot of client
facilities. We have already seen apcaccess, the output of which can
be seen in Listing 6. apcaccess is the main client tool for
monitoring UPS status.</p><p><a href="4347l6.html" target="_self">Listing 6</a></p><p>Another console-based client is powerflute that can be used
to monitor the UPS status continuously as seen in Figure 3.</p><p>In Figure 4 another useful client for networked apcupsd is
shown. It is the CGI interface that was integrated into apcupse and
enhanced by Kern. If you want to be able to view UPS status from
the Web, this is the best choice. Figure 5 shows the status of the
UPSes connected to Kern's main server
(<a href="http://www.sibbald.com/cgi-bin/multimon.cgi" target="_self">www.sibbald.com/cgi-bin/multimon.cgi</a>).</p><p>
