    The continuing dominance of Intel processors is pushing RISC system
    out of the server market.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13bf580.0x14b75b0"></a></h2></div></div><p> One of the great advantages of Linux is
that it runs on practically any processor you can find. Most
competing flavors of UNIX are limited to a single CPU architecture.
But in the server world, processor choices are diminishing. While
this may not hurt Linux, it certainly doesn't help. These changes
have been driven by Intel, which would love to turn the server
market into a clone of the PC market, with hundreds of vendors
selling similar systems based on Intel silicon.
</p><p>Although far more PCs than servers are sold each year, the
revenue from these two markets is actually similar, since servers
are much more expensive, and have higher profit margins. So if
Intel can grab its typical share of those profits (that is, most of
them), it would be a great coup for the company.</p><p>So far, this strategy is off to a great start. In 1998, Intel
launched a one-two punch, introducing its first Xeon processors
designed exclusively for servers and disclosing the design of its
Itanium processor for very large servers. With the exception of
Sun, all major server vendors quickly adopted a two-track strategy,
offering customers the choice of either Intel-based systems or
systems using in-house RISC processors. The problem is that
customers, for the most part, have been choosing the Intel-based
systems, which use standard operating systems (Windows 2000 or
Linux) and offer compatibility with systems from a variety of
vendors. The RISC systems tend to be more expensive and rely on
proprietary UNIX operating systems. Intel now holds nearly all of
the market for low-cost servers (under $10,000) and more than half
of the market for more expensive systems.</p><p>This market shift has left the RISC vendors with less revenue
to support their processor lines. During the same period, high-end
microprocessor designs have become more complex, requiring a
greater investment to develop new products. With these two trends
moving in opposite directions, Compaq, HP and SGI have slowed the
pace of their RISC architectures (Alpha, PA-RISC and MIPS,
respectively) to the point that they have fallen behind Xeon in
performance on many key applications. This decline has caused a
downward spiral in sale for the RISC vendors.</p><p>As a result, HP and SGI have already announced they will
eventually discontinue their RISC lines, and Compaq is likely to
follow suit. IBM continues to invest in its PowerPC line, but the
bulk of the company's servers rely on Intel processors. At the
recent Microprocessor Forum, the CPU industry's premiere event, IBM
was the only one of these four companies to present a paper on a
future RISC processor.</p><p>Sun has avoided this slippery slope by focusing exclusively
on its SPARC/Solaris platform, and the company has never been
healthier. But even with about 20% market share for servers above
$10,000, the company is having problems developing new processors.
It recently rolled out its UltraSparc-3 processor nearly two years
behind schedule and announced an 18- to 24-month delay in its plans
for UltraSparc-4 and UltraSparc-5. Intel solves this problem by
leveraging the same processor designs between its PC line and its
server line. Thus, it can invest far more than any other company in
the design of its processors. As CPU designs become more complex,
this level of investment is needed to maintain
competitiveness.</p><p>Even as Intel dominates the processor market, it splits the
market between two different architectures: Xeon and Itanium. But
so far, Itanium has been a dud. After many delays, the new
processor should finally appear in systems over the next few
months. But sources indicate its performance is disappointing, and
most vendors are sticking with Xeon. Intel's new Pentium IV
technology will appear in the Xeon line in early 2001, giving that
line a further boost. Meanwhile, Itanium's hopes are pinned on a
next-generation version that isn't likely to appear until 2002.
Until then, Itanium will be a niche player.</p><p>AMD is gearing up to push its Athlon processor into the
server market. If AMD succeeds, this move will put pressure on
Intel to cut Xeon's price and boost its performance, much as the
company was forced to react to Athlon in the PC market this year.
Since Athlon and Xeon both use the same x86 instruction set, AMD's
entry will strengthen that platform and make it even more
successful than it is today.</p><p>Thus, for the next few years, Xeon and compatible processors
will power the vast majority of servers. This convergence benefits
Microsoft, which is focused exclusively on that platform, and takes
away one of Linux's selling points. Linux must go head-to-head with
Microsoft in features and performance to continue its gains in the
server market.</p></div></div>
