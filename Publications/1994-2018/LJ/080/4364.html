latest offerings for new Linux users from IDG, the Dummies company.
This yellow box contains three CDs and a 128-page installation
booklet. The CDs contain Caldera OpenLinux 2.3, StarOffice 5.1a and
two e-books in PDF format: Caldera OpenLinux for Dummies and
StarOffice for Linux for Dummies. Adobe Acrobat Reader 4.0 for
Linux is also provided. For this review, I'll focus on installing
the software and using the booklet as Caldera OpenLinux and
StarOffice have been reviewed in more detail in other
articles.</p><p>The installation booklet is written by Jon &ldquo;maddog&rdquo; Hall
and Nick Wells and leads the reader through the installation of
OpenLinux and StarOffice. The booklet provides clear instructions
accompanied by numerous screen shots, which guide the reader
through the installation process.</p><p>The booklet's first chapters show the reader how to determine
what hardware their machine contains and how to make room for Linux
if they want to share the system with Windows. Instructions for
using Partition Magic CE and FIPS to repartition a Windows hard
drive to make space for Linux are provided, but Partition Magic CE
is not included with this package.</p><p>Once the hardware has been determined and the hard drive
configured, the booklet leads the reader through the installation
of OpenLinux. The installation chapter contains screen shots of
Caldera's Lizard installation program in action along with
step-by-step instructions guiding the reader through the install
process.</p><p>Following the Linux installation instructions is a chapter
detailing the programs that can be used to configure
<span   class="emphasis"><em>X</em></span> if it wasn't configured properly during
installation. The Caldera lizardx program is covered along with the
XF86Setup and xf86config programs.</p><p>After the installation and <span   class="emphasis"><em>X</em></span>
troubleshooting chapters is a chapter on using Caldera OpenLinux
for the first time. It briefly covers such things as booting the
computer, using the KDE desktop, adding users, changing passwords
and shutting the system down.</p><p>The final chapter in the booklet covers the installation and
starting of StarOffice. The chapter provides step-by-step
instructions for installing and starting StarOffice but not for
using it. While a brief introduction to the StarOffice applications
is provided here, using StarOffice is covered in the StarOffice for
Dummies e-book.</p><p>The two e-books on CD 3 are meant to provide more information
for new users. In addition to more installation information, the
Caldera OpenLinux for Dummies e-book contains all the chapters that
could be expected in a beginner's Linux book. There are chapters on
the Linux file system, text editing, the BASH shell, connecting to
the Internet, getting more information about Linux and
troubleshooting.</p><p>The StarOffice for Linux for Dummies e-book covers the
features of the StarOffice suite. The first section of the book
introduces the reader to the StarOffice desktop and applications,
while the following sections cover the office applications in
greater detail. StarOffice is a fully featured office suite
containing the following applications: StarWriter for word
processing, StarCalc for spreadsheets, StarDraw for drawing,
StarImpress for creating slide shows, StarSchedule for keeping
track of events, StarBase for creating databases, an address book,
and web, e-mail and newsgroup capabilities. The e-book contains
plenty of screen shots and examples of the applications in
action.</p><p>While the e-books contain plenty of information at a minimal
cost with low shelf-space requirements, they are a little clumsy to
use. It is difficult to read a book page-by-page on a computer
screen, and if you need to use the OpenLinux e-book to help with
installation, you will either need a second computer or have to
keep rebooting into Windows.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux in a Box</em></span> doesn't include the
Windows version of the reader, so Windows users might have to
download it before they can view the manuals before they install
OpenLinux.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux in a Box for Dummies</em></span> provides a
very capable system with OpenLinux and StarOffice along with two
complete e-books. The installation booklet, while short, provides
step-by-step instructions and screen shots, and the choice of
Caldera's OpenLinux with its Lizard installation program makes
installing OpenLinux quite easy. The e-books help new users of both
Linux and StarOffice. New Linux users, who have access to a
knowledgeable Linux friend, or experienced Linux users looking to
get OpenLinux and StarOffice at a good price, should find this
package a very attractive offering.</p></div></div>
