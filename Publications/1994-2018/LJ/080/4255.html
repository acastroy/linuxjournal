complement each other. That doesn't mean they are the same
quality&mdash;just that they cover different things in the same area.
</p><p>Before you ask, &ldquo;Why PHP?&rdquo;, let me answer. While there has
been a lot of web development in Perl, and Python is growing in
this area, PHP is a tool designed specifically for dynamic web
development. That, along with its C-like syntax, makes it an easy
choice for a programmer wanting to add dynamic web content
generation to their tool kit.</p><p>As a general comment about both books, they claim to cover
PHP4. This is pretty much true because PHP4 is not very different
from PHP3. This is actually good news because most existing PHP
applications are still in PHP3, and a book that didn't cover PHP3
would be relatively useless.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb7f580.0xc78210"></a>PHP Essentials</h2></div></div><p>This is the introductory book of the pair. It introduces PHP
and works through many examples all the way to setting up an
e-commerce site. Three of the eight chapters deal with databases in
general and MySQL specifically. As the power of PHP comes from how
it interacts with a database, this makes complete sense.</p><p>Once you get comfortable with what PHP is, the most important
part of the book is the Essential PHP Language Reference in
Appendix A. This appendix starts off with an introduction PHP
syntax, and then covers all the built-in functions available to the
PHP programmer. This section is well written and can act as a
decent reference even for a newcomer to PHP.</p><p>When I finished reading this book, I felt I had the knowledge
to go off and write some serious PHP code. Fortunately, instead of
writing code, I read the other book.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb7f580.0xc783c8"></a>Web Application Development with PHP 4.0</h2></div></div><p>This book is the real winner of the pair. By that, I mean it
goes well beyond my expectations for any book on any programming
language. New Riders seems to be on a roll with their recent
language books, as the last one I reviewed, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Python
Essential Reference</em></span>, was also a winner.</p><p>This is not a beginning PHP book and certainly not a
beginning programming book. In the introduction, they state that
the target audience is PHP programmers who want to take their
skills to the next level, know other programming languages or want
to extend PHP's feature set. I think they are correct with this
statement.</p><p>This book is organized into nine chapters, each designed to
extend your knowledge in a particular direction. The first chapter
deals with development concepts. With over 30 years of programming
experience in a dozen or more languages under my belt, I
immediately wanted to skip this chapter. Fortunately, they
anticipated this and included a sidebar titled &ldquo;Why You Should
Read This Section&rdquo;. Okay, they were right. Too often, we want to
get to the fun part&mdash;writing code. This first chapter sets the
whole tone for the book, showing us the significant benefits of
doing the design work first.</p><p>The next chapter, titled &ldquo;Advanced Syntax&rdquo;, introduces
concepts such as classes, which can be ignored in basic programming
but make your life a lot easier when you get into serious
development. Chapters three through five deal with application
design presenting concepts you need to think about, with code to
fill in the blanks. Not quick reading but clearly a good
investment.</p><p>Chapter six gets into database access. Like <span   class="emphasis"><em>PHP
Essentials</em></span>, this book also concentrates on MySQL, but
the presentation is very different. PHPLib is introduced, and
readers are shown how to develop an application that is
database-independent. PHPLib adds a level of abstraction for other
interfaces as well as the database, and this chapter convinced me
that using this library can amount to huge savings in development
time.</p><p>Chapter seven goes on to use PHPLib to develop a knowledge
repository. Note that all this code is on the included CD along
with PHP, MySQL, Apache, TurboLinux, PostgreSQL and even the entire
book as a PDF document. This chapter also includes an overview of
XML and how it can be used to benefit the developer.</p><p>Chapter eight presents some PHP success stories, useful
information that could also be used to convince your boss that PHP
is real and does solve real problems. The final chapter shows how
PHP can be extended.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb7f580.0xc78790"></a>Conclusions</h2></div></div><p>If you are doing serious PHP development, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Web
Application Development with PHP 4.0</em></span> is essential. It
will make the difference between &ldquo;my program finally works&rdquo; and
&ldquo;I feel good about my program&rdquo;. <span   class="emphasis"><em>PHP
Essentials</em></span>, while not a great book, offers needed
information to get you up to speed. What's missing in sophisticated
programming is made up for in terms of the ease at which it can be
read and its value as a language reference.</p></div></div>
