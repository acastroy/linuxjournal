    Tim walks us through a simple web application to demonstrate the
    features of PHP and PostgresSQL.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26ae580.0x27a6608"></a></h2></div></div><p>It wasn't long ago that to build a
serious web application with ease meant laying out serious cash for
a Cold Fusion license, a proprietary database like Sybase, and a
Sun server. Fortunately, those days are long over. With the vast
reach of Apache and recent maturation of free databases, there are
realistic, perhaps superior, alternatives to proprietary software.
</p><p>The best of the open-source breed is PHP, a scripting
language that could be likened to Perl; and PostgreSQL, a powerful
object-relational database. When you put PHP and PostgreSQL
together, you can build anything from a simple guest book to a vast
web-based accounting application. PHP provides the brains while
Postgres provides the brawn.</p><p>I'm going to introduce a very basic PHP shopping cart and
inventory application that takes advantage of Postgres' transaction
ability. You can download the source code and read other tutorials
on my web site, PHPBuilder.com.</p><p>The first thing I want to cover is the structure of the
application. In every web application I build with PHP, I start by
setting up a comprehensive library, which gets included on every
page throughout the site. This library will be called common.php
and stored in a directory called include.</p><p>Our library will handle routine tasks for us, such as setting
up a connection to the database, figuring out who the user is,
setting up the header/footer of the site, etc. By keeping these
functions in one place, our application will be much cleaner and
easier to maintain. For example, rather than hardcoding a database
connection on every page, we code it once in the library.</p><p><a href="4343l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1. Sample Library
Coding</a></p><p>There, the first rev of our library is already useful. It
connects us to the database and provides a simple HTML abstraction
for us. As our site HTML grows more complex, we can include most of
it in <b  >site_header/site_footer</b> and have the
changes apply throughout our entire application.</p><p>The library also includes a simple abstraction layer for
issuing Postgres queries. I do this simply to reduce the amount of
code I have to write.</p><p>And finally, we make a call to PHP4's built-in session
management code. Calling <b  >session_start</b> will
cause PHP4 to reload any variables that you registered so they are
available to the rest of your application.</p><p>Each page on our site will look fundamentally like
this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;?php&lt;\n&gt;
//include the common library
require ($DOCUMENT_ROOT.'/include/common.php');
echo site_header('Example Page');
/*
        page logic
*/
echo site_footer();
?&gt;
</pre><p>Generally, when building an application, it's wise to
separate the heavy-lifting logic from the actual presentation (in
this case, HTML) as much as possible. I generally do this by
wrapping logic inside of function calls, which are then included
and called from the pages throughout your site. The reason is that
you may eventually want to build different interfaces for your
applications&mdash;perhaps an extremely lightweight interface for
wireless applications. If the logic were interwoven with the HTML
presentation, you would have to duplicate the logic to create
another interface. If it's separated into function libraries, both
interfaces can reuse the same logic.
</p><p>The problem with function calls in PHP is that there is no
standard exception-handling process. If there is an internal error
in a function, how does the calling code know and pass that
information to a user? In other languages, like Java for example,
you would throw an exception inside of your functions (methods in
Java). When you call the method, you would wrap it in a try/catch
statement and handle the problem accordingly.</p><p>I generally solve this problem in PHP by always returning
either true or false from a function call, and setting a global
variable called <b  >$feedback</b>. The result is then
testable and <b  >$feedback</b> can be printed to the
screen if needed. There is an effort underway called PEAR
(<a href="http://pear.php.net" target="_self">http://pear.php.net/</a>),
which is making an attempt at standardizing error handling and
database access, among other things, but nothing is concrete
yet.</p><p>Here is an example of how you can call functions using my
true/false method:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;?php&lt;\n&gt;
$result=function_call_name();
if (!$result) {
        //there was an error-display it
        echo $feedback;
} else {
        //continue on with success
}
?&gt;
</pre><p>Now let's start thinking about our shopping cart. We need a
few fundamental data structures to let us store our shopping cart
data. For starters, we need an inventory database that lists item
name, part number, price, and quantity on hand. We'll also need to
keep track of our customers and the items the customer is
purchasing. That's as complex as we'll get here.
</p><p><a href="4343l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2. Shopping Cart Data
Structures</a></p><p>That should be enough to give us a rudimentary shopping cart.
To normalize our database schema, I created a separate table that
lists the contents of a customer's cart. This lets a customer have
multiple items in their cart while allowing us to easily join the
cart contents with the inventory database.</p><p>Now we need to think about the actions the various functions
of an on-line store. The most basic functions include getting a new
cart, adding items to that cart, then checking out. A real on-line
store will need a lot more, such as the ability to browse the
items, adjust quantities, etc., but I'll leave those features up to
you.</p><p>I'll start with a simple function call to create a new
customer. All that really entails is getting the next value out of
the customer sequence we created, inserting that into a new record
in the customer table, then registering that number in PHP4's
built-in session management code.</p><p><a href="4343l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3. Creating a New
Customer</a></p><p>That took a little more code than I would have liked, but it
shows you how to start and terminate a transaction in Postgres
properly and how to check each query for errors. I will use the
same routine error checks throughout all my code, and you should as
well.</p><p>Always plan out how you will handle the situation when a
query fails. Will you terminate your script outright, try the query
again or just go on as if nothing happened? Carefully consider the
consequences of each option. For example, if you fail to get the
next <b  >customer_id</b>, you can't really go on to
create a new customer record. If creating the customer record
fails, you can't later update her address information or add items
to her cart. Logical, right?</p><p>Now let's look at the process for adding items to a cart.
This too is relatively easy. Before inserting an item into the
cart, we should first check that the item exists in the database.
This is considered best practice, since the item number will be
coming in from a web browser, and could have been tampered
with.</p><p>Once we know that the item exists, we can then test to see if
it's already in the cart. If it is in the cart, increment the
quantity, rather than insert another row. If it is not in the cart
already, insert it into the shopping cart with a default quantity
of one.</p><p><a href="4343l4.html" target="_self">Listing 4. Adding Items to a
Cart</a></p><p>Now we can create new customers and they can add items to
their carts. Now we just need to be able to check out from the
store and reduce the store inventory at the same time. This is the
most complex part of the entire store and makes good use of
Postgres' transaction and advanced-locking scheme.</p><p>To start, we will make use of Postgres' SELECT...FOR UPDATE
syntax, which effectively locks selected rows so you can update
them and commit your changes within a transaction.</p><p>By using this syntax within a transaction, you can guarantee
that your data stays consistent. With some databases, like MySQL,
you can't easily lock specific rows of data to prevent other
processes from decrementing the inventory while you are also trying
to do the same. What you wind up with is inaccurate numbers and a
useless inventory count.</p><p>This query will also make use of subselects, another standard
feature on the more powerful databases available. Subselects allow
you to basically tie two queries together into one to make your
life easier.</p><p>After we lock the rows, we need to issue a query to decrement
the inventory count for each item in our cart. For simplicity's
sake, we won't warn of lack of inventory, but we will successfully
set the <b  >item_count</b> negative if we fall below a 0
inventory level. You could then set up an admin page to view items
with a negative inventory balance and order fresh inventory.</p><p>And finally, we will want to update the customer's table with
the visitor's credit card, shipping info, and total sale amount,
and then destroy the customer's session from PHP4.</p><p><a href="4343l5.html" target="_self">Listing 5. Checking Out and Reducing
Inventory</a></p><p>Now that's a reasonably complex transaction, each step of
which must execute properly. If it doesn't, the entire transaction
must be rolled back to put everything back in the proper
order.</p><p>If you didn't have the luxury of transactions in this
example, and a query failed in the middle of updating one of the
inventory items, you would be in a lot of trouble. You'd have part
of your inventory updated and part not updated. If the visitor
retried the page, how would you know which inventory items to
decrement again? The answer is, you wouldn't, and you would wind up
with an inaccurate inventory.</p><p>This article by no means provides a comprehensive shopping
cart solution&mdash;I could probably write an entire book on that, if I
had the time. It does, however, lay the groundwork, and demonstrate
the design and execution methodology that I recommend for every web
developer. For further information and discussion, visit
PHPBuilder.com.</p><p>Some of the pieces that I'm leaving out include pages to view
the cart contents and the ability to view items in the store. Those
pieces, along with all the code here, are available in a .zip file,
along with a discussion/comment board;
