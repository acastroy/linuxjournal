    The benefits of SISAL and a call for action.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ac5580.0x1bbd5b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>Back in the misty, early days of
computing, famed computer scientist John Backus invented a
programming language called Fortran. Given his other
accomplishments, most computer scientists have probably forgiven
him for this. After all, how was he to know that his invention
would grow into a Frankenstein, sweeping away all attempts to
replace it with more pleasant and useful tools?
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ac5580.0x1bbd6b8"></a>Functional Languages</h2></div></div><p>Later, Backus became interested in <span   class="emphasis"><em>functional
languages</em></span>. The best way to explain what a functional
language does is to show you one that isn't. Let's look at the
following C code:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
int increment_me(int deposit){
  static int balance = 0;
  balance = balance + deposit;
  if (balance &lt; 0) {
    fprintf(stderr,"Balance negative!\n");
  }
  return(balance);
}
</pre><p>This C function keeps track of your bank balance by adding
deposits to your account and subtracting withdrawals (negative
deposits). It also gives a warning if you overdraw your account.
Your balance is initially assumed to be zero. Subsequent calls add
to or subtract from this balance. In addition, a warning is given
if you reach a negative balance.
</p><p><b  >Increment_me</b> is a function in the C
language sense, but it is not a function in the mathematical sense.
A mathematical function, like sine or logarithm, gives the same
answer to a particular question each time you ask it. For instance,
the sine of 90 degrees is always one. In contrast,
<b  >increment_me</b> stores your current balance
internally, which means that the result returned from calling it
depends on the results of previous calls.</p><p>It is easy to turn <b  >increment_me</b> into a
true mathematical function by rewriting it as follows:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
int increment_me(int deposit, int balance){
  balance = balance + deposit;
  if (balance &lt; 0) {
    fprintf(stderr,"Balance negative!\n");
  }
  return(balance);
}
</pre><p>You, rather than <b  >increment_me</b>, have to
keep track of your bank balance in this version, but at least this
C function is now also a mathematical function&mdash;it always gives the
same answer to a particular question!
</p><p>What are the advantages of the functional structure of this
routine? Suppose <b  >increment_me</b> is part of a
complex accounting system, keeping track of many different
balances. In this case, storing a single balance inside the C
function would not get the job done since the function would only
work for that particular account. Furthermore, if some other aspect
of the accounting system needed to access your balance, it could
not do it in the original version of
<b  >increment_me</b>, since the balance is buried in the
function.</p><p>What is the downside of the new version of
<b  >increment_me</b>? Suppose
<b  >increment_me</b> were ten levels down in a stack of
C function calls. Then, it would be a considerable nuisance to
transfer the balance in which you are interested downward through
this stack. One might be tempted to use the C language
global-variable capability instead:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
global int balance;int increment_me(int deposit)
{
  balance = balance + deposit;
  if (balance &lt; 0) {
    fprintf(stderr,"Balance negative!\n");
  }
  return(balance);
}
</pre><p>This way, anyone anywhere in the system could insert the
balance for a particular account in the global variable
<b  >balance</b> and initiate the cascade of calls that
eventually results in <b  >increment_me</b> being called
and the balance being incremented.
</p><p>What is wrong with this way of doing things? Non-locality. If
something goes wrong, do you blame it on a bug in our humble
function, or is the error somewhere else in the system? If you have
ever dealt with this kind of a program, you know that it can be
very difficult to debug.</p><p>Functional programs avoid these problems by following three
rules:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Functions do not remember anything about previous
invocations.</p></li><li><p>Functions do not change their calling
arguments.</p></li><li><p>Functions do not access global variables.</p></li></ol></div><p>Such functions are said to be free of <span   class="emphasis"><em>side
effects</em></span>. Functional languages are languages that enforce
these restrictions. Examples of partially functional languages are
the venerable Lisp language and its derivatives such as Scheme, and
the language ML. Haskell and the original version of Lisp are
purely functional.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ac5580.0x1bbe2c0"></a>SISAL and Parallel Computing at LLNL</h2></div></div><p>The advent of parallel computers introduced a whole new set
of problems to the world of computing, the main one being how to
divide up a task so that multiple processors can make progress on
it simultaneously. Attempts to devise automatic parallelizing
compilers for ordinary languages have met with mixed success. The
objective is to define sub-tasks so that the flow of data between
them is minimized since typically the communication bandwidth
between individual processors in a parallel computer is limited.
This is difficult in ordinary languages since the flow of data is
immensely complicated by the existence of global variables and side
effects&mdash;witness our third example of
<b  >increment_me</b>.</p><p>Enter a team of computer scientists led by James McGraw of
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. In 1985 they invented a
functional language called SISAL for the specific purpose of
parallelizing scientific numerical calculations. The functional
nature of the language allowed the compiler to trace the flow of
data through the program, and therefore, to make intelligent
decisions as to how to split up the work between processors in
parallel computers.</p><p>Functional behavior on the procedure level, as in our
procedure for incrementing or decrementing one's bank balance, was
still insufficient for their purposes. In order to obtain
sufficiently fine-grained information about data flow, they needed
to make <span   class="emphasis"><em>every program statement</em></span> functional in
a mathematical sense. To understand the implications of this
requirement, notice that commonly used programming statements of
the form:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
a = a + 1
</pre><p>would be illegal in such a language since in mathematics a
variable such as <span   class="emphasis"><em>a</em></span> cannot be both the input
and output in an explicit function definition. One would have to
write instead:
<pre     class="programlisting">
b = a + 1.
</pre>


The implication is that variables can have a value assigned to them
once and only once. That's why the language is called SISAL, the
Streams and Iteration in a Single Assignment Language. The bit
about &ldquo;single assignment&rdquo; refers to the above characteristic of
the language. The obvious challenge is how to do iteration in such
a language. &ldquo;Streams&rdquo; refers to an abstraction that was meant to
be used in the language for input-output processes, but this was
never developed.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ac5580.0x1bbe688"></a>Everything Is a Function Definition</h2></div></div><p>The single assignment nature of SISAL makes its use very
different from commonly used languages such as C and Fortran. It
also gives SISAL a steep, though short, learning curve, especially
for those used to conventional programming techniques.</p><p>The key is to stop thinking in terms of a computer as a set
of memory cells alterable at will by a sequence of instructions.
Instead, think of SISAL as a nested sequence of mathematical
definitions. One example is familiar to C programmers. A normal if
statement in C might run something like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
if (i &gt; 0) {  a = i;
}
else {
  a = -i;
}
</pre><p>We recognize this as <span   class="emphasis"><em>assigning</em></span> the
absolute value of <b  >i</b> to <b  >a</b>.
However, an alternate form of the C language if statement is the
assigned if, which accomplishes the same thing:
<pre     class="programlisting">
a = if i &gt; 0 ? i : -i;
</pre>


This is much closer to the spirit of the corresponding SISAL
statement:
<pre     class="programlisting">
a := if (i &gt; 0) then i else -i end if;
</pre>


Returning to the two types of C language ifs, notice that the first
form is subject to a possible error which, though it is
syntactically correct, is probably not what you want to do; just
drop the <b  >else {a = -i;}</b> clause! This is still
legal C, but it leaves the variable <b  >a</b> undefined
when <b  >i &lt;= 0</b>. Such an error is simply not
possible in SISAL, or in the second type of C language if, because
all possibilities must be considered for the statement to be
syntactically correct.
</p><p>The assigned if in C is quite limited in power. For instance,
if several assignments need to be done, then several assigned ifs
need to be created, and the logical test is repeated for each
assignment. In SISAL one simply does the following:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
a, b, c := if (i &gt; 0) then             expression for a,
             expression for b,
             expression for c
           else
             alternate expression for a,
             alternate expression for b,
             alternate expression for c
           end if;
</pre><p>Alternatively, if it takes more than a simple expression to
compute a result, then something like the following construct may
be used:
<pre     class="programlisting">
a := if (i &gt; 0) then       let
         x = ...;
         y = ...;
       in
         if (x &gt; y) then x else y end if
       end let
     else
       ...
     end if;
</pre>


The <b  >let...in...end let</b> construct allows us to
replace a simple expression with an arbitrarily complex
calculation.
</p><p>How do we get around the single assignment provision in
iteration? Let's first see what the problem is. A loop in C that
computes the cumulative sum of the array <b  >a</b> might
take the form:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
b[0] = a[0];i = 1;
while (i &lt; n) {
  b[i] = b[i - 1] + a[i - 1];
  i = i + 1;
}
</pre><p>Note the presence of our now-banished friend <b  >i = i +
1</b>. All loops in C and similar languages have some
construct like this, whether it is implicit or explicit. However,
as we have noted, such a construct is illegal in SISAL. In
addition, the array <b  >b</b> is assigned to
<b  >n</b> times, which also violates the single
assignment nature of SISAL. In SISAL we do the following:
<pre     class="programlisting">
b := for initial       i := 0;
       bvalue := a[0];
     while (i &lt; n - 1) repeat
       i := old i + 1;
       bvalue := old bvalue + a[i];
     returns
       array of bvalue
     end for;
</pre>


The for initial clause is executed once, setting up the initial
definitions of <b  >i</b> and <b  >bvalue</b>.
Then the loop is begun. Each time the loop hits the while
statement, the variable <b  >i</b> is renamed
<b  >old i</b> and <b  >bvalue</b> is renamed
<b  >old bvalue</b>, leaving the names
<b  >i</b> and <b  >bvalue</b> unassigned and
ready to be reused. Finally, after the looping is finished, the
<b  >returns</b> clause gathers up the values of
<b  >bvalue</b>, including that from the <b  >for
initial</b> clause, and returns them as an array. While this
way of doing loops is really a bit of a slight-of-hand for a single
assignment language, it again satisfies the goal of keeping data
dependencies explicit. The existence of an old clause clearly
indicates that values produced in a loop depend on values generated
in the previous iteration of the loop.
</p><p>An alternate looping construct is available if computations
in later iterations do not depend on results from earlier
iterations. For instance, to multiply every third element of an
array <b  >a</b> by <b  >-1</b>, SISAL does the
following:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
newa := for i in 0:n - 1          a1 := if (mod(i,3) = 0) then
                  -a[i]
                else
                  a[i]
                end if;
        returns
          array of a1
        end for;
</pre><p>If a loop can be cast in this form, it makes parallelization
trivial since each branch of the loop can be executed by a
different processor with no intercommunication between processors.
</p><p>A complete SISAL function takes the form:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
function fun_name(argument_list returns return_list)  expression, expression, ...
end function
</pre><p>The argument list specifies the names and types of all
arguments. For instance, an argument list containing two integers
named <b  >i</b> and <b  >j</b> followed by a
real array named <b  >a</b> would be specified
<b  >i, j: integer; a: array[real];</b>. A return list
consisting of two real arrays would look like <b  >array[real],
array[real]</b>. The expression can be simple or complex,
involving let, for, if or other statements. The number of
expressions in the body of the function must match the number of
returned values.
</p><p>In addition to the basic types boolean, character, integer,
real and double_real, there are compound types array, stream (like
an array, but elements accessed sequentially), record (like a C
structure) and union. Each of the compound types can, with minor
restriction, consist of either simple or compound types. For
instance, a two-dimensional array in SISAL is simply an array of
arrays.</p><p>All variables are dynamically allocated, and variable types
are determined from context. User-defined types are declared with
statements like:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
type oner = array[real];type complex = record[u: real_part; v: imag_part];
type complex_array = array[complex];
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ac5580.0x1bb61a8"></a>SISAL Prevents Many Mistakes</h2></div></div><p>SISAL turns out to be a very safe language to use. Compared
to C, I invariably find that I am much farther along the road to a
working program with SISAL when the code first compiles
successfully. SISAL has many conventional safety features, such as
strict type checking, prototyping of external functions and array
bounds checking. Arrays carry information with them on array length
and starting value of the array index. Multidimensional arrays are
actually arrays of arrays, so bounds checking works individually
for each index as well as for the array as a whole. Since bounds
checking slows program execution, it can be turned off when
debugging is finished.</p><p>SISAL derives much additional safety from its functional and
single assignment natures. As I showed above, undefined
alternatives in if statements are impossible in SISAL. I find that
this has the effect of forcing one to think through an algorithm
very thoroughly as one is coding the program. Thus, coding a SISAL
program often takes more time than coding the first round of the
equivalent C program, but the extra effort pays off a hundred-fold
in the debugging stage and in a better understanding of the
calculation.</p><p>Speaking of debugging, conventional debuggers such as
<span   class="bold"><b>gdb</b></span> don't work well with SISAL, so
the developers of the language provided its own debugger,
<span   class="bold"><b>sdbx</b></span>. In addition, the &ldquo;peek&rdquo;
function allows one to examine the value of variables during
program execution.</p><p>In many ways SISAL is easier to debug than conventional
languages, due to its functional and single assignment natures.
However, certain behaviors take a bit of getting used to. For
instance, in the function:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
function polar(x, y: real; returns real)  let
    r := sqrt(x*x + y*y);
    theta := atan(y/x);
  in
    r
  end let
end function
</pre><p>all traces of the variable <b  >theta</b>
disappear. Since the computation of this variable contributes
nothing to the final answer, <b  >r</b>, the statement
generating <b  >theta</b> is dead code and is removed by
the SISAL optimizer. This gives rise to an iron-clad rule in SISAL:
if a calculation doesn't contribute to the final result, it is
ruthlessly eliminated. If the value of <b  >theta</b> is
really needed in the above function, then it should be included in
the output by changing the function definition to
<b  >...returns real, real)</b> and the
<b  >r</b> in the in clause to <b  >r,
theta</b>. Otherwise the computation of
<b  >theta</b> should be deleted from the code.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ac5580.0x1bb67d8"></a>Execution Speed and the OSC Compiler</h2></div></div><p>If this were all there were to SISAL, it would be an elegant,
but useless language. Since new variables are created for every
assignment, any significant SISAL program would be one giant memory
leak. This is particularly significant when it comes to arrays. In
SISAL, a completely new array is apparently created each time an
element of an array is changed!</p><p>I say apparently, because the back end of LLNL's SISAL
compiler, <span   class="bold"><b>osc</b></span>, is quite good at
optimizing away the horrid inefficiencies of single assignment
semantics. This, in fact, is the major contribution of the SISAL
development team. osc first converts the SISAL code into an
intermediate form called &ldquo;IF1&rdquo;. This intermediate code is then
extensively massaged before being converted into either C or
Fortran code. Thus, SISAL is really a fancy C (or Fortran)
preprocessor, which means that it is quite portable, in
nonparallelizing form to architectures with a good C compiler, such
as <span   class="bold"><b>gcc</b></span>. Virtually any UNIX or
Linux system will compile SISAL code in single processor mode. The
developers of osc claim that optimized SISAL code typically
executes within 20% of the time required by the same algorithm
coded directly in C or Fortran, and my experience with the language
supports this claim. Interestingly, a fast Fourier transform
routine written in SISAL by John Feo of LLNL actually ran
<span   class="emphasis"><em>faster</em></span> in parallel mode on a Cray computer
than Cray's own parallel fast Fourier transform routine, even
though it was slightly slower in single processor mode.</p><p>Creating parallel SISAL code is somewhat more difficult.
SISAL needs a C or Fortran compiler and an underlying operating
system that implements parallelism in order to produce parallel
code. Given the wide variety of parallel system types, and the
variety of custom interfaces to these systems, porting SISAL to a
new parallel system is not trivial. Thus, even though Linux now has
symmetric multiprocessing available, I have not attempted to make
SISAL use it.</p><p>Scientists and engineers often write computer programs that
take advantage of libraries of useful code. These libraries are
almost always written in Fortran. The importance of such libraries
is often cited as a reason for not migrating away from
Fortran.</p><p>SISAL bows to this reality by providing interfaces to both
Fortran and C. The connection goes both ways; SISAL can call C and
Fortran routines, and C and Fortran can call SISAL routines. The
Fortran interface is more developed than the C interface, which is
somewhat dismaying to Fortran-averse folk like me, but the good
news is that C can easily be used to emulate Fortran code, thus
allowing C programs to take advantage of the Fortran
interface.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ac5580.0x1bb6b48"></a>SISAL Input-Output</h2></div></div><p>The natural way to do input and output in a functional
language is to funnel input through the argument list of the
top-level function and funnel output through function return
values. The SISAL developers took this conservative approach,
designing a special input-output system called FIBRE. FIBRE
represents primitive types, arrays, records, etc., in a special
ASCII form. This form also contains information about the data,
such as array size and record contents, in addition to the data
itself.</p><p>Though having a certain elegance, this format is severely
lacking if, for instance, you are trying to decipher the output of
a global weather prediction model.</p><p>It is here that the SISAL interface to C and Fortran comes to
the rescue. This interface can be used to perform any type of input
and output desired by the user. However, this solution is somewhat
inelegant, as it requires the user to delve into the grungy details
of the inter-language interface. This can be a daunting experience
to the average scientist or engineer, and it defeats the purpose of
providing safe, efficient and easy-to-use computational
tools.</p><p>This problem can be solved if flexible interfaces can be
written between SISAL and widely used standard data formats. I have
written just such an interface to the NetCDF library. NetCDF is a
format and an application programming interface for storing and
retrieving gridded numerical data. Developed by the UNIDATA program
of the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research, it is
rapidly increasing in popularity in the fields of meteorology and
oceanography and is starting to spill over into other fields as
well. Many tools currently exist to manipulate and display data in
this format, with more appearing all the time. The NetCDF library
is open-source software and is available from UNIDATA's web site.
However, if you are lucky, your Linux distribution already has a
prepackaged version of NetCDF available for installation&mdash;for
instance, it is available in the Debian GNU/Linux distribution that
I use.</p><p>Listing 1 shows a complete SISAL applicatin (solution of the
heat transport equation in a long rod). NetCDF is used to write out
the results. The time evolution of the temperature pattern along
the rod is shown in Figure 1 using the GRI graphics package of Dan
Kelley. (See the July 2000 issue of <i  >Linux Journal</i> for an article on GRI.)</p><p><a href="4383l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1. Sample of a Complete

ready to be smoke-tested outside of the confines of Livermore and
offered people time on a Livermore Cray in exchange for
test-driving SISAL. I took them up on their offer and quickly
became enthralled with the language. At the time I was working on
Sun workstations, but eventually began a conversion to Linux on
PCs. SISAL wouldn't compile on Linux at the time but the problems
turned out to be relatively trivial, so with the help of Pat Miller
at LLNL, we ported SISAL to Linux.</p><p>As a real smoke test of SISAL, I wrote a tropical weather
research model that I still use, and that currently consists of
4,600 lines of SISAL code. I consider the osc compiler to be
relatively robust, though undoubtedly there are still bugs that I
haven't exercised.</p><p>The current version of my model talks to the outside world
using a C interface to my Candis (C language analysis and display)
package. Developing this interface contributed to the ease with
which I was able to implement the NetCDF interface to SISAL.</p><p>Unfortunately, the SISAL project was canceled in 1997.
However, with James McGraw's help, an open-source copyright was
placed on the osc compiler source code. As one of the few current
SISAL enthusiasts, I now maintain the web site for SISAL.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ac5580.0x1bb7280"></a>What Needs to Be Done?</h2></div></div><p>The SISAL project represents a relatively rare event in
recent times, namely a significant effort to focus the talents of
computer scientists on an issue of real importance to physical
scientists and engineers. The result is an exceptionally
interesting computer language for high-performance numerical
computing, along with the hooks needed to make it truly useful to
the targeted clientele.</p><p>Though the SISAL project ultimately failed to make a
significant impact at LLNL, its transfer to the world of open
source gives it another chance. What is needed are people willing
to try it out and ascertain whether it will help them get their
work done more effectively than the current alternatives. Also
needed are knowledgeable people who are willing to fix problems and
build on what has already been accomplished. An obvious extension
would be to make SISAL use Linux SMP for parallel computation. A
more ambitious objective would be to extend it to the distributed
memory model of parallel computing, perhaps enabling it to make use
of the Message Passing Interface (MPI) commonly used on massively
parallel computers such as Linux Beowulf systems.</p><p><a href="4383s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
