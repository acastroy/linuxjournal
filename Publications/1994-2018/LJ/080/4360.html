    A step-by-step procedure for establishing a backup system that will
    save time and money.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x101d580.0x1115608"></a></h2></div></div><p>Frequently people take computers for
granted. This behavior becomes very dangerous when people rely on a
computer to store and manipulate important data but fail to back up
those data. If you are reading this, then you are probably aware of
the need for reliable backups. However, you may work with people
who are not, and your job may be seriously affected by a loss of
their data.
</p><p>I work in a scientific research group. Our laboratories are
modern, and almost all of our data acquisition is performed by
computers running Windows 95. In essence, our whole business is to
acquire information that is stored on computers. Data loss can end
up costing thousands of dollars, especially when one considers the
salaries of all the people who helped produce that data.</p><p>To protect our group from data loss, I proposed an automatic,
network-based backup system for our irreplaceable data. The costs
were negligible (we had a 486/66 computer that was not in use and a
3GB hard disk that cost us little more than one hundred dollars). I
went through several versions of this system over the past two
years, starting with a Windows 95-based system and ending up with a
fast, powerful Linux-based system. The current version is easy to
implement, inexpensive, powerful and reliable. Assuming you have a
networked Linux machine ready, you should be able to use this
article to set up your own automatic backup system in a short
time.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x101d580.0x11157c0"></a>Necessary Tools</h2></div></div><p>All the tools that are needed for the automatic backup system
are included with most Linux distributions. The first is Samba, an
excellent open-source package that allows UNIX-type systems to
communicate with Windows-based systems over a TCP/IP network. The
Linux version includes a utility called
<span   class="bold"><b>smbmount</b></span>. It uses the
<span   class="bold"><b>smb</b></span> file system kernel support
unique to Linux, allowing any directories on Windows computers to
be mounted to the Linux file system and manipulated as if they were
on the Linux machine's hard disk. This will allow the archiving
programs (in their update mode) to check to see if a file on the
Windows machine needs to be backed up <span   class="emphasis"><em>before</em></span>
it is transferred through the network, thereby reducing the network
bandwidth requirements, CPU load and hard disk wear
<span   class="emphasis"><em>dramatically</em></span>.</p><p>There are numerous archiving programs available for Linux,
including <span   class="bold"><b>tar</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>bzip2</b></span>, and even the simple
<span   class="bold"><b>cp</b></span> command. However, I chose to
use tools from the open-source Info-ZIP project. These tools are
included with most Linux distributions are available for various
other platforms, are fast and small, and use an established file
standard for Windows systems. Furthermore, the compression
abilities of the Info-ZIP tools allow one to significantly reduce
the size of the file archives on the Linux backup system.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x101d580.0x1115b88"></a>Preliminary Steps</h2></div></div><p>Network shares (a hard drive or any directory with all its
subdirectories) must be set up on the Windows computers to be
backed up. If file sharing is not already enabled, you can set it
up from the Windows network control panel. Then, in the Windows
Explorer, right click on the drive or folder you want to access
from the network and choose the Sharing option from the pop-up
menu. I recommend allowing read-only access so that crackers cannot
alter or destroy your data if they somehow obtain your passwords.
Make sure to record the names of these shares. It is a good idea to
place the netbios names, DNS names and IP numbers of the Windows
computers in your /etc/hosts file of the Linux machine (as directed
by the comments in /etc/hosts), especially if your computers lie
across different subnets.</p><p>Once this is done, you must prepare your Linux system to
access and store the data. First create a mount point for the
Windows shares by typing <b  >mkdir /mnt/smb</b>. After
that, you must decide where you will put the archived
backups.</p><p>I put the backup files on a separate 1GB vfat (Windows)
partition that remains unmounted at all times except when the
actual backup processes are running. This way, the files are
protected as much as possible from file system damage due to power
outages, and the hard drive can be temporarily removed from the
Linux computer and put into a Windows computer to facilitate
recovery. In order to accommodate this, I created a mount point
called <b  >/mnt/backups</b>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x101d580.0x1115df0"></a>Scripts</h2></div></div><p>A <span   class="emphasis"><em>script</em></span> is a text file containing
commands that one would normally type at the Linux command prompt.
You can use them to easily accomplish very complex tasks
repeatedly. Making a script is as simple as typing the text into
your favorite editor, saving it and then using the <b  >chmod
u+x</b> command on the file.</p><p>Listing 1 shows the script that backs up the DATA directory
from the d_drive share on the computer named &ldquo;higgins&rdquo;. This
script runs on my Linux computer, &ldquo;magnum&rdquo;, and is stored as the
file root/backup/higgins.</p><p><a href="4360l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1. DATA Directory
Backup</a></p><p>The first line, while looking like a comment, actually
instructs the computer to use bash to execute the script. Next
comes all the shell variables that the main part of the script will
use to back up the data on higgins. This practice of putting the
case-specific values in variables at the beginning of the script
allows the user to make new versions for new computers very quickly
by copying the basic script and changing a few easily seen values.
Listing 2 shows a different set of variables for a Windows 98
machine (&ldquo;rick&rdquo; with a shared C: drive) and a Windows NT machine
(&ldquo;tc&rdquo; with a shared folder named &ldquo;data&rdquo;). Note how the Windows
NT variables need to specify a user name and the password
associated with that username.</p><p><a href="4360l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2. Variables for the Windows
Machines</a></p><p>The remaining lines actually do the work. The command
<span   class="bold"><b>export PASSWD</b></span> puts the password in
an environment variable that the smbmount program reads
automatically. The smbumount command is executed next in case
someone forgot to unmount an SMB share from the mount point. (If
there is nothing there, smbumount returns a harmless error message
and the script continues.) The smbmount program then attempts to
mount the remote share. <b  >-N</b> switch instructs it
not to ask for a password to replace the value of the PASSWD
environment variable. The <b  >-n</b> switch communicates
the username to smbmount.</p><p>An if statement checks to see if the specified backup files
actually exist before doing any backup work in case the network may
be down or the remote computer is switched off. In this case the
script will terminate after making the mount point available
again.</p><p>If the Linux machine can access the remote files, all
archiving is done with the <span   class="bold"><b>zip</b></span>
command. The <b  >-r</b> switch is the standard recursion
option, which makes zip go through every subfolder of the data
directory. The <b  >-u</b> puts zip in update mode, where
it will only add or change files that are not already archived or
those that have changed. The <b  >-v</b> parameter
instructs zip to verbosely show the names of every file it checks
on the display&mdash;a useful option for troubleshooting.</p><p>After a backup script has been set up for each computer, you
can make a simple script named
<span   class="bold"><b>master</b></span> to call each of the backup
scripts sequentially. An example of my master script is shown in
Listing 3.</p><p><a href="4360l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3. Master
Script</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x101d580.0x1116688"></a>Activating the System</h2></div></div><p>After all the scripts have been written, you can put a
symbolic link to the master script in one of the /etc/cron.d
subdirectories so that the computer will take care of the backups
automatically. For my setup, I typed <b  >ln -s
/root/backup/master /etc/cron.d/weekly/master</b> to set
automatic weekly backups. You can back up on a daily basis if you
need to since the update option of archiving utilities minimizes
resource requirements.</p><p>The first usage of a backup script, however, will require a
lot of network bandwidth and CPU time. Hence, you may want to
consider running it for the first time by hand or with the
<span   class="bold"><b>at</b></span> command at night.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x101d580.0x1116898"></a>Caveats</h2></div></div><p>Five important points should be noted:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Any shell script with passwords should be made
unreadable by anyone but the owner by using the <b  >chmod
go-r</b> command.</p></li><li><p>If your data is very sensitive, you need to set up
adequate security measures to keep industrial spies from hacking
into your Linux machine and stealing your centralized data. See the
Linux security HOWTO for more information.</p></li><li><p>The smbmount program tends to vary slightly across
different distributions of Linux. Hence, if the scripts in this
article don't work quite right for you, check out the man pages to
see how your version of smbmount handles its command-line
options.</p></li><li><p>Users of the Windows computers must be taught to
keep their data under a central directory, such as &ldquo;users&rdquo; or
&ldquo;data&rdquo;, instead of several random directories spread across the
hard drives. Some people are too lazy to move their files into a
central directory, despite the fact that it takes only five
seconds. You may have to actually move their files yourself before
they will even start using the centralized directory. Remember,
though, that these users may be the <span   class="emphasis"><em>greatest</em></span>
threat to your organization in terms of data loss since they never
bother to make backup copies of their own data.</p></li><li><p>Finally, a hard drive is a very practical place to
put the backups of irreplaceable data. My archive files use less
than 400MB of hard disk and contain more than a 1.5GB worth of
data. However, you may want to consider obtaining a large-capacity,
removable drive for your Linux machine. With this, you can
occasionally copy the archive files from your hard disk to a
removable disk and take them home in case of physical destruction
or theft of the machine.</p></li></ol></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x101d580.0x150f068"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>A Linux-based network backup system for irreplaceable data
files on many networked computers is inexpensive, reliable, easy to
set up, trivial to expand and extremely practical. With just an
hour of time you can potentially save your group or company many
thousands of dollars in the case of a hard drive crash. Currently,
my Pentium 150 workstation keeps archives of years of
mission-critical data from eight computers spread across three
buildings and two subnets. It takes me less than two minutes to add
a new computer to the system due to the use of shell variables in
the scripts.</p><p>This is the kind of task Linux was <span   class="emphasis"><em>born</em></span>
to do. You can take an old surplus computer, make it &ldquo;headless&rdquo;
with no keyboard or monitor and stick it somewhere in a closet
where it will humbly do its work unseen. You can also run it on
your personal workstation since the Linux tools can run in the
background. You can set up an FTP server on the Linux machine on
the fly if you need to restore files to a crashed computer or
simply take the hard drive out and stick it inside a Windows
machine. Since Linux has been designed to coexist with many
different computers and operating systems, one can adapt the
scripts to back up many different kinds of computers, including
other Linux machines via NFS and even MacIntosh computers with the
netatalk and hfs packages.</p><p><a href="4360s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
