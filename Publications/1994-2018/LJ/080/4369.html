    At this year's Embedded Systems Conference, Linux loomed large in
    almost every booth. Talk about a year changing everything.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x245b580.0x2553558"></a></h2></div></div><p>If you could travel back in time to the
Embedded Systems Conference of September 1999, you would find that
the &ldquo;Embedded Linux Market&rdquo; simply did not exist one short year
ago. Sure, a growing number of developers and a handful of
companies were starting to embed Linux, but as a market that anyone
tracked, or paid attention to, embedded Linux simply hadn't made it
onto the radar screens.
</p><p>How many (and which) companies counted themselves as
&ldquo;Embedded Linux Companies&rdquo; one year ago? How many embedded Linux
news releases and new product announcements were issued at ESC in
September 1999? Not many. One year ago, embedding Linux was a
relatively rare phenomenon and was mostly the result of developer
innovation&mdash;not the fruits of marketing plans and promotional
strategies.</p><p>There were some exceptions, some pioneers. To find out what
was going on in the &ldquo;world of embedded Linux&rdquo; one year ago, I
turned to my favorite research tool (can you guess?) and scanned
headlines around the time of ESC, September 1999. That search
turned up many of the seeds of today's embedded Linux market.
Companies making headlines about embedded Linux support included
(alphabetically): Caldera, Cygnus, EMJ, FSM Labs, Lineo,
MontaVista, PROSA and Zentropix. Early hardware partners for these
embedded Linux pioneers included: Force, JUMPtec, Megatel, Motorola
Computer Group, Synergy Microsystems and Ziatech. In particular,
three embedded Linux announcements around the time of 1999's ESC
foreshadowed the later formation of the Embedded Linux
Consortium:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Zentropix announced RealTimeLinux.org, an effort to
create momentum and consensus in real-time Linux solutions.
Zentropix was later acquired by Lineo.</p></li><li><p>Cygnus announced the EL/IX API &ldquo;in an effort to
pre-empt the fragmentation of embedded Linux in the embedded
computing segment.&rdquo; Cygnus was later acquired by Red Hat.</p></li><li><p>Lineo announced an Embedded Linux Advisory Board
(EMLAB), &ldquo;an independent and vendor-neutral organization to
promote and advocate the use of Linux in the embedded systems
arena&rdquo;.</p></li></ul></div><p>Transporting back to the present&mdash;ESC, September 2000&mdash;where
does embedded Linux stand today?
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x245b580.0x25539d0"></a>&ldquo;Embedded Linux&rdquo; Has Become a Disruptive Force
in the Market</h2></div></div><p>&ldquo;Embedding Linux&rdquo;, primarily an activity of innovative
software developers one short year ago, has become the central
focus of a rapidly growing number of commercial endeavors. The
Embedded Linux Consortium, which didn't even exist seven months
ago, already boasts over 75 corporate members. Major investments in
embedded Linux, totaling hundreds of millions of dollars, have been
made by industry powerhouses like Motorola, IBM and Intel.</p><p>It's important to understand that the embedded market would
be going through a major transition, right now, with or without
Linux. Independent of Linux, developers would be scrambling to
satisfy the growing demand for both intranet and Internet
connectivity. They would be hastening to take advantage of the
opportunities presented by new low-cost 32-bit RISC processors
coupled with abundant program and storage (Flash) memory. High
integration system-on-chip processors based on MIPS, PowerPC and
ARM cores make it both easy and inexpensive to embed full-system
features in even the simplest and most cost-constrained systems.
These emerging technologies have dramatically boosted the
capabilities of embedded devices, and have also greatly elevated
expectation levels.</p><p>In short, embedded Linux arrived on a scene that was already
in the midst of great upheaval, with developers working hard and
fast to apply newly available technologies to newly defined
challenges. Because it provided low-cost, open-source, yet
state-of-the-art functionality, Linux was well positioned to be
swept along by the tide of change in the embedded sea. The open
availability of source, coupled with today's unheralded ease and
speed of collaboration and communication, turned out to be
compelling factors that enabled developers to quickly and
efficiently adapt to the challenges of a rapidly changing
landscape. So Linux began to spread like wildfire in the embedded
market.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x245b580.0x2553b88"></a>Everyone Now Has a Linux Strategy</h2></div></div><p>As compared with last September's ESC, Linux support was
found practically everywhere this year. Today, nearly every company
has a Linux strategy&mdash;whether how to take advantage of Linux or how
to defend against it. Non-Linux stalwarts like Wind River,
Microsoft and QNX all exhibit symptoms to varying degrees of the
necessity of coming to grips with life in a world where embedded
Linux is an increasingly major factor. For example, both Wind River
and QNX joined the Embedded Linux Consortium last spring as
founding members.</p><p>In addition Jerry Fiddler, Wind River founder and chairman,
now devotes several slides during his talks to defining his
company's position relative to embedded Linux. In the open-source
debate last ESC, John Fogelin, Wind River's VP of Technology, said,
&ldquo;We see point-of-sale, ATMs, Industrial PC and Internet Appliance
applications as an opportunity where Linux can replace DOS and
Windows NT. We embrace Open Source and are evaluating Linux as an
OS option for Wind River customers. We are prototyping solutions
based on Linux, now.&rdquo; In the latest ESC open-source debate,
Fogelin reiterated Wind River's support for Open Source&mdash;while
missing few opportunities to cast a FUD net over embedded
Linux.</p><p>These days, even Microsoft's Embedded &amp; Appliance
Platforms Group endeavors to promote a new image of openness and
flexibility. Although no explicit mention is made of Linux,
expressions like &ldquo;source access&rdquo;, &ldquo;simplified licensing&rdquo;,
&ldquo;flexible business model&rdquo; and &ldquo;Windows Embedded Developer
Community&rdquo; have crept into the new Microsoft lexicon.</p><p>While not directly supporting Linux, QNX Software Systems
announced a strategic initiative last June to reposition QNX, a
POSIX-compliant RTOS, as &ldquo;Linux-like&rdquo;. Among the changes were the
opening up of source code for many QNX modules other than the still
proprietary and royalty-based QNX Neutrino kernel, plus no-cost
availability of the QNX development toolkit to individuals and
developers. The get.qnx.com web site launched around the start of
this year's ESC, and, by the end of the show, QNX reported that
well over 100,000 copies of the free QNX toolkit had been
downloaded by developers.</p><p>The most radical adaptation strategy of all came from Lynx
Real-Time Systems, which last fall embarked on the path of adding
Linux to its product line, along side the company's POSIX-compliant
RTOS, LynxOS. Half a year later, the company took the further step
of changing its name in order to more directly reflect its dual-OS
(LynuxOS + Linux) strategy, becoming &ldquo;LynuxWorks&rdquo;.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x245b580.0x2553df0"></a>One Measure of Success</h2></div></div><p>Not surprisingly, this year's <span   class="emphasis"><em>EE Times</em></span>
embedded market survey reports a huge jump in the use of Linux as a
tool platform among developers, a 1,400% increase over the last 12
months.</p><p>Unfortunately, however, useful data was not gathered
regarding the use and planned use of Linux&mdash;or even Windows&mdash;as a
target platform in embedded systems, due to what appears to be a
catastrophic flaw in the only relevant survey question. The single
question on target OSes was worded in a manner that restricted its
applicability to only real-time operating systems. The question
asked in the survey was: Which of the following commercial
real-time operating systems have you (A) used previously, (B) are
you currently using or (C) plan to use within the next year? Only
RTOSes, such as VxWorks, QNX, LynxOS, OS9, etc., were included in
the list of OS choices. Not surprisingly, neither Linux nor Windows
showed up in the results.</p><p>I strongly recommend that the question be revised so that it
encompasses all categories of target system OSes, not specifically
real-time ones. Whether the target system requires hard, soft or
non-real-time performance should be the subject of a secondary
question. Other questions of interest might include connectivity
options, standards compliance (like POSIX, for example),
etc.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x245b580.0x2554000"></a>Accelerating from 0 to 100+ in Six Short
Months</h2></div></div><p>Another telling measure of the expanding embrace of Linux by
the embedded market is the meteoric rise of the Embedded Linux
Consortium, which now claims over 114 members. Founded in March
2000 by 22 companies, the ELC held its first general membership
meeting at this year's ESC in order to provide an opportunity for
members to meet the newly elected board of directors and one
another. Attendance at the meeting was estimated to be over 75
members and guests.</p><p>After brief talks by ELC chairman Inder Singh and &ldquo;yours
truly&rdquo; on the state of the embedded Linux market and the mission
and objectives of the ELC, and by John Cheuck, vice chairman of
EMBLIX (the Japan Embedded Linux Consortium), the ELC began the
process of selecting specific projects and activities. To assist
that process, a questionnaire will shortly be distributed to ELC
members asking for input on what the ELC should do, as well as what
each member feels the ELC should not do.</p><p>Currently, the consensus appears to be strong for the ELC to
stay away from being a standards organization, but, rather, to
focus its efforts on building the sense of &ldquo;Embedded Linux&rdquo; as a
brand. Speaking of which, the ELC has commissioned a permanent
logo&mdash;one with the obligatory penguin&mdash;which the group wants to see
strongly promoted by all of its members on their web sites and in
their collateral materials.</p><p>Other likely projects for the ELC include a much larger booth
for trade shows, including the possibility of hosting exhibits from
individual members. The ELC may also form working groups to develop
guidelines and recommendations that might be submitted to various
standards bodies. Other ideas are being solicited.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x245b580.0x2554210"></a>Growing Architectural Diversity</h2></div></div><p>There certainly seems to be a trend away from embedded PC
architecture. That shouldn't be too surprising, given that the
embedded PC is, after all, over 15 years old.</p><p>Intel's product announcements were roughly equally weighted
between the latest embedded Pentium processors and the new
StrongARM-derived XScale Microarchitecture. Other X86 processor
vendors exhibiting at ESC included STMicroelectronics and ZF Linux
Devices, with X86-based system-on-chip products, and AMD with its
latest embedded K-series CPUs. Surprisingly, National
Semiconductor, maker of the highly popular Geode X86 architecture
system-on-chip processors, wasn't an exhibitor at the
conference.</p><p>ARM, StrongARM, MIPS, PowerPC and other non-X86 architectures
were well represented both at the booths of their manufacturers,
and also at the booths of tool, OS and board vendors. Zilog, a
corporate executive founding member of the ELC, seems to be
bouncing back to life, and has revived use of the revered Z80 brand
in more modern, connection-oriented processors. Who knows...maybe
by next ESC, Zilog will have ported embedded Linux to the
Z80!</p><p>On the board side, the traditional buses are still around.
It's too soon to predict with certainty, but there's a hint of an
emerging trend towards busless SBCs based on PowerPC, ARM and MIPS
processors. Examples are the ADS Bitsy (StrongARM), Embedded Planet
RPX (PowerPC), Intrynsic CerfBoard (StrongARM) and others. Even
Ampro, one of the first and most prominent makers of embedded PC
SBCs, has announced its intention to roll out MIPS versions of its
new EnCore PCI-based platform.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x245b580.0x2554420"></a>What's Cool?</h2></div></div><p>In addition to the above trends and observations, here are
two Linux-related items that especially caught my fancy.</p><p>Lineo's real-time clock demo, you've heard of real-time
clocks, but this one was different! It's a bit hard to describe, so
please bear with me. Fantazein makes a clock that &ldquo;projects&rdquo; the
time via a set of LEDs on a wand that oscillates back and forth
(see Figure 1 and 2). The LEDs are modulated at precisely the right
rate to show the time, as if projected in space, as the wand sweeps
back and forth. Okay, read the explanation on their web site
(<a href="http://www.fantazein.com/how.html" target="_self">www.fantazein.com/how.html</a>)&mdash;but
hurry back!</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4369f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Fantazein Clock
</p></div></div><p>Now that you've got the picture, I'll explain what Lineo did.
They rewired the inputs to the LEDs so that they are driven by a PC
parallel printer port. With an otherwise idle Linux system, words
projected via the &ldquo;clock&rdquo; appear stable and readable. Then, the
system starts doing some file transfers, and the display becomes
completely unreadable. Now, control of the LEDs is switched to
RTAI, a hard real-time Linux system. You guessed it; even with file
transfers taking place, the display is rock solid. It turns out
that even a Linux kernel with low-latency patches would not be able
to make the display remain stable in the presence of high loading
on the system. RTAI (or RTLinux), on the other hand, can do it
easily. Bravo, on a great demo of hard vs. soft (or non-) real-time
performance!</p><p>With all the talk about open-source operating systems and
related software, how often do we hear about open-source BIOS? Sure
enough, there are a couple of projects going on out there. But to
date, there has been no truly well-supported effort to provide
comprehensive technology for system initialization and startup.
That situation appears to be changing, as a result of some new
software being developed by Red Hat called RedBoot. The project is
new, and there is much yet to be done, but RedBoot may soon be
&ldquo;booting&rdquo; that proprietary BIOS out of many embedded Linux
systems. If you've ever tried to use an embedded PC in a non-PC
application, you probably had to struggle with issues like
eliminating a long list of copyright messages, creating a custom
splash screen, speeding the boot process, supporting custom
hardware initialization or adding robust system diagnostics.
RedBoot to the rescue!</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x245b580.0x2554840"></a>On, to the Future!</h2></div></div><p>Well, ESC is a really large show and there were, no doubt,
many other important trends and interesting demos and products that
I didn't see and haven't included. I guess you really do need to be
there, to take it all in. See you next ESC? Perhaps at the rate
Linux is spreading, they'll need to change the name to ELSC&mdash;the
Embedded Linux Systems Conference!</p></div></div>
