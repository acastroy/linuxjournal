    Welcome to our special issue on violence in the workplace, I
    mean system administration.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1015580.0x110d608"></a></h2></div></div><p> Welcome to our special issue on violence
in the workplace, I mean system administration. Despite the picture
on the cover, <i  >Linux Journal</i> does not normally
advocate violence as a solution to system administration issues.
</p><p>But why is the system administrator as an individual, and
system administration as a profession, always in some kind of
crisis? Why is a system administration job a never-ending flow of
fires to be fought and ill-planned new information technology
purchases to be integrated somehow into the operation? Where is the
respect or consideration for the system administrator's expertise
in how to make information technology work? Hey, stop
laughing.</p><p>The answer to that last question is: &ldquo;Nowhere, of course.
Welcome to the race against burnout. Don't try to change the
organization; just make your big score and get out.&rdquo; Business
experts everywhere advise managers not to keep a dog and try to
bark, too. But it's an article of faith that management thinks
nothing of inflicting well-marketed but idiotic information
technology products on the poor, battle-weary sysadmin. But, it
doesn't have to be this way.</p><p>In <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Trouble with Dilbert,</em></span> Norman
Solomon writes, &ldquo;One of the best ways to teach people not to rebel
is to offer plenty of ruts for fake rebellion.&rdquo; And sysadmins have
nothing if not ruts for fake rebellion. With an escape hatch as
close as the nearest ssh client, sysadmin culture has flowered
under management repression into newsgroups, mailing lists and web
sites all dedicated to the proposition that all sysadmins are
created superior. That's not surprising for a bunch of people with
such diverse backgrounds and skills. Show me one sysadmin who
majored in Computer Science, and I'll show you three historians and
a molecular biologist. Sysadmins are, on the balance, excellent
writers and creative people.</p><p>So why does the job of being a sysadmin suck so much? Simon
Travaglia's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Bastard Operator from Hell</em></span> is the
folk hero of system administration, and his stories are linked to
from everywhere. If you haven't read the BOFH stories, he's a
self-described [Don, did you really think we could put that word in
<i  >LJ</i>?  &mdash;Ed.] who delights in tormenting any user
who asks a question (and some who don't, just to be on the safe
side). But, just messing with the users isn't making the system any
better. The BOFH is entertaining, but the way of the BOFH leads
only to more clueless users to deal with, more problems and less
help.</p><p>What the BOFH has may seem like power, but real power lies in
the ability to construct something useful. And you're not going to
get that done just working around the demands of idiots and taking
revenge where you can. You don't work for the Ministry of
Information here. In the real world, a system administrator can
walk away from idiots. And given the current job market for people
who know Linux, you can walk away from the next idiot, and the
next. Imagine a company that works your way because you built a
system that works your way, or just works, period. It's possible.
The Bastard Operator from Hell can only destroy. By abandoning
foolish companies to seek out the good ones, a system administrator
can really create something.</p><p><a href="4373s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
