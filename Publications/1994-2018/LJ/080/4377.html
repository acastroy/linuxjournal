Windows directory when running a dualboot of Windows 98 and Open
Linux 2.4 (Best of Technical Support, September 2000). What Mr.
Rubini does not mention is that Caldera sets permissions in the
/etc directory as -rwxr-xr-x. This most likely was done to prevent
the user from inadvertently deleting Windows files. Permissions to
the fstab file need to be changed to &ldquo;rwx&rdquo; for the group and/or
others. The fstab file can then be changed from &ldquo;ro&rdquo; to &ldquo;rw&rdquo;.
If permissions are to be changed for non-root users, they should be
changed to &ldquo;rw,umask=000&rdquo;.</p><p>&mdash;James Schoch jschoch@siscom.net</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x206e580.0x2166240"></a>Graphic Card Follow-up</h2></div></div><p>In the October 2000 issue, Matt Matthews' article,
&ldquo;Graphics: Pick a Card...Any Card&rdquo;, states &ldquo;...the 3500TV has a
TV tuner that is supported under Linux&rdquo;. I have been searching and
can find no support...yet. Where is it?</p><p>&mdash;Al al_h@technologist.com</p><p>Matt Matthews responds: There are two projects working on the
TV tuner that I am aware of,
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/v3tv" target="_self">http://sourceforge.net/projects/v3tv/</a>
and
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/tdfxTV" target="_self">http://sourceforge.net/projects/tdfxTV/</a>.
The former looks like it has a workable solution with some bugs. It
also looks like development has slowed. The latter seems to be in
its infancy, having only peer review code available.</p><p>&mdash;Editor</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x206e580.0x2166500"></a>We Love Hackers</h2></div></div><p>The cover of the October issue of <i  >Linux Journal</i> states: Make Life Difficult for Spammers &amp;
Hackers. This calls &ldquo;crackers&rdquo; &ldquo;hackers&rdquo;, which they are not
and, thus, throws mud on real &ldquo;hackers&rdquo; who are the very ones who
give so much of themselves to make Linux and all open-source
software possible in the first place.</p><p>Real hackers have been struggling against the media for years
to recover the name &ldquo;hackers&rdquo;. And while it is normal for more
ignorant segments of the media to use the term incorrectly, it is
very annoying to see the term so misused and on the very cover of
<i  >Linux Journal</i>!</p><p>Do you really feel that Linus is someone that you need to
&ldquo;make life difficult for&rdquo;? You really think he is going to break
into your systems? As your magazine is directly and/or indirectly
about hackers and their accomplishments, it seems to me like
shooting yourselves in the foot to basically insult them by giving
their group name a bad meaning.</p><p>&mdash;Terry Mackintosh&mdash;a hacker terr@terrym.com</p><p>As a longtime reader (I have Issue 1, Volume 1) who also sold
<i  >Linux Journal</i> at hamfests back in the early
days, I say SHAME, SHAME, SHAME! I am talking about the cover
headline that says &ldquo;Make Life Difficult for Spammers &amp;
Hackers&rdquo; on the cover of the October 2000 issue. You people should
know better. A hacker is someone like Linus or RMS. Someone who
breaks into computers is a CRACKER. Are you getting too preoccupied
with the suits? This it the kind of headline I would expect from
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Time Magazine</em></span> or <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Washington
Post</em></span>, not from <i  >Linux Journal</i>.</p><p>&mdash;Ken Firestone ken@firestone.net</p><p>We made a mistake. Everyone who worked on the cover will have
to sing &ldquo;Join Us Now and Share the Software&rdquo; at the next Linux
conference. We are committed to running articles by hackers about
hacking.</p><p>&mdash;Editor</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x206e580.0x2166a80"></a>Not a Book at All</h2></div></div><p>I have just read Daniel Lazenby's review of <span   class="emphasis"><em>The XML
Handbook</em></span> by Goldfarb and Prescod in the October issue of
<i  >Linux Journal</i>.</p><p>I must say I cannot agree with your positive appraisal of
this book. First, this can hardly be called a &ldquo;book&rdquo;- it is
essentially a collection of corporate white papers bound up with a
CD-ROM of product demos. Prentice-Hall duped consumers by using
Goldfarb's reputation to generate sales. Imagine the disappointment
when readers discover that Goldfarb and Prescod have in fact
authored only a small part of this work&mdash;the rest of the chapters
were sold to vendors to hawk their wares. Prentice-Hall should
steer clear of this tactic in the future, or they will be demoted
to the ranks of Que, Sam's and other third-rate technical
publishers.</p><p>To say this book was panned in the XML/SGML community would
be an understatement&mdash;for many, this has seriously tarnished
Goldfarb's and Prescod's reputations.</p><p>&mdash;Brad Clawsie bjc@yahoo.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x206e580.0x2166d40"></a>Assabet's Contribution to iPaq</h2></div></div><p>I read with great interest the articles on embedded Linux
and, in particular, the applications for handheld devices in the
September 2000 issue of <i  >Linux Journal</i>. I would
like to emphasize though, that while the author of the article
(&ldquo;Compaq's Approach to Linux in Your Hand&rdquo;) correctly points out
the lineage of the iPaq as being the Itsy project at Compaq, one
should be aware that Intel's Assabet reference design also
contributed to iPaq's development. This is clearly seen when one
looks at the system specification of the iPaq; this verifies that
the system control registers are similar to the Assabet design. In
particular, the unique audio codec solution on the Assabet has been
identically implemented on the iPaq design. The Assabet platform is
based on Intel's StrongARM* architecture (recently renamed as
Xscale*), compatible SA-1110 processor and SA-1111 companion chip.
The Assabet design offers significant technical attributes over the
Itsy design, specifically the stereo audio, color display, power
management, CF support and backlight to name a few.</p><p>Key developers of the Assabet platform are at a new company
called ideaLogix, which is currently developing wireless video
streaming products and services for visual information
management.</p><p>&mdash;Jumbi Edulbehram jumbi@idealogix.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x206e580.0x2166f50"></a>Following Up with Security</h2></div></div><p>Thank you for the good article &ldquo;Good-bye Bandits, Hello
Security&rdquo; in October 2000's <span   class="emphasis"><em>From the Editor</em></span>
column.</p><p>I believe it is of vital importance to do a follow-up study
of the major Linux distributions such as Red Hat, SuSE, Debian,
Slackware and about 20 more, and see to what extent security is
implemented in the next versions. Please examine the security, ease
of use and default setup from installation program. With such a
study, <i  >LJ</i> will force the major distributions
to set standards for this issue. As you mentioned in your article
(aimed at distributors?, good) there are many new Linux users
hooked up permanently by DSL or cable, and if security is not set
up by default, or is too difficult, they will choose some other OS
(I will not spell it out).</p><p>&mdash;Bertil Palmqvist Bertil.A.Palqvist@telia.se</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x206e580.0x21671b8"></a>Clarification for DNS Beginners</h2></div></div><p>I was reading &ldquo;Securing DNS and Bind&rdquo; in the October issue
and noticed an error that some beginners to DNS may not understand.
When talking about the computer querying for an IP address to
wiredmonkeys.org (or whatever it was), the author states that it
will look to ns.isp.org instead of ns.someisp.org. This can be
confusing to people who may wonder why it would leave their domain
(someisp.org) and search a name server in isp.org.</p><p>&mdash;Brandon Shirey brandons@mail.esi.net</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x206e580.0x2167318"></a>Shocked</h2></div></div><p>I'm shocked at your response to Dale Lakes' letter in the
September issue (Disgusted, page 6). It is ridiculous for a
magazine like yours to hire a company which uses NT and IIS to
fufill your web hosting and e-commerce needs.</p><p>Don't you get it?</p><p>The Linux OS needs the support of the IT community. We need
to be able to answer the objections of corporate managers and home
users who can't think outside of the Microsoft Box. We all need to
prove to our friends, family, coworkers&mdash;everyone!&mdash;that we can
expect a PC to be reliable, stable and secure. We don't have to be
overcharged for less than promised. We can concentrate on using our
computers rather than being used.</p><p>However, when a Linux magazine has to rely on Microsoft to
have a web presence, you make us all look like fools. You'll have
no credibility and deserve none until you start practicing what all
of us are preaching every day: &ldquo;Expect More&mdash;Use Linux!&rdquo;</p><p>By the way, your response said you're looking for a company
that can do web hosting and e-commerce on Linux. My Google search
(<a href="http://www.google.com" target="_self">http://www.google.com/</a>)
returned 97,000 hits. Three of the companies listed had ads in your
September issue.</p><p>&mdash;Randy Cook randy@rcook.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x206e580.0x2167630"></a><i  >LJ</i> Store Web Site Provider
Responds</h2></div></div><p>I would like to respond to the reader whose letter was
published in the September 2000 issue of <i  >Linux Journal</i> under the headline &ldquo;Disgusted&rdquo;. The author
complained because <i  >Linux Journal</i>'s e-commerce
and fulfillment partner (that's us) runs the <i  >Linux Journal</i> Store web site
(<a href="http://store.linuxjournal.com" target="_self">http://store.linuxjournal.com/</a>)
on Microsoft NT and IIS.</p><p>While the complaint is accurate, it doesn't begin to discuss
how we use computing resources at WAS Inc. Let me say to this
customer, and every other potential customer, that our use of
technology is completely subordinate to the task at hand:
satisfying the shopper. We don't pick operating systems due to
popularity, we pick them for their suitability to our needs. (For
various reasons, NT happened to be the best choice for our
internally-developed software. We use, in addition to NT, Linux,
IBM AIX, OS/2, PC-DOS 7, Mac OS and Windows 98. All singing, all
dancing, all SAMBA-ing.)</p><p>We are, in fact, currently in the process of moving from NT
to AIX as our primary platform, for the same reason: NT did not
meet our needs. We discovered some serious scalability problems and
needed to think hard about our platform of choice. We write our own
e-commerce software (we do not use Microsoft's), so we have more
invested in object-oriented technology and our current code
structure than we do in any one operating system. Our product runs
today on OS/2, Windows NT, IBM AIX, Sun Solaris and HP-UX. We'd be
on Linux today if IBM supported our language there. (Please write
and ask them to make VisualAge Smalltalk available on Linux.) We
will be on Linux in the future even if they don't. But our
immediate move will be to AIX on RS/6000 systems.</p><p>While I appreciate your correspondent's feelings, I wish he
knew us better. We're Linux fans and Linux friends. We've run Linux
since our first distribution&mdash;that's Softlanding Systems (SLS)
0.99. (I don't even know if they're around any more.) We did not
discover Linux when Red Hat came along. I've personally been a
<i  >Linux Journal</i> subscriber in the past, way back
in the first year. (I admit that now I read the back issues as they
come into the warehouse&mdash;don't tell anyone.)</p><p>NT made business sense once. Linux and UNIX make more sense
to us for the future than Windows 2000. This is where we get off
the MS Windows boat. I would think our correspondent would be
cheering.</p><p>We're not Redmond's mind slaves!</p><p>&mdash;Les Kooyman Vice President, WAS Inc.</p><p><a href="4377s1.html" target="_self">Errata</a></p></div></div>
