    Deadlines are significant when debating the
    pros and cons of proprietary and open-software development.

1800 C.E., a product specification and honest delivery date was
announced. I know, I was there. &ldquo;Stan,&rdquo; said George Stephenson,
&ldquo;you don't have to be a Rocket scientist to appreciate my latest
steam engine.&rdquo; Rivals would rush to improve the spec and/or beat
the &ldquo;to-market&rdquo; deadline. Time passes, things change. You know,
you've been there. In these PC (pronounced Pursey by Shakespeare)
days, software announcements are now announced as soon as someone
devises a catchy acronym. The current ploy, successfully borrowed
by Microsoft from IBM, tries to discourage the competition.
</p><p>Part of the problem is that software predictions can be woven
into a bland, grandiose, uncontroversial jargon. Who could dispute
the value of a globally web-aware, multi-paradigmatic,
pattern-sensitive, cross-development architectural environment?
(Have I missed your favorite desideratum?)</p><p>Nevertheless, deadlines are significant when debating the
pros and cons of proprietary and open-software development. The
former is often driven and accelerated by corporate job pressures.
The latter, alas, relying on &ldquo;casual&rdquo; evolution, lacks the
&ldquo;next-week-or-else&rdquo; imperatives. Replacing the trad Vaporware, we
now meet the corporate term Vampireware (related to the Death March
syndrome). For once, we can pin down the originator, Trygve Lode,
CEO, Lode Data Corporation. Vampireware: A project capable of
sucking the lifeblood out of anyone unfortunate enough to be
assigned to it. The project never actually sees the light of day,
but nonetheless refuses to die.</p><p>Yet many open and closed projects eventually emerge from the
agonizing shadows to our clear screens. Dum codo spero?</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a56580.0x1b4e3f8"></a>I Have Mail</h2></div></div><p>Dan Jurca writes from California State University,

issue of <i  >Linux Journal</i>. Because of your
interest in (2^6,972,593--1) I thought you might enjoy visiting:

</p><p>By the way, this Landon (Kurt) Noll is the person who, with
one Laura Nickel, discovered in October 1978 that (2^21,701--1) is
prime; and soon after that, and after Miss Nickel lost interest, he
discovered that (2^23,209--1) is also prime. They used the library
and computer resources at California State University, Hayward to
do their research and perform the long boring computations.</p><p>Also, because you appear to be interested in &ldquo;long numbers&rdquo;
you might enjoy the following tidbit. Consider the equations:1.
A^(A^A)=10^(10^(10^10)) and2.
B^(B^(B^B))=10^(10^(10^(10^10)))</p><p>Reader challenge (huge prizes): Determine</p><p>a. Which of A and B is the greater, andb. the numerical
difference between A and B.</p></blockquote></div><p>I'll report Dan's solution anon. Meanwhile, I see you rushing
to the sublime Mathematica. We older farts still swear by Napier's
Bones.
