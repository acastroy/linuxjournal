    Need to load Linux on 100 workstations? Learn some tricks and

    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19ed580.0x1ae5870"></a></h2></div></div><p>Installing Linux on a PC has been long
considered a programming guru's domain. It usually takes a novice
user weeks or even longer to get the system properly configured.
However, with emerging installation techniques and package
management, especially from Red Hat, Linux is on the verge of
becoming user-friendly. Yet, even with these newer methods, one
aspect of Linux that is still frustrating is installation on a
large scale. This is not because it is difficult, but rather
because it is a monotonous and cumbersome endeavor. The object of
this article is to discuss the basics of a technique that will
simplify large-scale installation. Furthermore, a scheme is also
discussed for the automatic switch-on of a LAN employing
Wake-on-LAN technology.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19ed580.0x1ae5978"></a>Installation Automation: Why?</h2></div></div><p>A standard Linux installation asks many questions about what
to install, what hardware to configure, how to configure the
network interface, etc. Answering these questions once is
informative and maybe even fun. But imagine a system engineer who
has to set up a new Linux network with a large number of machines.
Now, the same issues need to be addressed and the same questions
answered repeatedly. This makes the task very inefficient, not to
mention a source of irritation and boredom. Hence, a need arises to
automate this parameter and option selection.</p><p>The thought of simply copying the hard disks naturally
crosses one's mind. This can be done quickly, and all the necessary
functions and software will be copied without option selection.
However, the fact is that simple copying of hard disks causes the
individual computers to become too similar. This, in turn, creates
an altogether new mission of having to reconfigure the individual
settings on each PC. For example, IP addresses for each machine
will have to be reset. If this is not done properly, strange and
inexplicable behavior results.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19ed580.0x1ae5ad8"></a>What About Kickstart?</h2></div></div><p>Those of us who have worked with Red Hat Linux are probably
aware of the fact that it already offers a method of automated
installation called Kickstart. This useful feature actually forms
the foundation of the methodology we have developed. Kickstart
allows us to specify beforehand our answers to all the necessary
questions asked during the installation process. The specifications
of a desired installation are listed in a special file called
ks.cfg. This file is then placed on an NFS server and the target
system is booted using a floppy disk. The setup prompt on the Red
Hat distribution allows you to choose from a number of installation
methods. Kickstart can be chosen as the desired technique by simply
entering &ldquo;ks&rdquo; at the prompt. If everything has been done
properly, <span   class="emphasis"><em>voil&agrave;!</em></span> The only message you
will get at the end is the declaration of a successful
installation.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19ed580.0x1ae5c38"></a>Our Scenario</h2></div></div><p>We were given the task to set up a Linux laboratory of
sixty-four Pentium III machines connected via a 100MB Ethernet.
Sixty machines were to be set up as workstations and four as
various servers. With such a large number of machines, it was clear
that a powerful means of installation was sorely needed. The power
of our technique is evident from the fact that the whole setup
process took us about sixty hours, spread out over fifteen days.
Let's take a detailed look at the method we adopted.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19ed580.0x1ae5d40"></a>Giving Kickstart a Kick!</h2></div></div><p>The sixty computers obtained for use as workstations in our
laboratory (see Figure 1) had hard disks but no floppy drives. To
get Kickstart running, we needed to remove the case and manually
connect a floppy to each machine, boot the machine, install Linux
and, finally, remove the floppy. This is a long procedure since
floppies go bad all the time and, even if they do not fail, it
takes a minute or two waiting for the floppy to load. This can turn
into an unpleasant two minutes as you wait with your fingers
crossed, watching the screen, just to get the dreaded &ldquo;Boot
failed&rdquo; message. Moreover, if a disk does go bad, it takes even
longer to write another image onto a new disk.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4139f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1. The Linux Laboratory</p></div></div>
</p><p>A wiser approach had to be adopted. We merged the Red Hat
Installation disk with a very fine net-booting package, etherboot,
to obtain a network-bootable image of the disk. Now, since we also
placed this image on a NFS server, only a 16KB loader was needed on
the floppy which would boot up in under twenty seconds. This loader
would then retrieve the actual image over the network. A new floppy
could easily be made in less than thirty seconds.</p><p>The loader is, in fact, a ROM image; hence, to make it even
more reliable we burned it on an EPROM. The Red Hat boot-disk image
for network installation was kept on a DHCP/TFTP server. To get the
installation running, the ROM was plugged in to the network card
and the machine booted from the network. The same ROM can be reused
to boot other machines. As the ROM is robust and small, an
efficient way was thus developed for getting the installations
running. We call this super-Kickstart.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19ed580.0x1ae6108"></a>Preparing the Tools</h2></div></div><p>Before we could embark on setting up super-Kickstart, we
needed to obtain and set up some software packages. The first was
the etherboot package (see Resources). To serve our purpose, the
package had to be modified a little as follows.</p><p>In the directory etherboot/netboot/mknbi-linux, edit the file
mknbi.h as shown in Listing 1.</p><p><a href="4139l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a></p><p>Now, edit the configuration file for etherboot,
etherboot/src/Config.32, as follows. Locate the line:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
CFLAGS+=        -DDHCP_SUPPORT -DMOTD -DIMAGE_MENU
</pre><p>and change it to:
<pre     class="programlisting">
CFLAGS+=        -DDHCP_SUPPORT
</pre>


If the target machine has a BIOS that does not configure the
network card properly, you may also need to append this line with
<b  >-DCONFIG_PCI_DIRECT</b> before compiling the
packages.
</p><p>Next, we moved to the top etherboot directory and did a
<b  >make all</b> to compile all the binaries.</p><p>Then, we created a directory to hold all the necessary
executables for this setup. We copied the file
etherboot/src/floppyload.bin and the appropriate ROM images, .rom
and .lzrom, from the etherboot/src-32/ directory to this location.
The file mknbi was also copied from the
etherboot/netboot/mknbi-linux/ to this directory.</p><p>The second required tool was the streplace utility (see
Resources). This useful package was utilized for replacing strings
in files while configuring host-specific parameters that change
with each workstation, e.g., host name and IP address. After
compiling the binary, it was also copied to the working directory
mentioned above. With these tools in hand, we happily moved on to
the next step.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19ed580.0x1ae6630"></a>No More Installation Disk</h2></div></div><p>A closer look at the Red Hat installation disk reveals that
it contains a Linux kernel, an initial ramdisk image and some
configuration files. For our purposes, we utilized only the kernel
and the initial ramdisk image. To have a look at the contents of
the disk image, mount it as a loop device using these
commands:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
mount -o loop
cd <span   class="emphasis"><em>mount_point</em></span>
</pre><p>We then copied the kernel image (vmlinuz) and the initial
ramdisk (initrd.img) to the directory we created earlier. In
addition, the file syslinux.cfg provided the kernel options
necessary for initiating a Kickstart install. They were noted. We
had no further use for the installation disk beyond this point.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19ed580.0x1ae6840"></a>Setting up a Kickstart Option File</h2></div></div><p>The Kickstart HOWTO discusses the syntax of the ks.cfg file
in detail. Although very informative, it takes too long to generate
this file. Therefore, the method we devised was to first install
Red Hat Linux 6.1 on a machine using the &ldquo;normal&rdquo; CD-ROM method.
All packages, options and settings for our to-be-target-machine
were manually specified. Once the system was up and running, it was
tested for optimum performance and then used as prototype for the
rest of the installations.</p><p>A special package called mkkickstart also had to be
installed. The mkkickstart utility can extract information from an
installation and print it on the standard output. We used it to do
exactly that:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
mkkickstart &gt;ks.cfg
</pre><p>Any Kickstart installation that is now run with ks.cfg as the
configuration file will create a replica of our prototype
workstation. We did some minor editing of this file to implement
some changes. Listing 2 is a sample from the start of the file.
</p><p><a href="4139l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19ed580.0x1ae6b00"></a>Post-Install and Customization</h2></div></div><p>The Kickstart technique offers provisions for executing any
necessary post-install procedures needed once the installation is
complete. This feature, besides allowing individual customization,
is particularly useful when packages other than those included with
the standard Red Hat distribution are to be installed. In our case,
these included JDK (Java Development Kit) for Linux, among many
others. We added the following lines to the post-install section
and created a separate script and Perl program (see Listings 3 and
4) that would execute when the Red Hat installation had
finished:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
%post
cd /root
tar -xvzf install:/kickstart/install.tar.gz
cd installfiles
 ./postinstall
cd /root
rm -rf installfiles
</pre><p>The tar file (install.tar.gz) was placed on the Installation
Server (install), from where it could be retrieved and executed to
customize the system. Our special customization included un-tarring
JDK from our ftp server, setting up linuxconf for web access,
specifying the DNS server and allowing root remote shell access of
workstation from the servers.

ks.cfg file so that the target system was able to receive it even
after it had undergone a DHCP/TFTP boot. An analysis of the
installation procedure revealed that the tmp directory within the
initial ramdisk is one of the locations that the Kickstart system
looks for a configuration file.</p><p>The procedure of copying each ks.cfg to the appropriate
location and then adding a kernel to initrd to make an encapsulated
chunk of code was all performed by a script called superkick. A
look at this script (see Listing 5) will show the steps involved in
setting up the network bootable image.</p><p><a href="4139l5.html" target="_self">Listing 5</a></p><p>We wrote another script, doitfor, to automatically customize
the ks.cfg file and a post-install file for every workstation. It
is shown in Listing 6. The major task that this script performed
was inserting a specific host name and IP address within each
ks.cfg using the streplace utility. This script takes as input the
host name and IP address and generates a boot image to be uploaded
using DHCP/TFTP boot.</p><p><a href="4139l6.html" target="_self">Listing 6</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19ed580.0x1add9c0"></a>DHCPD Configuration</h2></div></div><p>To get the installation running, we needed to set up either a
DHCPD server or a BOOTP server. The problem with the BOOTP method
is that a list of network card MAC addresses has to be provided to
issue IP addresses to the target machines. With a large number of
installations, this would be quite a tedious job, so we opted for
DHCPD. There is a long list of DHCPD options but we needed only the
most basic ones, namely the default name-server address, starting
IP and domain names.</p><p>Now the tricky issue here was that if we booted a machine an
IP address would be issued to it. As long as it stayed on, the IP
address would not be reused and any subsequent machine that was
switched on would be automatically granted the next IP address by
the DHCP d&amp;\#230;mon. If the first machine was turned off, then
its IP address became free. Since DHCP has the liberty to assign
any unused IP addresses, there is a good chance that the same IP
address would be given to another new machine. If an installation
were then run, this new machine would end up with the same host
name and IP address as the one that was turned off. Simply put,
they would have the same network settings and would not work
properly.</p><p>To solve this problem, we changed the first IP address that
the DHCPD was allowed to offer. This was done by reconfiguring the
/etc/dhcpd.conf file (see Listing 7) and restarting the DHCPD. The
doitfor script includes the code to carry out this task every time
a boot image for a new target is created. Once an IP address had
been allotted, DHCPD could be switched to the next IP address and
the next installation started without complications.</p><p><a href="4139l7.html" target="_self">Listing 7</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19ed580.0x1addc28"></a>The Installation Process</h2></div></div><p>Once the DHCPD had been configured to offer the desired IP
address for a target, we could proceed in two ways. The first was
to burn the ROM image into an EPROM and plug the EPROM in to the
network card. This obviously requires an EPROM programmer. The
second and simpler way was to use the command</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cat floppyload.bin &lt;yourcard.rom&gt; &gt;&gt;/dev/fd0
</pre><p>to create a bootable floppy disk carrying the ROM image and
thus get the installation running. Some initial installations were
carried out with the floppy method. Later, the availability of an
EPROM writer allowed us to employ the EPROM technique, which worked
fine and was good for experience and experimenting.
</p><p>Note that completing more than two or three installations at
a time overloads the network and brings down the efficiency. With
two machines installing concurrently, we were able to achieve
complete installations in an average time of fifteen minutes. The
exact details of our installation procedure now follow.</p><p>First, we ran the shell script, doitfor, on the server to
specify which machine we would be installing next. The floppy drive
or the EPROM was plugged in to the target system and the system
booted. The boot image was automatically retrieved, and the
installation process started. While this process continued, we
moved on to the next machine by running the doitfor script with new
arguments corresponding to the next target. Booting the next
machine would result in two installations running simultaneously.
As soon as the installation on the first machine completed, we
could start at the third one, and so on. The only hassle was
plugging in the ROM/floppy and booting. Nevertheless, it was much
faster than the standard method of using the floppy and manual
settings.</p><p>If, on booting, the MAC address of the detected network card
is reported as <b  >FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF</b>, it is an
indication that the network card is not initialized properly. There
are two ways to overcome this. One is to switch off the Plug and
Play OS feature of the motherboard during initial setup, forcing
the BIOS to configure the network card. Note that switching this
feature off is required only during the installation bootup; it can
be switched on later, if required. The second method is to enable
the <b  >-DCONFIG_PCI_DIRECT</b> option in the
configuration file of the etherboot as discussed earlier.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19ed580.0x1addf98"></a>Time Synchronization</h2></div></div><p>With files shared among a large number of workstations, it
becomes imperative that machines have their clocks synchronized so
that file time stamps are globally comparable. Time synchronization
helps in maintaining logs, updating and distributing updates, etc.
We simply set up all the machines to match their time to that of a
reference server at every startup by utilizing the rdate utility.
To enable this on the client side, we simply added the following
line to the rc.local file:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
rdate -s
</pre><p>On the server side, the default time service had to be
enabled in the /etc/inetd.conf. This was done by locating and
removing the <b  >#</b> sign from the beginning of the
following line and restarting inetd:
<pre     class="programlisting">
#time   stream  tcp     nowait  root    internal
</pre>


Fancy time-servers such as NTPD or TIMED could also have been used,
but rdate works well for an undergraduate laboratory without
causing headaches due to cryptic configuration issues.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19ed580.0x1ade200"></a>Root Password Uniformity</h2></div></div><p>Many volunteers helped with the installation. Once the
installations were complete, security reasons demanded that we
change the root password on every machine. This meant that either
Linuxconf Web access was used for all the machines, or the system
administrators had to manually change the password on each
workstation. We wrote a script, change_password_on_all.pl (see
Resources), to achieve this password change from a single server.
The script requires that all workstations be configured to allow
remote shell root access from the server using the
<span   class="bold"><b>rsh</b></span> utility. This provision was
configured during the post-install steps. It should be noted,
however, that although this is not a very secure method of
exchanging crucial information, it worked fine in our controlled
laboratory environment. In addition, if caution is exercised by
running the script only when the LAN is not being used, this method
can prove to be very useful.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19ed580.0x1ade360"></a>Startup/Switch-off Automation</h2></div></div><p>Now we move on to a discussion of how we automated the LAN
startup and shutdown by controlling it from a single machine. To
understand this we have to take a closer look at AMD's Magic Packet
technology. Many network cards now come equipped with the
Wake-on-LAN feature. This means that when the machine is switched
off (i.e., the ATX casing has power but is not in the &ldquo;on&rdquo;
state), it provides a small amount of power to the Wake-on-LAN
enabled network card through a three-wire header connecting the
motherboard and the card. Hence, the card is actually alive and
able to keep watch on the LAN for a special packet, called the
Magic Packet (see Resources). On receiving such a packet, the
network card generates a pulse that can be used to switch on the
machine. The Magic Packet is, in fact, a stream of 0xFF characters
followed by the MAC address of the NIC, repeated a specific number
of times. The probability of such a packet occurring coincidentally
during normal operation is very rare. Hence, the reception of such
a packet can be safely assumed to indicate that it is indeed meant
for the target machine.</p><p>We wrote a Perl program named
<span   class="bold"><b>switch</b></span> (see Listing 8) that
switches one or all machines on the LAN either on or off. It
generates a Magic Packet and broadcasts it over the network. The
target machine, on receiving this packet, switches on. To switch a
machine off, a straightforward remote shell invocation of
<b  >halt</b> or <b  >shutdown -h</b> suffices.
To make things more manageable, we made the script parse
/etc/switch.conf for information regarding which host on the LAN
has what MAC address. It should be obvious that the MAC addresses
are required only for switching on and not off, as the shutdown
invoked through the remote shell requires only target IP
addresses.</p><p><a href="4139l8.html" target="_self">Listing 8</a></p><p>A small drawback is that, although the switch-on is possible
whether the target machine runs Linux or not, the switch off is
possible only if the target machine properly boots into Linux. This
method does not provide for switching the system off if the target
machine fails to boot properly. It should, however, be noted that
if a machine does fail to boot properly, it would require manual
attention for fixing it anyway.</p><p>In our laboratory, we had Intel 440BX2 motherboards with
D-link network cards that support the Wake-on-LAN feature. The
motherboard requires that the feature be switched on from the BIOS.
There is a large range of other component brands that support this
feature as well. Chances are that if you have purchased your
hardware in the last year, you already have these features.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19ed580.0x1ade728"></a>Server Configuration</h2></div></div><p>We utilized standard procedures in setting up the server
configuration. We set up the DNS, NIS, FTP, Apache, time and NFS
services. One special consideration was that no two services were
provided by a single IP address. Although we had only four actual
servers, we relied heavily on IP aliasing to create virtual
personalities for each service. This aliasing method provides for
transparent shifting of the services from one machine to another in
case of a failure, providing some degree of fault tolerance. This
approach is in continuation of our previous work on network fault
tolerance, reported in <i  >Linux Journal</i>, June
2000.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19ed580.0x1ade888"></a>autofs</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>autofs</b></span> is a kernel-assisted
auto-mounter for Linux which allows the system to dynamically mount
a file system on demand. It is like using MS Windows, where, when
you need to access a floppy drive, you do not have to specifically
attach a drive to a mount point. For example, if autofs is
configured to auto-mount a CD-ROM at, say, mount point /misc/cd,
then every time a CD-ROM is inserted into the drive and the
directory is changed to /misc/cd, the CD-ROM will be automatically
mounted at this point. If the mount point is not used for a while,
it will be automatically unmounted.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>autofs</b></span> was found to be very
useful for our scenario. Over the span of one week, we have many
different classes coming into the laboratory. Keeping all the user
files mounted on each workstation all the time created a lot of
server load and network traffic&mdash;an inefficient and undesirable
situation. We divided the file system into four groups and mounted
them individually via autofs rather than hard-binding the NFS
servers in the /etc/fstab file. This reduced the server load to a
quarter of its original.</p><p>To maintain flexibility, we used NIS for the autofs maps. The
map auto.master provides information about the mount point of the
autofs system, and auto.home gives information about what file
system should be mounted and from which server. It was discovered
that the autofs does not check for an NIS map if the file
/etc/auto.master is present. Hence, to make it work properly, we
removed the file /etc/auto.home from all the workstations that were
going to employ autofs. To include these maps in the NIS database,
select the rule auto.home and auto.master in the NIS Makefile
located at /var/yp/.</p><p>The following line was added to /etc/auto.master on the
server:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/home   auto.home       --timeout 60
</pre><p>and these lines were added to /etc/auto.home on the server:
<pre     class="programlisting">
#mount point    options         source host+path
g1      -rw,hard,intr   nfs1:/home/g1
g2      -rw,hard,intr   nfs2:/home/g2
</pre>


to enable building the proper database.
