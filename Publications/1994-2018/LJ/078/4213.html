Linux is a standard recognized throughout the entire UNIX world.
It's fast, it's straightforward, and it compiles standard C (or C++
for the g++ compiler). But anyone who has written a large makefile
knows it isn't a complete development environment by itself. With
the advent of some serious tools like Code Fusion and Source
Navigator from Cygnus, developing large projects with multiple
programmers is getting easier all the time.</p><p>Rather than use these tools, however, many professional
software developers rely on Rapid Application Development (RAD)
products to design, prototype and code applications. Many of these
applications revolve around database access; many are created by an
organization for internal use or by consultants for vertical
markets. These might be billing or database access systems,
customer support systems, or pieces that integrate existing web
services so all employees can access data using a browser. The
issues facing these internal developers are different from those
that face someone creating a &ldquo;boxed product&rdquo; or a standard
open-source project for eventual public consumption. Three examples
of these issues include very tight deadlines, a need to integrate
with existing IT infrastructure, and a need to run on multiple
platforms running in an organization.</p><p>The process for completing an internal project might look
something like this:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Plan the project, including creating a schedule for
development.</p></li><li><p>Create a demo (if things are moving slowly) or a
prototype (if they're moving rapidly).</p></li><li><p>Develop the actual program.</p></li><li><p>Test it within the department where it will be
used.</p></li><li><p>Deploy the program, and begin the revision phases
as needed.</p></li></ol></div><p>Java is the proposed solution to many of these internal
development projects. It's a cross-platform language, it works with
the Web, and everyone seems to accept it as a good idea. But Java
is not always the answer, as developers on many abandoned projects
can attest. Microsoft Visual Basic is also widely used for these
internal projects.
</p><p>The problem with so many of these internal projects is that
after a lot of work has been put into the planning step, the
prototype and development take so long and cost so much that the
whole project may become unworkable (or at a minimum, go way over
budget). Part of the problem lies in converting a plan into a
prototype, or a prototype into a working program. Other problems
often revolve around a lack of appropriate tools or talent, or the
need to create the program so that it runs on multiple platforms
(or the Web&mdash;which brings a separate set of challenges). RAD tools
are the solution many developers look to. These developer tools
combine a graphical interface, database access and additional tools
to help code, debug and deploy an end-user-oriented
application.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13a1580.0x1499ef8"></a>Omnis Studio</h2></div></div><p>While a few high-end tools have been available on Linux for a
while&mdash;some for $10,000 or more per developer&mdash;those needing RAD
tools normally didn't consider Linux. (One promising tool,
Borland's Kylix, is still in beta testing.)</p><p>A recent entrant in the field of Linux software development
is Omnis Studio from Omnis Software
(<a href="http://www.omnis-software.com" target="_self">http://www.omnis-software.com/</a>).
Though this company and product have been around for over twenty
years, they began shipping a Linux product just last year.
Fortunately, the maturity of their products and the depth of the
feature set have carried over very well to the Linux port. Omnis
Studio takes a Java-like approach to software development that
creates a single cross-platform program in a very powerful
graphical development environment.</p><p>Omnis uses a run-time engine to both develop and execute
programs. If &ldquo;editing&rdquo; is enabled in your license, you can create
new programs; otherwise, you can run only existing programs.
Amazingly, this engine (without the libraries your program may
require) is only about 1MB. Both the small size and the execution
speed of Omnis Studio applications are surprisingly good, given
that this is an interpreted environment. Engines that let you
create and execute Omnis Studio programs are available on Linux,
Windows and Macintosh. To show the flexibility of the technology
behind this product, consider that you can develop a program on
Linux, make changes to the same program file on a Windows system
(running a developer license of Studio), then run the newly altered
program on a Macintosh. You can think of the &ldquo;program&rdquo; as a
script that can be run or edited on any of the platforms. Figure 1
shows the architecture of the product.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4213f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Architecture of Omnis Studio
</p></div></div><p>Longtime users of both Omnis and other tools (Java or Visual
Basic) have told me that Studio requires about 20% of the
development time of Visual Basic because of the automation Studio
includes. Some of these automation features are things like
auto-typed variables which are tokenized throughout the project,
and single-file projects that collect all relevant information in
one place.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13a1580.0x149a318"></a>Web Wizards</h2></div></div><p>Omnis Software considers Visual Basic to be the main
competitor to Studio. The good news is that with Studio, internal
development projects which would have required Windows workstations
or an expensive UNIX RAD solution can now be developed on Linux and
executed on any system with a browser. The interface to Studio is
shown in Figures 2 and 3. It's a challenge to capture many features
in just a screenshot or two, but you can see some of the widget
palettes, properties, notebooks and method editors. Standard tools
like buttons, lists, menus and text are included, all tied together
for quick results. A scripting language called &ldquo;notation&rdquo; is used
to add code to objects, but in my experience, little coding is
needed compared to something like Visual Basic. The entire product
is object-oriented, with object inheritance and powerful class
libraries.</p><p>

</p><p>Two of the most time saving widgets included with Studio are
those for database access and web-based applications.</p><p>The Database widget creates a connection to a database within
your application, allowing you to view, add and delete records. The
database can reside on several types of servers including Oracle,
Sybase, Microsoft SQL, IBM's DB2, or any ODBC-compliant database
server. All the details are taken care of for you; just define a
form for the fields to appear in, and code the actions to take on
each piece of data that an end user works with.</p><p>Because the development platform is also the run-time engine,
you can use the database widget in real time to manage databases as
you develop an application. You can copy schemas (record layouts)
between tables or into your program, or move data between tables
located on different database servers (even if the servers are
running different database products).</p><p>Omnis Studio also includes a plug-in you can add to your
browser so that any application you write can be used within a
browser over the Web. To &ldquo;webify&rdquo; any application you've created,
just add a few widgets to the application. This does require you to
include the Studio application on the system running the web server
(Apache on Linux or IIS on Windows), plus you must add the Studio
plug-in to each client's browser, but the ability to rapidly turn
Linux into a true application server may be reason enough for some
developers to give Studio a try.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13a1580.0x149a9a0"></a>Prototype? What Prototype?</h2></div></div><p>The biggest advantage I've seen with using Studio is that the
prototype I create using the application wizard, standard widgets
and a little bit of scripting is a working program which I can
begin testing. If my &ldquo;prototype&rdquo; requires some tweaking to fit
the project description or client requests, I can do that
immediately and even re-deploy the application via the Web to
people who are already using it. Automatic updates is a feature not
all developers will need, but creating a prototype that with a
little polishing turns into a working program is something any
overworked developer can appreciate.</p><p>You can get a full copy of Omnis Studio for $149. That
doesn't include any printed manuals, but all of the documentation
(several thousand pages) is included on the CD. Separate printed
documentation sets are available if you need one. Several free
downloads are available from the Omnis Software web site, including
additional database support modules, an evaluation version of Omnis
Studio, and the web plug-in (so you can try existing applications
at the web site using your browser). A limited edition of Omnis
Studio 2.4 is also included with Caldera's OpenLinux 2.4 eDesktop
product.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13a1580.0x149ab00"></a>The Catches</h2></div></div><p>Okay, so I'm very impressed with Omnis Studio. But a couple
of flags need to be raised as well. First, the learning curve with
this product can be steep. Maybe this is best expressed as &ldquo;easy
to understand, difficult to master&rdquo;, which of course is much like
Linux itself. Studio uses a proprietary scripting language and a
number of &ldquo;wizards&rdquo; and widgets of its own design. All this is
similar to products like Visual Basic, but Studio has its own way
of doing things. If you're willing to put some work into learning
the product, you can generate amazing results; if you just tinker,
you're unlikely to even scratch the surface of what the product can
do. Omnis is working hard to make it easier to learn their product,
and they have a terrific group of experienced developers who help
each other via the Net. In addition, the documentation is solidly
written and full of complete examples, included on the product
CD-ROM.</p><p>The other big catch is that this is true commercial software.
It comes with a heritage of big UNIX and Windows installations at
Fortune 500 companies. Although Omnis has lowered their prices
significantly as they enter the Linux market, the product is really
intended for internal or consultant-oriented development at medium
to large companies. To that end, you must pay a run-time engine
license fee for each workstation on which you deploy the
application you write. It's a small fee, on the order of $10, but
it's certainly not open source. On the other hand, when you're
under the gun to create a powerful program with a ridiculous
deadline, it's a price you may be happy to pay.</p><p><a href="4213s1.html" target="_self">The Good/The Bad</a></p></div></div>
