The Apache Web Server
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11fb580.0x12f3870"></a></h2></div></div><p>Apache has been the most popular web
server on the Internet since April of 1996. The Netcraft February
2000 Web Server Survey found that over 58% of the web sites on the
Internet are using Apache, thus making it more widely used than all
other web servers combined. This success can be attributed to the
fact that Apache provides a robust and commercial-grade reference
implementation of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). Also, it
is reliable, configurable, highly scalable, well documented, open
source and free.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11fb580.0x12f3978"></a>Getting Started</h2></div></div><p>First, you must have Apache and the
<span   class="bold"><b>htpasswd</b></span> utility installed on your
Linux machine. If you do not, you can download the latest copy of
Apache (version 1.3.12 is available now) from the Apache
Organization web site and install it on your machine. htpasswd
comes with Apache.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11fb580.0x12f3ad8"></a>The Authentication Process</h2></div></div><p></p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4013f1.large.jpg"><img src="4013f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1. Sending User Credentials</p></div></div>
</p><p>Authentication is a simple yet very important principle&mdash;the
client sends its name and password to the server (see Figure 1).
Apache checks if the credentials are valid, and if so, returns the
requested page (see Figure 2).</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4013f2.large.jpg"><img src="4013f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 2. Access is Granted</p></div></div>
</p><p>If the user is not allowed to access the page or the supplied
password is not valid, Apache returns a 401 status (i.e.,
unauthorized access). The browser will then ask the user to retry
their user name and password (see Figure 3).</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4013f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>Figure 3. Failed Access</p></div></div>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11fb580.0x12f42c0"></a>Restricting Access Methods</h2></div></div><p>Restricting access to documents is usually done based on
either the host name of the browser or user credentials (user name
and password). The decision to adopt either method depends on your
environment settings. For example, if you want to restrict
documents within a limited environment such as a department, you
can use the client host name. Otherwise, if you want to grant
access on an individual basis, or if the people who are allowed
access are dispersed, you would then require a user name and a
password.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11fb580.0x12f43c8"></a>Restricting Access by User Name and
Password</h2></div></div><p>In order to set user authentication using a user name and a
password, we need to follow two steps. First, we create a file
containing the user names and passwords. Then, we inform the server
which resources are to be protected and which users are allowed to
access them.</p><p>The first step towards configuring authentication is to set
up a list of users and their corresponding passwords. This list is
saved in a file called, for example, users. This file should not be
saved under the root directory for security reasons. Therefore, for
my setup, I saved it under /etc/httpd. For an organized setting,
you can create a directory under /etc/httpd, perhaps called
users-files, and save the file in it. The file format is similar to
the standard UNIX password file, consisting of a list of user names
and an encrypted password for each, separated by a colon.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11fb580.0x12f4528"></a>The htpasswd Utility Mini-HOWTO</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>htpasswd</b></span> is a utility
supplied with the Apache package that allows us to create a user's
file containing user passwords in order to add or modify them. On
my machine, powered by Red Hat 6.1, Apache 1.3.9 and htpasswd were
installed as part of the standard installation. To see how htpasswd
works, type htpasswd at the shell prompt and the following messages
will be returned:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Usage:
htpasswd [-cmdps] passwordfile username&lt;\n&gt;
htpasswd -b[cmdps] passwordfile username password
-c Create a new file.&lt;\n&gt;
-m Force MD5 encryption of the password.
-d Force CRYPT encryption of the password (default).
-p Do not encrypt the password (plaintext).
-s Force SHA encryption of the password.
-b Use the password from the command line rather than prompting for it.
On Windows and TPF systems the '-m' flag is used by default.
On all other systems, the '-p' flag will probably not work.
</pre><p>According to the usage statement, to create a new users file
and add the user ibrahim to the file /etc/httpd/users, we type the
following command:
<pre     class="programlisting">
htpasswd -c -b /etc/httpd/users ibrahim <i  >LJ</i>*2000-ih
</pre>


The <b  >-c</b> flag is only used the first time we use
htpasswd to create a new users file. When we run htpasswd with the
<b  >-b</b> flag (please see the Security Issues
section), we will not be prompted to enter a password for ibrahim
since it was passed from the command line. Other users can be added
to the existing file in the same way, except that the
<b  >-c</b> argument is not needed since the file already
exists. If this option is used when adding other users, the file is
over written and the old users are lost.

Sample User Password File
</p></div></div>
</p><p>After I created a &ldquo;web account&rdquo; for myself, I added a few
other accounts and my /etc/httpd/users file looked like:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ibrahim:40gvm/lYXsk4a
chady:XygEnj0pSDx9A
julie:3zwRh<i  >LJ</i>Drr/9s
carla:IfPYPtrekJLxE
karine:jeM9XkbalFaTA
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11fb580.0x12f4c08"></a>Configuring the Server</h2></div></div><p>Now that the password file has been created, the server must
be notified that access will be restricted based on the user names
and passwords found in this file (/etc/httpd/users). This
protection method provides access control to individual files as
well as to directories and their subdirectories. The directives to
create the protected area can be placed either in a .htaccess file
in the directory to be protected, or in a &lt;Directory&gt; section
in the access.conf file (located in /etc/httpd/conf).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11fb580.0x12eb5a0"></a>Restricting Directories Using .htaccess</h2></div></div><p>To restrict a directory from within a .htaccess file, first
ensure that the access.conf file allows user authentication to be
set up in a .htaccess file. This is controlled by the
<b  >AuthConfig</b> override. The access.conf file should
include <b  >AllowOverride AuthConfig</b> to allow the
authentication directives to be contained in a .htaccess file. Now,
to restrict a directory to any user listed in the password file,
create a .htaccess file (inside the directory to be protected)
containing the following directives:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
AuthName "Confidential"
AuthType Basic
AuthUserFile /etc/httpd/users
require valid-user
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11fb580.0x12eb7b0"></a>.htaccess Contents Description</h2></div></div><p>The <b  >AuthName</b> directive specifies a realm
name for this protection. Once a user has entered a valid user name
and password, any other resources within the realm name can be
accessed with the same user name and password. This can be used to
create several areas that share the same user name and
password.</p><p>The <b  >AuthType</b> directive tells the server
which protocol is to be used for authentication. Another method,
<b  >Digest</b>, offering higher security features, is
also available in the <span   class="bold"><b>mod_digest</b></span>
module. Using MD5 Digest authentication is quite simple. Set up
authentication using <b  >AuthType Digest</b> and an
<b  >AuthDigestFile</b> instead of the normal
<b  >AuthType Basic</b> and
<b  >AuthUserFile</b>. Everything else should remain the
same.</p><p>The <b  >AuthUserFile</b> directive tells the
server the location of the user file created by htpasswd.
Similarly, when using a group file (described in the next section),
use the <b  >AuthGroupFile</b> directive to tell the
server the location of a group's file.</p><p>Last, the <b  >require</b> directive tells the
server which user names from the file are valid for particular
access methods. In this example, the argument
<b  >valid-user</b> tells the server that any user name
in the password file can be used. However, we can configure it to
allow only specific users. An example of this would be:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
require ibrahim julie carla
</pre><p>This directive allows only ibrahim, julie and carla to access
the documents after they enter a correct password. If any other
user tries to access this directory, even with the correct
password, they would be denied. This approach is very useful for
two reasons:
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Different areas of the server can be restricted to
different people with the same password file.</p></li><li><p>If a user is allowed to access different areas, he
has to remember only a single password.</p></li></ul></div>

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11fb580.0x12ec048"></a>Using a Group File</h2></div></div><p>In some cases, we want to allow only selected users to access
a particular directory. A lazy way of doing this is by listing all
the allowed user names on the <b  >require</b> line. This
is not encouraged since, if there are many users, the file will
become quite large. Luckily, there is a nice way around this
problem&mdash;using a group file which operates in a similar way to
standard UNIX groups. Any particular user can be a member of any
number of groups. We can then use the <b  >require</b>
directive line to restrict users to one or more particular groups.
For example, we could create a group called research-staff
containing users who are allowed to access the research department
pages. To restrict access to just users in the research-staff
group, we would use this directive:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
require group research-staff
</pre><p>Multiple groups can also be listed, and <b  >require
user</b> can also be given, in which case any user in any of
the listed groups, or any user listed explicitly, can access the
resource. For example:
<pre     class="programlisting">
require group research-staff admin-staff
require user julia carla
</pre>


allows any user in group research-staff or group admin-staff, or
both users julia and carla, to access this resource after entering
a valid password.
</p><p>A group file consists of lines giving a group name followed
by a space-separated list of users in that group. For
example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
research-staff:chady karine
admin-staff:ibrahim julie
</pre><p>The <b  >AuthGroupFile</b> directive is used to
tell the server the location of the group file. The catch with
using a group file is that the maximum line length within the group
file is 8KB. However, to get around this limit, we can have more
than one line with the same group name within the file.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11fb580.0x12ec4c0"></a>Potential Slowdowns</h2></div></div><p>Using a plaintext file to maintain user names and passwords
is easy and straightforward. Nevertheless, employing this method
with a large number of users causes a lot of processing at the
server side to search the file for the credentials in question;
this adds to the server load. Moreover, processing has to be done
for every request inside the protected area; even though the user
only enters their password once, the server has to re-authenticate
them on every request due to the stateless nature of HTTP.
Therefore, the server does not remember any information about a
request once it has finished and must resend the user name and
password on each request.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11fb580.0x12ec5c8"></a>Faster Access</h2></div></div><p>Much faster access is possible using DBM format files. This
allows the server to do a very quick lookup of names, without
having to read through a large text file. The slight drawback of
this method is the complexity of managing DBM files as compared to
managing plaintext files. There are various add-on modules which
allow user information to be stored in databases. Aside from the
DBM format <span   class="bold"><b>(mod_auth_dbm</b></span>), user
and group lists can be stored in DB format files
(<span   class="bold"><b>mod_auth_db</b></span>). Full databases can
also be used such as mSQL
(<span   class="bold"><b>mod_auth_msql</b></span>), Postgres95
(<span   class="bold"><b>mod_auth_pg95</b></span>) or any
DBI-compatible database
(<span   class="bold"><b>mod_auth_dbi</b></span>).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11fb580.0x12ec888"></a>Security Issues</h2></div></div><p>There are a couple of security considerations regarding the
password files managed by htpasswd. First, files containing users'
information such as /etc/httpd/users, should be outside the web
space of the server&mdash;they must not be fetchable by a browser.
Secondly, the use of the <b  >-b</b> flag with htpasswd
as shown in Figure 4, is discouraged since when used, the
unencrypted password appears on the screen.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11fb580.0x12ec9e8"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>Authentication is vital and necessary for most web servers.
Apache has proven its reliability, and has an excellent record of
stable performance and trustworthy security. Using Apache's
authentication features, we can combine a cost-effective way to
secure our documents using the most popular web sever running on
Linux.</p><p><a href="4013s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
