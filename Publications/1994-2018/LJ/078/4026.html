<a href="http://www.easysoft.com" target="_self">http://www.easysoft.com/</a></p></li><li><p>Price: Free for single users, commercial licenses

applications that use it. With Easysoft's products, you can access
any ODBC data source from just about any computer system, and you
can allow access to many Linux databases from ODBC clients. To use
real-world examples, you can access Access on a Win98 desktop from
your Linux web server, or your MySQL database from Excel.</p><p>Very few assumptions are made about what you will do with
that data once you have it. Use it with PHP or iHTML, write custom
C code, access it from Python or Perl or a Java applet; Easysoft
doesn't care.</p><p>Easysoft provides a combination of their own ODBC-ODBC bridge
software to allow access to remote database servers, and unixODBC
1.8.10 to access Linux database software. Access to SQL databases
is through Easysoft's SQL-ODBC gateway package. This
standardization on ODBC for all database access gives two important
benefits: your programs will be totally free of database-specific
dependencies, and you can seamlessly access multiple databases
without special code. Not only databases, you can access any data
source that has an ODBC driver.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x281c580.0x29149d0"></a>Installation</h2></div></div><p>On Easysoft's web page (http://www.easysoft.com/), they claim
you can install their ODBC-ODBC bridge in one to two minutes. They
aren't far off. It actually took closer to five minutes, but
perhaps I was having a slow day.</p><p>Easysoft supports Linux as just one of about a dozen
platforms, and they obviously know having a distribution that works
regardless of one's system type is very important. In the Linux
arena, they have libc5 and glibc 2.1 versions for Intel x86 and
Alpha processors. Installation is done without the use of a system
package tool and requires superuser access, because several new
libraries are added and files in your /etc directory are changed.
All files are placed in the /usr/local/easysoft directory. If
downloaded from Easysoft's web page, the software is packaged in a
compressed tar file and installation is a two-step process. First,
you must unpack the obscenely long-named tar file, change to the
newly created directory and run the <b  >install</b>
script.</p><p>The install script is a model of how self-installing Linux
programs should behave. You are asked a series of questions about
which components you would like installed, what directory to place
the files in and how everything should be set up. Given the quality
of the installation script, very little would be gained by using
distribution-specific package tools, and Easysoft's already
daunting array of download options would increase
unnecessarily.</p><p>One stage of the setup includes running Easysoft's license
management software. This application collects personal information
about you and how you will use the product, and contacts Easysoft's
servers through the Internet to request a license key. If you don't
have an Internet connection, you can print out the collected data
and mail it to Easysoft via real-space mail.</p><p>The Easysoft's installation script installs unixODBC.
Easysoft listens on port 8888 for ODBC requests and 8890 for HTTP
requests.</p><p>Easysoft's package is made up of separate client/server
applications. The clients and servers are a rather mix-and-match
affair. You can run a Windows server and Linux clients, or Linux
and OpenVMS servers and Java clients (using the ODBC-JDBC bridge),
or whatever your application demands. For most users, the servers
would be installed on the company database server computers, and
the clients would end up wherever the data was needed. This could
be your web server, a desktop computer running a database client
application, or both. This gives you great flexibility in choosing
your data sources, and even allows some unlikely combinations like
using spreadsheets on desktop computers as data sources for
dynamically updating web pages.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x281c580.0x2914ce8"></a>Using the Software</h2></div></div><p>Easysoft's tools are designed to facilitate getting data for
your applications, not writing them. In fact, they don't really
even provide the API. If you know how to use database tools,
Easysoft's products will give you access to a wider range of data
sources. If you don't, they provide some tutorial information to
point you in the right direction, but that's about it.</p><p>The APIs you use are specific to your language or development
environment, not Easysoft's product. Most aren't that complicated,
but it is totally a matter of what tools you are using. If writing
PHP scripts, you connect to your databases with the PHP ODBC
support. A command such as
<b  >@odbc_pconnect(&lt;datasource&gt;, &lt;username&gt;,
&lt;password&gt; )</b> establishes the connection to the data
source, returning a string if the connection is successful. Once
connected, you request data by assembling a string with your query,
and running another API command to execute it. If you are writing
in Perl, you use the DBM::ODBC API to access the data sources. If
your development tools include an ODBC API, chances are you can use
Easysoft's tools to provide access to a wider range of data
sources.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x281c580.0x2914ea0"></a>Licensing</h2></div></div><p>The Easysoft OOB client is free for use with any OOB server
you have a license for. That means you can install clients on any
computer in your office without having to worry about specific
licenses. Oddly, you are licensed to use the OOB client only with
servers you own and control. You can't use the OOB client to access
another company's server. Easysoft's own demonstration application
seems to cause people to unwittingly violate the client license.
There is also a limitation on incorporating the client in any
program or system you receive payment for the use of without
written permission. I'm sure that wasn't the intent, but it could
possibly be read to say that you need written permission to charge
for access to a web page with scripts that use Easysoft's client.
This would limit its usefulness in some applications.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x281c580.0x2914fa8"></a>Documentation and Getting Help</h2></div></div><p>Easysoft provides very complete documentation to help you get
started doing real work. Included with the software are
instructions for getting Apache and PHP installed, or working with
Applixware, or Perl DBD::ODBC, or ColdFusion, or a few other
commonly used configurations. The FAQ contains a lot of questions,
some of which I can't imagine are all that frequently asked. There
are also tutorials and sample applications to get you started
writing code.</p><p>Easysoft maintains a newsgroup for support questions, with
technical staff monitoring the group and answering
questions.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x281c580.0x2915108"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>Easysoft offers a lot to developers who need to add uniform
data access to existing programs, or develop data-aware
applications for web or client/server deployment. The wide range of
both clients and servers allows you to integrate complex networks
without writing a lot of special code. Easysoft allows you to
download and try out their software before you buy. With their
thirty-day trial, you can access all of the features, including
multiple database servers. A single-user, single-database license
is free for personal use.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Born at the beginning of the microcomputer age,
