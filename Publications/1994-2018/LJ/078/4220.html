Linux kernel mailing list that talked about Linux on the desktop.
Of course, people discussed why Linux had a long way to go on the
desktop (no one thought it was ready). I didn't jump in with both
feet, since I thought the thread was off-topic to begin with for
the already-busy kernel list, but I must disagree. The focus of the
conversation was on a lack of certain things like applications and
desktop simplicity.
</p><p>Well, I converted an entire school computer lab (33
computers) to Linux just recently, and it looks like there is more
to come. I've found that, properly installed and configured, Linux
on the desktop is easier for students and teachers to use (and a
lot less frustrating) than anything they've used before. The secret
is simplicity, since every app I can think of except Quicken has a
viable alternative. While I installed Caldera (the distribution is
really unimportant), the desktop is not KDE (Caldera's default). I
had to put together a couple of simple shell programs attached to
icons for the nontechnically inclined teachers, but nothing
difficult, and the students haven't found the games (yet). They're
so happy with it, they're talking about converting everything, not
just this one lab.</p><p>So don't underestimate Linux on the desktop. I've found that
once it's installed for the technologically challenged user,
they're much happier than with any other system they've used. And
those users couldn't install a Microsoft OS anyway; they're just
using what comes with the system&mdash;all I provided was a viable
alternative. Not bad for a guerrilla operating system.</p><p>sgalaAlive:
<a href="http://www.sgala.com" target="_self">http://www.sgala.com/</a></p><p>Have some processes you need to keep running? I know it's no
fun to find your web or ftp server down. This Perl script can take
care of making sure any essential services stay up, and notify you
by e-mail when they are restarted. Makes it very simple to keep
track of when services go down. And this particular program is
almost too easy to install and configure. It requires Perl, cron
(suggested).</p><p>Build Your Linux Disk:
<a href="http://byld.sourceforge.net" target="_self">http://byld.sourceforge.net/</a></p><p>You've probably seen a number of boot/root disks out there
that can be used as rescue disks. You may even have one. But, have
you ever wanted one with your favorite utilities on it, not someone
else's favorites? Then you've got to roll your own. BYLD, Build
Your Linux Disk, can help you do just that. And in case everything
won't quite fit on one disk, the author includes information on
making your disk slightly larger. In fact, a 1680K disk is standard
in the config file (just look in /dev for some common sizes, like
1760 or even 1840). It requires bash, a number of common system
functions, kernel sources.</p><p>Checkout:
<a href="http://www.draenor.org/checkout" target="_self">http://www.draenor.org/checkout/</a></p><p>A very simple checkin-checkout system for a company. Supports
&ldquo;views&rdquo; based on departments. You can tell quickly where someone
is (in/out) and the reason (if they've bothered to say). Will
require some small tweaks to the HTML code, unless you're satisfied
with the very plain interface provided. It requires a web browser,
web server with PHP and MySQL support, MySQL.</p><p>Pronto Mail:
<a href="http://www.muhri.net/pronto" target="_self">http://www.muhri.net/pronto/</a></p><p>Pronto Mail is a spinoff of the GTK-based mail client
CSCMail, reviewed here a few months ago. The CSCMail authors have
decided to move to C, so some users of CSCMail who like Perl have
moved the Perl version along. One good aspect of Pronto is the
simple install. If you want to use anything but CSV (MySQL,
PostgreSQL, mSQL, etc.), you'll need to create a blank database
with the user's name (and permissions for the user). Other than
that, Pronto is self-installing, including downloading.
Good-looking and stable. It requires Perl, Perl modules:
Gtk::XmHTML, Date::Manip, DBI, Text::CSV_XS, SQL::Statement,
DBD::CSV, MIME::Base64, HTML::Parser, IO::Wrap, MIME::Parser,
Mail::Header, MIME::Types, URI::URL, IO::Socket,
Lingua::Ispell.</p><p>passwdgen:
<a href="http://members.home.com/denisl/passwdgen" target="_self">members.home.com/denisl/passwdgen</a></p><p>I've used several password-generation programs. Until
recently, I used makepasswd. But passwdgen has a few switches that
allow you to decide if you want passwords to be all uppercase, all
lowercase, all numbers, or printable characters and not numbers or
letters. You can mix and match the switches to generate a
remarkably difficult password. You can also specify passwords that
can be typed with just the left or right hand (obviously this works
only on a standard QWERTY keyboard). It requires glibc.</p><p>Simple Network TOP:
<a href="http://sntop.sourceforge.net" target="_self">http://sntop.sourceforge.net/</a></p><p>Do you have a large number of hosts to monitor? Need to know
only if they're up or down (not whether a particular service is
running)? This utility is quick and easy to set up. It also has a
secure mode that allows it to run on a console with the command
keys disabled. Or, if you prefer HTML output, there's a switch to
provide it. sntop uses fping to probe, so it won't put much of a
load on your system or the network. It requires ncurses,
glibc.</p><p>Subnetwork Explorer:
<a href="http://cyest.org" target="_self">http://cyest.org/</a></p><p>Most of us should be familiar with nmap, but it's a bit heavy
just to keep an eye out for a quick check of &ldquo;is someone running a
rogue ftp site on the network?&rdquo; type scan. Netxplorer gives you a
way to make a quick check of a very few servers, currently
anonymous FTP, SUNRPC and NetBios file sharing, although more will
certainly be added in the future. A quick netxplorer of a class C
subnet takes only seconds, as compared to several minutes for nmap,
which you really should use if your needs are for a detailed
network scan. It requires glibc.</p></div></div>
