Security&rdquo;.</p><p>This book is the result of an iterative process of consulting
with experts in the field of computer and network security. The
list of contributors includes staff at well-known organizations
like the Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) and the U.S.
Census Bureau, so it is more than just the two main authors'
expertise&mdash;it is a collaborative effort of 48 experts.</p><p>It is not simply a theoretical book on computer security.
First, it details only one Linux distribution, Red Hat 6.0. Users
of other distributions will be able to use the book as well, but
they will need to fudge things according to the differences between
their distribution and Red Hat 6.0. Users of Mandrake
6.<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> should have no problem; users of Slackware
will have to adjust a lot of the information on system startup.
Debian users will probably find themselves scrambling to map all
the RPM package names to Debian package equivalents.</p><p>Second, it is a step-by-step walk through the process. The
authors don't simply say, &ldquo;remove package foo&rdquo;; they walk the
reader through the process of removing package foo, with the
complete command-line and system response for each command. It may
be only one or two steps, but they are there to show you exactly
what to type on the command line and what response to expect from
the system.</p><p>The book is entirely command-line-oriented. This is good, in
that the authors can show exactly what to do in each step. It also
means you get to do a lot of typing and careful checking of your
command lines. If you aren't already familiar with Bash's tab
completion, now is a good time to read up on it in the man
page.</p><p>Theory is minimal in this book. There is usually a brief
discussion of each group of command-line steps. Then the steps to
carry out are shown, interspersed with useful commentary.</p><p>The book is organized in a logical manner, starting with step
one on security policies, the physical security of the computer,
and a pre-installation check of the BIOS's security-related
features (e.g., turn off the ability to boot from floppy). Each
step is divided into sub-steps, so you can easily find an
appropriate sub-step for any aspect of security.</p><p>Step two, which would be chapter two in any other book, deals
with the installation of Linux. The authors cover pre-installation
security, where they point out that (for example) an FTP
installation from a public server on the Internet could leave your
computer compromised before the installation is complete.
Similarly, they discuss the security implications of
partitioning.</p><p>It's no surprise that the authors prefer the custom
installation of Red Hat over either workstation or server. Their
motto is &ldquo;When in doubt, leave it out&rdquo;, an excellent motto. If it
isn't there, it can't be cracked. The installation step continues
with password setup and some recommendations such as creating a
boot diskette. The book then shows how to set system access
policies and configure logging.</p><p>The next two chapters (excuse me&mdash;steps) are about securing a
workstation on a network and a server on a network. The server step
includes instructions for installing Secure SHell (SSH) tools,
which are far more secure than the &ldquo;r&rdquo; analogs (rlogin, rsh,
etc.), ftp or telnet. Other substeps show how to set up DNS,
electronic mail and several other services. The documentation on
securing Apache includes password protection and adding mod_ssl to
your Apache d&lt;\#230&gt;mon.</p><p>The process of securing a workstation includes disabling and
removing a number of standard d&lt;\#230&gt;mons, or limiting
access to those d&lt;\#230&gt;mons.</p><p>Step five deals with system tuning and packet firewalls. It
gives a brief introduction to IPCHAINS, and shows how to make,
install and test a strong ruleset.</p><p>Step six points the reader toward a number of tools for
network security, such as the (in)famous SATAN and its
descendants.</p><p>Appendix A has an excellent bibliography of Linux security
resources on the Internet. Appendix B is the stock Red Hat 6.0
/etc/inetd.conf. Appendix C is a System V-style startup script for
ssh, which fills a gap in at least two of the ssh products out
there. Appendix D is a 20-page script for a strong firewall
IPCHAINS ruleset, adapted for the book from David Ranch's highly
respected Trinty OS.</p><p>Appendix E is a script to modify the permissions of a number
of system utilities. The authors recommend you run it every time
you install Linux. It is worth studying to see how insecure the
authors find Linux to be.</p><p>The book is printed in an unusual format. It is spiral-bound,
standard (North American) letter-size paper. The unusual part is
that it is printed in landscape layout. The result is you see the
book as a 17 x 11-inch sheet of paper, with the binding across the
middle. This makes it possible to have a lot of information in
front of you while working at the keyboard. There is plenty of
white space for your notes. The effect was a bit disconcerting at
first, but I found it easy to work with and rather like it.</p><p>The steps are wellwritten, and I was able to walk through
several of the sub-steps. The only problems I had were caused by
other problems in the system, ones outside the scope of the book. I
was able to install ssh, for example, in minutes because the steps
in this book are better than the README file that came with one of
the distributions I tried.</p><p>One thing to keep in mind: while the book is a set of
step-by-step instructions, you will have to remain alert to your
own situation and local needs.</p><p>At first, I thought the scripts, especially the 20-page
IPCHAINS ruleset, were not available on the Net. Well, I am glad to
report that they are. The URL is carefully hidden away at the
beginning of Appendix A, which is not where the reader looking for,
say, Appendix D is going to look.</p><p>I recommend this book to professionals in the field. If you
are on the Internet with a firewall or any sort of server, you
should read it and take the steps appropriate to your situation. As
you do, check off each step completed so that you have a permanent
record of how you have customized your firewall.</p></div></div>
