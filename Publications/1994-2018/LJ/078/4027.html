inventory/product/sales database, and you are the one who makes it
go. You're the wizard, the head web-technology guru, the person
everyone turns to when something has to work. And your boss just
came into your office asking why on-line orders from your web site
are being e-mailed to salespeople for manual processing rather than
interfacing directly to your existing sales database. And, why
you've got customers ordering products that your inventory system
says you don't have; why customers can't search for products on
your web page; why you've got customers calling customer support to
find order status information that is easily available from, you
guessed it, the database. And on top of all that, your manager
wonders why a web designer is manually building web pages for each
new product that goes on the web page, even though (you guessed it)
the database has all the information the web page needs.
</p><p>Or maybe you are the boss, and you are doing the asking.
Either way, money is being spent to duplicate information from your
database on your web page, and jobs you've got software to handle
are being done manually. The result is subpar service and a subpar
web page, at extra cost.</p><p>Worse, potential customers see your web page every day. If it
isn't the slickest page around, and if your prices aren't the
lowest, those customers will go elsewhere to spend their money.
Slick and cheap wins in the e-commerce world. If you can't get your
costs down and your service up, <span   class="emphasis"><em>now</em></span>, your
customer base will go elsewhere. You don't have time to wait for a
C programmer to develop a custom database module for your web
page&mdash;you need a solution that works today.</p><p>Or maybe you are really starting from zero, and you don't
have a database system at all. You don't know what your inventory
is until you look, or what an order's status is until you find the
paperwork on someone's desk.</p><p>That is where data access middleware and on-line application
development systems come in. Simply put, data access middleware
provides a bridge between your user-level applications and your
database. On-line application development systems allow you to
rapidly develop web or client/server front-ends for your existing
database, or custom databases to match your front-end needs.</p><p>Magic Software Enterprises, or Magic, for short, has been
developing multi-platform data access middleware and on-line
application development tools for UNIX, AS/400, OpenVMS and Windows
users for years. Now, Magic's software, Magic Enterprise 8.3 and
Magic Toolkit 8.3, are available for Linux, recognizing Linux's
growing impact in the e-business and e-commerce market. Magic
Enterprise 8.3 provides the back end, and Magic Tool Kit 8.3
provides the rapid development environment for e-commerce and other
database-intensive applications. Between the two, you'll have
everything you need to make your boss happy, at least about your
database/web site integration.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1453580.0x154bc90"></a>Installation</h2></div></div><p>Installing Magic Enterprise v8.3 and Magic Toolkit on my Red
Hat 6.1 test system started out easy. There isn't much to it. Magic
supports Red Hat 6.0, 6.1, and SuSE 6.2 systems, distributing their
software in RPM package format. To install, you run
<span   class="bold"><b>rpm</b></span> with a few options, like the
package file name, and most of the work is done for you.</p><p>Not all of it, though. After the installation, you must
expand the user files into your user directory, and manually start
the server d&lt;\#230&gt;mons that make everything go. The
instructions detail the process well, but lack troubleshooting
information. If anything goes wrong, you are stuck with either
figuring it out yourself, contacting customer service or going to
Magic's on-line forum and asking other users.</p><p>Though the software is supplied as RPMs, it installs into the
/usr/local directory on your system as though it were manually
installed. That is a little odd, but causes no problems when using
the software.</p><p>The folks at Magic are seriously into the idea of making
money from their software. There is nothing wrong with that, but
preventing unauthorized use on the Internet is a trick. Magic's
solution to unlicensed users is a license server installed along
with their software to keep people honest, or at least harass them
if they aren't. It works; the license server gave me nothing but
trouble&mdash;a testament to its honesty-detection algorithm, but rather
frustrating if you are me.</p><p>The trouble continued until I gave up and started to e-mail
Magic's technical support people. Then, in a perfect example of
computer perversity, I ran the troublesome software one final time
to copy the exact error message into my e-mail, and it worked! I
have no idea what made it work, and I have no idea if it will work
for anyone else, but I was happy. (Being serious, if your system
host name has any periods in it, e.g., is a fully qualified domain
name, the license server will fail with a totally unhelpful error
message.)</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1453580.0x154bf50"></a>The Development Environment</h2></div></div><p>Magic provides an X-based integrated development environment
with a lot of handy features such as a concurrent version control
system, a WYSIYWYG user interface builder and a project management
system to make it easy to switch your development focus.</p><p>The interface is very database-like in feel; applications,
database tables, user-interface elements,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>everything</em></span> is viewed as a table. This makes
sense, considering that Magic's primary focus is working with
databases, but it will seem unfamiliar to people used to more
conventional programming environments. Of course, Magic isn't
really a programming environment. It is an application-generation
environment, so a lot of things will seem odd if you are expecting
to start coding.</p><p>Everything is a table, including the list of applications
themselves. When you go to create a new application, you start in
the Settings menu, and configure the application you want. Once it
is configured, you go to the File menu and open your new
application.</p><p>The development environment is totally separate from
traditional UNIX/Linux development tools. The version control
system is specific to Magic, the debugger is a Magic debugger,
everything is Magic. This allows Magic developers to seamlessly
cross platform boundaries. When you develop Magic applications, it
doesn't matter if you are working on Linux, Windows or an AS/400:
the application and the environment are the same.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1453580.0x154c1b8"></a>Writing Applications</h2></div></div><p>When it comes to writing applications, the language paradigm
is everything. If your language paradigm doesn't match the problems
you face, everything is harder. Magic deals in databases; Magic's
tools act like database tools. Magic's paradigm is the database.
For solving database problems, Magic works very well, but
programmers should be prepared to shift world views while learning
the system. It is not like programming in Perl.</p><p>Magic provides a web tutorial to guide you through developing
your first on-line application. If you don't go through the
tutorial, you will be lost from minute one. It isn't that Magic is
complicated or hard to use. Magic is not intuitive. It isn't hard,
either, but the user interface and application development paradigm
are unique enough that you can't count on experience to let you
fake knowledge of the system.</p><p>In Magic, you create a database, define the queries and then
design the user interfaces. Magic's intelligence shows because it
encourages you to design your database before you worry about the
trivial stuff like how the web page is going to look. It is also
handy because by the time you get to the user interface, almost
everything is done; and since Magic automatically generates and
publishes the HTML, by the time you finish the interface,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>everything</em></span> is done. Following the tutorial
takes about an hour, and when you are done, you will have the start
of an e-commerce site that would be an improvement for many on-line
retailers. With Magic, a demo and a working program may be just a
link apart.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1453580.0x154c3c8"></a>Putting Your Work to Work</h2></div></div><p>Magic's strength is in getting real-world web and
client/server applications up and running quickly, and running
fast. Calling Magic &ldquo;Data Access Middleware&rdquo;, or an &ldquo;Application
Development System&rdquo;, or any other simple one-line name risks
losing sight of what Magic is for: to make database interfacing
easy and scalable. Even that risks oversimplifying things. Perhaps
it is: to put the thousand-order-per-minute e-commerce site within
reach of the three college students and a venture capitalist that
are going to revolutionize on-line sales. Or, to make the
ten-thousand-billion-product on-line catalog a one-month project,
rather than a life's work. Maybe even to make securely
incorporating on-line ordering to your existing database system a
seamless extension of what you are already doing, rather than a
redesign of your entire business model.</p><p>The question you should ask yourself is whether the cost of a
super-slick, do-everything database/application generator system
will pay for itself the way you plan to use it.</p><p>The Magic Enterprise 8.3 server allows you to expand your
existing capabilities or add new capabilities, keeping the process
as seamless as possible. From interfacing to multiple database
systems to load balancing across servers to dynamically
partitioning client/server applications, Magic makes the real-world
job of keeping a big system running a manageable task. Magic knows
this, too, and they know the value of rapid development and
scalable deployment. The Magic development kit for Linux is
available for an introductory price of $299 US, and single-user
licenses for Magic Enterprise 8.3 are free, but licenses for
additional users will cost you. When evaluating application
development environments and run-time systems, you've got to look
at what you will save and what new abilities you will have. If your
project would take six months using conventional and free tools
like PHP3, or a month using Magic, the extra licensing expense may
be more than offset by the savings in development costs.</p><p>And if getting big database access jobs done fast is
important to your bottom line, Magic may be just what you
need.</p><p><a href="4027s1.html" target="_self">The Good, The Bad</a></p></div></div>
