hours a day, and it is no longer a question of whether they will be
attacked, but when. The first line of defense against a break-in is
a firewall, and an open OS such as Linux can be used to create a
very secure one. While newer distributions try to make it easier to
create firewalls, you still need to know some information so you
can create one that can do its job well.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Building Linux and OpenBSD Firewalls</em></span>
attempts to provide you with enough information to determine your
security needs and create a firewall to meet them. According to the
introduction, it &ldquo;is a cookbook for building firewalls using Red
Hat Linux 6.0 and OpenBSD 2.5&rdquo; and &ldquo;contains step-by-step
instructions on exactly how to build a very useful and powerful
firewall from scratch&rdquo;.</p><p>Even though it provides step-by-step instructions for
creating and tuning a firewall, the authors believe your firewall
will be more secure if you know what is being secured. To this end,
the first three chapters cover basic network security issues. The
first chapter discusses topics such as what you are protecting
(your data, your computers and your reputation) and the value of
good passwords. Chapter 2 provides a brief explanation of how the
Internet works, covers protocols such as IP, TCP and UDP, and
describes the common exploits against them. The third chapter
explains some basic network configurations for a firewall and helps
you determine which services should be provided by your network.
These chapters also talk briefly about web browsers and
Microsoft-specific problems such as Back Orifice.</p><p>The next two chapters are on choosing an OS and the hardware
to use for your firewall. The authors provide a brief history of
UNIX and free software, explain the differences between the GPL and
BSD licenses, and offer comparisons between Red Hat Linux 6.0 and
OpenBSD for such factors as software availability, ease of
installation and general security. They also talk about building
your firewall computer from the ground up so you know for sure what
is in it and what to do when you have to open it up to fix
something. They point out that you won't need bleeding-edge or
high-performance hardware for the majority of your firewall
situations, and provide some information on troubleshooting any
hardware problems you might encounter.</p><p>Chapters 6 and 7 cover the installation of Red Hat Linux 6.0
and the steps you need to take to configure it as a firewall. The
installation instructions are basically notes and enhancements to
the Red Hat manual. The book then introduces ipchains and firewall
rules and explains how to enable IP masquerading. A basic firewall
script for ipchains is provided, along with instructions for
starting up the firewall every time the computer boots.</p><p>Installing OpenBSD and configuring IPFilter are the subjects
of the next two chapters. The book goes into more detail on
installing OpenBSD than it does for Red Hat, including the creation
of a boot floppy and hard-drive partitioning. Instructions on
configuring the system to use your modem, mounting your CD-ROM and
optimizing the kernel for firewalling are also given. The
directions for configuring IPFilter follow the same path as the
instructions on configuring ipchains, including an explanation of
the book's basic firewall script and how to start the firewall when
the machine boots. OpenBSD tools such as IPNAT, IPFTEST, IPFSTAT
and IPMON are also introduced in these chapters.</p><p>After explaining how to get your firewall up and running, the
book moves on to the process of tuning it to be more effective.
Specific firewall policies such as protecting against spoofed
packets and blocking particular TCP services are given, with
instructions on configuring both a Linux and an OpenBSD firewall to
implement the policy. The book also explains how to determine what
services your firewall is currently providing and how to shut down
any you don't want to provide to the outside world.</p><p>Next, the authors cover intrusion detection and response.
They discuss what to do during an attack, and how to evaluate the
attack when it is over. They offer different scenarios for a home
network, a network in a small business, and a large corporate
network. This chapter also talks about monitoring your network, the
importance of log files, and introduces tools such as SATAN and
Tripwire to help you secure your network.</p><p>The final chapter is a hodge-podge of information. It
includes notes on information from the earlier chapters, a brief
introduction to the vi editor, and talks about the importance of
having a security policy. Finally, it contains two small scripts:
one to remove a disk set from OpenBSD and one to start your
firewall under Red Hat Linux.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Building Linux and OpenBSD Firewalls</em></span>
covers quite a bit of ground in its twelve chapters. Almost
one-half of the book is dedicated to Internet and network theory,
but I still found this information relevant. After all, how can you
build a secure firewall if you don't understand how it works and
what it can protect? The authors attempt to make the subject matter
easier to digest by using liberal doses of humor, although this
occasionally makes the book hard to read. They also provide
diagrams and sidebars to help explain complicated concepts. The
authors provide a web site containing more Linux and OpenBSD
scripts for firewalling, along with errata and updates for the
book.</p><p>I found this book informative and useful. If you have a
dedicated Internet connection or if you want to protect your small
business from hackers, I think this book will help you.</p></div></div>
