    Decreasing the vulnerability of your DNS server is largely a matter
    of staying current and private.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b2a580.0x1c22608"></a></h2></div></div><p>In the SANS Institute's recent consensus
document &ldquo;How to Eliminate the Ten Most Critical Internet Security
Threats&rdquo;
(<a href="http://www.sans.org/topten.htm" target="_self">www.sans.org/topten.htm</a>),
the number-one category of vulnerabilities reported by survey
participants was BIND weaknesses. BIND, of course, is the
open-source software package that powers the majority of Internet
DNS servers. In fact, again according to SANS, over 50% of BIND
installations are vulnerable to well-known (and in many cases, old)
exploits.
</p><p>The good news is that armed with the simple concepts and
techniques I'm about to describe, you can quickly and easily
enhance BIND's security on your Linux (or other UNIX) DNS server.
Since our focus here will be security, if you're an absolute BIND
beginner you may wish to first start reading the BIND online
documentation (see Conclusions, at end) or the first chapter or two
of Albitz and Liu's book <span   class="emphasis"><em>DNS and BIND.</em></span></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b2a580.0x1c22818"></a>BIND Basics</h2></div></div><p>Having said that, let's begin with a brief look at how the
Domain Name Service and BIND work. Suppose someone
(myhost.someisp.com in Figure 1) is surfing the Web, and wishes to
view the site
<a href="http://www.wiremonkeys.org" target="_self">http://www.wiremonkeys.org/</a>.
Suppose, also, that person's machine is configured to use the name
server &ldquo;ns.isp.com&rdquo; for DNS lookups. Since the name
www.wiremonkeys.org has no meaning to the routers through which the
web query and its responses will pass, the user's web browser needs
to learn www.wiremonkeys.org's IP address before attempting the
query.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4198f1.large.jpg"><img src="4198f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1. myhost.someisp.com</p></div></div>
</p><p>First, &ldquo;myhost&rdquo; asks &ldquo;ns&rdquo; whether it knows the IP
address. Since ns.someisp.com isn't authoritative for
wiremonkeys.org and hasn't recently communicated for any host that
is, it begins a query of its own on the user's behalf. The process
of making one or more queries in order to answer other queries is
called <span   class="bold"><b>recursion</b></span>.</p><p>ns.someisp.com begins its recursive query by asking a &ldquo;root
name server&rdquo; for the IP address of some host that's authoritative
for the zone wiremonkeys.org. (All Internet DNS servers use a
static &ldquo;hints&rdquo; file to identify the thirteen or so official root
name servers. This list is maintained at
<a href="ftp://ftp.rs.internic.net/domain" target="_self">ftp.rs.internic.net/domain</a>
and is called named.root.) In our example, ns asks
E.ROOT-SERVERS.NET (an actual root server, with a current IP
address of 192.203.230.10), who replies that DNS for
wiremonkeys.org is handled by &ldquo;ns-wiremonkeys.wiremonkeys.org&rdquo;,
with an IP address of 55.100.55.100.</p><p>ns then asks ns-wiremonkeys for the IP address of
www.wiremonkeys.org. ns-wiremonkeys returns the answer
(55.100.55.200), which ns forwards back to myhost.someisp.com.
Finally, myhost contacts 55.100.55.200 directly via HTTP and
performs the web query.</p><p>This is the most common type of name lookup. It and other
single-host type lookups are simply called &ldquo;queries&rdquo;; DNS queries
are handled on UDP port 53.</p><p>Not all DNS transactions involve single-host lookups,
however. Sometimes it is necessary to transfer entire name-domain
(zone) databases: this is called a zone transfer, and it happens
when you issue an <span   class="bold"><b>ls</b></span> command from
the nslookup utility, or run <span   class="bold"><b>dig</b></span>.
The main purpose of zone transfers, however, is for name servers
that are authoritative for the same domain to stay in sync with
each other (e.g., for &ldquo;master to slave&rdquo; updates). Zone transfers
are handled on TCP port 53.</p><p>The last general DNS concept we'll touch on here is caching.
Name servers cache all local zone files (i.e., their hints file
plus all zone information for which they are authoritative), plus
the results of all recursive queries they've performed since their
last startup. That is, almost all: each resource record (RRs) has
(or inherits their zone-file's default) time-to-live settings.
These settings determine how long each RR can be cached before
being refreshed.</p><p>This, of course, is only a fraction of what one needs to
learn in order to fully understand and use BIND. I haven't even
mentioned forwarders or reverse lookups. Hopefully, it's enough for
the purposes of discussing BIND security.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b2a580.0x1c22f50"></a>DNS Security Principles</h2></div></div><p>DNS security can be distilled into two maxims: always run the
latest version of your chosen DNS software package, and never
provide unnecessary information or services to strangers. Put
another way, keep current and be stingy!</p><p>This translates into a number of specific techniques. The
first is to limit or even disable recursion. Limiting it is easy to
do using configuration-file parameters; disabling recursion
altogether may or may not be possible, depending on the name
server's role.</p><p>If, for example, the server is an &ldquo;external&rdquo; DNS server
with the sole purpose of answering queries regarding its
organization's public servers, there is no reason for it to perform
lookups of nonlocal host names (which is the very definition of
recursion). On the other hand, if a server provides DNS resolution
to end users on a local area network (LAN), it definitely needs to
recurse queries from local hosts, but can probably be configured to
refuse recursion requests, if not <span   class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span>
requests, from nonlocal addresses.</p><p>Another way to limit DNS activity is to use split DNS
services (see Figure 2). Split DNS refers to the practice of
maintaining both public and private databases of each local name
domain (zone). The public zone database contains as little as
possible: NS records listing publicly accessible name servers, MX
records listing external SMTP (e-mail) gateways, public web servers
and other hosts that one wishes the outside world to know
about.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4198f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>Figure 2. Split DNS</p></div></div>
</p><p>The private zone database may be a superset of the public
one, or it may contain entirely different entries for certain
categories or hosts. For example, many organizations use a
Microsoft Exchange server for internal e-mail, but maintain a
completely separate SMTP gateway system to receive mail from the
outside world. This is sometimes actually the organization's
firewall, or perhaps a dedicated mail server in a DMZ network
connected to the firewall but separate from the internal
network.</p><p>The value of such an architecture should be obvious:
compromise of the SMTP gateway does not automatically result in the
exposure of internal e-mail to outsiders. Other services commonly
split this way are WWW (which separates public web data from
intranet data), FTP, and virtually all other TCP/IP services for
which it's desirable to differentiate between public and private
data. DNS, however, is arguably the most important service to
split, since most other TCP/IP services depend on it.</p><p>The other aspect to DNS stinginess is the content of zone
files themselves. Even public zone databases may contain more
information than they need to. Hosts may have needlessly
descriptive names (e.g., you may be telling the wrong people which
server does what), or too much or too granular contact information
may be given. Some organizations even list individual systems'
hardware and software names and versions! Such information is
almost invariably more useful to prospective crackers than their
intended audience.</p><p>Maintaining current software and keeping abreast of known DNS
exposures is at least as important as carefully considering actual
DNS data. Furthermore, it's easier: the latest version of BIND can
always be downloaded for free from ftp.isc.org, and information on
BIND vulnerabilities is disseminated via not only one, but several
mailing lists and newsgroups (some of which are listed at the end
of this article).</p><p>There's actually a third maxim for DNS security, but it's
hardly unique to DNS: take the time to understand and
<span   class="emphasis"><em>use</em></span> the security features of your software
(and of your DNS-registration provider&mdash;Network Solutions and other
top-level-domain registrars all offer several change request
security options, including PGP. Make sure that your provider
requires <span   class="emphasis"><em>at least</em></span> e-mail verification of all
change requests for your zones!).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b2a580.0x1c23630"></a>Selecting and Installing the Appropriate BIND
Software</h2></div></div><p>As of this writing, the most current version is 8.2.2, patch
level 5. Due to a particularly nasty buffer-overflow problem that
can lead to unauthorized root access of vulnerable systems (the
&ldquo;NXT&rdquo; bug, described in CERT Advisory #CA-99-14) in
<span   class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span> older 8.2 releases, it is
<span   class="emphasis"><em>essential</em></span> that anyone using BIND be at least
at version 8.2.2P5.</p><p>Note that for some time after BIND v.8.1 was initially
released in May 1997, many users deliberately continued using BIND
v.4 due to its stability (and possibly to postpone having to learn
the new configuration-file syntax). In fact, the Internet Software
Consortium(ISC) continued to support, and even patch, version 4,
releasing BIND v.4.9.7 a full year after 8.1's debut.</p><p>However, the ISC no longer recommends that anybody continue
using BIND v.4, even v.4.9.7. So it bears repeating: everyone who
runs BIND on an Internet server should be running the latest
release of version 8.<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span>.</p><p>We've established that you need the latest version of BIND.
But should you use a pre-compiled binary distribution (such as an
RPM), or should you compile it from source? For most users, it's
perfectly acceptable to use a binary distribution, provided it
comes from a trusted source. Virtually all UNIX variants include
BIND with their &ldquo;stock&rdquo; installations; just be sure to verify
that you indeed have the latest version.</p><p>The command to do this with Red Hat Package Manager is
<b  >rpm -q -v bind8</b> if the package has already been
installed, or <b  >rpm -q -v -p ./&lt;path &amp; filename of
package&gt;</b> if you have a package file, but it hasn't
been installed yet. The rpm package name for BIND is usually
&ldquo;bind8&rdquo; or &ldquo;bind&rdquo;.</p><p>If you perform this query and learn you have an old
(pre-8.2.2p5 version), most package formats support an &ldquo;upgrade&rdquo;
feature; simply download a more current package version from the
Linux distribution web site, and upgrade it using your package
manager. To do this with RPM, the command syntax is <b  >rpm -U
./&lt;path &amp; filename of package&gt;</b>, assuming you
don't need special install options. If the above doesn't work, you
can try <b  >rpm -U --force ./&lt;path &amp; filename of
package&gt;</b>.</p><p>If you can't find a suitable binary distribution, compiling
it from source is easy: there is no &ldquo;configure&rdquo; script to run,
and none of BIND v.8<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span>'s Makefiles need be
edited. Simply follow the brief instructions in the source's
INSTALL file (<b  >make; make install</b> is all most
people need to do).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b2a580.0x1c23c60"></a>Starting named: The Padded Cell</h2></div></div><p>It's premature to start
<span   class="bold"><b>named</b></span> (the main process of BIND)
just yet. But how you plan to run named will determine how it
should be configured. Now is a good point, therefore, to talk about
some startup options that can enhance security.</p><p>As with all Internet services, it's a good idea to run named
in a &ldquo;padded cell&rdquo; in which a prospective cracker will be trapped
should he/she exploit, for example, some obscure buffer-overflow
vulnerability. Three flags make this cell easy to achieve:
<b  >-u &lt;username&gt;</b>, <b  >-g &lt;group
name&gt;</b> and <b  >-t &lt;directory for named to
chroot to&gt;</b>.</p><p>The first causes named to run under the specified user name.
The second causes named to run under the specified group name,
while the third changes (&ldquo;chroots&rdquo;) the root of all paths
referenced by named. Note that when running named chrooted, this
new root is applied even <span   class="emphasis"><em>before</em></span> named.conf is
read. Therefore if, for example, you invoke named with
<b  >named -u named -g wheel -t /var/named</b>, then it
will look for named.conf in /var/named/etc rather than in /etc.
That is, the default location of named.conf is always /etc, but if
named is chrooted to path /other/path, /etc will be translated as
/other/path/etc.</p><p>The net effect of these three flags (when used properly) is
that named's permissions, environment and even file system are
severely limited. Should an unauthorized user somehow hijack named,
instead of gaining root permissions (prior to BIND v.8, named ran
as root) they'll gain the permissions of an unprivileged account.
Furthermore, they'll see even <span   class="emphasis"><em>less</em></span> of the
server's file system than an ordinary user can: directories
connected to directory-tree nodes higher than the chroot-point
won't, from named's perspective, even exist.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b2a580.0x201c328"></a>Overview of named.conf</h2></div></div><p>Running <span   class="bold"><b>named</b></span> in a padded
cell is paranoid and elite in itself. But that's just the
beginning! BIND 8.<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span>'s configuration file,
named.conf, with its large number of supported parameters, allows
you to control named's behavior with a great deal of
granularity.</p><p>Consider the example named.conf file as shown in Figure
3.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4198f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>Figure 3. Example named.conf File</p></div></div>
</p><p>The hypothetical server whose configuration file is
represented here is an external DNS server. Since its role is to
provide information to the outside world about coolfroods.org's
publicly accessible services, it has been configured without
recursion. In fact, it has no &ldquo;.&rdquo; zone entry (i.e., no pointer to
a hints file), so it knows nothing about and cannot even learn
about hosts not described in its local zone files. Transfers of its
local zone databases are restricted by IP address to a group of
trusted slave servers, and logging has been enabled for a variety
of event types.</p><p>So how do we do these and even more nifty and paranoid things
with <b  >named.conf</b>?</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b2a580.0x201c850"></a>Useful named.conf Parameters: acl{}
Sections</h2></div></div><p>Although strictly optional, Access Control Lists (acls)
provide a handy means of labeling groups of IP addresses and
networks. And since we're paranoid, we definitely want to restrict
certain actions and data by IP address.</p><p>An acl may be declared anywhere within named.conf, but since
this file is parsed from top to bottom, each acl must be declared
before its first instance in a parameter. Thus, it makes sense to
put acl definitions at the top of named.conf.</p><p>The format for these is simple:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
acl acl_name { IPaddr1;
IPaddr2; ...etc. };
</pre><p>Note that the IP address list can contain either complete IP
addresses in the form x.x.x.x or network addresses in the form
x.x.x/24, x.x/16, etc. Now, each time named.conf is read, the
parser will substitute all instances of the acl's name (that occur
after its definition) with its corresponding IP address list.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b2a580.0x201cab8"></a>Global Options: The options{} Section</h2></div></div><p>The next thing to add is a list of global options. Some of
the parameters that are valid for this section can also be used in
zone sections; be aware that if a given parameter appears both in
options{} and in a zone section, the zone version will supercede
the global setting as it applies to that zone. In other words, the
zone-section values of such parameters are treated as exceptions to
the corresponding global values.</p><p>Listing 2 shows some useful parameters that can be used in
options{}.</p><p><a href="4198l1.html" target="_self">Listing 2. options {}
Listing</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b2a580.0x201ccc8"></a>Logging</h2></div></div><p>In addition to global options, we definitely want to set some
logging rules. By default, named doesn't log much more than a few
startup messages (such as errors and zones loaded), which are sent
to the syslog d&lt;\#230&gt;mon (which in turn writes them to
/var/log/messages or some other file). To log security events, zone
transfers, etc., you need to add a <b  >logging{}</b>
section to named.conf.</p><p>The <b  >logging{}</b> section consists of two
parts: one or more <b  >channel{}</b> definitions (each
of which defines a place to send log information) followed by one
or more <b  >category{}</b> sections (wherein each event
type you wish to track is assigned one or more channels). Channels
usually point to either files or the local syslog
d&lt;\#230&gt;mon, and categories are actually pre-defined; that
is, you choose from a set of pre-defined categories, specifying in
each case what is to be done with event messages from that
category.</p><p>Channel definitions take the following format:
<b  >channel</b>
<span   class="bold"><b>channel-name</b></span>
{{<span   class="bold"><b>filename</b></span>
<b  >syslog</b>
<span   class="bold"><b>syslog-type</b></span>|<b  >null</b>];
<b  >print-time</b> [<b  >yes</b> |
<b  >no</b>];
<b  >print-category</b>[<b  >yes</b> |
<b  >no</b>];};</p><p>Note that <span   class="emphasis"><em>filename</em></span> by default is put in
named's working directory, but a full path may be given (that is
assumed to be relative to the chrooted directory, if
applicable).</p><p>Category specifications are much simpler:</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>category</b></span>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>category-name</em></span>
<span   class="bold"><b>{</b></span><span   class="emphasis"><em>channel-list</em></span>
<span   class="bold"><b>;</b></span>
<span   class="bold"><b>};</b></span></p><p>Note that as with IP address lists, the channel list is
semicolon-delimited and must contain channels defined in a prior
<b  >channel{}</b> statement. See the BIND Operator's
Guide (BOG) for the full list of supported categories; suffice it
to say that <b  >xfer-out</b>,
<b  >security</b>, <b  >load</b>,
<b  >os</b>, <b  >insist</b>,
<b  >panic</b> and
<span   class="bold"><b>maintenance</b></span> are usually of
interest to the security-conscious DNS administrator.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b2a580.0x201da88"></a>A Note on Caching-Only Name Servers</h2></div></div><p>&ldquo;Caching-only&rdquo; name servers, which are not authoritative
for any zones (i.e., are neither master, slave, nor even stub for
anything), are inherently simpler and therefore easier to secure
than other kinds of DNS servers. Little of what follows will apply
when setting up a caching-only server.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b2a580.0x201db90"></a>zone{} Sections</h2></div></div><p>The last type of named.conf section we'll examine here is the
<b  >zone{}</b> section. Like
<b  >options{}</b>, there are many additional parameters
besides those described below; see the BOG for more
information.</p><p>The three parameters most useful in improving zone-by-zone
security are:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
allow-update { IP/acl-list ; };
allow-query IP/acl-ist ; };
allow-transfer IP/acl-list ; };
</pre><p><span   class="bold"><b>allow-update</b></span> lists hosts
that may submit Dynamic DNS updates for the zone;
<span   class="bold"><b>allow-query</b></span> specifies which hosts
may even submit simple DNS queries; and
<span   class="bold"><b>allow-transfer</b></span> restricts who may
download entire zone files. Note that all three of these parameters
may be used in either/both <b  >zone{}</b> sections
and/or the options{} section, with zone-specific settings
overriding global settings.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b2a580.0x201dfb0"></a>Zone File Security</h2></div></div><p>Our secure DNS service, trapped in its padded cell and very
particular about what it says to whom, is shaping up nicely. But
what about the actual zone databases?</p><p>The good news here is that since our options are considerably
more limited than with named.conf, there's less to do. The bad news
is that there's at least one type of Resource Record that's both
obsolete and even dangerous, and must be avoided by the
security-conscious.</p><p>Here's a sample zone file for the hypothetical domain
&ldquo;boneheads.com&rdquo; (see Figure 4.)</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4198f4.large.jpg"><img src="4198f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 4. Sample Zone File</p></div></div>
</p><p>The first thing to consider is the Start-of-Authority (SOA)
record. In the above example, the serial number follows the
convention yyyymmdd##, which is both convenient and helps security,
as it reduces the chances of accidentally loading an old (obsolete)
zone file&mdash;the serial number serves as both an index and a time
stamp.</p><p>The refresh interval is set to three hours, a reasonable
compromise between bandwidth conservation and paranoia. That is,
the shorter the refresh interval, the less damage a DNS-spoofing
(cache-poisoning) attack can do, since any &ldquo;bad records&rdquo;
propagated by such an attack will be corrected each time the zone
is refreshed.</p><p>The expiry interval is set to two weeks. This is the length
of time the zone file will still be considered valid, should the
zone's master stop responding to refresh queries. There are two
ways a paranoiac might view this parameter. On one hand, a long
value ensures that should the master server be bombarded with
denial-of-service attacks over an extended period of time, its
slaves will continue using cached zone data and the domain will
continue to be reachable (except, presumably, for its main DNS
server!). But on the other hand, even in the case of such an
attack, zone data may change, and sometimes old data causes more
mischief than no data at all.</p><p>Similarly, the Time to Live interval should be short enough
to facilitate reasonably speedy recovery from an attack or
corruption, but long enough to prevent bandwidth cluttering. (The
TTL determines how long the individual zone's Resource Records may
remain in the caches of other name servers retrieving them via
queries.)</p><p>Our other concerns in this zone file have to do with
minimizing the unnecessary disclosure of information. First, we
want to minimize aliases (&ldquo;A records&rdquo;) and canonical names
(&ldquo;CNAMEs&rdquo;) in general, so that only those hosts who need to be
are present. (Actually, we want split DNS, but when that isn't
feasible or applicable, we should still try to keep the zone file
sparse.)</p><p>Second, we want to minimize the amount of (recursive)
glue-fetching that goes on. This occurs when a requested
name-server (NS) record contains a name whose IP address (via an A
record) is not present on the server answering the NS query. In
other words, if server X knows that Y is authoritative for domain
WUZZA.com but X doesn't actually know Y's IP address, life can get
weird: this scenario paves the way for DNS-spoofing attacks.
Therefore, if you really want to eliminate all recursion (and I
hope you do by now), make sure none of your Resource Records
require recursive glue-fetching, and then set the &ldquo;fetch-glue&rdquo;
option to &ldquo;no&rdquo;.</p><p>Finally, we need to use RP and TXT records judiciously if at
all, but must never, ever put any meaningful data into an HINFO
record. RP, or Responsible Person, is used to provide the e-mail
address of someone who administers the domain. This is best set to
as uninteresting an address as possible, e.g.,
&ldquo;information@wuzza.com&rdquo; or &ldquo;hostmaster@wuzza.com&rdquo;. Similarly,
TXT records contain text messages that have traditionally provided
additional contact information (phone numbers, etc.) but should be
kept only specific enough to be useful, or better still, omitted
altogether.</p><p>HINFO is a souvenir of simpler times: HINFO records are used
to state the operating system, its version, and even hardware
configuration of the hosts to which they refer! Back in the days
when a large percentage of Internet nodes were in academic
institutions and other open environments (and when computers were
exotic and new), it seemed reasonable to advertise this information
to one's users. Nowadays, HINFO has no valid use on public servers,
other than obfuscation (i.e., intentionally providing false
information to would-be attackers). In short, don't use HINFO
records!</p><p>Returning to Figure 3, then, we see that the last few records
are unnecessary at best and a cracker's gold mine at worst. And
although we decided the SOA record looks good, the NS record
immediately following points to a host on another domain
altogether&mdash;remember, we don't like glue-fetching, and if that's
the case here, we may want to add an A record for
ns.otherdomain.com.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b2a580.0x1f30270"></a>Advanced BIND Security: TSIGs</h2></div></div><p>Whew! We've looked at BIND security from several important
angles, but we haven't even mentioned cryptographic controls.
Actually, the Secure DNS protocol (&ldquo;DNSSEC&rdquo;, described in RFC
2535) merits an article of its own. This set of extensions to DNS
provides a means of cryptographically signing zone-transfer and
query transactions, including the secure exchange of all necessary
key data. Since DNSSEC hasn't yet been widely implemented (and in
fact isn't even fully supported in BIND v.8x), we'll limit our
discussion of it to the use of Transaction Signatures
(TSIGs).</p><p>Suppose you wish to sign all zone transfers between the
zone's master and a slave. You would do the following:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>create a key for the zone</p></li><li><p>on each server, create a <b  >key{}</b>
entry in named.conf containing the key</p></li><li><p>on each server, create a
<b  >server{}</b> entry in named.conf for the other
server which references the key declared in step (2).</p></li></ol></div><p>Step one is most easily done with BIND's
<span   class="bold"><b>dnskeygen</b></span> command. To create a
512-bit signing key that can be used by both master and slave, type
<b  >dnskeygen -H 512 -h -n
&lt;<i><tt>desired_keyname</tt></i>&gt;</b>. The
output will be saved in two files named something like
<b  >Kdesired_keyname.+157+00000.key</b> and
<b  >Kdesired_keyname.+157+00000.private</b>. In this
case, the key-string in both files should be identical; it will
look something like
&ldquo;ff2342AGFASsdfsa55BSopiue/-2342LKJDJlkjVVVvfjweovzp2OIPOTXUEdss2jsdfAAlskj==&rdquo;.
</p><p>Steps two and three consist of creating entries similar to
the following in named.conf on each server (substituting
&ldquo;desired_keyname&rdquo; below with whatever you wish to name the
key&mdash;this string must be the same on both servers!):</p><pre     class="programlisting">
key desired_keyname {
        algorithm hmac-md5;
        secret "&lt;insert key-string from either keyfile here&gt;";
}
server &lt;IP address of other server&gt; {
        transfer-format many-answers;
        # (send responses in batches rather than singly)
        keys { desired_keyname; };
};
</pre><p>Note that <b  >key{}</b> statements must always
precede any other statements (e.g., <b  >server{}</b>
statements) that refer to them. A logical place to put key-server
statements is between <b  >options{}</b> and zone
statements.
</p><p>Now all you need to do is restart named (via a <b  >kill
-HUP</b> or <b  >ndc restart</b>) on both servers.
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Voil&agrave;!</em></span> You are now on the cutting edge
of DNS security!</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b2a580.0x1f30c68"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>The guidelines and techniques we've covered here should give
you a good start on securing your DNS server(s). For a more
in-depth understanding of these techniques, I strongly recommend
BIND's on-line version of its Operators' Guide (included in most
binary distributions, or available separately from
<a href="http://www.isc.org" target="_self">http://www.isc.org/</a>). This
is among the most useful documents provided in any OSS package.
Another excellent source of BIND security information is Liu's
&ldquo;DNS Security&rdquo; slide show (available from him in PDF format&mdash;see
below).</p><p>Equally important, every BIND user should subscribe to at
least one security-advisory e-mail list. CERT is my personal
favorite, since it's timely enough to be useful but low-volume
enough to not be a nuisance. And at your earliest convenience, you
should look up and read the CERT advisories listed
below&mdash;understanding the threats is an essential part of good
security.</p><p><a href="4198s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
