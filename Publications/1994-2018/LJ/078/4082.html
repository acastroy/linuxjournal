    Learn the correct procedures for submitting a patch to the

the most prized gems in the Open Source community. Based around a
philosophy of shared resources through modularity, it somehow is
both well-written and written by committee. (Or, at least, by many
individuals and teams which argue/agree over features.) One of the
methods by which Linux keeps everything neat and modular is the
kernel configuration system, often referred to as config,
menuconfig and xconfig. These are the scripts that an installer of
a source kernel must run in order to set up the kernel options, but
you probably know that if you are reading this. On the outside,
these look like three very separate programs with completely
separate interfaces. In reality though, all three draw from the
same fundamental rules that many programmers of the Linux kernel
must know in order to spread their work or even to submit their
patches to Linus. It is this fundamental system that gives Linux
users the options they need to design a Linux system based on their
needs.
</p><p>Since the Linux kernel is an open-source project, it
obviously accepts submissions from its users for new features.
Often, however, programmers with the desire and the know-how to add
features to the Linux kernel choose not to for a variety of
reasons. In this article, I hope to clear up some of the mysteries
surrounding the kernel configuration system that may be hindering
users and keeping them from becoming developers. Every brain counts
in open-source efforts, and every programmer who adds his or her
changes into the kernel makes the kernel more robust for the rest
of us.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a04580.0x2afc608"></a>What's in a Patch?</h2></div></div><p>To start off with, there has to be a reason you are mucking
about in the kernel configuration scripts in the first place. Maybe
you are just exploring the system and awaiting the day when you too
will be submitting patches to the kernel. Or maybe (and more
likely) you have added a particular feature to the kernel that you
feel deserves some more widespread use, but you want to have it
ready to integrate for Linus or Alan or another kernel-developing
guru. For the purposes of this article, I will use a hypothetical
patch to make the random device driver a compile-time option,
although I should stress that in reality I had absolutely nothing
to do with the creation of that driver. (This is the driver that
controls the /dev/random and /dev/urandom devices.) Also, I will
not be discussing in depth the creation of kernel modules in this
text&mdash;I will assume you can extrapolate how to do it from this
article, especially if you were smart enough to create a
modularized driver in the first place.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a04580.0x2afc710"></a>Choosing Your Config Name</h2></div></div><p>The first step in modularizing your program should be
obvious: you need some name that the C preprocessor can recognize
to help it sort out the differences between what changes are yours
and what are not. The kernel handles this distinction through the
use of preprocessor instructions: the <b  >#ifdef</b> ...
<b  >#else</b> .. <b  >#endif</b> constructs
throughout the kernel.
</p><p>The first thing to make sure of when you do this is to be
consistent. In a system as complicated as the Linux kernel, a
little bit of consistency can save a lot of headaches later. You
should look in Documentation/Configure.help for similar options and
check to see if they have a common prefix (after
<b  >CONFIG_</b>, of course). For example, all block
device options start with <b  >CONFIG_BLK_DEV_</b>. This
is relatively easy to change later, of course.</p><p>Once the name is selected, you should make
<b  >#ifdef</b>...<b  >#endif blocks</b> around
portions of the code that your patch changes (having a Linus tree
around when you do this helps, as you can diff it and easily see
what you changed). If you removed existing code, you'll need to
integrate the #else blocks from the real tree, unless you were
smart enough to keep them around while you were writing your patch.
(I usually use the construct &ldquo;#if 0&rdquo; early in the programming
stage.) At this point, compiling the kernel should work, and your
option will be correctly disabled and we can continue to the next
step. If it doesn't work or portions of your patch are still
present, you obviously need to go back and double-check your
diffs.</p><p>For the purposes of my example, I would choose the name
CONFIG_RANDOM for the option. The random devices are character
devices, and at the time of this writing, there was no
<b  >CONFIG_CHAR_</b>( or similar) prefix in common
use.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a04580.0x2afcbe0"></a>The Configure Scripts (Config.in)</h2></div></div><p>The next step we need to take is to add the new configuration
option to the configure system. Fortunately, this is fairly easy
with only a couple of warnings. In the directory where you have the
majority of your patch (in my example, drivers/char), there will be
a file called 'Config.in' which contains the configuration options
for the code in that directory. It is possible to put the config
option in a different directory's config file, but it obscures the
readability a little and may make it difficult to locate your code
later. However, if it definitely belongs somewhere other than where
you have it (or if the location of your code does not have one of
those files), you should use your own best judgment and be prepared
to move it later. Browsing through this file, you will see that it
contains what appears to be a rough scripting language similar to
Bash or another shell script. This scripting language is called,
easily enough, &ldquo;Config Language&rdquo; and should not be terribly
difficult to get your arms around. For the purposes of our
non-modular example, we don't need to work with the full vocabulary
of the language and can concentrate on only a few keywords (defined
below). For a more complete guide to the language, a complete
reference is provided with newer kernels
(Documentation/kbuild/config-language.txt). There are plenty of
examples provided in the actual configuration files, however, and
the language is simple enough that a real understanding of the
language and syntax is not required for normal maintenance. In
general, lines in this file are formatted with one or more keywords
(called verbs) followed by some arguments. Here is a partial list
of verbs and their meanings:
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>comment: An unparsed comment except when preceded
by the <span   class="bold"><b>mainmenu_option</b></span> command
which would cause the comment to be used as a heading.</p></li><li><p>mainmenu_option: A verb that makes the next comment
into a heading. I cannot explain enough how odd this seems to
me.</p></li><li><p>bool: Boolean (yes/no) configuration option. This
verb is always followed by a question and a configuration variable
to put the result (&ldquo;y&rdquo; or &ldquo;n&rdquo;) in.</p></li><li><p>tristate: A value similar to a bool but with the
additional &ldquo;make as module&rdquo; possibility denoted as &ldquo;m&rdquo;. This is
applicable only to device drivers.</p></li><li><p>if... fi: A conditional block that is evaluated
only if a certain configuration variable is set.</p></li></ul></div>

The idea here is to locate the section of the file which
corresponds to where you would like your option to be in the
configuration programs. This should naturally be the location where
your patch is most related to the other options provided. Once you
have located where it would go, you should format a line similar to
the following with your own information thrown in:
<pre     class="programlisting">
bool 'Random driver support' CONFIG_RANDOM
</pre>


(Please note here that a' is used as the quote character. This can
be easy to miss.)
</p><p><a href="4082s1.html" target="_self">Config File for
CONFIG_RANDOM</a></p><p>If your configuration option relies on another to be set,
this model becomes more complicated. You will need to surround your
options with an if ... fi block that tests the prerequisite option.
There are a number of examples in the assorted configuration files
to help you with this process; when in doubt, copy. One final word:
you should be aware that this file is used not only to generate the
selection lists in the configuration processes, but also to
generate the include/linux/autoconf.h file. In order to preserve
the readability of that file, you should be careful that options
you add do not come after other subheadings or the configuration
option will not appear in the right place when that file is
generated. (Of course, it will still work no matter where it is in
the file, but for readability, this is something to
consider.)</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a04580.0x2afd268"></a>Setting up the Default Configs</h2></div></div><p>At this point, you have your patch surrounded by defines
which correspond to configuration options. You can now toggle the
use of your patch in the configurator. The hardest part is done,
now we just need to fill in some loose ends.
</p><p>As you have probably noticed if you have used Linux on more
than one architecture, there are different options for each of the
different platforms. Thus far, you have not concerned yourself with
making much of that distinction, but now it is time. In order to
modify the defconfig file the right way, you'll need to take a
couple of steps. First, you should back up your .config file with
your personal configuration settings. Replace that file with a copy
of arch/&lt;whatever&gt;/defconfig and rerun the configurator.
Select whatever option you would like to be the default for your
config option, and save that file. Replace defconfig with the new
.config and replace the old one. You now have a new default
configuration file built for your architecture.</p><p>If your patch works for multiple architectures (for example,
it's a generic network protocol type or something that is generally
applicable), you'll want to make default config files for all the
architectures it supports. This can be done most easily be
repeating the steps above, except first changing the ARCH line in
the source Makefile to reflect the architecture you are building
the config file for.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a04580.0x2afd420"></a>The Help File</h2></div></div><p>The final and often overlooked portion of a patch is the help
file that must accompany the configuration option. The file in
question is Documentation/Configure.help. The format of that file
is something like this (or see the attached example):
<pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;description&gt;
&lt;variable name&gt;
&lt;help file&gt;
</pre>


In addition, it should be noted that there must be an extra blank
line between config files, and newer kernels support having blank
lines in the help text itself, provided that the blank line
actually contains a space or other white space.
</p><p>It is highly advised that you attempt to locate a portion of
this file that roughly corresponds to what your option is for.
Often, but not always, options in similar places in the
configuration menus will have similar places in the help file, and
that can serve as a helpful indication as to the best place to put
your particular piece. If you still do not know where to put
everything, I advise sending e-mail to the current help maintainer
with a question and a brief description of what your patch does
(maybe even include the help text you would like to have
added).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a04580.0x2afd5d8"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>You should be done at this point. Before you can send off
your patch for submission, it is wise to compile it both enabled
and disabled and make sure both kernels work properly. If there are
dependencies, make sure they are working correctly and that all the
options you would expect to have, you have, and vice versa. And
finally, you should send your patch to the kernel list and request
bug reports before you announce it as being done to Linus and the
gang, or be prepared for a heavy dose of reality, especially if you
made changes that impact architectures you don't actually have.
