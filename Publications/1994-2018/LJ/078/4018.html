the Internet is distance education. The most significant advantage
of Internet connectivity over previous communication paradigms for
distance education is that a high degree of interaction among
teachers and learners is possible. Education is a highly
interactive process. If it weren't, schools wouldn't be
needed&mdash;textbooks alone would be sufficient. The fact that the
Internet protocols support two-way communication and virtually
unlimited possibilities for integrated multimedia (given sufficient
bandwidth and quality of service) presents unprecedented
opportunities for extending the reach of education beyond the
traditional classroom.
</p><p>Most applications of Internet technology to distance
education have been web-based courses. In a web-based course, the
course content is developed as modules in HTML, and interaction
takes place asynchronously through discussion boards or plain old
e-mail. Some web-based courses also support synchronous interaction
through chat sessions. Some advantages of web-based courses are
that they work well at modem bandwidths and require only a web
browser on the student's computer, thus maximizing the possible
audience and minimizing the technical support requirements.
However, a quality web-based course requires a great deal of effort
to produce; and in disciplines such as engineering where the
content must be updated frequently, maintenance of the course can
also be significant. Another important limitation is that
interactions are essentially limited to textual media. In answering
a question for a student in an engineering class, the teacher often
needs to construct or mark up a diagram while explaining the
concept. This is best accomplished in an environment which supports
real-time audiovisual interaction, which is why the traditional
face-to-face classroom has survived the last few hundred years so
well.</p><p>With this in mind, the &ldquo;MBone virtual classroom&rdquo; was
developed at North Carolina State University to allow students to
attend live engineering classes from a remote location by &ldquo;tuning
in&rdquo; to the class from a workstation. The concept was to replicate
as nearly as possible the face-to-face environment with real-time
interaction including audio, video and graphics. To solve the
problem of having many remote students attending the classroom
virtually, IP-multicast and the MBone tools were employed. The
virtual classroom has been in use since the fall of 1996 to provide
access to engineering classes to students at several locations in
North Carolina. This article describes how IP-multicast and the
MBone tools were used to create the virtual classroom environment,
and the development of DETA, the Distance Education Teaching
Assistant, a Tcl/Tk-based wrapper which provides a simple, unified
interface to the many hardware and software components of the
virtual classroom.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27eb580.0x28e3f50"></a>IP-Multicast and the MBone</h2></div></div><p>IP-Multicast, the class-D addressing scheme in IP which makes
the MBone network possible, was developed by Steve Deering in his
PhD thesis at Stanford, and later developed and implemented at
Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (PARC). The first multicast tunnel
was established between BBN and Stanford University in the summer
of 1988. The Internet Multicast Backbone (MBone) was subsequently
established as a virtual network of multicast tunnels over the
existing Internet. In 1992, the same year that the Internet grew to
one million hosts and Mosaic was created at NCSA, the MBone carried
its first real-time audio and video traffic.</p><p>IP multicast is useful in that it provides an efficient
mechanism for &ldquo;broadcasting&rdquo; data over the Internet. It is best
understood in comparison to IP unicast. When sending the same data
to multiple clients using unicast, multiple separate connections to
those clients must be opened. When the number of clients grows
significantly, the load on the sender increases dramatically. With
IP multicast, the data needs to be sent only once. The
multicast-enabled network sends copies of the data to all of the
clients who wish to receive the data. In this way, the sender
transmits the data only once, regardless of the number of clients
wishing to receive the data. It is very similar to a television
broadcast, where a single transmitter sends out a single video
transmission, and anybody within range of the signal can receive
the transmission. Because it is more efficient at sending the same
data to multiple recipients, multicast is ideal for multimedia
network applications such as video-conferencing or live
netcasts.</p><p>The ability to send and receive IP multicast is primarily
dependent on your network. The network's routers must know how to
deal with multicast packets. A few years ago, there existed very
few routers capable of handling multicast packets. At that time, a
method was needed to send multicast packets over networks designed
to handle only unicast packets. This method became the Virtual
Multicast Backbone, or MBone. Software that uses the MBone
essentially packages multicast packets inside of unicast packets,
which non-multicast-enabled routers know how to handle.
Multicast-enabled routers are able to identify and process the
multicast packets, as well as computers running MBone
software.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27eb580.0x28e4108"></a>The MBone Tools</h2></div></div><p>The primary components of the distance education software
used at NC State are the MBone tools. These are
<span   class="bold"><b>vic</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>rat</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>wbd</b></span>, and
<span   class="bold"><b>sdr</b></span> are available for download in
binary and source form at University College London's (UCL) web
site at
<a href="http://www-mice.cs.ucl.ac.uk/multimedia/software" target="_self">http://www-mice.cs.ucl.ac.uk/multimedia/software/</a>.
<span   class="bold"><b>vic</b></span> is an MBone video-conferencing
tool. It was originally developed by Steve McCanne and Van Jacobson
at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) Network
Research Group. The version being used at NC State is currently
under development at UCL. This version provides video-capture
support using Video4Linux, so many existing video-capture cards are
compatible with it. It incorporates a number of codecs including
H.261 and H.263. It provides controls to adjust frame rate,
bandwidth, and video quality, as well as many other options. Users
can switch between thumbnail and full-screen video windows, and
switch between a number of video formats.
<span   class="bold"><b>vic</b></span> runs in multicast- conference
mode or point-to-point-unicast mode.</p><p>The Robust Audio Tool (rat) is an MBone audio-conferencing
tool. <span   class="bold"><b>rat</b></span> was developed by UCL's
Networked Multimedia Research Group. There are two versions of RAT:
a stable, toll-quality (i.e., telephone-quality) version 3, and an
improved, though experimental, high-quality version 4.
<span   class="bold"><b>rat</b></span> supports both ALSA (Advanced
Linux Sound Architecture) and OSS (Open Sound System), so it is
compatible with a large number of sound cards.
<span   class="bold"><b>rat</b></span> provides a number of audio
codecs, as well as packet-loss concealment schemes. Other features
include automatic gain control, silence suppression and encryption.
<span   class="bold"><b>rat</b></span> also provides a graphical
interface showing conference participants and audio levels. Like
vic, rat can operate in point-to-point-unicast mode or in
multicast-conference mode.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>wbd</b></span> is an MBone shared
whiteboard. It allows a number of participants in a conference to
share a single whiteboard workspace. It was originally written by
Julian Highfield at Loughborough University. The most recent
development work on it has been done by Kristian Hasler at UCL.
<span   class="bold"><b>wbd</b></span> is compatible with the
original LBNL whiteboard, wb, developed by Steve McCanne. Because
wb is available only in binary form for UNIX platforms, Julian
Highfield wrote wbd primarily to fill the need for a Windows
version of wb. Since the source is freely available, we have chosen
to use wbd over the binary-only <span   class="bold"><b>wb</b></span>
on Linux. wbd has a standard set of whiteboard features, such as
font, color and line-width options, text input capability, drawing
tools and various page orientations.
<span   class="bold"><b>wbd</b></span> can import both PostScript and
text files. wbd was designed to work in both point-to-point and
shared multicast modes, though currently only the multicast mode
functions properly in Linux.</p><p>Instead of each user in a conference connecting to every
other user, MBone users join a multicast group. Anything sent to
the group is received by all current members of the group. None of
the MBone tools discussed so far provide any means of locating or
advertising these groups. This is accomplished through the session
directory tool, <span   class="bold"><b>sdr</b></span>. In a sense,
the session directory is like a television guide which shows all
the currently available &ldquo;shows&rdquo; on the MBone.
<span   class="bold"><b>sdr</b></span> was originally written at UCL
and was modeled after another LBNL tool called
<span   class="bold"><b>sd</b></span>. When the user loads up sdr, a
listing of all public and private MBone sessions appears. To get
more information about a specific session, the user clicks the
session name. To join a session the user clicks the join button for
that session and sdr then loads up the various tools needed to
participate in the session. To create a new session, the user
clicks the New button and enters various information about the
session. <span   class="bold"><b>sdr</b></span> then generates the
multicast addresses and advertises the session for other users to
see.</p><p>The bandwidth requirements for the MBone tools are relatively
low by current standards. Each video source requires only about
128KBps at a rate of ten frames per second. The audio requires
about 64KBps at telephone quality. Higher frame-rate video is
possible, but we've found that high-quality whiteboard data in
combination with good-quality audio more than compensate for the
slow video. The video mainly orients the participant and provides
visual cues, while the actual content is provided via the audio and
whiteboard data. For some classes, it is more important to provide
full-motion video, and when adjusted appropriately, vic can provide
this.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27eb580.0x28e49f8"></a>DETA, the Distance Education Teaching
Assistant</h2></div></div><p>The MBone tools were not specifically designed with distance
education in mind. In fact, though interoperability and uniformity
between the applications was a goal of the original designers, it
had yet to be achieved when the first MBone classes began at NC
State. Additionally, the tools themselves have a relatively steep
learning curve for nontechnical users. For example, in order to
create a new session, a number of technical options have to be set
in sdr, including Type of Session, Session Scope, Type of Media and
Session Time. Experienced users have little difficulty navigating
these options, but to meet the needs of distance education, users
have to be able to operate the tools with only minimal training. In
order to accomplish this goal, the distance education Teaching
Assistant was created. DETA is a wizard-style interface to the
MBone tools. It hides all of the technical options the
inexperienced user should not have to deal with. Originally, it
primarily functioned as a simplified interface for starting
Mbone-based Distance Education classes. Over the years, a number of
features have been added, including the ability to give preprepared
presentations and automatic digital archiving of classes.</p><p>The underlying purpose behind DETA is to meld the various
tools and supporting programs into a single, easy-to-use
application. DETA is written in the Tcl/Tk interpreted scripting
language. The primary reason for this choice has to do with the
MBone tools. All of them are Tcl-based applications written in C or
C++. This not only provides great flexibility within the
applications themselves, but also allows for basic interoperability
between them. This interoperability is achieved through Tcl's Send
command. Send allows one Tcl interpreter to execute commands
remotely within another applications interpreter. In DETA, the Send
command is primarily used to remotely operate SDR, as well as to
set options within the other MBone tools.</p><p>One of the drawbacks of using the Tcl Send command for
communication is that it doesn't hide any of the various tool's
internal implementation. This becomes an issue when that
implementation is changed, or a new tool is added. The core DETA
script then has to be altered to adapt to the changes in the tools.
One solution to this problem is to modify the various tools
directly so that they communicate via a common,
implementation-independent bus. This would require separate
modified versions of the MBone tools. Rather than use modified
versions of the MBone tools, it was decided to modularize the code
that communicates with the various tools into separate interface
packages. The interfaces contain all of the tool-specific Tcl code
in string arrays. These arrays are sourced by the primary DETA
script at startup. In this way, the core script can be modified
without affecting implementation-dependent code, and new or updated
tools can be added simply by creating new interface modules.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4018f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Mode Selection Screen for DETA
</p></div></div><p>When the user first starts DETA, he or she is given four mode
options, as seen in Figure 1. The first is to create a new session.
This creates a new multicast session that will be announced while
the session is active, and which will expire after the session
becomes inactive. By creating the session, the user becomes the
designated host of that session. The second option is to host an
existing session. This mode is included so that users can host
permanently existing sessions. At NC State, a session directory
server was written by Troy Holder that continuously announces class
sessions. In this way, semester-long class announcements do not
have to be re-created at every meeting. The third option is to join
an existing session. This is the option that a remote participant
would select. It allows the user to select a desired session from a
list of available sessions and then join it. The last option is to
play a recorded session. This mode is used to select a previously
archived session for playback via a remote VCR server. Once the
mode is selected, the user enters information about the session.
Figure 2 shows the information required when creating a new
session. This includes the name of the session, the lecturer name,
and the MBone tools to use in the session. This is saved between
sessions and usually doesn't need to be re-entered. Once the
options for the session have been set, DETA creates the session and
loads the MBone tools.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4018f2.large.jpg"><img src="4018f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. User Information Screen for DETA
</p></div></div><p>In addition to melding the core MBone tools, a number of
features have been added to DETA. The first is a tool called
WBDImport developed at NC State. This tool is modeled after
WBImport, which was written by Van Jacobson. It allows the user to
give a PowerPoint-style presentation using the shared whiteboard
tool. The format used for slide files is generic PostScript. The
user indicates which files will be used at startup, either by
specifying a directory containing the slides, or by specifying a
text file containing a list of all the files and their locations.
During the session, a WBDImport window lists all of the slides
specified at startup. To show a slide, the user simply clicks the
name of the desired slide and it is loaded into the shared
whiteboard. This tool allows professors to prepare a set of slides
in advance and then annotate them during a lecture. The slides and
the annotations are sent out live to all the participants in the
session. Using preprepared slides in this way has been found
superior to handwriting for classes requiring large amounts of
written notes.</p><p>The audio tool used in DETA allows only one user to speak at
a time. If there is a question at a remote site, it is important
that there be someway to signal the host so that the question can
be asked. A tool called the Electronic Hand Raiser provides this
capability. Remote users have a control panel with a button labeled
&ldquo;Ask Question&rdquo;. When they click this, the session host will hear
a tone and see a message button indicating who the question is
from. To acknowledge the question, the host clicks the message, and
then allows the remote site to ask their question. There is also a
&ldquo;Cancel Question&rdquo; button at the remote site if the remote user
wishes to withdraw their question. In addition to dealing with the
problem of half-duplex audio, this tool provides a form of floor
control that matches traditional classroom protocols (See Figure
4). Figure 3 shows a live DETA session with the MBone video, audio
and whiteboard tools, as well as the Electronic Hand Raiser and
WBDImport tool.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4018f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

Session</p></div></div>
</p><p>Another feature of DETA is integrated recording and playback
of sessions. To record a session, the host checks the record option
and the session is automatically recorded on a separate VCR server.
To play back a session, the user selects the play session option
and then chooses the desired session. Once the session is selected,
DETA provides a VCR-style interface (see Figure 4). This interface
also allows the user to start the various tools and provides
standard VCR controls such as play and rewind. The VCR server
itself is a separate Tcl script that DETA communicates with via
TCP/IP sockets. The primary function of the server is to start and
stop a Java application called mVCR. mVCR was written by Peter
Parnes at the Lulea University of Technology in Sweden. It is
capable of capturing and playing back multicast data streams for
the MBone audio, video and whiteboard tools. The DETA VCR Server
and mVCR, in combination with DETA, provide immediate on-demand
playback of sessions. As soon as a class session is complete, that
session is available for remote playback. This greatly reduces the
cost and overhead necessary to provide time-delayed classes to
remote sites. Additionally, students who missed a class or wish to
review a class can individually replay recorded sessions.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27eb580.0x28dbcd8"></a>Issues with Recording and Playback</h2></div></div><p>The recording and playback of DETA sessions is not entirely
without problems. The recording system works by capturing all the
network packets received at a client station during the initial
live session, encoding them along with a time stamp and writing
them to disk. On playback the time stamps are used to deliver an
&ldquo;identical&rdquo; stream of network packets that will exactly mimic the
original session and preserve the synchronization of the audio,
video and whiteboard. The quality of the recording (or the live
session) can be affected by packet loss due to network congestion,
processor loading, or other sources. Generally speaking, the loss
of a single packet does only minimal damage to the audio or video
recording. A missed syllable during playback is easily filled in
from the context, and a missed video frame causes only a momentary
pause or distortion. This is often not the case for the whiteboard.
One of the ways faculty use the whiteboard is to load preprepared
PostScript slides containing figures or equations, and then use the
mark-up capability of the whiteboard to provide additional
information and lead the class through the discussion of the
presented material. A typical PostScript image, even when
compressed, may be 10 to 50KB. In order to stream this to the
client systems, the image is broken into multiple network packets
by the server and reassembled at the client prior to rendering. If
even a single packet is lost in transit, the reassembled image will
be incomplete and the rendering will fail. The entire image will be
absent from the client whiteboard. The whiteboard protocol contains
a feature for dealing with this problem during a live session. Each
network packet is numbered so every client can identify when a
packet is missing. That client can then send a request to all the
other session participants asking for the packet to be
retransmitted, and any client that has the requested packet can
respond. This late delivery mechanism works well for the whiteboard
because it less sensitive to the synchronization. Unfortunately,
the mVCR recording tool is passive. It simply records the packets
that are received without requesting retransmission of missing
packets. Whenever a PostScript image is received with any packets
missing, it will be incomplete in the recording, and will not
appear during playback. This can significantly degrade the quality
of the learning experience, since the students viewing the playback
are unable to see the prepared material.</p><p>To overcome this difficulty, a repair tool was developed:
<span   class="bold"><b>fix_wb_recording.pl</b></span>. The Perl tool
simply parses through the whiteboard recording, locates any
PostScript images with missing data, and replaces them with
complete images. Parsing the recording requires detailed knowledge
of both the mVCR recording format and the wb data format. Neither
of these is well documented but sufficient information is available
on the Web. The mVCR recording format is described by Peter Parnes
at
<a href="http://www.cdt.luth.se/~peppar/progs/mMOD/doc/fileformat.txt" target="_self">www.cdt.luth.se/~peppar/progs/mMOD/doc/fileformat.txt</a>.
The mVCR format is just a header containing basic setup information
(multicast address and port number) and any number of wrapped wb
data packets. The wb data format has never been published but Lars
Rasmusson has posted a reverse-engineered description of the format
at
<a href="http://www.it.kth.se/~d90-lra/wb-proto.html" target="_self">www.it.kth.se/~d90-lra/wb-proto.html</a>.
While it is known that this description is incomplete and incorrect
in some details, it was sufficiently accurate for the purpose of
repairing the mVCR recordings. Within the wb data format,
PostScript images appear as a sequence (not necessarily
consecutive) of draw commands that encode the PostScript data and
issue the command to the client to render the complete
image.</p><p>Whenever the parsing routine encounters a PostScript image in
the recording, it opens each PostScript file that was used in the
original session and searches for a matching data block. Since most
instructors prepare all of their PostScript images using a single
software tool, the images often contain large sections that are
identical. Therefore it is usually necessary to check several
recorded data blocks before one is found that produces a unique
match with one of the original images. Once a unique match is
found, each draw command associated with the recorded image is
deleted and new draw commands are inserted containing all of the
data blocks of the complete image and an associated render image
command. After a recording has been completed, DETA gives the user
the option of post-processing the slides with the repair tool. If
this option is chosen, DETA sends the actual PostScript slides to
the VCR server and runs the fix_wb_recording.pl tool. Once this was
implemented, problems with the quality of the recorded sessions
dropped to nearly zero.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27eb580.0x28dbf98"></a>MBone Classes at NC State</h2></div></div><p></p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4018f5.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>Figure 5. The MBone Classroom at NC
State</p></div></div>
</p><p>North Carolina State University has been running MBone
classes since the fall of 1996. In this time, a number of
undergraduate engineering courses have been delivered to
participating universities and community colleges. At NC State, a
classroom was constructed specifically for distance education (see
Figure 5). This classroom contains seating for local students.
There are two remote-control video cameras, one for the lecturer
and one for the students. There are three large television monitors
on which the computer screen is shown to the local students. There
is a control area with a computer workstation, document camera, two
small TV monitors and an AMX controller. The AMX controller
controls the cameras as well as the other audio and video sources.
It also provides a central control to operate the other equipment
in the room. The most innovative feature of the classroom is a
digital projection SMARTBoard mounted on the front wall of the
classroom. The SMARTBoard is an input device manufactured by SMART
Technologies. It is essentially a touch-sensitive version of a
standard office whiteboard. Whatever is written on the surface of
the SMARTBoard is transmitted to the computer. The projection
version used in the classroom works in combination with an LCD
projector to project an image of the computer screen directly onto
the SMARTBoard. In this way, the lecturer essentially writes
directly on the computer screen. The SMARTBoard is large enough
that the local students see directly what the lecturer is writing
on the SMARTBoard. This technology provides a natural closed-loop
interface to the computer that closely parallels the traditional
classroom blackboard.</p><p>Generally, a teaching assistant operates the computer
equipment and cameras while the instructor lectures. This frees the
instructor from having to deal with any technical issues while the
class is in session. One of these issues relates to the
floor-control aspect of DETA. The floor-control provided by the
Electronic Hand Raiser is purely voluntary, and requires all
participants to follow the correct protocol. Often we have found
that remote participants will scribble onto the shared whiteboard
to get the lecturer's attention, or the instructor will simply fail
to acknowledge incoming questions. A good solution to the
floor-control issue remains to be found and usually it is the
assistant's responsibility to help the lecturer acknowledge any
questions. Another associated issue occurs when a local student
asks a question. The lecturer must repeat the question in order for
it to be heard by the remote sites. Often the lecturer will
mysteriously stop speaking for a moment, and then start answering a
question that none of the remote participants ever heard asked.
Remote participants are then forced to either figure out what had
been asked, or interrupt the flow of class and ask the lecturer
what the original question was. One solution to this problem has
been to give students their own microphones. Unfortunately, this
relies either on them remembering to activate the microphone, or on
distracting continuous presence audio.</p><p>The overall response by students to the MBone classes has
been positive. The interactive capabilities provided by the MBone
tools are far superior to videotapes or broadcasts. They provide a
richer educational experience, more similar to a traditional
classroom. Most instructors have been able to adapt well to the
technology, though there exists somewhat of a learning curve for
those accustomed to traditional classroom teaching. One of our
primary aims in the future is to flatten this learning curve and
make the technology more transparent to the user. Ideally, an
instructor should be able to walk into a classroom, activate the
equipment, and begin lecturing immediately, without giving any more
thought to the underlying technology. While this goal has yet to be
achieved, we feel that the MBone tools and DETA, in combination
with the Linux platform, represent a highly usable and
cost-effective vehicle for the delivery of interactive distance
education. For more information, as well as links to all of the
DETA and MBone software, visit our web site at
