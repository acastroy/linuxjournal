    Home music networks of the (near) future will bring unlimited
    choice into your living room.

bin as vinyl records and cassettes? Not if the only way you can
listen to tunes is by using your PC or a battery-powered player
that holds an hour of music. But fear not, digital denizens&mdash;a
number of new devices are emerging to MP3-ize everything from
stereo components to boom boxes. And Linux will play a key role in
this potentially huge new market.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b3b580.0x1c336b8"></a>The New Media: No Media</h2></div></div><p>For too long, digital music has been tied to a specific
medium: the 120mm CD. To listen to a song, you carry a disc from
player to player. That isn't so bad with one disc, but carrying an
entire collection around is impractical. And until the recent
availability of CD burners, there was no way to create new
compilations of songs you like or get rid of ones you don't. But
digital music is just a bunch of bits. The combination of new
compression techniques such as MP3, with faster modems and bigger
hard disks, has made it practical to move digitized songs from one
device to another. It has also become trivial to create (legally or
illegally) new copies of songs.</p><p>Today, this process is typically performed on a PC, which is
the only device that most people own with a network connection and
a hard disk. But a PC is not ideal for this task. It takes a long
time to boot, the user interface is complex, and it crashes
frequently. In addition, PCs are too expensive to put in every
room, and they often don't have high-quality sound outputs.</p><p>The solution is to create a home music network. Start with a
music server. This stand-alone device has a hard disk, a network
connection, a small screen or TV connection for the user interface,
high-quality audio outputs and inputs, and probably a CD drive.
Users can download music from the Internet and also &ldquo;rip&rdquo; their
own files from the CD drive or external audio sources. The user can
listen to stored music using playlists or listen to streaming
Internet radio.</p><p>The natural operating system for this device is Linux. No
Windows compatibility is needed in this appliance, but Linux
provides out-of-the-box networking and enough power to handle
downloading, ripping, streaming and listening at the same
time.</p><p>Now add music clients to the home network. These low-cost
devices send requests to the music server and play streaming audio
from the server or from the Internet. No hard disk or CD drive is
required, but Linux is again a good choice, given its low cost and
network support. Just as your home may have several radios and CD
players, future homes will have several music devices connected to
the music server.</p><p>A number of technologies, by the way, are vying to become the
home network of choice, including phone line (HPNA), power line
(HomePlug) and wireless (802.11). Any of these can support a home
music network of several devices. With this new way of listening to
music, there is no physical medium. Songs are accessible as bit
streams from any device that is hooked to the network. In theory,
you could listen to your music from a hotel room in Iowa, assuming
it had an Internet connection. You could also download songs to a
variety of portable devices that could each hold some or all of
your music collection, allowing you to listen to your music when
not connected to the Net.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b3b580.0x1c33978"></a>Devices Beginning to Emerge</h2></div></div><p>The first company to get behind this vision was S3, which
owns the Rio line of portable MP3 players. The company recently
announced the Rio Receiver
(<a href="http://www.riohome.com" target="_self">http://www.riohome.com/</a>),
which is a music client that uses the PC as a server, connecting
through your existing phone wiring (without disrupting your phone
service). The device sells for about $250 US, although you will
also need to add a $49 phone-line networking card to your PC if you
don't already have one. S3 is developing a music server, but that
device is not yet available. Both S3 and partner Dell Computer are
selling the new devices.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4219f1.large.jpg"><img src="4219f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. The Rio Receiver
</p></div></div><p>Other small companies including Lansonic, Lydstrom and
Zapmedia are marketing digital music systems with various levels of
networking capability, but only S3 is producing both music servers
and low-cost music clients. Its Rio was the first and is still the
leading portable MP3 player, and S3 is leading the way with home
stereo components as well. While only a third of all Americans
regularly use the Internet, almost everyone listens to music.
Digital music, in MP3 and other formats, could be the killer
application that drives the adoption of home networks. As the
easiest way to get a non-PC device onto a network, Linux will have
many opportunities in this new market.</p></div></div>
