    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x295f580.0x2a57608"></a></h2></div></div><p>Linux is being used in more and more
tight places&mdash;devices or situations where multiple gigabytes of
storage or dozens of megabytes of RAM are simply not available.
Many <i  >Linux Journal</i> articles have addressed
this growing embedded systems space. Here, I will describe a
terrific open-source tool for people needing a suite of utilities
for use in these tight places.
</p><p>BusyBox is a single-binary application that includes the
capabilities of more than 70 standard Linux utilities. The BusyBox
project was started by Bruce Perens when he was leading the Debian
project. Many others have contributed code since then; the project
is currently maintained by Erik Andersen, who also maintains a web
page for it at
<a href="http://busybox.lineo.com" target="_self">http://busybox.lineo.com/</a>.
(BusyBox is sponsored by embedded Linux vendor Lineo, Inc. See
<a href="http://www.lineo.com" target="_self">http://www.lineo.com/</a>.)</p><p>The corresponding standard utilities that BusyBox replaces
occupy about 1.5MB of disk space in a standard Linux system. The
BusyBox program uses only 260KB of disk space; it can even be
compiled to include only a handful of utilities that you select,
still within a single binary. We'll see how to do this
later.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x295f580.0x2a578c8"></a>How It Works</h2></div></div><p>Linux distributions normally include packages with many
separate utilities, often in sets named textutils, shellutils or
something similar. These utilities are generally very
full-featured. For example, the command to list files,
<span   class="bold"><b>ls</b></span>, supports over 50 command-line
options. Because these utilities are so full-featured, they are
sometimes larger than you might expect. For example, the
<span   class="bold"><b>ls</b></span> command (dynamically linked)
occupies 48KB of disk space. While you wouldn't notice that on a
standard PC, many of those 50 options are just wasted space on an
embedded system or boot disk. BusyBox combines numerous utilities
in a single binary, limiting the features of each utility to those
most commonly needed. The <span   class="bold"><b>ls</b></span>
command in BusyBox has a mere 12 options&mdash;more than enough for most
of us.</p><p>When you enter the name of a utility in a shell (at the Linux
command line), the shell locates the binary with that name and
executes it. When you install BusyBox, it creates links in your
file system so that instead of having a real
<span   class="bold"><b>ls</b></span> command, you have a symbolic
link named &ldquo;ls&rdquo; that refers to the BusyBox binary. A directory
listing of <span   class="bold"><b>ls</b></span> would then appear
like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
lrwxrwxrwx 1 nwells users 12 May 17 14:47 ls -&gt;/bin/busybox
</pre><p>Typing <span   class="bold"><b>ls</b></span> at the command
prompt causes the shell to launch the BusyBox program, which in
turn examines the name under which you invoked it. Seeing that you
entered <span   class="bold"><b>ls</b></span> in this example, the
BusyBox program proceeds to act like
<span   class="bold"><b>ls</b></span>, interpreting any additional
options according to that command.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x295f580.0x2a57d98"></a>What Does BusyBox Include?</h2></div></div><p>If this talk about 70 utilities in one is making you curious,
here are a few samples of what BusyBox includes. The web site given
above has a complete list with documentation:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><b  >chmod, chown, chroot, lsmod, rmmod,
insmod</b></p></li><li><p><b  >dd, df, du, mkfs.minix, fsck.minix, mount,
sfdisk</b></p></li><li><p><b  >find, grep, sed, gzip, gunzip,
tar</b></p></li><li><p><b  >kill, killall, ps</b></p></li><li><p><b  >cp, cut, mv, rm, ln, more,
tr</b></p></li><li><p><b  >nslookup, ping, telnet</b></p></li><li><p><b  >init, syslogd, sh</b></p></li></ul></div><p>Many of these utilities are reduced versions to fit in the
260KB total space mentioned above. For example, the
<b  >sh</b> shell doesn't support if/then/else statements
or while loops, but it has enough built-in commands to handle
simple startup shell scripts. Also, commands like
<span   class="bold"><b>init</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>tar</b></span> have greatly reduced
functionality, but they are sufficient to get the job done for many
applications where you don't have space for the full-blown utility.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x295f580.0x2a58790"></a>Compiling BusyBox</h2></div></div><p>Adding BusyBox to your system is simple. First, obtain the
source code by visiting
<a href="ftp://ftp.lineo.com/pub/busybox" target="_self">ftp.lineo.com/pub/busybox</a>
and downloading the most recent version of the compressed tar file.
As of this writing, the most recent version is the file
<b  >busybox-0.45.tar.gz</b>, but newer versions will
probably be available by the time you read this. Work on BusyBox
seems to progress at a steady pace.</p><p>After you've downloaded the tar file, place it in a working
directory and use this command to untar the file:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
tar xvzf busybox-0.45.tar.gz
</pre><p>Change to the newly created busybox directory (I write the
name in lowercase this time to match the binary name) and enter the
<span   class="bold"><b>make</b></span> command:
<pre     class="programlisting">
cd busybox-0.45
make
</pre>


Now you're ready to test a few BusyBox commands. The busybox binary
is located in the main busybox directory after you use the make
command. In order to use a particular feature of BusyBox, execute
the busybox binary with a command name as a parameter. For example,
to use the <span   class="bold"><b>ls</b></span> command, from within
the busybox-0.45 directory, enter:
<pre     class="programlisting">
 ./busybox ls
</pre>


Or to use the <span   class="bold"><b>lsmod</b></span> command,
enter:
<pre     class="programlisting">
 ./busybox lsmod
</pre>


Additional command options can be placed after the command name.
For example, to use the <span   class="bold"><b>du</b></span> command
to view only the contents of the /etc directory tree, type this:
<b  >./busybox du /etc</b>
</p><p>Another important feature of BusyBox is that you can see a
small on-line help screen for each utility that BusyBox replaces.
Just use the <b  >--help</b> option with the command. For
example, to learn about the ls options that BusyBox supports, enter
<b  >./busybox ls --help</b></p><p>This displays the following help text:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
BusyBox v0.45 (2000.05.17-20:38+0000) multi-call
binary -- GPL2
Usage: ls [-1acdelnpuxACF] [filenames...]
Options:
-a      do not hide entries starting with .
-c      with -l: show ctime (the time of last
        modification of file status information)
-d      list directory entries instead of contents
-e      list both full date and full time
-l      use a long listing format
-n      list numeric UIDs and GIDs instead of names
-p      append indicator (one of /=@|) to entries
-u      with -l: show access time (the time of last
        access of the file)
-x      list entries by lines instead of by columns
-A      do not list implied . and ..
-C      list entries by columns
-F      append indicator (one of */=@|) to entries
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x295f580.0x2e51118"></a>Installing BusyBox</h2></div></div><p>BusyBox is most useful on a system without a set of regular
Linux utility programs, but you'll probably be exploring it on a
standard Linux system. Because of this, you should use the PREFIX
variable when installing BusyBox. The installation process creates
symbolic links for all the utilities that BusyBox supports. This
allows you to enter <b  >ls</b> instead of
<b  >busybox ls</b>. Suppose you had begun working with
BusyBox in the <b  >/tmp</b> directory (such that a
directory called <b  >/tmp/busybox-0.45</b> was created
by the <span   class="bold"><b>tar</b></span> command). Then, if you
want to create symbolic links in the same area, use this
command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
make PREFIX=/tmp/busybox-0.45 install
</pre><p>The <b  >/tmp/busybox-0.45</b> directory will then
contain subdirectories named <b  >bin</b>,
<b  >sbin</b> and <b  >usr</b>, each with
symbolic links to /bin/busybox. You'll also need to copy the
busybox binary to <b  >/bin</b> before using these
symbolic links:
<pre     class="programlisting">
cp /tmp/busybox-0.45/busybox /bin
</pre>


Now you're ready to explore the symbolic links in your BusyBox
subdirectories. For example, change to the bin directory:
<pre     class="programlisting">
cd /tmp/busybox-0.45/bin
</pre>


Then use the ls symbolic link with the <b  >--help</b>
option:
<pre     class="programlisting">
 ./ls --help
</pre>


You see the same help text as indicated previously. This shows you
that BusyBox is being used instead of the standard ls command on
your Linux system.
</p><p>BusyBox uses the GNU C library, or glibc, which can add
substantially to the space requirements of an embedded system or
boot disk. You might consider looking at alternate C libraries to
save space. Examples include minix libc and newlibc. Another
example that looks promising but doesn't yet support the full
functionality of BusyBox is the uC-libc project from Rt-Control
(see
<a href="http://www.uclinux.org" target="_self">http://www.uclinux.org/</a>).
The maintainer of BusyBox, Erik Andersen, is currently working to
enhance this mini C library so that it can be used to reduce the
total size requirements for BusyBox.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x295f580.0x2e51850"></a>Configuring BusyBox</h2></div></div><p>The description of BusyBox so far is straightforward, but
doesn't capture all that the program offers. Returning to the
source code you un-tarred when you compiled BusyBox, load the file
busybox.def.h into a text editor:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cd /tmp/busybox-0.45 vi busybox.def.h
</pre><p>The first part of this file (about the first 100 lines)
contains <b  >#define</b> statements for each utility
capability that will be included in BusyBox. If you don't want to
include the capabilities of one of these utilities, simply comment
out that line. For example, if you don't need
<span   class="bold"><b>sed</b></span> in the system you are using
BusyBox on, comment out the line for sed using two forward slashes,
like this:
<pre     class="programlisting">
//#define BB_SED
</pre>


Commenting out a few of the larger utilities greatly reduces the
size of the final busybox binary. For example, removing five
complex programs (<b  >init</b>, <b  >tar</b>,
<b  >sfdisk</b>, <b  >gzip</b> and
<b  >gunzip</b>) reduces the size of the busybox binary
from 260KB to 155KB.
</p><p>The second part of the busybox.def.h file (after a few
explanatory comments) contains #define statements that activate or
disable various features of BusyBox. Some of these features are
intended to save memory, such as eliminating the use of the /proc
file system, reducing the amount of on-line help provided and
eliminating the use of regular expressions. Other #defines are
specific to features of a single command. For example, you can
eliminate the ability to create new tar files with the tar features
of BusyBox. Unless you really need to shave off a couple more KB in
the size of BusyBox, you shouldn't need to alter the #define
options in the second section of the busybox.def.h file.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x295f580.0x2e51d20"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>Embedded versions of Linux such as Lineo's Embedix may be the
most obvious use of BusyBox, but you might come up with many other
uses. For example, if you need to create an initrd file to boot up
a system with unusual hardware, you can use BusyBox functionality
to add the basic system utilities with a single easy-to-manage
binary. Or, you might use BusyBox as part of a boot diskette or
single-disk version of Linux, as the Linux Router Project and the
Debian boot floppies.</p><p><a href="4238s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
