    In the first part of this three-part series on real-time audio
    synthesis,
    we take you through the history and basis of RTcmix.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a40580.0x1b385b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>RTcmix is a software package that
performs audio synthesis and effects processing. Basically, it's a
real-time version of the Cmix language. Standard control over
program execution is achieved via a C-style scripting language
called MINC (MINC Is Not C). It has been open source long before
the phrase was coined. That fact has been key to its evolution.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a40580.0x1b386b8"></a>History</h2></div></div><p>There have been literally dozens of RTcmix hackers over the
past 20 years. I've done my best to give some credit as it relates
to this article. You can also check the AUTHORS file included in
the recent distribution (see &ldquo;Getting and Installing&rdquo;
below).</p><p>Cmix was derived from the MIX program, a 20-track mixer
written by Paul Lansky (at Princeton University) in 1978, which ran
on VMS in FORTRAN on IBM mainframes. Synthesis abilities were
added, and Paul ported Cmix to run on a PDP11/34 in 1983-84 under
BSD2.9 UNIX. In 1985, he moved it over to Ultrix on a DEC MicroVAX.
He and Lars Graf added the MINC parser in 1987, with help from Brad
Garton and Dave Madole on various parts. Cmix lived happily under
the NeXt (and other UNIX systems) for several years with its user
base primarily in academic institutions. It has been and continues
to be used both for instruction, computer music composition and
research development.</p><p>Doug Scott and Paul Lansky ported an initial real-time
version to SGI in 1995. While sometime in 1993, as a student and
research assistant at Columbia University's Computer Music Center
(CMC), I took a first stab at a Linux port which had to use Sox to
unswap big-endian files. Boy was that fun. In late 1995, Brad
Garton (CMC director) and I created a real-time version with a
scheduler. RTcmix was born, originally running under IRIX. Porting
to Linux basically entailed swapping out the IRIX audio API with
OSS (Open Sound System). The initial IRIX version was presented at
the International Computer Music Conference (ICMC) '97. Shortly
thereafter, Luke DuBois (also at the CMC) added an API to make
writing TCP socket data easier. Doug Scott set up a mechanism to
dynamically load instruments at run-time in 1997. John Gibson (at
UVA) cleaned up the business of reading and writing different audio
file formats in 1999 with an interface to Bill Schottstaedt's (at
Stanford University) sndlib. John and I recently added two new
abilities: routing audio via an internal &ldquo;bus&rdquo; mechanism and
multichannel audio support. This work was presented this past year
at the Society for Electoacoustic Music in the U.S. (SEAMUS) Y2K
conference in Denton, Texas. Work also continues on controlling
synthesis parameters in real time, creating various interfaces, and
more robust socket support.</p><p>Setting up CVS (Concurrent Versions System) to help manage
code has facilitated recent collaborations and development. The
main core of RTcmix is released under the GPL (GNU Public License),
with some different licenses for various components (e.g.,
instruments and effects) depending on their origin.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a40580.0x1b388c8"></a>Getting and Installing RTcmix</h2></div></div><p>In order to make use of RTcmix's real-time audio abilities,
you need to install and set up the OSS audio drivers for Linux (see
Resources). Support for ALSA (Advanced Linux Sound Architecture)
remains untested but is planned. If you want to use RTcmix as a
real-time audio processor, you need to make sure your audio card
supports full-duplex operation. The Linux version of RTcmix can be
downloaded via ftp from:</p><p><a href="ftp://presto.music.virginia.edu/pub/RTcmix" target="_self">presto.music.virginia.edu/pub/RTcmix</a></p><p>The latest version as of this article is 3.0. The complete
package exists in separate packages. RTcmix-3.0.0.tar.gz: the core
engine and scheduler. insts.jg-3.0.0.tar.gz: instruments written by
John Gibson. insts.mch-3.0.0.tar.gz: multichannel instruments.
insts.std-3.0.0.tar.gz: standard suite of instruments. [At
publication time, current versions of all of these packages is
3.0.2&mdash;ED]</p><p>I should probably comment on some terminology here. An RTcmix
&ldquo;instrument&rdquo; can be either an effects processor (e.g., DELAY) or
a synthesizer (e.g., FM synthesis).</p><p>Instrument packages should be unpacked into the same
directory as the main code. So if you unpack the main code (RTcmix)
to /usr/local/src, you'll end up with /usr/local/src/RTcmix-3.0.0.
Untar instrument packages into that directory. In the case of
insts.std.tgz, you'd end up with
/usr/local/src/RTcmix-3.0.0/insts.std-3.0.0. You can unpack the
main code into any directory you like (e.g., your home directory or
anyplace else).</p><p>In order to keep instruments and RTcmix versions consistent,
we've added version tags to their directories. To make compilation
simpler, you should symlink these to default names. For example,
insts.std.tgz will untar into insts.std-3.0.0. You should symlink
this as:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ln -s insts.std-3.0.0 insts.std
</pre><p>Once you've gotten everything unpacked and linked, you can
set things up for compilation. There's no ./configure utility here.
You have to edit makefile.conf in the RTcmix root directory. Only a
few lines need changing. Reading from the top of the file:
<pre     class="programlisting">
# Change stuff in here as needed

# The directory containing the RTcmix directory
TOPDIR = /usr/local/src

# The name of the RTcmix directory
CMIXDIR = $(TOPDIR)/RTcmix-3.0.0

# The dir that will contain links to the
# instrument dynamic shared objects
LIBDESTDIR = $(CMIXDIR)/shlib

# add new instruments to this list (e.g.,
# insts.std, insts.jg)
INST_DIRS = insts.base #insts.std insts.jg insts.mch
</pre>


The only things you really need to potentially change are
<b  >TOPDIR</b>, depending on where you've unpacked
RTcmix, and <b  >INST_DIRS</b>, depending on which
instrument packages you've downloaded.
</p><p>Once you've made the appropriate changes, you can do a
<b  >make &amp;&amp; make install</b> from the top-level
RTcmix directory. This will compile everything and put a CMIX
executable in TOPDIR/bin and shared libraries in TOPDIR/shlib. Make
sure the bin directory is part of your
<b  >PATH</b>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a40580.0x1b38ea0"></a>Making &ldquo;Music&rdquo;</h2></div></div><p>The MINC scripting language provides both a powerful and
easy-to-learn interface to RTcmix. More terminology: a MINC script
is referred to as a scorefile. If you understand C, using MINC will
be trivial. Some major differences are no semicolons at the end of
each line and no functions (sorry). The art of using MINC (RTcmix)
to make music is the primary focus of several semester-long college
and graduate courses offered at several higher education
institutions around the world. There's no way I can do it complete
justice here. Instead, we'll take a look at some scorefiles which
illustrate various features.</p><p>To execute a scorefile, simply pipe it into CMIX with
stdin.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
CMIX &lt; scorefile
</pre><p>from the command line will fire it off. Internally, this
syntax passes the scorefile to a parser (compiled by yacc/bison)
which in turn passes events to a scheduler. When used in real-time
performance mode (i.e., with external control sources), the RTcmix
parser listens to a TCP socket, parsing data on the fly. In this
instance, parser and scheduler are implemented using the
linuxthreads library. The following scorefiles are included with
version 3.0 of RTcmix and were designed by John Gibson.
</p><p><a href="3681l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1.</a></p><p>Listing 1 illustrates a reasonably simple scorefile which
uses two RTcmix instruments. There are dozens more. WAVETABLE, as
the name implies, is a wavetable lookup instrument. REVERBIT, also
descriptive, runs a reverberation effect on an audio stream. In
this example, the output of WAVETABLE is piped into REVERBIT, then
out to your audio device and/or an audio file.</p><p>Let's step through the scorefile a bit:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
rtsetparams(44100, 2)
</pre><p>This command is necessary for all RTcmix scorefiles. It sets
up the audio device to run in stereo at 44100hz. An optional third
parameter allows you to configure the audio buffer size to reduce
latency in performance (e.g., when controlling RTcmix from another
application). Default is 8,192 frames.
</p><p>Next we declare which &ldquo;instruments&rdquo; we're going to
use:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
load("WAVETABLE")
load("REVERBIT")
</pre><p>As mentioned above, RTcmix supports the dynamic loading of
libraries. These commands load the instruments at run-time. This
allows for a smaller memory footprint than loading all the
instruments simultaneously. It also allows you to write a score
that uses multiple instruments.
</p><p>The next few lines are commented out. Uncommenting them will
allow audio to be written to a soundfile as well as the audio
device. The set_option command (de)activates various RTcmix
features. For example: <b  >set_option("AUDIO_OFF")</b>
will turn off writing to the audio device&mdash;useful when your
scorefile forces your computer to stretch beyond its means.</p><p>In order to map the audio from one source to another,
eventually to your speakers or a soundfile, we call:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
bus_config("WAVETABLE", "aux 0-1 out")
bus_config("REVERBIT", "aux 0-1 in", "out 0-1")
</pre><p>As mentioned earlier, one of RTcmix's newest features is the
ability to route audio streams. In an attempt to keep tradition
with established mixing convention, we've adopted a &ldquo;bus&rdquo;
paradigm. Internal buses are labeled as &ldquo;aux&rdquo;, which can be read
from (as &ldquo;in&rdquo;) or written to (as &ldquo;out&rdquo;). Input devices are
labeled &ldquo;in&rdquo;, and output buses (audio devices) &ldquo;out.&rdquo; The
convention for bus designation is:
<span   class="bold"><b>bus_type</b></span> &ldquo;number&rdquo; [in or out for
aux]. So &ldquo;out 0&rdquo; would be an output channel (e.g., a speaker) and
&ldquo;in 0&rdquo; a line in or mic. This is not to be confused with &ldquo;aux 0
in&rdquo; which is the specification of an internal bus that is being
read from by a particular instrument.
</p><p>So, the statements above first route WAVETABLE's output to
aux (internal bus) 0 and 1. Then REVERBIT's
<b  >bus_config</b> is set up to read from aux 0 and 1
(WAVETABLE's output) and write its output to a stereo audio device
(out 0-1). It is possible to have multiple bus configurations for
the same instrument. Each inherits the most recent call.</p><p>The next line in the score sets a global variable
<b  >totdur</b>. Variables are auto declared at init time
(i.e., when the RTcmix parser reads your file). There are no
reserved global variable names.</p><p>In order to set &ldquo;control rate&rdquo; update of internal synthesis
parameters (e.g., amplitude envelope updates) we use the
<b  >reset</b> command. So <b  >reset(2000)</b>
updates 2,000 times every 44,100 samples&mdash;every 20.5
samples.</p><p>The following two lines are a bit less
self-descriptive:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
setline(0,0, 1,1, 5,0)
makegen(2, 10, 10000, 1,.5,.3,.1)
</pre><p>As with many packages that have developed over a number of
years, RTcmix has its share of legacy issues. Unit generators in
Cmix are defined by the <span   class="bold"><b>makegen</b></span>
statement. Makegens are used for various internal aspects of a
particular instrument: an amplitude envelope, waveform for a
lookup, pitch vibrato, and so forth. The
<span   class="bold"><b>setline</b></span> command is a related
statement, used specifically to set an amplitude envelope. The
time-value pairs set an amplitude of 0 at time 0, 1 at time 1 and
zero at time 5. Time in this sense is relative and will be
stretched accordingly to the duration of your &ldquo;note&rdquo; (see below).
The WAVETABLE instrument needs some kind of waveform to read in
order to make sound. It stores this information in &ldquo;slot 2&rdquo;. Slot
1 is used for the amplitude envelope defined by the setline. Yes,
you could substitute a makegen command for that setline (gen24).
Gen10 specifies loading a sinusoid into the respective slot (in
this case 2). The size (in samples) of the wavetable in this case
is 10,000. Remaining arguments are amplitudes for successive
harmonics. That's about as complicated as it gets, at least in this
article.
</p><p>After assigning some more global variables, we seed the
random number generator with:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
srand(3284)
</pre><p>The actual music making is done by the following lines:
<pre     class="programlisting">
for (st = 0; st &lt; totdur; st = st + .45)
    WAVETABLE(st, dur, amp, freq, random())
</pre>


This is a simple for loop which executes until st is greater than
totdur (defined earlier). The parameters to WAVETABLE (as well as
all other RTcmix functions and instruments) are referred to as
p-fields. In the case of WAVETABLE:
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>p0 = start time</p></li><li><p>p1 = duration</p></li><li><p>p2 = digital amplitude (in this case between 0 and
32767)</p></li><li><p>p3 = frequency (in hz)</p></li><li><p>p4 = stereo spread</p></li></ul></div>

For p4 = 0 100% of the output will go to channel 0 (defined by
bus_config above) and pf4 = 1 sends it all to channel 1. A value of
0.5 splits between both channels evenly. Note that the random()
function call returns a floating point value between 0 and 1u.
</p><p>The last few lines of the score reset the amplitude envelope
with <b  >setline(0,1, 1,1)</b>, because we want a
slightly different one for our REVERBIT function, which we call
with: <b  >REVERBIT(st=0, insk=0, totdur, amp, revtime, revpct,
rtchandel, cf)</b>.</p><p>The p-fields for REVERBIT are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>p0 = start time</p></li><li><p>p1 = inskip, which is the time to start reading
input. (Use 0 for bus_configs; some other value when reading in
from a file.)</p></li><li><p>p2 = duration</p></li><li><p>p3 = amplitude multiplier (generally between 0 and
1)</p></li><li><p>p4 = reverb time</p></li><li><p>p5 = reverb percentage</p></li><li><p>p6 = right channel delay</p></li><li><p>p7 = cutoff frequency for low-pass filter (in
hz)</p></li><li><p>p8 (optional) = apply DC blocking filter
(boolean)</p></li></ul></div><p>That's it. Simply type the following to execute the score:
<pre     class="programlisting">
CMIX &lt; WAVETABLE_REVERBIT_1.sco
</pre>


Listing 2 is a musically simpler example, but illustrates the
powerful ability of RTcmix to process an incoming audio stream in
real time.
</p><p><a href="3681l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2.</a></p><p>To set up our audio device for simultaneous reading and
writing, we use the set_option command again:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
set_option("full_duplex_on")
</pre><p>It's necessary to have this command executed before the
rtsetparams call, as it sets an internal flag that rtsetparams uses
when performing actual setup of the audio device. As before, we set
up the device for 44K stereo, but this time decreasing the internal
buffer size for real-time performance to 512 frames.
</p><p>To tell RTcmix to read from the audio device, we use:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
rtinput("AUDIO", "MIC")
</pre><p>The <b  >MIC</b> argument is necessary only in IRIX
versions of RTcmix. We could just as well say:
<pre     class="programlisting">
rtinput("some_file.aiff")
</pre>


to read an audio file instead.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a40580.0x1b313b8"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>RTcmix is an incredibly powerful and flexible package because
of the work of many people, and possible because of its open-source
nature. Different features have been added by different people over
the years. It continues to evolve. The Linux operating system has
been an excellent platform both for development and performance.
With the recent advent of high-end, multichannel digital audio card
support for Linux (e.g., the RME Digi96 series), the abilities of
RTcmix grow in conjunction with the OS.</p><p>This article only scratches the surface of RTcmix's
potential. Future articles will discuss in greater depth the
process of writing RTcmix instruments and controlling them in real
time (e.g., with nice open-source GUI packages like GTK).</p><p>In the end, it remains amazing to think that a computer,
operating system and software package can work together well enough
to make music. It is, however, by no means new thinking. Ada
Lovelace apparently debated at length with Charles Babbage the
virtues of this &ldquo;new computing device&rdquo;. His contentions had to do
with an unbeatable chess player, hers about a device that could
compose and create music of any type or degree of
complexity.</p><p><a href="3681s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
