Dave rolls the dice to see if he's getting brains for lunch or a

I've spent the past few articles describing how to work with ImageMagick,
watermarking, resizing and adding 3-D frames to images from within shell
scripts. Interesting stuff, but I feel the need to move back to some game
programming, because it's more fun to write than something
practical and actually useful. See? That's how this year's going to
go in my column. I'm going to start out by enjoying programming
rather than carrying it as a burden while we Accomplish Important Things.
You with me? I thought you would be. 
</p><p>
So in this article, I'm going to start writing a multi-dice-rolling
game program based on the fun, lightweight game <span   class="emphasis"><em>Zombie
Dice</em></span>. In the game,
you're a zombie trying to accumulate brains without getting shot down
by vengeful humans. The game comes with 13 dice: six green, four yellow
and three
red. Each die has three possible elements: brains (good), gunshots (bad)
and feet, which denote the person represented by that particular die has
&ldquo;done a runner&rdquo; and you'll need to roll that particular die
again next turn.
</p><p>
Out of the 13 dice, you randomly pick three each time, then roll them,
accumulating both brains and gunshots. If you get to three gunshots,
you're dead. If you get to 13 brains, you win. That's about it.
In the real game, you take turns with someone else, but I'll get into
the nuances a bit further in the program. For now, let's start by
looking at how to simulate each individual die. Remember, there are three
different colors, the green being the &ldquo;easiest&rdquo; humans to defeat,
and the red being the &ldquo;hardest&rdquo;.
</p><p>
In programmatic terms, and using some additional variables to make the
notation easier to understand, here's how I am going to simulate the
different sides of these dice:

<pre     class="programlisting">
BRAIN=1; SHOT=2; RUNNER=3
gdie[1]=$BRAIN; gdie[2]=$BRAIN; gdie[3]=$BRAIN; 
gdie[4]=$SHOT; gdie[5]=$RUNNER; gdie[6]=$RUNNER;
ydie[1]=$BRAIN; ydie[2]=$BRAIN; ydie[3]=$SHOT;  
ydie[4]=$SHOT; ydie[5]=$RUNNER; ydie[6]=$RUNNER;
rdie[1]=$BRAIN; rdie[2]=$SHOT;  rdie[3]=$SHOT;  
rdie[4]=$SHOT; rdie[5]=$RUNNER; rdie[6]=$RUNNER;
</pre>
</p><p>
As you can see, each color die has six options&mdash;since they're all
six-sided dice&mdash;and the differences in color are reflected in the number
of brains, shots and runners each has specified.
</p><p>
Using all-caps variables as placeholders for numeric values is a bit of an
old-school programming technique, but the script will run 99% as fast, and
the value of the mnemonics makes writing a lot of the later code far easier
and helps avoid errors.
</p><p>
I also start my indexing at 1, not zero. Why, when Bash and other shells
use zero-index arrays? Um, I don't know, but likely it's just because it makes more sense to me
to refer to &ldquo;faces one through six&rdquo; on a die than &ldquo;zero
through five&rdquo;. Since
I'm using the mnemonic names rather than just numeric values, however,
I ostensibly could change some of this as desired if it really bugs you. 
The first actual script segment requires more mnemonic variables so I can
stick with the desire to write a very clear script:

<pre     class="programlisting">
GREEN=1; YELLOW=2; RED=3
function pick_color
{
  # returns 0 for green, 1 for yellow and 2 for red
  case $( expr $RANDOM % 13 + 1 ) in
    1|2|3|4|5|6  ) color=$GREEN  ;;
    7|8|9|10     ) color=$YELLOW ;;
    11|12|13     ) color=$RED    ;;
  esac
}
</pre>
</p><p>
As with just about every game, randomness is important. That's why so
many games have decks to shuffle, dice to roll and so on. Totally deterministic
games are generally a lot less fun (although not always&mdash;neither Chess nor Go
have any randomness to them).
</p><p>
Bash makes working with random numbers super easy. The special variable
<tt  >$RANDOM</tt> is assigned a random integer value between 1-MAXINT every
time you reference it&mdash;no need to &ldquo;seed&rdquo; it. 
</p><p>
Here's an easy and interesting little test:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ while [ $i -lt 10000 ] ; do 
  echo $RANDOM ; i=$(( $i + 1 )); 
done | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -5
   4 7281
   4 6947
   4 6309
   4 31328
   4 28955
</pre>
</p><p>
This spits out 10,000 random numbers, then analyzes how frequently each
occurs, displaying the five most common. In this case, you can see that the
most commonly occurring number appears only four times out of 10,000
numbers. Try this on your system: if you see a number appearing
significantly more, you might have a less random number system than you
want.
</p><p>
Now where was I? Oh yeah, rolling dice. Since I'm working in a
shell script, the idea of a function &ldquo;returning&rdquo; a value is pretty
non-existent, so instead I'll be setting global variables within local
function scope. It's sloppy programming, but a constraint of shell
scripting, so
bear with it and know that if you want to write this in Ruby, Perl or
similar, you'll be able to have a more rigorous policy with your own
variables.
</p><p>
Six out of 13 dice are green, four are yellow, and three are red. You can see how
that's easily implemented with the case statement.
</p><p>
In a very similar spirit, rolling an individual die is easily accomplished,
particularly because of the array of dice sides by color set up earlier in
the script. Here's all that's needed:

<pre     class="programlisting">
function roll_die
{
  # returns 1 for a brain, 2 for gunshot, 3 for a runner

  dieroll=$( expr $RANDOM % 6 + 1 )

  case $1 in
    $GREEN  ) roll=${gdie[$dieroll]} ;;
    $YELLOW ) roll=${ydie[$dieroll]} ;;
    $RED    ) roll=${rdie[$dieroll]} ;;
  esac
}
</pre>
</p><p>
A two-dimensional array would make this even easier, with a single line:
 
<pre     class="programlisting">  
roll=${die[$COLOR][$dieroll]}
</pre>
</p><p>
But in the interest of legibility, I've slightly complicated things with
the three different arrays. Still, the function's delightfully small
and easily understood.
</p><p>
Armed with both of these, it's easy to pick a color randomly and then
roll that die:

<pre     class="programlisting">
pick_color
roll_die $color
</pre>
</p><p>
Notice that the function <tt  >roll_die</tt> is written to expect the die color to be
specified as its parameter. Since we are using global variables, I suppose I
should just refer to <tt  >$color</tt> in the function, but that makes me cringe just
a little bit. Know what I mean?
</p><p>
Let's add some code to make it easy to display what I've
&ldquo;rolled&rdquo; too. This is easily done with arrays again:

<pre     class="programlisting">
colorname[$GREEN]="green"; colorname[$YELLOW]="yellow";
 &#8618;colorname[$RED]="red";
nameof[$BRAIN]="brain"; nameof[$SHOT]="gunshot";
 &#8618;nameof[$RUNNER]="runner";
</pre>
</p><p>
Now it's this easy to show what's been rolled:

<pre     class="programlisting">
echo "Rolled ${colorname[$color]} die: ${nameof[$roll]}"
</pre>
</p><p>
So let's roll a few dice:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ./zdice.sh
    rolled green die: runner
    rolled green die: brain
    rolled red die: runner
$ ./zdice.sh
    rolled green die: brain
    rolled red die: runner
    rolled red die: brain
</pre>
</p><p>
That's a good start. Next month, I'll look at how to accumulate
brains and track those dangerous gunshots. Meanwhile, why not pick up the
actual game, for sale at Target and a zillion other places. It's from
