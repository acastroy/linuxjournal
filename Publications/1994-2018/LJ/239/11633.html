SSDs, I</h4><p>
Regarding Brian Trapp's interesting article on SSDs [&ldquo;Solid-State
Drives&mdash;Get One Already&rdquo; in the January 2014 issue], there's one thing I would like to
know. Mr Trapp should have been more elaborate on this: how does he
reconcile his remark on TRIM and RAID setups with this:
<a href="http://serverfault.com/questions/508459/implementing-linux-fstrim-on-ssd-with-software-md-raid?" target="_self">serverfault.com/questions/508459/implementing-linux-fstrim-on-ssd-with-software-md-raid?</a>?
</p><p>
I have a RAID 1 setup running on an SSD, which works perfectly well with
fstrim.

<span   class="bold"><b>Brian Trapp replies:</b></span>
Thanks for your note. My assertion that SSDs, TRIM and RAID are a bad
combination was indeed incomplete. Never bet on Linux
<span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> having a
feature for long! 
</p><p>
If you're using hardware-based RAID (using the RAID feature built in to your
motherboard's BIOS, a standalone RAID card or a RAID on a NAS device),
TRIM support still is probably not going to work. Intel seems to be
working hard on the RST chipsets, but check the notes for your specific
driver carefully.
</p><p>
On the other hand, if you're using software-based RAID, the picture is much
prettier! According to the 3.7 Linux kernel notes
(<a href="http://kernelnewbies.org/Linux_3.7" target="_self">kernelnewbies.org/Linux_3.7</a>, December 2012), TRIM was added to mdadm for
modes 0, 1 and 10! 
</p><p>
Thanks for the pointer. I'm going to try a RAID 1 on my workstation the
first chance I get!

SSDs, II</h4><p>
I did a lot of research on SSDs and found &ldquo;The SSD Endurance
Experiment&rdquo; by Tech
Report, Geoff Gasior. There are several parts to the report with the last
one on
300TB testing on six SSDs. The results are impressive.

Roman   <br><br>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Brian Trapp replies:</b></span> Thanks for the link
Roman! While the 200TB update
came out after I had already written the article, it is a good resource for
data on how the extreme upper end of write loads affect SSD performance and
endurance.

Usability, I</h4><p>
The article &ldquo;It's about the User: Applying Usability in Open-Source
Software&rdquo; by Jim Hall in the December 2013 issue was fantastic! I
work for the US government, and
usability is a significant issue that has plagued many of our software
projects. 
</p><p>
The GNOME Human Interface Guide (HIG) provides on-target
usability responsibilities, and I even used it as the foundation for a
government software HIG several years ago. While the GNOME HIG is great, it
lacks many of the key points made by Jim. Maybe GNOME 3 would have ranked
higher in the 2013 Best Desktop Environment category if the HIG had a
stronger emphasis on user testing. 
</p><p>
Speaking of user testing, I can't figure
out one element of Jim's Gedit test&mdash;that is, how do you change the default
font in Gedit?

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Peter Cook  <br><br>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Jim Hall replies:</b></span> 
Thanks for your comments! Your question about how to change the default font
highlights a usability issue in Gedit. From my usability test, all participants
either were unable to change the default font in Gedit, or they experienced extreme
difficulty in doing so.
</p><p>
I conducted my usability test with Fedora 17 and GNOME 3.4, and in that
version of Gedit, there was a Preferences menu item under the Edit
menu. In the current version of GNOME (3.10), the Preferences menu item
is located under the gedit application menu in the top bar. From the
Font &amp; Colors tab, you can set the default font for Gedit. See Figures
1 and 2 for screenshots using Fedora 20 and GNOME 3.10.

Usability, II</h4><p>
Jim Hall's article on usability testing in the December 2013 issue was excellent! I have done some
of the things he mentions, and one thing in particular is really important:
when you have a user struggling during the testing, don't jump in to
&ldquo;fix&rdquo; it. The problem is not the user; the problem is the program,
particularly when a number of people face the same issues. 
</p><p>
Another example
I found that agreed with my experience is regarding the use of &ldquo;hot
corners&rdquo;.
I have always found that the biggest annoyance, and I cannot imagine it got
in with the help of any usability testing. As an experienced user, I know I
can find the place to turn it off (and I always do), but it exemplifies to
me the problem with software designed by developers for developers. Open
source has a culture that puts the developer at the top of the pyramid,
with users at the bottom, and hot corners is a result. We are at the point
where often the open-source alternative is every bit as functional as the
proprietary software, but cannot get traction because of usability issues.
This is the next frontier for open source if we really want to take over.
And since Microsoft seems to have committed a huge usability blunder with
Windows 8, we have a shot, but only if we can provide an alternative that
is easier for people to use.
 
<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Kevin O'Brien  <br><br>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Jim Hall responds:</b></span>
While GNOME was not a focus of my usability test, almost every participant
experienced problems with the GNOME hot corner. This usually occurred
right away in the first task, when testers first tried to use the
menus. They would often &ldquo;overshoot&rdquo; the menu and activate the hot corner
instead. Although testers were able to recover from this pretty quickly,
it definitely caused unexpected problems during the test.
</p><p>
During the usability tests, I kept a running log of comments made and
actions performed by the participants. When they accidentally activated
the GNOME hot corner, participants were immediately confused, asking
&ldquo;What just happened?&rdquo; or exclaiming &ldquo;Whoa!&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Oops!&rdquo; One user became
so frustrated, he started swearing at the computer whenever he hit the
hot corner.
</p><p>
I'd like to make 2014 the year of usability in open-source software. Even
proprietary software has usability issues (the dramatic change to the
Windows 8 desktop is one obvious example), but I want to focus on open-source software. I'm glad you share this enthusiasm! Please bring this
energy to your favorite open-source software project to help find
and fix usability issues. This will help everyone who uses open-source
software, and together we can make Linux even better!

Automating Passphrases in Encrypted Volumes</h4><p>
Thanks to Shawn Powers for his &ldquo;Encrypting Your Cat Photos&rdquo; article in the
January 2014 issue. I'd like to share a solution to a problem I face while
working with encrypted volumes in the cloud. The problem is how to automate
entering passphrases when accessing encrypted volumes; in my case, access is
done from a script, and users cannot be prompted.
</p><p>
I'm using this command to solve the problem:

<pre     class="programlisting">
cryptsetup --key-file $pass_file luksOpen 
 &#8618;$vol_name my_volume
</pre>
</p><p>
Before calling it, I copy <tt  >$pass_file</tt>, which contains the passphrase.
Then I delete the file.
</p><p>
This is not very secure method. I wonder if there is a better way to do it.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Evgeni Stavinov  <br><br>
</p><p>
That is, unfortunately, an issue with encrypting a filesystem. The only
solution I know for non-interactive decryption is what you are doing,
which is to have a password file. Usually, that's a file stored with
protected permissions somewhere on a system, but of course, you see the
problem, the password is in a file! I'm not sure how you're copying the
password file, but if it were me, I'd temporarily copy the file (with
secure permissions of course) to a ramdisk so the file isn't recoverable
from the hard disk. There's no great answer I'm aware of,
however.&mdash;Shawn Powers
