<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #239, March 2014</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Linus Torvalds</b></span> is planning to put out
<span   class="bold"><b>Linux version 4.0</b></span> in a year or so,
and he mentioned it by way of explaining why he wanted to do it and what he
hoped would happen when he did.
</p><p>
Apparently, his main reason to go from 3.x to 4.x is to avoid the 3.x minor
numbers going up above the teens. He said, &ldquo;I'm ok with 3.&lt;low teens&gt;, but
I don't want us to get to the kinds of crazy numbers we had in the 2.x
series.&rdquo; That's no joke. The 2.1.y series got up to 2.1.132, and there were
complaints.
</p><p>
So, why announce it now, if 4.0 is a year or two away? Linus said he hoped
the 4.0 kernel could be a &ldquo;stabilization&rdquo; release, where everyone
contributed bug-fixes only. By announcing it early, he hoped everyone 
gradually would get used to the idea, and that perhaps there would be at least a
very slim chance of success. He said, &ldquo;I may be pessimistic, but I'd expect
many developers would go 'Let's hunt bugs....Wait. Oooh, shiny' and go off
doing some new feature after all instead. Or just take that release off.
But I do wonder...maybe it would be possible.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Clearly his thinking has come a long way from the old 2.x days, when long
periods of stabilization were official policy&mdash;and the source of much
developer angst.
</p><p>
Even now, most responses were opposed to making 4.0 a
&ldquo;stabilization&rdquo; release. But,
that could have less to do with a general dislike of bug-fixing and more
with the fact that a large culture of stabilization has emerged in the wake
of the 2.6 tree's abandonment of stabilization efforts nearly altogether.
</p><p>
Originally Linus was supposed to hand off the 2.6 tree to <span   class="bold"><b>Andrew Morton</b></span>,
who would maintain it as a stable tree while Linus forked off a 2.7
development series. Instead, Linus stayed in control of 2.6, never forked a
development tree, and just started taking development patches in 2.6
instead. Thus endeth the x.even/x.odd development paradigm for stable and
development kernels.
</p><p>
In place of this, in those long-ago days, Linus said that really the Linux
distribution folks were the natural ones to handle stabilization. They
typically heavily patched the Linux kernel anyway, so they had a process in
place and the motivation to keep their users from hitting bugs.
</p><p>
But that didn't really seem like enough, so Andrew converted his beloved
and popular <span   class="bold"><b>-mm tree</b></span> into what is now
called the <span   class="bold"><b>linux-next</b></span> tree. Before
the switch, the -mm tree was simply the collection of patches Andrew
intended to feed up to Linus. But he was so prolific, and collected so many
patches from other developers, that the -mm tree already had started to
become a natural staging area for many patches that were on their way to
the official tree. And, a lot of people ran the -mm kernel on their home
systems because they liked it better. Renaming it linux-next simply
formalized that identity and gave code a place to live, and more
important, it allowed it to be tested by a large number of users before heading up to
Linus.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Greg Kroah-Hartman</b></span> and some others also started their own stabilization
effort, in which they would fork off each official release and put out a
few more official versions of that release consisting of bug-fixes only.
For example, after Linus put out 2.6.39, Greg and his fellows put out
2.6.39.1 through 2.6.39.4, all with stabilization fixes and security
patches. When Greg started this work, Linus' nickname for it was the
&ldquo;sucker's tree&rdquo; because of the unfathomable amount of work required.
</p><p>
Both Andrew's linux-next and Greg's stable tree persisted into the 3.0 time
frame and continue to be a primary means of stabilizing the official
kernel tree. Any patches going into Greg's stable tree, for example, must
be accepted into Linus' tree first. That may sound odd, but it actually
prevents the same bug from cropping up again and again in new official
releases. Even with the patches going into Linus' tree, Greg's stable
series is still valuable, because it has the fixes, the whole fixes and
nothing but the fixes, which means Greg's tree becomes more and more stable
while Linus' continues to gallivant off in development-land.
</p><p>
Greg also occasionally designates one of his forks as &ldquo;long-term
stable&rdquo;,
which means he intends to put out more than just a few stabilization
releases, but will continue to maintain it for maybe a year or longer. The
choice of which official release will become &ldquo;long-term
stable&rdquo; is a source
of much ongoing speculation, because distributions like to organize their
ongoing work around a particular kernel as early as possible&mdash;in fact,
earlier than Greg typically picks out a new &ldquo;long-term stable&rdquo; candidate. 
</p><p>
But, that is another story. The point is, stabilization efforts have risen
up to fill the gaps left by Linus' decision to abandon stabilization
efforts in the main kernel tree. And as a result, his concept of 4.0 as a
&ldquo;stabilization&rdquo; release doesn't seem to strike anyone as very important.
</p><p>
Actually, Linus didn't completely abandon stabilization as a goal. Each
release cycle includes a final release-candidate process that focuses on
stabilization for a couple weeks before the official release comes out.
</p><p>
But, this brief stabilization window was exactly why certain people didn't
like his 4.0 stabilization idea. <span   class="bold"><b>Olof
Johansson</b></span>, for example, said that
instead of dedicating a whole release to stabilization, why not just extend
the stabilization window of the previous release?
</p><p>
There were other objections. <span   class="bold"><b>Ingo Molnar</b></span> and Greg both felt that the
release before 4.0, &ldquo;would also probably be a super-stressful release to
maintainers, as everyone would try to cram their feature in there&rdquo;. And
Greg remarked, &ldquo;I see it today when people are trying to guess as to what
the next long-term-stable kernel is going to be, and they throw things in
that are half-baked just because they know they can 'fix it up'
later.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Ingo also said that a better way to make the official kernel more stable
would be for maintainers to put more pressure on developers to submit fixes
to known bugs before sending in patches implementing new features.
</p><p>
Ingo pointed out that Linus rarely got patches directly from the developer
who created them, and that these patches typically went through at least a
maintainer and possibly another person above them, before reaching Linus.
So Ingo didn't feel that Linus could have much direct influence over the
stabilization process anyway. He concluded, &ldquo;why not just do what worked so
well for v3.0 and afterward? Keep the existing process in place.&rdquo;
</p><p>
And Greg pointed out that his stabilization forks were actually very
successful. He pointed out that 4,000 bug-fixes went into the 3.0.x stable
releases, which he felt indicated that developers in general already took
stabilization very seriously. He suggested that trying to focus on
stabilization for a single 4.0 kernel release would not be as useful as
evangelizing good practices for submitting code to Greg's stable trees.
</p><p>
The discussion continued for a bit, but for the moment, Linus had nothing to
add. It seems as though he does want to improve the stabilization process
for the official kernel in some way. Maybe he'll do it with a push for
stability in 4.0, and maybe he'll try something else that runs more along
the lines of supporting existing stability efforts.

<h2 class="title">Alice, the Turtle of the Modern Age</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #239, March 2014</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Many of us grew up with LOGO, the kid-friendly programming language that
guided a little turtle around a screen. Yes, it was simplistic. Yes,
it taught only the very basics of programming concepts, but it also
inspired an entire generation of programmers. The applications you run
every day were written by people who steered a digital turtle around a
screen in third grade.
</p><p>
Alice is a project from Carnegie Mellon University that allows new
programmers to use a drag-and-drop interface to create 3-D scenes and
perform programmatic results without typing any code. The Alice Project
has evolved through the years, and it's currently on version 3. The code is
freely downloadable and is available for Linux, Mac and Windows.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11641alicef1.large.jpg"><img src="11641alicef1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
(Image from <a href="http://www.alice.org" target="_self">www.alice.org</a>)
</p></div></div><p>
Although the LOGO programming language allowed for some lengthy instructions for
the turtle, it was limited. Alice, on the other hand, uses the animation
environment to teach amazingly complex programming concepts. By utilizing
an environment where syntax is dragged as opposed to typed, it takes
&ldquo;typos&rdquo; out of the equation. It's hard to describe just how complex the
programming can be with Alice, so I urge you to download it or at least
visit the Alice Project at <a href="http://www.alice.org" target="_self">www.alice.org</a>.
</p><p>
For doing its part in producing the next generation of programmers,
while (at least in my mind) continuing the legacy of a small digital
turtle from my youth, Alice gets this month's Editors' Choice Award.

<h2 class="title">Android Candy: Humans, Run!</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #239, March 2014</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Whether you're a fan of the shambling brain-munchers or you prefer
your undead to sprint from victim to victim, zombies are amazingly
popular. In an ironic twist, the most unhealthy members of humanity,
or former members, can help you become the healthiest!
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11641androidf1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
&ldquo;Zombies, Run!&rdquo; is an application for your Android phone that uses
GPS and your music collection to help motivate you to exercise. A slim
waist and a great beach body might be enough to get you running, but how
about the sounds of an approaching zombie horde? It's a twisted motivator,
but it really works!
</p><p>
The application isn't free, but at $7.99 (or less if you find it on
sale), it costs about as much as an extra-large frozen mocha latte. Both
investments will affect your health, but in this case, the zombies are
far better for you. Check it out at <a href="https://www.zombiesrungame.com" target="_self">https://www.zombiesrungame.com</a>.

<h2 class="title">Non-Linux FOSS: Wampserver</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #239, March 2014</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
I'll be honest, the first thing that drew me to Wampserver was the
name. Although it's just a continuation of the LAMP acronym for Linux,
Apache,
MySQL and PHP, there's something about that name that makes me smile. Anyway,
Wampserver is an application for Windows that provides Apache, PHP
and MySQL in a single manageable package. 

</p><p>
Wampserver includes a single installer for all the components and an
interface for controlling them (Figure 1). Although it certainly
makes sense to use Linux for hosting an Apache-based Web server, if you're
in a situation that requires you use Windows, Wampserver is a perfect
way to install what is normally a fairly complex set of applications.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11641fossf1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Wampserver Interface
</p></div></div><p>
Wampserver installs all open-source software on your Windows machine, and
is itself open-source software as well. It's available from SourceForge
or directly from the Wampserver Web site: <a href="http://www.wampserver.com" target="_self">www.wampserver.com</a>.

Kyle Rankin demonstrated the advantage of splitting terminal windows in
previous issues. If
you'd like a simple, graphical way to split your terminal window, look
no further than Terminator (<a href="http://gnometerminator.blogspot.com" target="_self">gnometerminator.blogspot.com</a>). Split screens and keybindings can be saved
for quick setups, and it's simple to create a grid of terminal windows
or a combination of large and small screens.

If you've ever opened multiple terminal windows and tried to arrange
them so you could see them all, Terminator will make your life a lot
easier. Even if you've never tried a split-window setup, the ease and
simplicity Terminator offers might make you a believer. It did for me!

<h2 class="title">Spelunking with Linux</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Joey Bernard</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #239, March 2014</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Mapping is ordinarily a complex task&mdash;just consider all the available software
to help maintain and generate maps. And, that's only for mapping in two
dimensions. Maintaining and generating maps of caves bumps this
complexity up a notch. Caves exist in all three dimensions. So any mapping
software needs to keep track of volumes rather than areas. There are not
very many options that can handle this task. Luckily, one
available package can do this job very well: Therion
(<a href="http://therion.speleo.sk/index.php" target="_self">therion.speleo.sk/index.php</a>). Therion is an
open-source program, released under the GPL and available for Windows,
Mac OS X and Linux. 
</p><p>
Most distributions should have a package available,
or you always can download the source and build it from scratch. In
Debian-based distributions, you can grab it with the command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo apt-get install therion
</pre>
</p><p>
Once it is installed, you can find it in your desktop environment's
menu system, or run <tt  >xtherion</tt> from a terminal window.
</p><p>
When you first start up Therion, you essentially get a blank canvas.
You can open an existing file or create a new one
to begin working. Let's start by creating a new project. You
can click the File&rarr;New menu entry or press Alt-N. Therion
then asks you to enter a name for your new project. This name should
end with .th. 
</p><p>
You end up with two black panes as the main part of the
interface. On the far right, there are a number of sub-panes, with the
settings pane opened. Here you can set the working directory for your
current project and the related configuration file. You also can set
command-line options, and there is a compile button, which I'll discuss
shortly. 
</p><p>
The main interface is actually composed of three separate
windows. You start in the first one, the &ldquo;Text Editor&rdquo;. There is also a
&ldquo;Map Editor&rdquo; window and a &ldquo;Compiler&rdquo; window. They are accessible two
ways. The first is by using the menu. The window entries are located
under the main menu entry Window. There also are keyboard shortcuts
for each of them. You can bring up the text editor with F1, the map editor
with F2 and the compiler with F3.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11641therionf1.large.jpg"><img src="11641therionf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. The main window that comes up when you first start Therion.
</p></div></div><p>
Let's start with the text editor. The first step is to define the survey
for this project. Since this is just a quick tutorial, let's just use
the name &ldquo;example1&rdquo;. In the text editor window (press F1 to
bring it up),
enter the following text:

<pre     class="programlisting">
survey example1
endsurvey
</pre>
</p><p>
Between these two lines is where you need to enter your survey data. You
could enter this data manually, but usually, it would have been collected
using some other system. One example of this is using PocketTopo to go
and collect the survey data directly in the field. 
</p><p>
If you don't have
any data available, you can get some on-line. There is a very
good tutorial at the Cave Surveying Group
(<a href="http://cp.cavesurveying.org.uk/index.php/articles/3-therion-tutorial" target="_self">cp.cavesurveying.org.uk/index.php/articles/3-therion-tutorial</a>).
It also
includes some example data you can use while you are learning to
use Therion. Let's use the example file bpwth.txt. 
</p><p>
In the text editor
window, add an extra blank line between the two lines you already entered,
and place the cursor on this new blank line. Now you can click on the
menu entry File&rarr;Import and select the file bpwth.txt. This will
import the data you are going to plot. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11641therionf2.large.jpg"><img src="11641therionf2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. The survey data is simply a list of data points.
</p></div></div><p>
Once you have
all of your data imported, you need to save it to a file. Because
the project's name is example1, name the text file
example1.th. 
</p><p>
The next step is to run the compile stage to process all of
this data. Press F3 to switch to the compile window. You
need to give the compiler some options so that it knows what to do, so 
open a new configuration file by either clicking the menu
item File&rarr;New or pressing Alt-N. The default filename that comes
up is thconfig. To keep things clean, name the file thconfig.thc, and
save it in the same location as the text file you created earlier. Click
in the top pane to set the focus there, and enter the following text:


<pre     class="programlisting">
source example1.th export model -fmt survex -o example1.3d
</pre>
</p><p>
The first line tells Therion where the data is to compile. The second
line tells Therion what file format to use to save the compiled
model. In this particular case, the model is being saved in Survex
3D format. 
Therion supports several different file formats.
</p><p>
With this information in the system, you now can go ahead and
compile your model. You can press F9 or click the menu entry
File&rarr;Compile. Therion will process your model and write out
details in a log, which is displayed in the lower pane.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11641therionf3.large.jpg"><img src="11641therionf3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. The log of results from the compile shows up in the lower pane of
the main window.
</p></div></div><p>
So, what does this look like? Luckily, Therion includes a viewer called
Loch that
can handle Survex 3D files. You should have an entry for it
in the menu system for your desktop environment. You also can start it up
from a terminal window with the command <tt  >loch</tt>.
It uses
OpenGL to draw the three-dimensional model of your cave data. There is
also another program called Aven that you can use to visualize the
cave data. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11641therionf4.large.jpg"><img src="11641therionf4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Loch is one of the viewers for 3-D files available from Therion.
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11641therionf5.large.jpg"><img src="11641therionf5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. You also can use Aven to view 3-D files generated from Therion.
</p></div></div><p>
The last window to look at here is the map editor. For this example, let's
switch to the map editor by pressing F2. Add a new file by clicking the
menu item File&rarr;New and save it with the filename example1.th2. The
file ending .th2 is the default for mapping files in Therion. 
</p><p>
You
can add images from several different file formats to your map, but in
this case, let's add data from the PocketTopo export
data. Click the menu entry Edit&rarr;Insert Image, and
change the file type to &ldquo;PocketTopo therion export&rdquo;. Select the same
sample data file as before, bpwth.txt. You will end up with a very
nice layout of the cave that was surveyed with PocketTopo.
You then can edit this map, adding points, lines and areas.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11641therionf6.large.jpg"><img src="11641therionf6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. You can import map data from PocketTopo into Therion.
</p></div></div><p>
Hopefully, you now will be able to plan safe and rewarding trips into your
local caves with Therion. With more and more publicly accessible
caves using Therion, you will have a growing set of information available
before you ever leave home. Don't forget to check out the other
tutorials available on-line to learn all of the other great things you
can do with Therion.
