because they represented the best physical distribution, I am also
honored and delighted in seeing the Part-Time BBS in the first
column! Thank you!</p><p>The column also prompted me to update the files on the
system&mdash;I figured if you were so kind with your words, I had better
at least respond with some kind of positive action. So the
Slackware 2.1.0 distribution is now on-line and available for
download.</p><p>In spite of the name, Part-Time BBS is available 24
hours-a-day, 7 days-a-week, and since I've become interested in
Linux, it has been extended to be a repository for Slackware. I am
also (if I can ever find the time) exploring ways to actually
convert what is already on the BBS (there's a lot more than just
Linux) to a BBS running under Linux.</p><p>Thanks again!</p><p>&mdash;Tim Gales,

1994, Issue 8] was very unfair. He clearly does not like either TeX
or emacs and so it is not surprising that most of his comments are
negative. He seemed not to be sure for whom the book is intended.
Well, I can tell you that; it is intended for people like me. I
have The TeXbook and I have done quite a bit of document writing (I
have even set tables with \halign, wow!) but I have gotten to the
stage where I need more information about the tools that surround
TeX and how they fit together. This book is just what I
need.</p><p>Vince was &ldquo;hoping they'd pick an editor (even [ugh...] emacs)
and give some real details regarding how to hook in and use [it] to
efficiently write TeX documents&rdquo; but the book explains about the
tex and AUC-TEX modes in emacs and how to implement the
edit-run-edit cycle within emacs. What more does he want? The font
chapter contains &ldquo;more than any sane person would want to know
about font selection and generation&rdquo;. Vince may not be interested
in fonts but lots of people are. I have recently gotten involved
with dvi drivers and I am very much interested in font selection
and generation.</p><p>He ends by recommending to your readers that they save their
pennies, learn SGML and get the rest of what they want off the net.
I suppose you can get everything off the net if you spend long
enough searching but, like most of your readers, I don't have time
to waste and I am happy to spend $30 for Norman Walsh to put the
hours in on my behalf and collect the results into a book. Why else
would your reviewer have 19 O'Reilly books on his shelf? This was a
shabby review and you chose the wrong person to do it.</p><p>Yours, etc.</p><p>&mdash;Tony Sumner,
