    This month Mark shows us the safe and painless way to set up
    anonymous ftp on your system.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c58580.0x1d503f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>The standard
<span   class="bold"><b>ftp</b></span> daemon that comes with recent
Slackware distributions, and which is used by many&mdash;perhaps
most&mdash;anonymous ftp sites, is the wu.ftpd which comes from
Washington University at Saint Louis. It offers many useful
features, including:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Extensible support for get filename.gz when only
filename exists, and for get filename when only filename.gz exists
(auto-gzip and auto-gunzip), and similar functionality for .Z
(compress).</p></li><li><p>Extensible support for get dir.tar
(auto-tar)</p></li><li><p>Extensive logging</p></li><li><p>Ability to limit the number of connected users
based on location</p></li><li><p>Ability to easily change configuration</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c58580.0x1d50920"></a>Getting and Compiling</h2></div></div><p>You can get the most recent copy of wu.ftpd at
sunsite.unc.edu as /pub/Linux/system/Network
file-transfer/wu-ftpd-2.4.linux.tar.gz. Be sure not to get the
wu-ftpd-2.4.patch.gz file that exists there&mdash;the file
wu-ftpd-2.4.linux.tar.gz is already patched, and applying
wu-ftpd-2.4.patch.gz removes the patches.</p><p>Once you uncompress and untar the file, you'll have a
wu-ftpd-2.4.linux directory containing all the source files. The
configuration for wu.ftpd is slightly different than most packages
you may install for Linux. For example, you don't use make. You
execute the build script with the lnx option:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
trippy:~/wu-ftpd-2.4.linux&gt; build lnx
</pre><p>Before you do that, you may want to change the configuration
files. The config.h configuration file usually does not need to be
changed. The more important configuration src/pathnames.h file
tells the daemon where various files, including the bianary, are
located. The INSTALL file in the source root directory explains
each of the entries in the configuration files.</p><p>During the build, you may notice a number of warnings from
GCC. Many of them relate to SIGBUS being redefined. The second
warning will tell you where it was previously declared. This is
okay. It just means GCC noticed that two header files defined the
same thing, in this case SIGBUS.</p><p>After the build is complete, you may wish to back up and
remove the old ftpd program. Using /sbin/pkgtool, which comes with
most Slackware releases, is an easy way to do this. You will want
to view tcpip. Write down the locations of files that have ftp or
in.ftp in them. After this, you can back up and remove the existing
files. This way, you can be sure you have a clean
installation.</p><p>When you are ready to install, use
<span   class="bold"><b>su</b></span> to assume root status, then
type <b  >build install</b>, which will copy the binaries
to the correct locations. By default, the daemon itself goes in
/usr/local/etc/, support files go in /usr/local/bin/, and man pages
go in /usr/local/man/.</p><p>Last, create the ftp user, by either manually editing
/etc/passwd as root (be careful!) or by using the useradd command.
Optimally, ftp should have &ldquo;*&rdquo; as an encrypted password, be in its
own group (you probably want to create an ftp group for this, if
there isn't one already); and have /bin/true as a login shell.
Having /bin/true as a shell means that even if someone is able to
break into the account, they will be automatically logged out, as
/bin/true immediately exits (you can also use /bin/false). When
you're done editing the ftp user in /etc/passwd, it should look
something like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ftp:*:401:50::/home/ftp:/bin/true
</pre><p>The two numbers may be different, and the /home/ftp may be
different if your users have another path to access their home
directories (like /user/ftp), but you get the general idea.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c58580.0x1d50df0"></a>Configuring</h2></div></div><p>Now on to the fun part&mdash;setting up the configuration files.
This may appear at first to be a large task, but once a
configuration is set up, it requires very little maintenance&mdash;if it
is set up correctly the first time. The obvious advantage to having
many configuration files is that you don't have to re-compile
wu.ftpd to add or modify features.</p><p>Before we go into the configuration files, I have to explain
how anonymous ftp works from an administration point of view. In
order to preserve the security of legitimate users of the system,
ftpd changes its root directory so that it can only see a small
part of the filesystem. That is, when you type cd / during an
anonymous ftp connection, you don't really go to the real root
directory, the one that normal users see. A chroot(2) function call
changes the root of ftpd to the home directory for user ftp in
/etc/passwd. In my case, the root for an anonymous user becomes
/home/ftp relative to me, a legitimate user of the system. From
here on, I'll call the root for an anonymous user &ldquo;ftp&rdquo; root or
&ldquo;~ftp/&rdquo; and the `/' or `root directory' will be the root directory
you know and love.</p><p>First, we have to set up files in our root directory. The
~/wu-ftpd-2.4.linux/doc/examples directory contains a number of
sample files that will work for most situations. These files
include ftpusers, ftpaccess, and ftpconversions. They should be
installed in the /etc directory after modifying it for your local
setup.</p><p>The ftpusers file contains a list of users who are not
allowed to connect via ftp. This increases the security by not
allowing users such as &ldquo;root&rdquo; to connect and possibly overwrite a
file like /etc/passwd. Users are listed one per line.</p><p>The ftpaccess file is the primary ftpd configuration file. It
sets up certain definitions of users, configures the major sections
of security, and a previous number of other functions. The
ftpaccess file in the examples directory should be fine for most
people, but if you expect large numbers of people connecting for
anonymous ftp use, you can use the ftpaccess.heavy file. Here are a
few things you will want to look at in whichever ftpaccess files
you use:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><b  >loginfails int</b>&mdash;This sets the
number of unsuccessful log in attempts allowed before ftpd
disconnects.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
class class typelist addrglob
</pre><p><b  >[addrglob...]</b>&mdash;This sets up a
<span   class="emphasis"><em>class</em></span> of users. <span   class="emphasis"><em>typelist</em></span>
can be <b  >real</b> for real users of the system,
<b  >anonymous</b> for anonymous users of the system, and
<b  >guest</b> for guest accounts (which aren't quite
like anonymous). <span   class="emphasis"><em>addrglob</em></span> lists where someone
is coming from, either in IP (or dot&mdash;198.30.149.*) notation, or
name notation (*.satelnet.org). This allows you to set up a group
as <b  >local</b> users (anonymous users who are on your
same subnet for example) and a group for <b  >remote</b>
users who might be outside the local subnet. A setup could look
like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
class local real,guest,anonymous 198.30.149.*
class remote real,guest,anonymous *
</pre><p><b  >limit class n time msg file</b>&mdash;This sets up
limits on class of users, limiting access to n users during time.
If they can't get in, display the text in the file ~ftp/msg file.
Time is defined as in UUCP's L.sys file, but for those of you who
can't find that file, the times are rather easy. Sunday is
represented as `Su', Monday as `Mo' and so on. These can be
followed by times in 24-hour format. So, to limit the number of
remote users to 5 except for weekends and at night (when the limit
goes to 10):</p><pre     class="programlisting">
limit remote 10 SaSu|Any1800-0600 /etc/msgs/msg.toomany
limit remote 5 Any /etc/msgs/msg.toomany
</pre><p>The default ftpaccess.heavy file seems to have this
backwards. Also, if a limit is not valid (i.e. you put fubar as a
limit) or it is -1, this is taken to be unlimited users.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="circle"><li><p><b  >passwd-check none|trivial|rfc822
warn|enforce</b>&mdash;This sets up how the ftpd should respond
when given a password for an anonymous login. There are three
methods that you can have for allowing passwords:</p></li><li><p>none&mdash;We don't care what the password is (you can
log in as guest)</p></li><li><p>trivial&mdash;Has a @ in the name (you can log in as
komarimf@)</p></li><li><p>rfc822&mdash;Must be an RFC822 complaint address (full
username and host)</p></li></ul></div><p>If you have set trivial or rfc822 and the user does not
comply with the requested password format, you can do two
things:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="circle"><li><p>warn&mdash;tells the user that an invalid password was
      entered, gives a suggested password, but lets the user log in
      anyway</p></li><li><p>enforce&mdash;tells the user the password is invalid,
      gives a suggested password, then logs the user out.</p></li></ul></div></li><li><p><b  >readme file when</b>&mdash;tells the user
to be sure to read the ~ftp/&lt;file&gt; during
<span   class="emphasis"><em>when</em></span>. <span   class="emphasis"><em>when</em></span> can be on
login or on certain directories. For example, the entries:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
readme README* login
readme README* cwd=*
</pre><p>will notify you of all the README files (README*) upon login,
and any time you change directory. Note that you may want to change
this to just README if you have a large number of README files in a
directory.</p></li><li><p><b  >message file when</b>&mdash;This is
almost the same as the readme entries above, only the ~ftp/file is
output to the user's screen during when.</p></li><li><p><b  >shutdown file</b>&mdash;If file exists,
ftpd will not allow any logins. This gives you a good way of
shutting down ftp without having to edit /etc/inetd.conf and
restarting inetd, then doing the reverse to get it all working
again. In fact, all you need do is type (in this case):</p><pre     class="programlisting">
touch /etc/shutdownftp
</pre><p>and no more logins will be allowed. Notice that connected
users are not disconnected automatically via this method. You bump
connected users off the system, and I'll get to that in a
bit.</p></li></ul></div><p>Finally, there is the ftpconversions file. One of the
features of wuftpd is that it allows you to download files in a
format different from the on the remote side. That is, you can
automatically compress a text file as it gets sent to you, making
the transfer go quicker. Or you can get an entire directory bundled
up in one .tar file, ready to put on a floppy disk. There are few
modifications you should make to this, as the .tar and .gz (for
gzip) already exist to allow you to tar, compress, untar, and
uncompress a file on the fly. This should go in
/etc/ftpconversions. Other files are placed under ~ftp/. For
example, you have to install the gzip and tar binaries, plus the
shared libraries necessary to run the commands. Change directory to
~ftp/bin (use mkdir to create it first, if it does not exist) and
execute the following:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cp /bin/ls .
cp /bin/gzip .
chmod 0111 *
</pre><p>This will copy the binaries, then make them both execute
only.</p><p>Next you'll need the libraries. Go into the ~ftp/lib
directory (or make it and do the following:)</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cp /lib/libc.so.4 .
</pre><p>Yes, you can make a hard link, and you can also use
statically linked executables. If you feel confident in your
abilities to do either, you can do it.</p><p>You could also have a copy of /etc/passwd. Without it, when
regular users of the system make files available to anonymous ftp
users, user and group names (only the literal UID and GID as they
are stored in the filesystem) will show up. So to resolve numbers
to names, you'll need copies of both /etc/passwd and /etc/group in
~ftp/etc/. However, you don't need encrypted passwords or other
information in the passwd file, only the UID, GID, and username. So
you can replace all the passwords in the copied passwd file (be
sure you're editing the correct file!!) with stars (*), then erase
all the fields after the GID, leaving you with entries like:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
mark:*:401:100:::::
</pre><p>The downside of this (for the extremely security conscious)
is that a remote user could now know login names for legitimate
users. Then again, you can change the names of the valid users of
the system to something else. What could be better than letting a
cracker spend all day (without success and increasing his chances
of getting caught) trying to crack an account named &ldquo;bob&rdquo; on your
machine who he saw as the owner of a file on anonymous ftp?</p><p>To be sure that the files are set up correctly, run the
~\wu-ftpd-2.4.linux/bin/ckconfig program. It will verify the
locations of various files needed to run.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c58580.0x214a7a0"></a>Security and Final Setup</h2></div></div><p>Speaking of security&mdash;now is the time to make sure that files
are as they should be. You don't want anyone getting free access to
your system, do you? Here's how the directories in ~ftp/ should be
laid out:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Execute only (mode 0111 in chmod): ~ftp/bin and
~ftp/etc</p></li><li><p>Read and execute (mode 0555 in chmod): ~ftp/pub,
~ftp/usr, and ~ftp/var (if you want it&mdash;or it can be a link to
~ftp/usr)</p></li><li><p>Write and execute (optionally read too&mdash;0333 or
0777 in chmod): /incoming</p></li></ul></div><p>Incoming is a special directory where users are allowed to
place incoming files. From here, the files are then moved by the
ftp administrator to another location. Many sites have their
incoming directories set up so that any file that is uploaded can
immediately be downloaded by another anonymous user. But, an
unscrupulous user can upload an illegal program for immediate
download by anyone else. In the time it takes the ftp administrator
to discover the file and erase it, hundreds of people could have
downloaded it. By denying read access to the directory, users can
put files there, but not see them. Instead you get a message about
&ldquo;permission denied&rdquo;.</p><p>The execute-only directory is also special in that while
anonymous users can run the programs in that directory (tar and ls
usually), they can't get a directory of what is there, nor can they
put anything in the directory. This is good because it prevents an
anonymous user from finding out what kinds of programs are
available, and also allows extra security on the ~ftp/etc/passwd
and ~ftp/etc/group files.</p><p>Now your ftp site should be ready for allowing incoming
users. If you had to install wu.ftpd, make your changes to
/etc/inetd.conf by adding the following line:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ftp stream tcp nowait root /usr/sbin/tcpd /usr/local/bin/ftpd
</pre><p>This assumes that you want the tcpd(8) wrapper and that the
ftpd binary is located in /usr/local/bin. An ftp line may already
be in the file, so you may have to only edit it. Restart inetd with
a <b  >killall -HUP inetd</b>, and sit back and
relax.</p><p>If you are interested in watching how popular your ftp site
is, a few programs can help. The ftpcount tells you how many users
of each class are connected to your machine, and what the maximum
is. ftpwho gives you slightly better information about who is
logged in, and ftpshut is used to bump connected users off at a
specific time. The xferstats program in the util directory can give
you detailed reports of when most people connect, what gets
downloaded, and other information that may help you fine-tune your
configuration.</p><p>wu.ftpd has many more abilities than I have described here,
such as the ability to create &ldquo;private&rdquo; directories and groups to
allow only certain anonymous ftp users access to directories. There
are also provisions for logging access information via syslogd(8)
and file transfer information to /var/adm/ftpd/xferlog. There's a
man page for xferlog(5) too. Both of these methods of logging are
set up by default.</p><p>If you have any questions about setting up ftp on your linux
