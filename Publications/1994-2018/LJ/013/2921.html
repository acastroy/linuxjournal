    The First Annual &ldquo;Excellence in Programming&rdquo; Awards Presented by

conjuction with its 20th year of publication, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Dr. Dobb's Journal</em></span>
magazine honored outstanding achievement in the field of computer
programming by hosting the first annual &ldquo;Excellence in Programming&rdquo;
awards at the Software Development `95 conference. Awards were
presented to Alexander Stepanov, for his development of the C++
Standard Template Library (STL) and Linus Torvalds, creator of the
Linux operating system. Richard Guggenheim, honorary council of
Finland, was present to accept the award for Torvalds.
</p><p>In his presentation, Phil Hughes, president of Specialized
Systems Consultants and publisher of <i  >Linux Journal</i>, discussed why
Linus should receive this award for the most innovative software
product of 1994. &ldquo;Lots of software was designed in 1995. I see the
key here as being innovative. Innovation can consist of development
of a new type of product. For example, Multiplan, the first
spreadsheet was innovative,&rdquo; Hughes said.</p><p>He continued, &ldquo;Linux is innovative in a very different way.
While Linux is another Unix-like system, its development has been
done in a totally unique fashion. Linus started the development
effort but managed to continue his work in such an open manner that
it made possible and even encouraged others to get involved in the
effort.</p><p>Thousands of individuals have contributed to the effort to
make Linux what it is today but Linus gets credit for the
innovation. After all, he did manage to get these thousands of
people to work on the development of Linux and the serious
innovation is that he managed to get them to do all the work for
free.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The recipients were chosen based on their contribution to an
area of software development that has significant impact on
programmers,&rdquo; said Jonathan Erickson, Editor-in-Chief for
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Dr. Dobb's Journal</em></span>.
&ldquo;The editorial committee was formed last year to
look at and promote significant innovations in software
development,&rdquo; explained Erickson.</p><p>Mr. Torvalds almost single-handedly implemented true
innovation in operation-system kernel design while achieving 100
percent UNIX System V compatibility&mdash;something even
commercially-available systems have not accomplished. Torvalds is a
student at the University of Helsinki in Finland.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2921f1.jpg"></div><p>Richard Guggenheim accepts the award for Linus Torvalds from
