    Want to set up your own mailing list? Piers Cawley takes you
    step by step through the process of creating a proper
    mailing list with Majordomo.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dc1580.0x1eb94a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>Majordomo is a nifty piece of perl that
maintains mailing lists. The clever bit is that, once the system
administrator at a site has completed the basic setup, the owner of
the list, who doesn't actually have to have an account on the
computer running Majordomo, can handle day-to-day maintenance via
e-mail messages.
</p><p>Majodomo was originally written by Brent Chapman after he got
frustrated trying to compile and set up ListProc. The latest
versions of Majordomo are maintained by John Rouillard.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dc1580.0x1eb9608"></a>Why Majordomo?</h2></div></div><p>Majordomo and its associated programs were designed with the
Unix guiding principle in mind; that of using suites of small,
easily understood tools to do surprisingly complex tasks; and it
does those tasks remarkably well. It also makes for an easily
extensible system. There are some problems, but&mdash;and this brings us
to the second big advantage of using Majordomo&mdash;you can fix them
yourself.</p><p>Majordomo is free. This means that you get all the source
code and you can modify it to your heart's content. Not only that,
but that source is remarkably well commented and easy to
understand, especially considering how easy it is to write
obfuscated perl code.</p><p>Of course, there are things about Majordomo that things like
LISTSERV and ListProc do better&mdash;it doesn't handle large, busy
mailing lists as efficiently as they do. It is, however, easier to
administer (once you've got the aliases set up) than either of
these, you don't have to pay for it, and it works with
Linux.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dc1580.0x1eb97c0"></a>Fetching the Source</h2></div></div><p>First make sure you have the most up-to-date copy you can lay
your hands on. This discussion will cover Majordomo 1.93, but who
knows: 2.0 might be out by the time you read this. Whatever you do,
don't use 1.92, since it had a rather nasty security hole.
Majordomo's home site is
ftp://ftp.greatcircle.com/pub/majordomo/.</p><p>You'll also need perl, at least version 4.035, preferably
4.036. Majordomo does run under perl 5.000 but it was developed
(and is being developed) under perl 4.036. The site here is running
sendmail 8.6.91, but things should work okay with smail, although I
haven't tried it. See <a href="1067s1.html" target="_self">footnote
1</a>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dc1580.0x1eb9978"></a>Compiling/Installing Majordomo</h2></div></div><p>Compiling Majordomo is easy. Just a couple of caveats:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Majordomo expects perl to be in
/usr/local/bin/perl</p></li><li><p>As it comes out of the box there is a bug which
causes Majordomo to read in the config file twice, once from
/etc/majordomo.cf and once from $homedir/majordomo.cf. This is
easily fixed though; simply remove the line: <b  >require
`majordomo.cf';</b> from config_parse.pl.</p></li></ol></div><p>For what follows, I'll assume you have set up a
/etc/majordomo.cf which looks like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$whereami="yourhost.yourdomain";
$whoami="Majordomo@$whereami";
$whoami_owner="Owner-Majordomo@$whereami";
$homedir="/usr/lib/majordomo";
$listdir="/var/spool/majordomo/lists";
$digest_work_dir="/var/spool/majordomo/digest";
$log="$homedir/Log";
$mailer="/usr/lib/sendmail -f$sender";
$filedir="/var/spool/majordomo/archive";
$filedir_suffix="";
$index_command="/bin/ls -lRL";
$return_subject=1;
$majordomo_request=0;
umask(007);
@archive_dirs=();
</pre><p>and that the directories /var/spool/majordomo/lists,
/var/spool/majordomo/digest and /var/spool/majordomo/archive exist
and are owned by majordomo.majordomo with mode 775.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dc1580.0x1eb9d98"></a>Configuring Basic Aliases</h2></div></div><p>For this I'll assume you're using sendmail 8.6.9 (purely
because that's the mailer that we use here at Frontier). If you're
not using a version 8 sendmail you will need to add majordom to the
list of &ldquo;trusted&rdquo; users that sendmail allows to spoof the sender of
a mail envelope (find the T line in sendmail.cf and add majordom to
the list).</p><p>As root, add the following lines to your /etc/aliases
file:</p><pre     class="programlisting">

majordomo: "|/usr/lib/majordomo/wrapper majordomo"
owner-majordomo: postmaster
</pre><p>Now assume you want to set up a list &ldquo;test&rdquo; with all the
bells, whistles, and gongs that Majordomo provides. You'll need to
add the lines shown in <a href="1067l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a>
to your /etc/aliases file.</p><p>Run newaliases to make the aliases visible.</p><p>Now, su to majordomo and run the commands in
<a href="1067l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2</a>.</p><p>Edit /var/spool/majordomo/lists/test.config, set a new list
password, and add a moderator if necessary. Hopefully it's all
pretty self-explanatory. Copy test.config to test-digest.config and
edit things like <b  >message_footer</b> and
<b  >message_fronter</b>.</p><p>For example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
message_fronter &lt;&lt; END
  In test today:
_SUBJECTS_
END
message_footer &lt;&lt; END
--
To switch to the undigested list,
send this to majordomo@host.domain
unsubscribe test-digest
subscribe test
end
END
</pre><p>Watch out for the config sections advertise and noadvertise.
These expect a list of perl regular expressions, complete with /'s.
These are used when someone queries your Majordomo server for a
list of lists. So, say you had a list &ldquo;local-jellygarglers&rdquo; which
you didn't want anybody off your site to know about (and who
would), you could put the following in your
local-jellygarglers.config file:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
advertise &lt;&lt; END /<span   class="emphasis"><em>yourdomain</em></span>$/
EOF
</pre><p>which means that Majordomo will only mention the list in its
list of lists if the sender's address is in the domain
yourdomain.</p><p>The default digesting provided by Majordomo is not bad for
busy lists. It waits until the digest size reaches a certain
specified size (use the maxlength setting in test-digest.config to
set this) then sends the digest. However, this is not a good
solution if you're looking at a list which has periods of
infrequent posting&mdash;especially if the majority of the lists
subscribers go for the digestified version, there is the potential
for a message to hang around unread in the digest queue for weeks.
There are two solutions to this. The first method is to copy
contrib/digest.send into /usr/lib/majordomo, editting the value of
DIGESTDIR to correspond with the directory where you stash your
digests, then add the line</p><pre     class="programlisting">
0 2 * * * /usr/lib/majordomo/digest.send
</pre><p>to Majordomo's crontab file. The digest will be sent every
morning at 2, no problems.</p><p>The second (and to my mind neater) method is to apply Paul
Close's patch to digest and use a slightly different crontab line.
The patch to digest does a couple of things. It adds the variables
<b  >digest_maxlines</b> and
<b  >digest_maxdays</b> to the list.config files. (If you
do this after you've created a config file you'll need to mail the
commands <b  >writeconfig</b> test and
<b  >writeconfig</b> test-digest to majordomo so it can
write out a new, valid config file again, so this is really best
done before you make the config files.) These two parameters mean
you can tune the digester so that a digest should never get sent
with any messages older than (say) a week in it.</p><p>The patch also adds a <b  >-p</b> switch to digest.
When digest is invoked with this switch it checks to see if the
digest should be sent (i.e., it checks to see if any articles in
the digest are too old), and sends it out if necessary. To use
this, simply change the <b  >-m</b> to
<b  >-p</b> in the line that invokes the digest program
from digest.send.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dc1580.0x1eba840"></a>Setting Up Archiving</h2></div></div><p>I'm assuming for this that you're going to be using rouilj's
archive2.pl for your archiving work. This can be found in
contrib/archive2.pl in the Majordomo source directory and it should
also be linked to archive in the Majordomo home directory.</p><p>The only thing you need to do to get archive2 to work for the
test mailing list is change the</p><pre     class="programlisting">
@archive_dirs lines in /etc/majordomo.cf to
@archive_dirs=("/var/spool/majordomo/archive/test");
</pre><p>and, as they say, voil&aacute;!</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dc1580.0x1ebaa50"></a>Setting Up Files For Remote Retrieval</h2></div></div><p>Since you've set up the rules for finding a given list's
archive, Majordomo itself knows that a list's files are stashed in
that directory (in our case /var/spool/majordomo/archive/test), and
anything in there can be retrieved by members of that mailing list
(or others depending on how you've configured the list) using the
get command in mail messages to Majordomo.</p><p>Majordomo neither knows nor cares about the contents of this
directory. It simply returns a list of files when asked for an
index, or returns the file when asked for that. These files don't
actually have to be mail archives, so you can put anything there
that may be of interest to the list's users. For example, we have a
client who is running a play-by-mail game and he puts the files
that are freely available to all the game's players within the
archive directory so that his players can retrieve them using
mail.</p><p>However, there is a caveat associated with Majordomo's file
handling. Since Majordomo doesn't know about the contents of a
file, it doesn't know if that file is a binary file. (This is a
conscious design decision&mdash;if you need to do heavy duty file work
Majordomo can interface with ftpmail, but that's another story.)
Thus, if you want to make binary files available you will need to
uuencode and split them up by hand first.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dc1580.0x1ebac08"></a>Almost There...</h2></div></div><p>The list is now virtually ready to hand over to the list
administrator to operate via mail. The only thing left to do is to
create a temporary info file (/var/spool/lists/test.info) for the
mailing list&mdash;this should be a short file which gives a description
of the list, what it's about, who's in charge, policy, that sort of
thing. If you don't know all this, just put a dummy info file in
place and let the list administrator worry about setting it
correctly.</p><p>Now you are ready to set up the list's first subscriber. This
is usually the list's owner (the chap that test-approval and
owner-list point at), in this case pdcawley@ftech.co.uk. Send the
following mail message to Majordomo:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
To: majordomo
Subject: This bit is irrelevant
approve foo subscribe test pdcawley@ftech.co.uk
end
</pre><p>where <span   class="emphasis"><em>foo</em></span> is the list password and
pdcawley@ftech.co.uk is the owner of the list.</p><p>You should also send this user a copy of the file
Doc/list-owner-info from the Majordomo source directory, which you
have editted to take account of the list details (these are all set
at the top of the file) so that she/he will be able to administer
the list remotely without having to ask you too many
questions.</p><p>Of course, if you are both the system administrator and the
mailing list administrator you'll need to read this file
yourself.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dc1580.0x22b3170"></a>Support for Majordomo</h2></div></div><p>What do you know&mdash;Majordomo has a bunch of assorted mailing
lists. I strongly recommend that you at least join Majordomo-users.
To do that, send the following in the body of a mail message to
<a href="mailto:majordomo@greatcircle.com">majordomo@greatcircle.com</a> :</p><pre     class="programlisting">

subscribe majordomo-users
lists
end
</pre><p>This will subscribe you to majordomo-users and also send you
a list of all the mailing lists available.</p></div></div>
