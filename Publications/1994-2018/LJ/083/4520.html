Release 5. The users access this application from Windows using
Tiny Term. We want to move these users to Linux, so far we tried
Telnet, defining TERM as scoansi and several other terminals and
rlogin with xterm, but we cannot get the right key mappings.</p><p>&mdash;Jorge C. Oneto, jconeto@jco.wamani.apc.org</p><p>According to SCO, many Linux distributions contain incorrect
scoansi termcap entries. I believe SCO would be willing to send you
a new termcap entry that will fix the problems you are seeing.
(Without more details than &ldquo;cannot get the right key mappings&rdquo;
it's hard to say what exactly is wrong.)</p><p>&mdash;David Brown, david@caldera.com</p><p>I did a migration of a FoxPro application from SCO UNIX to
Linux and we had to manually modify a terminfo entry to get a 100%
scoansi compatible terminal emulation. After modifying the most
adequate (probably vt100 or ansi) terminfo file you will need to
compile it using the tic terminfo compiler. Do a <b  >man
tic</b> to get more information about this command. I would
suggest that you look at an actual scoansi emulation definition
file on a real SCO system and take a close look at the escape
sequences definition so you can port them to Linux (beware of
copyright issues if you plan on just copying this file from the SCO
system to the Linux system). Another good approach that helped me
with the keyboard part is the
<span   class="bold"><b>xmodmap</b></span> command that lets you
define sequences for each key to be sent from the keyboard to the
host on an X terminal session.</p><p>&mdash;Felipe E.

better and more flexible way to secure a machine is with ipchains.

configuring a sound card but still am confused as to whether this
is a necessity that requires rebuilding the kernel (which I have
never done and am a bit nervous about). I detect a SB 3.01 card
when I boot but then get an error message about the card being
several years old or needing to be reconfigured. Would it be easier
for me to go out and purchase a Linux-friendly card?</p><p>&mdash;Greg McNichol, gc@mcnichol.net</p><p>That depends on your card. If it's an ISA-based sound card,
it is probably not going to work well unless it's one of the more
popular cards, such as a SoundBlaster (NOT a
SoundBlaster-compatible). But if it's PCI, you shouldn't be getting
that message. In general, most PCI devices should be expected to
work with Linux at this point. There are rare exceptions, but they
are usually in the area of SCSI and network cards. One thing you
should make sure is that there isn't another driver made
specifically for your card, because the first driver that THINKS it
knows what it's doing is allowed to control a device. This may be
bad if your card isn't actually a SoundBlaster or clone, but the
driver thinks it is. You can do this by rebuilding your kernel and
looking through the sound card options, seeing if any matches
it.</p><p>&mdash;Chad R. Robinson, crobinson@rfgonline.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x148b580.0x197d118"></a>Linux on IBM A20p?</h2></div></div><p>I'm a laptop user with an IBM A20p. I can't seem to find any
