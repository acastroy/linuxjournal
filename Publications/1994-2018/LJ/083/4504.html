an easy task, and running a business requires skills that technical
people might not be comfortable using. If you're considering
becoming a consultant, or have been consulting for a while,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>The Computer Consultant's Guide</em></span> can help you
understand which skills and practices contribute to being
successful.</p><p>Written by Janet Ruhl, a leader of CompuServe's Computer
Consultant's Forum and a regular contributor to &ldquo;Contract
Professional&rdquo;, this edition of the book has been updated and now
includes information on consulting in Canada and Europe. The book
contains 290 pages divided into eleven chapters, appendices and an
index.</p><p>Subtitled &ldquo;Real-Life Strategies for Building a Successful
Consulting Career&rdquo;, <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Computer Consultant's
Guide</em></span> covers all phases of a consulting career from
determining if you're ready to start consulting through increasing
your business once you are successful. The book contains quotations
from many consultants, which demonstrate real-life examples of the
ideas presented.</p><p>The first chapter of the book provides a general explanation
of what different computer consultants do. It covers contract
programmers, resellers, custom application developers,
multimedia/web authors and management consultants. For each type of
consultant there is a &ldquo;Meet the Consultant&rdquo; section that contains
thoughts from a consultant practicing in that field. The chapter
ends by providing common questions and answers about computer
consulting.</p><p>The next chapter helps you to determine if you are ready to
begin a consulting career. It is important to examine both your
skills and your pool of potential clients. It explains that finding
the first client is usually easy, but that finding enough of them
to make a living is difficult, so there is advice on how to build a
pool of potential clients before striking out on your own. It also
offers advice on personality and business skills that will help you
to be a good consultant. Potential financial pitfalls, such as the
loss of insurance and difficulty obtaining loans, are explained.
The chapter ends with a discussion on preparing your family for
your new job and contains specific information for mothers who are
wondering if consulting will let them stay close to their children
while earning a good income.</p><p>Chapters Three through Seven deal with the mechanics of
running a consulting business. Covered topics include obtaining
licenses, deciding if you need to incorporate, creating a business
image, marketing your services and working with brokers. Most
useful for beginners are the chapters on determining rates and
successful marketing strategies. Chapter Five addresses the problem
of determining what to charge and helps you decide if you should
ever work for nothing. Chapter Six covers marketing and stresses
that word of mouth is your best type of marketing. It does offer
advice on mass mailings, brochures, advertising and cold-calling if
you feel that you must try these. Chapter Seven gives advice on
working through brokers, especially on how to find a reputable one
and how to avoid Draconian noncompetition clauses that can prevent
you from working with old clients once you leave the broker.</p><p>The next three chapters cover client relations&mdash;from
interviews with potential clients through collecting payments.
Chapter Eight helps you conduct an interview with a potential
client, determine when to start charging them and explains common
contract clauses of which to be wary. Chapter Nine concerns
consultant behavior while working for a client and includes advice
on dealing with common problems, both technical and personal,
encountered at a client's site. Chapter Ten deals with support and
payment issues. It shows how support for old clients can be
profitable and provides advice on how to support them without
slighting new clients. It also discusses what to do if clients are
slow to pay, won't pay or can't pay.</p><p>The final chapter business, dealing with success and avoiding
burnout. If you have more work than you can handle this chapter
helps you decide between hiring more employees to handle the load
or taking on less work. If your business has plateaued, it explains
how you can increase business by doing such things as selling
hardware, giving seminars and/or writing. It also helps you avoid
getting in a rut from doing the same type of work year after year.
There are times when leaving consulting and reentering the
corporate world will appeal to you, and this chapter helps you
determine when to do this and provides information on doing it
gracefully.</p><p>The book contains two appendices and an index. Appendix A is
a list of resources for consultants, including print material,
professional organizations and web sites. Appendix B lists the
twenty factors that the IRS uses to establish your status as either
a contractor (consultant) or an employee for clients.</p><p>The book is easy to read, and Ruhl's extensive experience in
dealing with these issues is apparent. This book was published in
1997, but it is not outdated because it focuses on business skills,
not technical ones.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>The Computer Consultant's Guide</em></span> provides
easy to understand, practical information for consultants just
starting out or for people considering entering the field. If
you've tried consulting previously but were unsuccessful, it can
help you determine what went wrong. In addition to helping you
determine when you're ready to start consulting, it can also help
you avoid common consulting pitfalls and keep your business
growing.</p></div></div>
