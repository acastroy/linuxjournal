<span   class="emphasis"><em>WSJ</em></span></h2></div></div><p>It was P.T. Barnum who famously said, &ldquo;I don't care what you
say about me, but just spell my name right.&rdquo;</p><p>So that's our rationale, here at <i  >Linux Journal</i>, for enduring a bit of publicity that came our
way via the December 14, 2000 issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Wall Street
Journal</em></span>. The &ldquo;Digits&rdquo; column on page B6 (the
Technology Journal page) leads off with a six-inch item titled
&ldquo;Linux Battles&rdquo;. Normally we scan pubs like the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Journal</em></span> for tidbits about anything and
everything that might remotely relate to Linux. But this time the
news wasn't just close to home&mdash;it was home. The story was about
<i  >Linux Journal</i>.</p><p>&ldquo;Digits&rdquo; is the <span   class="emphasis"><em>WSJ</em></span>'s form of
&ldquo;UpFRONT&rdquo; and shares the same appetite for irony. Unfortunately,
the irony in question here involved the apparent fact that our
modest little on-line store sold police-style barricade tape that
says &ldquo;Microsoft Free Zone&rdquo; while the company that actually runs
the store, WAS, Inc., was hardly Microsoft-free. It seems that the
site was at least partly served up by (shudder) Microsoft Windows
NT&mdash;at least while WAS moved its operation onto some kind of
UNIX.</p><p>We have been working with WAS to hasten the end of this irony
and expect to return the store to an equally Microsoft- and
news-free condition.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x152f580.0x16275b0"></a>Storage System Turns Latino Research Center Into
Publishing Powerhouse</h2></div></div><p>Founded in 1989 at Michigan State University, the Julian
Samora Research Institute has one purpose: to generate, transmit
and apply knowledge that will serve the needs of Latino communities
in the Midwest. Grants to the Institute help to fund empirical
research done by scholars and to publish their research as books or
monographs. This research looks at relevant social, economic,
educational and political conditions of Latino communities in both
the US as a whole and the Midwest in particular. The Institute's
forthcoming data will serve as a resource on and for
Latinos.</p><p>The Institute started publishing small books and reports a
decade ago. Since then, it has increased both its research and
publishing volume ten times over. Up until three years ago, the
Institute could get away with publishing a book on paper and then
file it away.</p><p>Danny Layne, who divides his time between network
administration and publishing production, says: &ldquo;If we needed to
print a book, we'd pull it out of the file and then put it
away.&rdquo;</p><p>To keep up with the volume of research it had to publish, the
Institute found itself producing more electronic files&mdash;files that
kept getting larger and more complex. Researchers broke down
chapters into multiple files. One book could consist of 20
different files. Researchers also generated electronic charts and
graphics along with PowerPoint presentations. Books got published
not only in hard-copy format but also on-line on the Institute's
web site. Layne says: &ldquo;To this end, we were generating new types
of files that we never had before.&rdquo; Disk space on a desktop
personal computer couldn't handle the volume being churned out.
Layne says that the Institute didn't want to start adding large
hard disk drives to its desktop PCs. &ldquo;If one PC's disk drive
failed, then we'd have to restore files from a previous backup tape
and recreate what we lost. That's inefficient.&rdquo; So, with
technology funds from the government and the University, the
Institute decided to buy a central storage system to house all
publications and the files for the web site. Since the Institute
has a small computing staff and limited resources, the storage
device had to be highly reliable, easy to set up and maintain and
able to accommodate more storage space with the addition of more
disk drives as needed. Layne notes, &ldquo;Our search for a storage
system brought us to Winchester Systems. We purchased a FlashDisk
external RAID storage system with seven 9GB disk drives.&rdquo;</p><p>Layne observes that just three years ago the Institute had
virtually no storage&mdash;only a few desktop PCs. &ldquo;During this time,
the FlashDisk has allowed a small research department, within a
large university, to turn itself into a publishing powerhouse on a
small purse. Some of the other departments on campus are in awe of
our storage system. And there are good reasons for it.&rdquo; Two
side-by-side Dell PowerEdge 2200s, one Windows NT and one Linux
plug directly into the FlashDisk. It provides fast, highly reliable
RAID 5 storage to multiple servers with different operating
systems. This feature eliminates the expense of buying storage for
each server. Layne says that managing one storage system is easier
than managing two or three of them.</p><p>The Windows NT server, which connects to the intranet within
the building, functions as a central repository for all active
publications and for the databases used to inventory and to track
these publications. The FlashDisk allows each researcher to have
his or her own storage space, apart from the desktop. Using either
a Windows-based PC or a Mac, researchers can access both Windows
NT, Mac and Linux files stored on the FlashDisk.</p><p>Cross-platform programs allow the system to function as a
quasi-network attached storage filer. These programs include
Services for Macintosh running on the Windows NT server and
Netatalk running on the Linux server. The latter program permits
printers to function as network devices.</p><p>The FlashDisk also contains a large collection of artwork.
Overall, the FlashDisk provides the researchers with fast access to
a large bank of files: everything from text to graphics, regardless
of the format, over an intranet. When a book is no longer going to
be published, it gets archived to a CD-ROM or a DVD. Meanwhile, the
Linux server, which connects to the external network, contains all
of the Institute's web files, as well as the web site itself. About
700 web pages reside on the FlashDisk. The web site gets about
3,000 hits each day (100,000 hits a month). Setting the space aside
on the FlashDisk to store the Linux files, as well as the Linux
operating system, turned out to be easier than Layne thought it
would be: &ldquo;We just followed the FlashDisk's instructions in the
manual and made one telephone call to technical support, and then
we were up and running,&rdquo; he says.</p><p>While the FlashDisk provides a large amount of disk space,
Layne wants to avoid having it become clogged with multiple
versions of old files. He says that keeping storage neat and trim
shouldn't become a time-consuming burden for a network
administrator. &ldquo;We've mentored our researchers to perform a number
of storage housekeeping procedures. After all, they're responsible
for overseeing their flow of information, including creating it,
updating it, storing it, deleting it or archiving it.&rdquo; For
example, researchers learn how to name their files so they can
easily locate them and remove them if they get old. Layne has also
put a regular storage clean-up program in place. Researchers have
to go through their storage space and either delete multiple copies
of files or move old files to a CD. While researchers do a good job
of maintaining their space, Layne says that the Institute's
publishing volume has a healthy appetite for more storage
space.</p><p>According to Layne, &ldquo;We're planning to upgrade our 9GB
drives to 18GB drives to double our amount of storage. We can do
this inexpensively because Winchester Systems will give us credit
toward a trade-in on the drives. The service folks at Winchester
Systems must feel like the repair people at Maytag. The FlashDisk
has never broken down, not even hiccuped.&rdquo;</p><p>Money from the University will allow the Institute to produce
audio and video clips for the Web. Layne says, &ldquo;We've already
tested accessing and storing multimedia on the FlashDisk.
Everything worked fine.&rdquo;</p><p>&mdash;Elizabeth M.

job-opening descriptions. For example, Windows' terms include 95,
NT, CE, Win, Windows NT, etc. Besides various abbreviations, there
are also ambiguous words. Is Win followed by NT to be counted as
Windows and Windows NT or just Windows NT alone? Generally, the
&ldquo;maximum munch&rdquo; rule is used. That is, the longest recognizable
term possible is used. Then there are still the misspellings and
unknown words. Thus, all this makes determining what is required
fuzzy. Having said that, here are some of the statistics used in
the job descriptions:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>number of job openings: 129,000</p></li><li><p>number of unique words: 12,200</p></li><li><p>number of unique skill sets: 68,800</p></li></ul></div><p>Five most often used words:
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>C++: 19,951</p></li><li><p>Java: 16,920</p></li><li><p>SQL: 9,121</p></li><li><p>vb: 9,003</p></li><li><p>HTML: 8,788</p></li><li><p>JavaScript: 4,793</p></li></ul></div>

As you would expect with all these terms, skill sets made up of a
couple of words would tend to appear more often than skill sets
made up of three or more words. The top five skill sets were:
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>frame relay: 445</p></li><li><p>Oracle dba: 445</p></li><li><p>C++ Java: 412</p></li><li><p>WinNT server: 361</p></li><li><p>Shell script: 361</p></li></ul></div>

Powered by Apache and Linux</h2></div></div><p>After only a few months of operation, NeoPets.com, a web site
built on a Red Hat Linux/Apache platform, is already turning a
profit, recording billions of page views monthly. Targeting youths
aged 20 or younger, the site enables users to create and care for
their own personal virtual critter known as a &ldquo;NeoPet&rdquo;. It also
boasts a series of constantly changing &ldquo;universes&rdquo; complete with
games, stories, contests and entertainment. According to recent
figures from PC Data Online, NeoPets attracts 2.1 billion page
views and 2.3 million unique users each month who each stay for an
average of 7.48 hours, making this the stickiest site on the
Web.</p><p>Based on August numbers, NeoPets ranks higher in page views
than Excite, Lycos and Amazon. What's more, it engenders far more
loyalty (termed stickiness) among users. The average AOL user, for
example, visits for 35 minutes a month, while Yahoo users spend
three hours 22 minutes. In the Gen Y market, NeoPets total of seven
hours 48 minutes trounces the competition, with ten times the page
views of Disney.</p><p>Initially created in a college dorm with a &ldquo;launch
campaign&rdquo; that consisted of sending a couple of e-mails to other
virtual pet sites, the site chalked up 200 sign-ups on its first
day and was soon scoring as many as 200,000 page views a day. A
management and technical team was then formed to create the
corporate platform needed to help NeoPets expand. They added more
staff and moved its servers to Pixelgate, a Westlake Village,
California-based web hosting and internet services company. &ldquo;After
being off-line for several days, we surpassed 600,000 page views
within three days of getting back on-line,&rdquo; said NeoPets Chairman
and CEO Doug Dohring.</p><p>The company increased the number of Apache/Linux boxes from
two to five, using single CPU P3-600s as image servers and dual
P3-600s for web servers, each with 512MB to 1GB RAM. Continual load
expansion eventually pushed NeoPet's MySQL database technology to
the limit. By this time, NeoPets was surpassing up to ten million
page views a day. Reorganization again became a necessity.</p><p>The company secured the services of Web Zone Inc. of Santa
Clara, California and Broomfield, Colorado-based Level 3, a
multinational Tier One provider with hosting facilities in Los
Angeles. This provided enough bandwidth to deal comfortably with
anticipated traffic volumes. NeoPets then added yet more staff and
purchased about 50 Red Hat/Apache web and image servers, two more
MySQL Servers and a Sun server to run an Oracle database. Once the
Oracle conversion was completed, page views soared to over 40
million a day.</p><p>The current NeoPets architecture comprises a Red Hat 6.2 and
Apache front end, with a Solaris and Oracle back end. At the same
time, MySQL is still used for a wide range of database
operations.</p><p>Despite the introduction of Oracle, NeoPets remains one of
the larger users of Apache on the Web. Though Oracle had to be
introduced to provide a heavy-duty database, NeoPets believes that
open source ultimately offers better quality and greater product
reliability and remains committed to further expanding the
robustness and capacity of PHP, Apache and MySQL as an alternative
to Oracle.</p><p>&ldquo;We are looking for people who can modify these open-source
applications and take them to a new plateau,&rdquo; said CTO Bill
McCaffrey. &ldquo;If we involve the right people, we believe that we can
take these applications to the point where they can be used for
even the largest sites on the Web.&rdquo;</p><p>In anticipation of another summertime boom in site usage,
NeoPets is planning to add many more web developers and open-source
programmers, as well as system administrators and IT support
staff.</p><p>&mdash;Drew Robb</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x152f580.0x1a22928"></a>The <i  >Linux Journal</i> Award for

exception of Eric Raymond it kind of sucks at PR.</p><p>Okay, let's qualify that. There are some fine companies that
get mileage out of open source as a virtue, but as an editor I can
tell you that there are too darn few pure open-source projects
.org-type with a PR department (we suspect that number is zero), or
with much PR instinct, by which I mean they bother editors like me
with interesting information about what they're up to. Sure, we get
flamed to a cinder when we neglect to mention the obvious, such as
early last year when we wrongly reported that Borland's InterBase
was about to become the first open-source database project, earning
the outrage of some PostgreSQL folks (though surprisingly few,
considering). But there isn't much outreach by the growing
assortment of nuts-and-bolts open-source projects that simply make
something handy that a lot of others can use.</p><p>Take proxy caching, which is very handy if you've got a lot
of traffic to manage&mdash;but not much of a conversation starter except
for those who (for professional or other reasons) obsess about
it.</p><p>As it happens there are more than a few obsessives out there,
and one of them (I forget who) told me that Squid
(<a href="http://www.squid-cache.org" target="_self">http://www.squid-cache.org/</a>)
is the cat's pajamas of open-source proxy servers. Well, it seems
there are a pile of proprietary (presumably closed-source,
certainly not free) proxy servers in the world. You can get them
from Lucent, Novell, IBM, Cisco, Microsoft and the other usual
suspects. Their prices run from zero to six figures. Squid is at
the bottom of that range. As their FAQ puts it, &ldquo;You can download
Squid via FTP from the primary FTP site or one of the many
worldwide mirror sites. Many sushi bars also have Squid.&rdquo;</p><p>The product is competitive&mdash;literally. A group called IRCache
holds frequent bake-offs (which they now call cache-offs) using the
web Polygraph
(<a href="http://www.polygraph.ircache.net" target="_self">http://www.polygraph.ircache.net/</a>),
a benchmarking tool developed by the National Science Foundation
and a bunch of those same usual suspects. The results (also on the
IRCache site) for each bake/cache-off run through many pages, many
tables and many graphs. Squid leads in some places and lags in
others, but it runs in the thick of every race.</p><p>Perhaps the most telling results come from this level-5 post
from Matthew P. Barnson on Slashdot last year:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>I can personally say that the three I've had
experience with, Novell's ICS caches (which comprised ten of the
twenty entrants), Network Appliance's NetCache, and Squid (on
Solaris, in our case) all rock. Squid 2.3-stable1 was a dream to
compile, install, and configure.</p></blockquote></div><p>When we contacted him directly, he added this about Squid:
&ldquo;As an outgrowth of the Harvest Project, this venerable,
free-software proxy cache sets the benchmark by which all other
caches are measured.... For the price, Squid kicks some serious
butt!&rdquo; He also has kind words for another open-source project:
<div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Apache web server was not specifically mentioned
in the bake-off, but in my experience is extremely popular for
caching services because the same server that can serve your web
pages from your dorm room can also speed up your web
surfing.</p></blockquote></div>

And he should know his stuff, he works at one of the most heavily
visited sites on Earth (iMALL.com).
</p><p>So let's raise a glass of saki to the Squid team and invite
all the other open-source and free-software developers who envy
this kind of coverage to let us know what they're up to.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x152f580.0x1a22f00"></a>Stop the Presses</h2></div></div><p>What's happens when the Penguin-in-Chief himself issues an

thinking what nobody has thought.</p><p>&mdash;Albert Szent-Gyorgyi.</p><p>The Internet never retreats.</p><p>&mdash;Vint Cerf</p><p>Linux (le-nuks, lin-uks) noun. A version of the UNIX System V
Release 3.0 kernel developed for PCs with 80386 and higher
microprocessors. Developed by Linus Torvalds of Sweden (for whom it
is named).</p><p>&mdash;from Microsoft Bookshelf (spotted by Wojciech
Tatina)</p><p>The only piece of software I've never cursed is emacs. It
changes modes effortlessly. When I'm editing a Perl script it adds
the tags and checks the parens. When I edit a letter it gives me
all the carriage returns in the right place. It's one piece of
software, but it understands file extensions. emacs knows what I'm
up to. It's okay with what I do and it tries to help. I often find
Word trying to add bullet points or numbers where I don't want
them. emacs never does that to me. Of course emacs and I grew up in
the same environment, so maybe that makes sense.</p><p>&mdash;Clay Shirky</p><p>...being a Linux user is sort of like living in a house
inhabited by a large family of carpenters and architects. Every
morning when you wake up, the house is a little different. Maybe
there is a new turret, or some walls have moved. Or perhaps someone
has temporarily removed the floor under your bed.</p><p>&mdash;John R. Levine and Margaret Levine Young</p><p>To try to do something that is inherently impossible is
always a corrupting enterprise.</p><p>&mdash;Michael Oakshott</p><p>Bored people are the best consumers.</p><p>&mdash;John Taylor Gatto</p><p>You people just don't get it, do you? All Linux applications
run on Solaris, which is our implementation of Linux.</p><p>&mdash;Scott McNealy</p></div></div>
