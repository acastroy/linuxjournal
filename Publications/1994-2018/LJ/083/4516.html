IT industry that Linux does not offer professional support. I was
recently speaking with one of my peers who was having trouble with
a Windows NT server that was handling file and print sharing for a
medium-sized network. My associate was frustrated because Windows
NT does not handle high-bandwidth situations well. If an end user
were to drag a very large file over their network, the load on the
server would go up considerably.
</p><p>I asked my peer why he did not use a solution such as Linux
with Samba. The answer I received was interesting. It was not
&ldquo;Linux, are you kidding?&rdquo; or &ldquo;Linux sucks!&rdquo; It was &ldquo;What if it
breaks, and frankly, who do I hold liable if it does?&rdquo; I had to
give him a sidelong glance, since one of my company's
(<a href="http://www.commandprompt.com" target="_self">http://www.commandprompt.com/</a>)
focuses is managed-Linux services.</p><p>While talking to other clients, I have received many similar
responses. The press has gone to extraordinary efforts to promote
Linux. It has also gone to extraordinary efforts to damn Linux. In
the end, the press, the key marketing tool of the Linux industry,
has missed the entire point. The point is that professional,
commercial, Linux-support corporations do exist. Instead the press
has concentrated on either Internet-related support resources such
as USENET or the Linux Documentation Project
(<a href="http://www.linuxdoc.org" target="_self">http://www.linuxdoc.org/</a>).
They also mention companies like LinuxCare or Red Hat. The problem
is you cannot touch, praise or, if necessary, physically strangle
Red Hat, LinuxCare or comp.os.linux.networking.</p><p>Don't get me wrong. I am playing devil's advocate here. The
major firms like Red Hat, VA Linux and LinuxCare have their place
in the support marketplace. They are excellent with phone-based
support&mdash;if you want to pay $325 US per incident to Red Hat. I have
news for you: that is more expensive than Microsoft. LinuxCare
rides in at $180 per hour and you specify the cap. Excellent: I get
to pay $180 an hour and hope they can fix it. What happens if they
don't? At least with Red Hat support is incident-based.</p><p>If you are a medium- to large-sized corporation, Red Hat or
LinuxCare may be good for you. They offer the type of service that
a lot of smaller consultants cannot; they are always available.
They can usually offer quicker response times because they have
people waiting by the phone just to take the call. They also have a
lot of internal resources that they can call upon. If one engineer
does not have the answer, the one sitting next to him might.</p><p>Price is not the only disadvantage. An engineer cannot
<span   class="emphasis"><em>see</em></span> what is happening. They must be told, and
understanding and accuracy can be lost in the translation. Of
course, you could allow the engineer remote access to your
machine.</p><p>Documentation can be an issue as well. When was the last time
you used phone support and, when you were finished, received a
detailed summary of what the person did, how much time it took them
and what, exactly, was fixed?</p><p>To this end, small consulting firms and independent
consultants are a good fit for many corporations. If you have 1-100
users, they may be your best solution. The consultant is a
sure-fire way to make sure you get your hands on someone if
something is broken. Typically, they are local, and sometimes you
may even know where they live. There are many consultants who will
actually be more knowledgeable than the standard engineers at a
place like Red Hat. The consultant will have a tendency to work
more directly with machines, have a personal lab and try new
things.</p><p>The willingness of consultants to experiment can be both good
and bad. The good side is the consultant will be familiar with more
of the software and solutions that Linux can provide. The bad side
is the consultant may find a good solution and charge the customer
to install it, when, in actuality, the customer is being charged
for the consultant to learn how to install and use the
program.</p><p>I should stress that this is not usually the case. The
business perspective is that you shouldn't have to pay someone to
learn how to provide you with the service you need. In technology,
however, a customer will often demand a type of technology that the
consultant does not know. The business can either pay the
consultant to learn and install it or find a consultant that
already has knowledge of the technology. It is the consultant's
responsibility to be honest with the customer about his or her
level and breadth of knowledge.</p><p>So, how do you find a consultant? That is a tough one. The
largest database of Linux consultants is the Linux Consultants
Search and Guide located at
<a href="http://www.linuxports.com" target="_self">http://www.linuxports.com/</a>.
It currently has over one thousand entries, with locations ranging
from California to Turkey, and you can search via mail code,
keyword or other options.</p><p>Another possibility is your local Linux user group. You can
find a list of them at
<a href="http://www.linux.com/lug" target="_self">http://www.linux.com/lug/</a>
[see also Groups of Linux Users Everywhere (GLUE) at
<a href="http://www.ssc.com/glue/groups" target="_self">http://www.ssc.com/glue/groups/</a>].
Linux User Groups can be an easy way to network and find someone to
help you with your Linux machines. If you are trying to locate a
Linux consultant, the most difficult part will be finding a good
one. Many consultants are extremely independent. They want to
remain entirely autonomous; they want to do things their way, and
unless you speak geek, they communicate poorly.</p><p>The trick is to find a consultant that you can communicate
with. If you can find a consultant that communicates well, you will
get a lot farther. There is a reason many large consulting firms,
Linux or otherwise, have a customer service department or sales
people to take your initial calls. Technical people can be very
hard people to deal with on a common level. If you are
uncomfortable with computers, they can be even more difficult to
deal with. To know whether you have found a good consultant is
difficult, but there are a couple of things that you can look
for:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>A good consultant will be patient without being
condescending. They will communicate with you. They will explain
everything they have done or will do in complete detail. They will
do so more than once, if necessary.</p></li><li><p>He or she will provide everything in writing. If
they are completing a project for you, large or small, they will
provide a project plan. The project plan can be as simple as a half
sheet of paper for certain tasks, or it may be ten pages for
others. It just needs to be documented. If it is a service call,
the consultant will provide more detailed communication as the call
progresses. They will help the customer decide what actions to
take. When the call is completed, they will provide a written
analysis of what they did and how it fixed the problem. The
analysis will be repeated on their billing.</p></li><li><p>He or she will bid on everything that they do. They
will say, &ldquo;I think it will take two hours to complete this job.&rdquo;
However, it is important for the customer to realize that computers
have attitude problems and that most consultants work on a
time-and-materials basis. It may take more or less time than the
initial estimate. It is the consultant's responsibility to make
sure that the customer understands this.</p></li><li><p>A good consultant will happily provide a list of
references that verify their knowledge and ethics. A note on this:
Linux is young, and there are a lot of new consultants out there
just trying to get by. Do not be afraid to use an untried
consultant. If you are concerned about their skills, counterbid the
price. Ask them if they will come out, without charging you, to
assess the problem. Tell them that you will happily pay their full
rate, plus the time they spent to assess the problem, if they give
you a reasonable assessment and are able to fix the problem. This
will allow you to judge their mannerisms, assess how they will
perform and give you a general feeling as to whether or not you can
work with the consultant.</p></li><li><p>A good consultant will not do only Linux. There are
a ton of consultants out there who say &ldquo;We only do Linux.&rdquo; It is
supposed to make them seem like a better consultant, at least
technically. The problem is (unless you are a Linux-only company)
you will have to deal with many different vendors.</p></li></ul></div><p>I have a customer that has WTS (Windows NT Terminal Server)
4.0/Citrix, AIX, Linux and SCO. I have to manage all of these
machines plus the users that are connecting to them. If I were just
a WTS person, I would not be of much use to them. (But yes, I
advocate switching all to Linux at every opportunity.) It is very
important for the consultant to understand your environment. Do not
expect them to be an expert in every environment, but a basic
understanding of the environment is important. The ability to
perform most common administrative tasks of other environments is
also important.</p><p>On the other hand, do not expect that the person that has
been handling your Windows NT network has a clue about Linux. Linux
is a completely different beast than Windows NT. It operates
differently and takes a different kind of love to make it work.
Linux will run without trouble for years at a time if you have the
right person to take care of it. If you get the wrong person, it
will be a source of heartache forever. If you are thinking about
migrating to Linux and you want to use your existing consultants,
make sure that they have actual implementation experience with
Linux.</p><p>If this is what a good consultant does, you may be asking
yourself why <span   class="emphasis"><em>your</em></span> consultant is not doing
these things. There is a drawback to having a
<span   class="emphasis"><em>good</em></span> consultant. The truly good consultants,
if they are following everything I've described, would have to bill
you like a lawyer just to stay alive. When I call my lawyer, even
to ask a simple question, I am billed for that phone call. In order
for the firm to remain profitable they must bill me. It may only
take ten minutes of their time on my end, but it could easily take
30-45 minutes to document the call, give it to the assistant, have
the assistant record the call and put the notes of my call in the
file for future reference. If you get six of those phone calls a
day, that is three hours of time that needs to be billed.</p><p>As mentioned previously, the consultant, just like a lawyer,
operates on a time-and-materials basis. In order to provide the
customer with the level of service just described, the consultant
would have to charge more than the standard rate. They would have
to take time, and thus money, to create all the documentation. They
would have to charge you to communicate, negotiate and sometimes to
simply put up with you. The customer may always be right, but it
doesn't do the customer any good if the consultant can't get his
work done. The more of the consultant's time that the customer
takes up, the more expensive the consultant will be. Do not
micromanage the consultant; build a relationship of trust with him
or her, but make sure he or she sticks to what you agreed upon. It
is a very fine line.</p><p>Given all of this to consider, how can you tell a good
consultant from a bad one? There is much more to a good consultant
than technical know-how. There are varying degrees of bad
consultants, and I don't think that very many of them are truly
bad. Personally, I have a difficult time dealing with
&ldquo;management&rdquo;. The people wear the ties, read <span   class="emphasis"><em>PC
World</em></span> and think they have a clue really get on my
nerves. Does this make me a bad consultant? No, not if I
communicate professionally and am patient with the guy wearing the
tie who just read the latest issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>PC
World</em></span>.</p><p>Again, most consultants aren't bad consultants. The majority
of problems that I have seen between consultants and companies were
caused by a lack of communication. If you lack good communication
skills you will always have difficulties. Communication between the
customer and the consultant takes two forms: customer management
and consultant management.</p><p>A good consultant will have good customer-management skills.
Customer management is the ability to communicate with the customer
without intimidating, insulting or badgering. It is the ability to
resolve issues without becoming defensive. It is the ability to
address a customer as an equal but provide boundaries within which
they can work with you. The easiest mistake to make as a consultant
is to take a call after hours but charge the customer a normal
rate. A few may call this customer service, but customers by nature
and by good business sense (attempting to save money) will try to
take advantage of that. If you do it once, you can mistakenly set a
precedenct.</p><p>Conversely, a good customer will manage their consultant. The
consultant must understand clearly what their role is and what it
is the customer would like them to do. If the consultant does not
understand these things, you will consistently run into, &ldquo;But I
thought...&rdquo; or &ldquo;Wait, you told me....&rdquo; If you utilize consistent
procedures, thorough communication and clearly expressed
expectations, you will see the majority of your consulting issues
fall by the wayside.</p></div></div>
