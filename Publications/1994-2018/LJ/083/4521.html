<i  >Linux Journal</i> and went right to one of your
feature stories&mdash;&ldquo;A Linux-Based Automatic Backup System&rdquo;. I was
expecting to see something about tape drives and backing up and
restoring a dead hard drive. Instead, I see a very brief tutorial
on using Samba, cp, cron, and bzip on backing up Windows shares on
a Linux hard drive. The author quotes that it's an &ldquo;inexpensive
and easy solution&rdquo;&mdash;he's exactly right about that. I don't see
creating a zip file on a hard drive a backup solution, nor do I see
this article being a feature story. There was absolutely nothing in
the article that even mentioned backing up Linux files or how to
restore them. Articles like this and the wave of many others that
you have published in the past are a complete embarrassment to
Linux. They all seem to be Linux acting in a supporting role to
Windows. Come on! Look at the front cover of your magazine! Publish
some real articles about Linux for a change!</p><p>&mdash;Paul Sullivan wiley14@mindspring.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2345580.0x243d4a8"></a>A Real Bastard</h2></div></div><p>Thank you for your short article in the December 2000 issue
of <i  >LJ</i> on the trouble with the Bastard Operator
from Hell. Interesting from my point of view that I've never felt
that my job has sucked. It's often busy and I have had to deal with
a lot of bozos, but I've generally been having a good time. And I'm
somewhat in the minority in that I did major in computer
science.</p><p>I do have one question, though. I've just recently (this
week) started at a new employer. Problem is, I've run into someone
in my group who likely doesn't think BOFH is funny at all. Rather,
he thinks it's a manual on how to be a systems administrator. I kid
you not. So what do you do when you encounter a real life BOFH?
It's serious enough that I think the guy should be just outright
fired. I still don't know how he got hired and how he's lasted as
long as he has.</p><p>&mdash;Anonymous</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Unfortunately, there's no Getting People Fired

2000 issue he states &ldquo;...CGI has a number of drawbacks...,it
requires that the web server spawn a new process.&rdquo; It saddens me
to see that a regular columnist at <i  >Linux Journal</i> misunderstands the meaning of CGI.</p><p>Even though he defines CGI as &ldquo;common gateway interface&rdquo; he
fails to continue with the thought. It is an interface to a server.
It is not a program. Any process that processes data given to a
server with a QUERY_STRING is a &ldquo;CGI program&rdquo;. That means that
mod_perl scripts, PHP, servlets, JSP, etc., all of which run in the
server memory space&mdash;thereby not spawning new processes&mdash;are also
CGI programs.</p><p>Yes, the common misconception is that CGI is a type of
scripting, but as the leaders of the industry we should be precise
in our language and meaning.</p><p>&mdash;Nathan Hokanson nathan.hokanson@home.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2345580.0x243da80"></a>Ada Boy!</h2></div></div><p>I enjoyed the article by Frode Tennebo on Ada 95 programming
in the December 2000 issue. It's exciting to see Ada's increasing
popularity in the Linux world. It's because of the language's
features and robustness that best-selling Linux author Warren W.
Gay announced that he would be porting his open-source projects to
Ada.</p><p>For the benefit of your readers, more information about Ada

find the magazine very helpful and informative. I enjoy the section
that displays wacky domain names that have not been consumed by the

the Ultimate Linux Box&rdquo; but you stopped short of actually
delivering on the promise of the article! Sure, there are lots of
choices out there for a motherboard, hard disk drive, etc., but
knowing that doesn't help in trying to assemble &ldquo;The Ultimate
Linux Box!&rdquo; Knowing that Tyan, ASUS and Abit make good
motherboards is like answering the question &ldquo;Why Linux?&rdquo; with
&ldquo;Because it does lots of cool stuff!&rdquo; I hope that you will do an
article similar to the one at
<a href="http://www.maximumpc.com/reprint/archives/archive21.html" target="_self">www.maximumpc.com/reprint/archives/archive21.html</a>
but focused on Linux. I think it's great to give the pros and cons
and considerations of each component, but then take a stand! Commit
yourself to something and tell us why! That is a lot more useful
than a wishy-washy &ldquo;Well, this is cool, and that's cool, and these
other folks say that all these other things are cool too, so they
would all be good in an Ultimate Linux Box.&rdquo;</p><p>&mdash;Jerel

2001</em></span>], I used SuSE 6.1 and 6.2. I tried to upgrade to
6.4 and it kept reverting to German with a German keyboard. I could
fix it at the command prompt and KDE bug team said this was a
problem with SuSE. It's a good program and if one speaks German it
has support. The Cal crew [<span   class="emphasis"><em>California office</em></span>]
is clueless. I took it off the machine. I need the newer version to
play with Star Office and its database. I think the basic problem
with the Linux crowd is that no one gives a rat's a** about the end
user.</p><p>&mdash;Paul Taylor ptay1@bestweb.net</p><p>I'm sorry to hear you had such a problem with SuSE. I'm not a
SuSE employee, but I will say my experience with 6.4 and 7.0 has
been pretty good. Definitely no issues with German keymaps. You
mentioned upgrading to 6.4. My habit, with any distribution, has
been to avoid upgrades and do a clean install. Linux is changing
too rapidly, and I think you are asking for trouble doing an
upgrade. I generally back up everything (you do have a backup
strategy and media right?), repartition (possibly), reformat and do
a clean install, then pull back my personal files (e-mail,
bookmarks etc.) from the backup. The newer distributions seem to
pick up most of your hardware right out the gate, so a lot of that
hassle is now gone. Any remaining favorites I may be missing I'll
reinstall from the distribution's CDs, rebuild from source, or
restore from my backup. This may seem like a bit more hassle than
an upgrade, but in the end I think you'll end up with a much more
stable system. If all you're after is StarOffice, you can just add
it to your current setup. I've done this on two Mandrake 6 systems
with no problem, downloading it from Sun.</p><p>&mdash;Stew Benedict stewb@aysenterprises.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2345580.0x243e3c8"></a><i  >LJ</i> Interactive</h2></div></div><p>I want you to know that interactive.linuxjournal.com is one

article on groff [December 2000]. Even though I have been using
groff extensively for four years, I still found something new to
learn in Wayne's piece.</p><p>I learned about groff some years before when I obtained a
copy of <span   class="emphasis"><em>UNIX Text Processing</em></span> by Dougherty and
O'Reilly. I found it intriguing and poked away with the
<span   class="bold"><b>ms</b></span> macros for a while until I
returned to school and decided that the courses for which I was
paying deserved to have my handwritten (and largely illegible)
notes transcribed for future reference.</p><p>Wishing to &ldquo;give back&rdquo; to the Linux community, I prepared a
&ldquo;Groff and Friends HOWTO&rdquo;
(<a href="http://www.ucalgary.ca/~dprovins" target="_self">http://www.ucalgary.ca/~dprovins/</a>),
which after reading Wayne's article might be more aptly titled a
&ldquo;groff and Friends ms HOWTO&rdquo;, as it is focussed on that set of
macros, and how to adjust them to meet one's needs.</p><p>Even with all that &ldquo;experience&rdquo;, I still found Wayne's
article enlightening, and when it comes time to rewrite the how-to
(which it could use), I hope to include some of his insights.
Naturally I'll mention his article as a reference for new or
not-so-new users.</p><p>May I add that there is an active mail list for groff at
<a href="http://groff.ffii.org" target="_self">http://groff.ffii.org/</a>

suggestions for, groff development.</p><p>&mdash;Dean Provins provinsd@ve6cta.cuug.ab.ca</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2345580.0x243ecb8"></a>What's up with Ogg?</h2></div></div><p>In my January 2001 copy of <i  >Linux Journal</i>, there is an article on Ogg Vorbis as an
open-standard alternative to MP3 [&ldquo;Ogg Vorbis-Open, Free
Audio&mdash;Set Your Media Free&rdquo;] The article states that Ogg Vorbis'
main financial backer is iCast, an entertainment division of
CMGion. However, it makes no mention of the fact that CMGion closed
down iCast services as of the end of last year and is closing many
other divisions of its company acquisitions.</p><p>I was just curious why such an article was run with
information that was old news or at least did not include an update
when it seems that the backbone of this standards support is
suffering from osteoporosis.</p><p>I checked both the Vorbis site and the xiph site linked from
the article, but neither of them have any news or apparent updates
since mid November (when icast was shut down according to ZDNet
news).</p><p>&mdash;Kathy Lynn</p><p>Kathy, As you say, iCast services were closed down as of the
end of last year. The issue of the article is January 2001, meaning
it was on the streets mid-December and at the printer in November.
The article's author, Jack Moffitt, former VP of technology for
iCast was laid off when it happened and had no idea at the time he
wrote the article. There is, however, already much software that
supports Ogg Vorbis available at
