<span   class="bold"><b>inetd</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>xinetd</b></span> provides access control,
improved logging and resource management. It has become the
standard Internet super d&aelig;mon for Red Hat 7 and Mandrake 7.2.
This article is designed to get you started with using some of its
features&mdash;hopefully some of its more interesting ones&mdash;and is based
on features available in xinetd 2.1.8.8pre3.

(panos@cs.colorado.edu), seems to have dropped the project. Rob
Braun (bbraun@synack.net) has picked up the project and is now
responsible for maintaining the package. One problem I noticed with
the package in its current state was that I had to add a couple of
header files to get select( ) to work on my old libc5 system.
Should you need them, they are as follows:</p><pre     class="programlisting">

inetd lines with bracketed, expanded syntax. In addition, new
possibilities are given for logging and access control. While inetd
allows control for TCP connections using Venema's tcp_wrappers
software (tcpd), you cannot control UDP connections. Also, it
doesn't do well with RPC (portmapper) type services. Additionally,
while you can control the rate of connections using inetd (by
appending a number to the wait or no wait argument, for example,
nowait.1 for one instance per second), you cannot control the
maximum number of instances. This could lead to process table
attacks, for example, an effective denial of service. By using
xinetd, we can thwart this.</p><p>I usually start xinetd with the following command, placed in
my startup scripts where Internet services are started:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/usr/sbin/xinetd -filelog /var/adm/xinetd.log -f /etc/xinetd.conf
</pre><p>This tells xinetd to log everything to the file
/var/adm/xinetd.log and use the configuration file
/etc/xinetd.conf. The bulk of this article will deal with this
configuration file.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x138f580.0x1487ad8"></a>Compile-Time Options</h2></div></div><p>The three compile-time options you should pay attention to
that provide added access control are libwrap, loadavg (a threshold
monitor for load averaging) and IPv6 support. As with most
libwrap-aware d&aelig;mons (like
<span   class="bold"><b>portmapper</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>sendmail</b></span>), the option
&ldquo;with-libwrap&rdquo; in the configure script tells xinetd to be built
linking in support for the tcp_wrappers file /etc/hosts.allow and
/etc/hosts.deny. These options for xinetd work exactly as they do
for inetd and support all of the xinetd-controlled d&aelig;mons.
Note that if you're starting from scratch with xinetd, using tcpd
is no longer needed as access control is done within xinetd.
However, this support for libwrap is useful if you're migrating
from inetd/tcpd and don't want to change your access files
too.</p><p>The second interesting configuration option is support load
average monitoring, accomplished using the with-loadavg option in
the ./configure script. sendmail supports dropping connections at
high load, presuming that it has spun out of control and is taking
down the machine. The max_load option can be enabled using this
configuration option to limit connections to any or all services
based on the load average of the machine.</p><p>Lastly, the configuration option to add IPv6 support is
accomplished by using the with-inet6 capability in ./configure.
This adds xinetd support for IPv6 addresses and connections. Note
that your kernel (and network) must support IPv6 for this to be
effective. IPv4 support is maintained, of course.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x138f580.0x1487d40"></a>The Configuration File</h2></div></div><p>The xinetd configuration file, usually /etc/xinetd.conf, can
be built by hand or automatically from an inetd.conf file. The
former is more time consuming and prone to errors; the latter is
readily accomplished using the
<span   class="bold"><b>itox</b></span> utility or
<span   class="bold"><b>xconv.pl</b></span> script. Although the itox
utility is being dropped in favor of the xconv.pl script, it is
still useful. However, note that running it repeatedly will
overwrite the existing file. Both itox and xconv work in the same
way, but we'll show it for itox:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ itox &lt; /etc/inetd.conf &gt; xinetd.conf
</pre><p>The newer utility, xconv, understands comments and the use of
tcpd better than itox does. For itox you have to specify the
directory where d&aelig;mons live, such as /usr/sbin. The first
section you may want to include is the defaults section. This
gives, as the name implies, defaults for the xinetd service:
<pre     class="programlisting">
defaults
{
   instances       = 25
   log_type        = FILE /var/adm/servicelog
   log_on_success  = PID HOST EXIT
   flags           = NORETRY
   log_on_failure  = HOST RECORD ATTEMPT
   only_from       = 129.22.0.0
   no_access       = 129.22.210.61
   disabled        = nntp uucp tftp bootps who
                     shell login exec
   disabled       += finger
}
</pre>


Immediately, we can see the syntax of a xinetd configuration
parameter: &lt;directive&gt; &lt;operator&gt; &lt;value&gt;. The
directives that xinetd understands are listed in Table 1.
Directives we'll ignore here are flags, type, env and passenv.
We'll talk more below about only_from and no_access, plus logging
options.
</p><p><a href="4490t1.html" target="_self">Table 1. Directives for
xinetd</a></p><p>Operators are quite simple, either = or +=. Using =, the
values on the right are given to the directive on the left. += is
also quite intuitive and is used to append values to an already
defined directive. Without it, earlier directives are overwritten.
This can also be used to spread access lists or, for example, over
multiple lines.</p><p>Service descriptions are given by the format:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
servicename
{
        directive = value
        directive += value
}
</pre><p>Servicename must be listed in the /etc/services to occur on
the proper socket and with the proper protocol.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x138f580.0x1488210"></a>A Word about Access Control</h2></div></div><p>Actually, a few words about how xinetd does access control.
First of all, xinetd controls connections, not packets. It's a
userland d&aelig;mon, just as inetd is. As such, while it would
break a SYN or connect() attempt from a host that is prohibited
from connecting to a service, it will not break &ldquo;stealth&rdquo; scans
such as a FIN scan [a port scan utilizing TCP packets with the FIN
flag set, often performed with a tool such as NMAP]. Don't rely on
xinetd to be a firewall to break portscanning. A resourceful
intruder will be able to use this information to gather
access-control lists for your various services. Luckily, this can
be logged by xinetd, and your paranoia sensors should go off when
you review your logs.</p><p>Secondly, xinetd, as of 2.1.8.8pre3, performs name lookups
when a system attempts to connect. Previously, it used to do
lookups at startup, but this has been changed.</p><p>Using access control is really quite simple. The first
directive is only_from, which lists the networks or hosts from
which the we will accept connections from. This directive sets up
rules that can be overridden by no_access. You can use network
numbers, such as 10.0.0.0 or 10, or network names, including
*.my.com or .my.com with this directive. Host names and IP
addresses of hosts also can be used here. Use the directive 0.0.0.0
to match all hosts and to listen to all addresses. Denials are
parsed once the criteria are met by using the no_access directive.
Again, networks or hosts can be specified.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x138f580.0x14883c8"></a>Service Configurations</h2></div></div><p>Let's have a look at some basic applications of this
information. The first service we'll look at is the
<span   class="bold"><b>echo</b></span> service, which is internal to
both inetd and xinetd.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
service echo
{
        socket_type     = stream
        protocol        = tcp
        wait            = no
        user            = root
        type            = INTERNAL
        id              = echo-stream
}
</pre><p>Echo runs as root, is a tcp stream and is handled internally.
The id directive of echo-stream would show up in the logs. In the
absence of only_from or no_access directives, access to this
service as configured is unlimited.
</p><p>Now, let's look at a regular service, in this case the
daytime service:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
service daytime
{
        socket_type     = stream
        protocol        = tcp
        wait            = no
        user            = nobody
        server          = /usr/sbin/in.date
        instances       = 1
        nice            = 10
        only_from       = 0.0.0.0
}
</pre><p>Again, anyone can connect to it, but we specify an executable
to run (as nobody) to return the information. This one doesn't
extend the previous example by much. We now look at another service
for secure shell version 1. This was done to prevent resource
exhaustion by <span   class="bold"><b>sshd</b></span>.
<pre     class="programlisting">
service ssh1
{
        socket_type     = stream
        protocol        = tcp
        instances       = 10
        nice            = 10
        wait            = no
        user            = root
        server          = /usr/local/sbin/sshd1
        server_args     = -i
        log_on_failure  += USERID
        only_from       = 192.168.0.0
        no_access       = 192.168.54.0
        no_access       += 192.168.33.0
}
</pre>


Here, we build on what we were doing before. Recall that sshd needs
to be started with the <b  >-i</b> flag when it is
started from a super server like inetd or xinetd, so we place that
in the server_args directive. Note: adding the flags to the server
directive will cause it to fail. Only ten people can use this
service at any one time, which is not a problem on the server this
example was taken from. We log, in addition to the default
information, the user ID of the connecting party as described in
RFC 1413 if they are unable to connect. Lastly, we have two
networks listed which cannot access this service.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x138f580.0x14887e8"></a>Logging and xinetd</h2></div></div><p>The logging directive understands several values that can be
used to get information about your server (see Table 2).</p><p><a href="4490t2.html" target="_self">Table 2. Various Logging Directive
Values</a></p><p>As such, typical lines to add specifics about logging may
look like those listed below. For a service that successfully
connects, we usually want to log the process ID of the service
spawned, the host that connected and when it exited:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
log_on_success  = PID HOST EXIT
</pre><p>This will give us useful information for debugging and
minding normal server operations. For failures, we log what we
would expect:
<pre     class="programlisting">
log_on_failure  = HOST RECORD ATTEMPT
</pre>


Here we log the host that connected, the reason the connection was
denied and additional information about the connecting host
(sometimes the user ID that attempted to connect). These are
recommended baselines to give you a good view of your server.
</p><p>Recall that above, in our defaults section, we were logging
to /var/adm/servicelog. We have directed all the information, both
failures and successes, to be logged by xinetd. Most of our
information will look like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
00/9/13@16:05:07: START: pop3 pid=25679 from=192.168.152.133
00/9/13@16:05:09: EXIT: pop3 status=0 pid=25679
00/10/3@19:28:18: USERID: telnet OTHER :www
</pre><p>Using this information, it is easy to debug xinetd and normal
operations. It is also easy to spot security issues such as
connection attempts that you want to try to block. Simply grep for
&ldquo;FAIL&rdquo; in the logs, and these entries will stand right out:
<pre     class="programlisting">
00/10/4@17:04:58: FAIL: telnet address from=216.237.57.154
00/10/8@22:25:09: FAIL: pop2 address from=202.112.14.184
</pre>


Acting on security issues requires another article, but, suffice it
to say, don't take the address reported as solid information, since
it can be forged.
</p><p>The xinetd.log file, by contrast, contains information from
xinetd. This can be useful in debugging connections that give
errors.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
00/10/25@21:10:48 xinetd[50]: ERROR: service echo-stream,
accept:
Connection reset by peer
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x138f580.0x1880f60"></a>Reconfiguring xinetd</h2></div></div><p>You can edit the xinetd.conf file while xinetd is running. To
get it to reconfigure, send the signal SIGUSR1 to the xinetd
process:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# ps -ax | grep xinetd
   50  ?  S    5:47 /usr/sbin/xinetd -filelog /var/adm/xinetd.log -f /etc/xinetd.conf
# kill -SIGUSR1 50
</pre><p>Tail the -filelog you are using to make sure that it
restarted and adjusted the changes you made. Definitely do this
before you log out and make sure you can log back in if this is a
remote connection.
</p><p>Note that using -HUP, as one does for inetd to reconfigure
it, will actually cause xinetd to cease operation. This is, by
design, to thwart hackers who reconfigure your xinetd and attempt
to reload it without understanding the documentation.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x138f580.0x1881170"></a>When to Use xinetd</h2></div></div><p>Personally, I use xinetd for almost all of my services; the
only one that sees a significant performance hit is my web
d&aelig;mon Apache. Too many processes have to start too fast for
it to be time efficient. DNS services should also
<span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> be loaded into xinetd; the performance hit
is too large.</p><p>I do, however, run sendmail out of xinetd, allowing
fine-grained control over who can connect. My configuration for
sendmail looks like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
service smtp
{
        socket_type   = stream
        protocol      = tcp
        wait          = no
        user          = root
        server        = /usr/sbin/sendmail
        server_args   = -bs
        instances     = 20
        nice          = 10
        only_from     += 0.0.0.0
        no_access     += 129.22.122.84 204.0.224.254
}
</pre><p>Even on a high-traffic mail server the performance hit is
negligible. I have also loaded sshd into xinetd to prevent a
process table attack on it.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x138f580.0x18813d8"></a>Conclusions</h2></div></div><p>I hope this article has been helpful to you in getting xinetd
configured and tweaked for your needs. As you can see, the features
it offers are tremendously more than inetd, even with tcp_wrappers
in place. Solar Designer
(<a href="http://www.openwall.com" target="_self">http://www.openwall.com/</a>)
has a patch available for a slightly older version of xinetd,
version 2.2.1, that allows for instance control on a per IP basis,
which helps stop simple process table attacks. Note, however, that
simple forgery can get around this. I do not know if this patch has
been applied to later versions of xinetd or if it can be.</p></div></div>
