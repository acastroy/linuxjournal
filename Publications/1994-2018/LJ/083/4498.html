    Number one requirement of the successful consultant: do what you
    love.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x131a580.0x14123a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>There are many means by which we choose
to measure what is success. In my early days of computer-industry
consulting, I was happy and successful because I was independent,
busy and doing what I enjoyed. My primary goal was to make a living
as a computer engineer and not work for a defense company. Although
the economy was slow, I was successful because of a simple
principle I have always stuck with: do what you love.
</p><p>However, as time went on my success had limits. In the early
days, I was a &ldquo;body for hire&rdquo;. I went from job to job, and when I
had some free time I did my &ldquo;administrative work&rdquo;. The not-so-fun
paperwork, billings, etc., always came last and, even then, only
when I was forced. This model was cool but not very scalable. My
priorities began to change, and my need for a more stable, steady
income stream became apparent. I had to start exploring the more
advanced consulting model.</p><p>When I examined my operation I found that life was good when
I was doing my thing for the customers. My pain was in between
jobs, when I had to collect bills and actively market my skills in
the ever-present search for that lucrative, long-term and very cool
gig. In business terms, I was at the sawtooth growth point for
which the current mode of operation required additional investment
for continued growth. I had the choice of hiring some help or
hooking up with some outfit that would feed me leads; in return I
would &ldquo;fill out&rdquo; their service offerings. My new expanded
operating model evolved into two cool gigs. I hooked up with a
small company hocking computers, Advance Engineering Labs, and I
sold &ldquo;solutions&rdquo;. The solution lead to the sale of hardware. I
got paid for designing and implementing the solution that solved a
business problem for AEL's customers, and AEL got paid for the sale
of the hardware. Together we offered complete solutions and a
single point of contact for the customer. This arrangement worked
out quite well, and we were fairly unique in the early days of
desktop-computing environments.</p><p>Part two of my mode of operations was part-time teaching of
digital-design engineering at Heald College. I also credit my
teaching time as excellent presentation training&mdash;a valued skill as
we move up the ladder in the consulting world. Once again I felt I
was the &ldquo;successful&rdquo; consultant.</p><p>However, as my customers grew, so did their needs and their
level of engineering complexity. The increase in demand forced me
to give up teaching and concentrate full-time on the consultative
role I performed.</p><p>Item number two of requirements for successful consulting:
continuing education, both formal and informal via industry
seminars and trade rags.</p><p>The shelf life of consultants that do not continue to update
their education is about the same as a cup of yogurt. I cannot
express the importance of continued education. As consulting gigs
grow in size and sophistication so must your resum&eacute;.
Customers want to know how you keep up as well as what you have
done.</p><p>Item number three: a highly referenceable, in depth library
of information available at one's fingertips.</p><p>As my number of consulting gigs increased I began to amass
quite a collection of programs, diagrams, documents, tools and
experience. Reinventing the same stuff is a sin. The independent
consultant with any hope of being self-supporting must have an
organized library of information available at a moment's notice. As
the consulting gigs grow in complexity so must your ability to
communicate complex solutions in nontechnical ways. A solid library
of information, processes, techniques, programs and tools can
&ldquo;jump-start&rdquo; a consulting engagement, and develop confidence
between you and the customer. Every customer likes to know they are
getting their money's worth.</p><p>Item number four of the successful consultant: require an
assessment. Deliver a fair, honest, objective assessment to your
customer.</p><p>If we are to be more than a &ldquo;body for hire&rdquo;, then we need
to be part sales, psychologist, engineer, accountant, business
person and so on. We must understand clearly the needs of the
customer, the problems they are toiling with and the urgency of
their situation. The best way to gain the confidence of the
customer is through a proven-tested-assessment process designed to
clarify and articulate the customer's need. In other words, before
you jump in with your &ldquo;solution offering&rdquo; you must assure the
client you are completely aware of their &ldquo;unique&rdquo; and special
situation. Insist on an assessment! This can be as simple as
looking at the code and as complex as documenting and diagramming
the customer's entire business process. The final product of an
assessment should be impartial in nature and of value to the
customer. The successful consultant does not go into an engagement
blind. We would be doing the customer a huge disservice if we did
not carefully assess the situation, report our findings, and then
collectively design a solution. If we maintain an objective
approach, and if we are as complete as possible, the assessment
should be of value to the customer and, therefore, a paid
engagement. All our customers are offered a &ldquo;free&rdquo; assessment by
the other guys. There are no free lunches! Your customers will get
what they pay for, and almost all of the them will know this. If
they do not, you may want to rethink the engagement. People not
willing to do their homework most often are not satisfied with the
final results.</p><p>Item number five for successful consulting: finish
big.</p><p>Let's say you are a consultant doing what you love,
continuing your education, amassing your library and performing
valuable assessments. What is next? Do the work right? Actually,
performing the work is the easy part as long as it is something you
love. The next most important thing you can do to maintain your
success as a consultant is to &ldquo;finish big&rdquo;. Boxers may get away
with poor training, starting slow and performing poorly for nine
rounds, but if they knock out the opponent in the tenth they win.
On the other hand, if the boxer trains well, studies his opponent,
and kicks butt for nine rounds but drops his guard for one second
in the tenth and gets knocked out, then he is remembered as a
loser. The same goes for the consultant. Maintain your presence and
build your business through references and repeat business, and
then give your customers something to remember you with. Do a final
presentation of your work, summarize your accomplishments
throughout the engagement, present your final report and include a
copy of all the kudos the client wrote to you while you were
engaged. Do whatever you can to finish big. It is your last and
best chance to build more business out of a successful consulting
engagement. Even if the engagement was not successful, a final
presentation of the project, your work and the issues is viewed as
a professional thing to do and will often get you a second
chance.</p></div></div>
