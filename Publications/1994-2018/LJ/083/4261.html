    belong to, or are considering starting, a one-person or small consulting

    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b10580.0x1c081e8"></a></h2></div></div><p>This month's feature section is devoted
to a less technical subject&mdash;consulting. The articles are addressed
both to those who belong to, or are considering starting, a
one-person or small consulting business, and those looking to hire
a consultant. As the use of Linux proliferates it presents a
potential hotbed of opportunity for those Linux professionals with
the skills to sell their experience.
</p><p>December's issue on system administration mentioned the
frustrations of being locked into a working relationship with
nontechnical people. Consulting, however, involves the potential
frustration of not being in a working relationship with anyone at
all and the possibility of calling it quits and going back to work
for &ldquo;the man&rdquo;. On the other hand, being self-employed has its
advantages, not the least of which is freedom and
flexibility.</p><p>A consultant is a bit of a mercenary (Doc, forgive the
bellicose metaphor), a knight errant or a &ldquo;Have gun, will travel&rdquo;
whose metaphorical gun is experience and ideas. For those attracted
by this romantic ideal (and even the disillusioned who work best on
their own) becoming a Linux consultant might offer the chance to do
what you love and get paid for it. Marty Larsen is a long, time
big-time consultant and currently VP of consulting operations for
VA Linux Systems, and &ldquo;Do what you love&rdquo; is the first item of his
article in which he explains five requirements for the successful
consultant.</p><p>Part of the value of an outside consultant is that they
provide a fresh perspective to solving a company's problems.
Consider two examples from literature. Shakespeare's Polonius,
&ldquo;consultant&rdquo; to the Danish king in <span   class="emphasis"><em>Hamlet</em></span>,
is definitely part of what is rotten and stagnant in Denmark. His
entrenchment in his position blinds him, and his councils are
nothing more than worthless platitudes. He and those he consults
end up dead (hey, it's a tragedy). On the other hand, Joseph of
colorful-coat fame gets sold into Egypt with a novel outlook,
coming from a different land, different culture and a different
god. He starts out small (consulting fellow prisoners), gets one
good reference and in no time he's consulting the pharaoh and
practically ruling Egypt (of course, having the gift of prophecy
doesn't hurt).</p><p>Glen Otero, who runs his own small consulting firm, Linux
Prophet, points out that while Linux, being &ldquo;a fresh
perspective&rdquo;, may represent great opportunities for consulting,
one can't expect to get a job based solely on its merits, some of
which, while endearing to the Open Source community, count for very
little with many companies. Based on his experiences, Glen writes
that Linux is simply a tool, and a good consultant must know that
tool intimately enough to show exactly how it delivers the best
performance.</p><p>Joshua Drake, another independent entrepreneur, gives some
attention to the other side of the consulting equation&mdash;the client.
He reveals some important considerations in finding a good
consultant as well as some likely places to look.</p><p>While not found in the Feature section, but in its usual spot
of honor, Marcel Gagn&eacute;'s &ldquo;Cooking with Linux&rdquo; this month
deals with applications such as TimeSheet and BANAL that aid the
Linux consultant with those arduous tasks of time tracking and
bookkeeping. And don't forget to give Ralph Krause's review of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>The Computer Consultant's Guide</em></span>, 2nd Edition a
read.</p><p>&mdash;Richard Vernon, Editor in Chief</p></div></div>
