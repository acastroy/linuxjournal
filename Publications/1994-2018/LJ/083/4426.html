    Dennis provides a starting point for developers seeking
    solutions for their web application development requirements.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dca580.0x1ec2608"></a></h2></div></div><p>I was recently afforded the opportunity
to work with the internet department of a large medical publishing
firm located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The department assisted
the company's various marketing departments with regard to content
destined to be posted on the Internet as well as coordination of
scheduling and placement of content on the company's web site.
Ultimately the department served as a conduit between various
marketing and product management departments at sites in
Philadelphia, New York, Chicago and the Baltimore-based IT
department that physically housed the company's web servers.
</p><p>As a result of these activities, there were a great many
files finding their way into the department via a number of paths.
Most arrived by e-mail, some on diskette via interoffice mail and
some were uploaded directly to ftp servers in Baltimore. This
created a flurry of activity as the marketing staff and developers
in the department attempted to organize and coordinate a variety of
content. To add to the confusion, there were also numerous versions
of documents that were submitted due to last-minute changes made by
the supported departments. My task was to develop an interim
solution to reduce the confusion created by content submission
activity by organizing all the various content in one central
application. I attempted to do this by building a small web
application prototype that would serve to track each project's
title, manager, department, department code and cost accounting
code.</p><p>The application needed to be built quickly and cheaply
because constraints in the purchasing and tenuous acquisition
processes ruled out any new requisitions until the beginning of the
next fiscal quarter. It needed to run on standard PC equipment that
was readily available in the department. Technical support for the
application by experienced system administrators would be limited.
The applications needed to be light, fast, easy to use, stable and
easily maintained by the department's staff that approached web
development from a marketing, as opposed to technical, perspective.
Despite the fact that this was the Department of the Internet, the
focus of the department's activities was on content coordination.
The IT department administered the heavier-duty web servers and
telecommunications that were off-site.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dca580.0x1ec27c0"></a>Objective</h2></div></div><p>This document will relay the lessons learned from my
investigation into the software tools required and available for
building a rudimentary, dynamic internet application. Consideration
will be given to commercial and free software alike. We'll begin
with some definitions and background of the elements of a dynamic
web application and then continue on to a tour of some of the
available technologies. It is my intention that this article serve
as an informative starting point for developers and would-be
developers as they begin to seek solutions for their web
application development requirements.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dca580.0x1ec28c8"></a>What Is a Dynamic Web Site?</h2></div></div><p>Advanced web designers often use a scripting language called
JavaScript and a system of naming the parts of the web page&mdash;the
Document Object Model, or DOM&mdash;together with HTML and CSS to create
dynamic content on a page. These effects are sometimes called
Dynamic HTML or DHTML. I, however, am limiting the scope of this
project to building a web site that will generate dynamic content
by interacting with a database. I was not interested so much in
effects displayed to the user but in focusing on building an
intuitive web application. The project scripts will be executed at
the server, not at the client as occurs with JavaScript. The tools
and methods presented here will not limit the addition of
interactive or stylistic features to the application at a later
time.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dca580.0x1ec29d0"></a>What Is a Database?</h2></div></div><p>Data is defined as a general term meaning the facts, numbers,
letters and symbols processed by a computer or communications
system to produce information. In a computer system these items are
typically stored in files. A collection of related files is a
database. Within these files, records of items are organized into
rows and columns. In this case, I need something more sophisticated
than a simple collection of files.</p><p>The project requires a RDBMS, or Relational Database
Management System. An RDBMS is a software package that stores data
in rows and columns as tables. Various tables can be related to one
another in order to answer questions posed by the end user. These
questions are known as queries. The RDBMS is a concept first
introduced by Codd in an academic paper in 1970 but was not
commercially available until the mid 1970s. The RDBMS responds to
all queries whether they ask the RDBMS to retrieve, add, update or
delete data from the tables.</p><p>Sometimes the RDBMS that services a web site is called the
back end. The web pages that the end user will see is often called
the front end. Questions are posed to the back end using a language
called SQL (Structured Query Language). In short, if there is data
that needs to be processed, a DBMS of some kind is required. The
most popular at this time are Relational DBMS, that respond to
questions/commands via SQL.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dca580.0x1ec2b88"></a>Choosing a Database</h2></div></div><p>Oracle</p><p>One product that has become synonymous with the word database
is Oracle. Oracle
(<a href="http://www.oracle.com" target="_self">http://www.oracle.com/</a>)
is largely responsible for the current popularity of the relational
database. Over the years, its database server has become
justifiably respected for being full of features, fast and
reliable. Oracle is also supported on Linux, and it appears that
Oracle is committed to Linux as a platform.</p><p>However, there were two primary reasons not to use Oracle for
this project. First, the hardware requirements were well beyond the
capabilities of the machine used to develop and serve this
application. As a rule of thumb, 800MB of disk space is needed with
256MB of memory. Second, Oracle would have been too expensive an
alternative for an application of this size and temporary nature.
Even at the minimal licensing fee of five named users in perpetuity
for a single server the cost of using this software would have been
($160/user) $800.</p><p>MySQL</p><p>There are several open-source database options available to
developers. In conjunction with web sites, MySQL
(<a href="http://www.mysql.org" target="_self">http://www.mysql.org/</a>)
appears to be a very popular choice in the Linux community. MySQL
is a very fast, multithreaded, multiuser and robust SQL database
server. MySQL is now also open source and has recently formed a
strategic alliance with VA Linux Systems, a company that sells and
supports Linux-based computer systems. MySQL was first released to
the public in November 1996 and has always been available with
source code. MySQL has proven to be a lightning fast and reliable
database solution for a growing number of companies such as SGI,
ValueClick, Nortel/Insight, Tucows.com, Cisco and many more.</p><p>So it would seem that MySQL was more than up to the task of
the humble application described at the beginning of this document.
It is considered very fast with large record sets, and the MySQL
Manual reports production systems with upwards of 50,000,000
records. Further, there seems to be a growing relationship between
the team that develops MySQL and the team that develops PHP. The
increased popularity of this dynamic duo, coupled with boundless
enthusiasm from core developers of both technologies, culminated in
a meeting of the minds in Israel earlier this year. This resulted
in the MySQL library being packaged with the PHP 4.0 distribution,
in addition to an agreement to help each other improve the
performance quality of product integration whenever the opportunity
arises.</p><p>However, MySQL does have some shortcomings. One of these
shortcomings is in the area of transactions. Tim Kientzle
eloquently and succinctly discusses transactions in his July
article written for <span   class="emphasis"><em>Dr. Dobb's Journal</em></span>:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>A transaction is a set of related changes to a
database. The SQL standard specifies that an entire group of
updates can be issued to the database and then either committed or
rolled back as a unit. This lets you, for example, transfer money
between accounts stored in different database tables by adding the
money to one account and then trying to subtract it from another;
if the second update fails, you can undo all of the changes at
once.</p></blockquote></div><p>While lack of transaction support will not immediately be an
issue in our application, the threat of &ldquo;feature creep&rdquo;, even in
an application of this nature, compelled me to seek an alternative
system that does support transactions. Further, MySQL has only
limited support for foreign keys. The foreign key is an important
concept of the relational model. It is the way relationships are
represented and can be thought of as the glue that holds a set of
tables together to form a relational database. Another area where I
found MySQL to be wanting was in subqueries that it does not
support. A subquery occurs when a developer nests one SQL statement
within another SQL statement. Again, while my application is small
and likely would not run into too much difficulty with MySQL's
support of foreign keys, subqueries and transactions, it was still
another needling in the direction of an alternate RDBM.
</p><p>PostgreSQL</p><p>Some of the concerns that I had with MySQL seemed to be
addressed by the team developing PostgreSQL
(<a href="http://www.postgresql.org" target="_self">http://www.postgresql.org/</a>).
The version of PostgreSQL that ships with Red Hat 6.2 is version
6.5.3. This version already had support for transactions and
subqueries, but it did <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> have extensive
support foreign keys. However, the PostgreSQL team had recently
released version 7.0.2 of the database that does support
subqueries.</p><p>The PostgreSQL FAQ reports that PostgreSQL has most of the
features present in large commercial DBMSs, like transactions,
subselects, triggers, views and sophisticated locking. It has some
features that other databases do not have, like user-defined types,
inheritance, rules and multiversion concurrency control to reduce
lock contention. But this functionality seems to be at the expense
of the speed afforded MySQL. In comparison to MySQL or leaner
database systems, PostgreSQL is slower on inserts and updates
because it has transaction overhead.</p><p>Similarly to MySQL and in great contrast to Oracle, the
minimum system requirements of PostgreSQL are light. The PostgreSQL
administrator's guide reports that although the minimum required
memory for running PostgreSQL can be as little as 8MB, there are
noticeable speed improvements when expanding memory up to 96MB or
beyond. The rule is you can never have too much memory.</p><p>Check that you have sufficient disk space. You will need
about 30MB for the source tree during compilation and about 5MB for
the installation directory. An empty database takes about 1MB,
otherwise it takes about five times the amount of space that a flat
text file with the same data would take. If you run the regression
tests you will temporarily need an extra 20MB.</p><p>The machine I used easily meets these system requirements. I
don't expect the drop in speed to be an issue. I'm satisfied that
PostgreSQL addresses my concerns regarding MySQL and Oracle. I
decided to use PostgreSQL for this project.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dca580.0x1ec3370"></a>Choosing a Scripting Language</h2></div></div><p>As with database software there are many scripting languages
available for the Linux platform. Several are appropriate for use
as a server-side scripting language in a dynamic web application.
The purpose of the server-side scripting language is to tie
together the user interface presented to the user, which here will
be written in HTML and accessed via a web browser, and the back end
of the application or server system and database used by the
application.</p><p>ColdFusion</p><p>One commercial product considered as an option was ColdFusion
from Allaire
(<a href="http://www.allaire.com" target="_self">www.allaire.com</a>).
The Allaire product is widely used, and the server portion of the
environment is available and fully supported for Linux platforms as
well as on Windows NT. Allaire also offers a very nice development
environment as part of this package called ColdFusion Studio that
requires either the Windows 9x or NT platform to run. Both
components are available via download for a period of evaluation or
purchase from the Allaire web site.</p><p>The components of the ColdFusion package were built to
support the ColdFusion Markup Language (CFML). CFML has a syntax
that is similar to HTML in that there are opening and closing tags
that provide functionality beyond normal HTML. These specialized
tags intermingle or are embedded in the HTML application or page.
The ColdFusion server works with the web server to intercept these
special tags to allow for interaction with the database and server
providing the back end of the application.</p><p>The impressions that I carry of this product and environment
are very positive. It seems to be a very capable platform that is
easy to set up and use. There also appears to be a large group of
web-site developers using this program. I believe that casual
interactions with colleagues are often very helpful when becoming
familiar with a new language or software product. The similarities
of the CFML to HTML would also make it easy for a novice to be up
and running quickly. Additionally, ColdFusion works with Apache,
another check in its plus column.</p><p>Drawbacks are, however, that the system requirement for the
Linux version of the ColdFusion server, 512MB of RAM, is beyond the
capabilities of the system that I have available for this
application. The July 17, 2000 price list posted on the Allaire
site reports a price tag of $1295 US for the ColdFusion Server 4.5
Professional for Linux. The Windows-based development environment
will run another $495.00. If the budget for your application can
absorb the licensing cost of ColdFusion, it deserves
consideration.</p><p>Perl</p><p>In the Linux community Perl carries about as much respect as
any programming language deserves to expect. It seems that beyond
its use as a web-scripting language there is little that Perl
cannot handle. Written by Larry Wall, open-source Perl was first
released in 1987. Perl's latest version released this past March is
version 5.6 and is available from
<a href="http://www.perl.org" target="_self">http://www.perl.org/</a>.</p><p>Perl is a very mature and viable alternative as a
web-scripting language. There is a large developer community and a
great deal of support available. It can be tightly integrated with
the Apache web server and is available with most, if not all, Linux
distributions. However, what I was hoping to find was a simpler
solution for attaching my web pages to a database back end. Just
because Perl is the most obvious solution didn't necessarily mean
that is was the right solution. The simplicity criteria weighed
heavily in my decision to examine ColdFusion and partially ruled
out Perl in this case. I wanted to get my application up and
running quickly with as small a learning curve as possible.</p><p>PHP</p><p>PHP
(<a href="http://www.php.net" target="_self">http://www.php.net/</a>) is an
open-source, HTML-embedded scripting language. Unlike Perl, which
was born as a tool to assist in system administration, PHP was
designed from the ground up to work with web pages. It seems to
borrow from many programming languages that have preceded PHP,
including Perl and C. The PHP FAQ discusses the differences between
PHP and Perl:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>The biggest advantage of PHP over Perl is that
PHP was designed for scripting for the Web, where Perl was designed
to do a lot more, and because of this, can get very complicated.
The flexibility/complexity of Perl makes it easier to write code
that another author/coder has a hard time reading. PHP has a less
confusing and stricter format without losing flexibility. PHP is
easier to integrate into existing HTML than Perl. PHP has pretty
much all the &ldquo;good&rdquo; functionality of Perl: constructs, syntax and
so on, without making it as complicated as Perl can be. Perl is a
very tried and true language; it has been around since the late
eighties. But PHP is maturing very quickly
(<a href="http://www.php.net/FAQ.php#9.4" target="_self">www.php.net/FAQ.php#9.4</a>).</p></blockquote></div><p>From this discussion it would seem that PHP would be a good
fit for the application I was building. There has also been some
discussion as to how PHP compares with ColdFusion. The PHP FAQ
gives a good summary but also points to a comparison of the two
packages laid out by Mike Sheldon. Mike's comparison
(<a href="http://marc.theaimsgroup.com" target="_self">http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/</a>)
appears even handed. He points out some strengths and functionality
of ColdFusion that I had not considered. One of the most
interesting is an abstraction layer to database interaction. In
ColdFusion, the developer uses the ColdFusion administrator to set
up a data source. Whether the source is Oracle or an ODBC
connection is inconsequential with regards to the CMFL tag used to
interact with the source. In PHP, each database that we may want to
use has a set of functions that are specific to the chosen
database. Mike also points out that ColdFusion is bundled with a
search engine called Verity. PHP has no bundled search engine and
does not have an integrated development environment.
</p><p>Two areas I was surprised to hear that PHP had weaknesses in
were that of error handling and the ability to handle dates.
Because of the simple nature of this application, I don't see
either of these weaknesses becoming a problem. I only intend to use
one database, and there is a function set for each database under
consideration for this application. I don't see the data
abstraction offered by ColdFusion as being a bonus. In the final
analysis, I selected four primary components for this application:
GNU/Linux operating system, PostgreSQL RDBMS, PHP server-side
web-scripting language facilities and the Apache web server.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dca580.0x1ec3b00"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>There are a myriad of software options available for the
Linux operating system. The alternatives all have strengths and
weakness that arise from the software's efforts to serve a
particular primary need. I would recommend that those interested in
deploying one of these software packages use a reasoned approach in
determining which package best suits their needs. The value of
developers and consultants is only partially derived from their
mastery of a particular technology. The understanding of the
particular processes by which they hope to influence their
deployment of an information-technology solution should be of
primary concern. Because there are many high-quality alternatives
available to address a given information-technology challenge, it
is the technologist's ability to grasp and deal with the key issues
of the project in question that will ultimately determine of its
success or failure.</p><p>For my project, the combination of Linux, Apache, PostgreSQL
and PHP was appropriate. This combination will likely not be
appropriate for all projects. However, I hope that you find this
article an informative first step in your investigation of
alternatives for your next project.</p><p><a href="4426s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
