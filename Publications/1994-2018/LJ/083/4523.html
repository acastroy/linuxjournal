and 3-D. <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Blender Book</em></span> by Carsten Wartmann
deals with the latter. Blender is a free, Linux-based 3-D program,
that has gained a fairly rich following with Linux users.
Wartmann's book is currently unique in that it is the only book to
date dealing with the topic of teaching Blender to the rest of us.
Therefore, it would be unfair to class his book as &ldquo;best of
breed&rdquo; alongside other books available on the same topic,
nevertheless it warrants a good review by virtue of its strength of
content.</p><p>That said, the book itself sets a path to take the reader on
a topical, hands-on journey through the various aspects of
Blender's features. &ldquo;Features&rdquo; means two things here: those that
are specific to Blender as a program, and those that are specific
to 3-D modeling. This is to give fair warning to the potential
reader. Wartmann is not shy about displaying his technical literacy
regarding the details of the 3-D world (i.e., he doesn't water down
the language to make the book more palatable to the casual reader).
What he has set forth in writing is a willingness to give us a
straight, no-nonsense approach for understanding 3-D in general,
and then to go about the business of using Blender to render our
work.</p><p>With regard to the book itself, one of the more virtuous
aspects is its self-containment. The book comes with a CD-ROM that
has the latest version of Blender (version 1.8 upon publication), a
copy of Python (for scripting) and a substantial number of files
that the reader may bring into Blender and view in all their
detail. What is more, Wartmann has included all the necessary
graphics to compose the lessons for each chapter and has rendered
all the motion 3-D lessons as *.avi movies for the reader to
capture the essence of each lesson before getting started. Very
nice, indeed.</p><p>The content of the book does not assume that the reader has a
knowledge of 3-D, so the author begins with explaining the world of
3-D rendering by covering the basics that will be necessary for
doing the tutorials throughout the remainder of the book. What I
found most intriguing is Wartmann's ability to describe the huge
arena of 3-D and reduce it in manageable chunks so that readers get
sufficient detail, all the while not finding themselves bogged down
with information overkill. Wartmann, therefore, is consistent with
his intent for writing his material: to give the reader an adequate
understanding of both 3-D rendering and the use of Blender in &ldquo;a
fast, practical, and compact introduction to the world of 3-D
graphics and animation...&rdquo; (page 2)</p><p>Those who do have a knowledge of 3-D rendering will
appreciate the book for its hands-on approach to understanding the
interface and functionality of Blender as a program. Blender is not
Maya or 3-D Studio Max. It is a coming-of-age program that is
continuing to be developed under the company, Not a Number. That
said, Blender most assuredly has its own way of creating 3-D
graphics, in that its interface is quite different from that which
other, more commercially prolific, 3-D programs offer as standard.
Wartmann shines as an author because he keeps the knowledgeable
student interacting with Blender's unique interface by virtue of
keeping his detailed analysis of 3-D rendering specific to Blender,
as well as keeping us abreast of where we are in the program with
plenty of screenshots in order not to lose sight of the program's
interface while following his prescriptions.</p><p>Without exhausting the book's content here, it can be said
that Wartmann does a good job at covering the basics for 3-D
modeling and rendering. From understanding simple shapes (bezier
curves, NURBS, text and metaballs) to creating realistic animations
via Inverse Kinematics (IK) and radiosity, the author breaks these
concepts down into chapters and subsections, conquering each topic
with a hands-on tutorial. Once we get past the introduction to 3-D
and Blender's interface and terminology, our task for interacting
with the book is create, create, create.</p><p>For example, Chapter Five starts with creating primitives
(simple shapes: spheres, cylinders, etc.), moves us forward by
understanding the math behind it and how to implement the math to
fine-tune a primitive via the controls of Blender's interface, then
adds the issues of rotating, smoothing, extruding and warping a
given primitive. Once those basics are covered, it's on to creating
a mountain terrain, or landscape. Add to this a texture fill and a
little tweaking with curve (bezier) editing, and we have a finished
project before us. What is most effective about Wartmann's approach
is, while doing the tutorial, he is constantly revisiting and/or
adding 3-D concepts to our learning curve while introducing the
tools at hand. This helps the reader to stay in the world of 3-D
modeling and all its aspects without sacrificing the forward
movement of creating the content itself.</p><p>Here's a specific example of what the reader can expect from
Wartmann's book. NURBS are as common in 3-D rendering as is a line
in vector illustration. But the author makes no assumptions.
Therefore, when introducing the use of NURBS, he shows us his cards
straight up: &ldquo;NURBS (Non Uniform Rational B-Spline) curves are
three-dimensional curves represented by a class of equations
defined by nonuniform parametric ratios of B-Spline polynomials.
(That's probably more than you wanted to know, but there you have
it.)&rdquo; (page 83). Right. From there, he moves on to how this is
translated via Blender's interface and then moves us into creating
a simple NURB curve. The amount of material to cover all this? Two
pages. The point to be made here is, although Wartmann is terse in
some of his explanations, it is not at the sacrifice of the
reader's need to understand the context by which he is creating 3-D
images/animation from within Blender. The author covers all his
bases within a reasonably short amount of space.</p><p>The last sentence above is one of the very few issues I have
with the book itself. It's too small! 3-D is a healthy topic all by
itself and using Blender is no small feat. At first blush, opening
the program is to become a little overwhelmed by its sheer girth of
functionality. Although Wartmann concedes that his book does not
exhaust every aspect of Blender's power, I certainly would have
liked him to give it a try! Nevertheless, what he does do is give
the reader a sufficient amount of detail to have us up and running
with the basic concepts of 3-D rendering from within Blender in
both its complexity and flexibility.</p><p>Those who are new to 3-D and want an excellent (and free!)
program by which to indulge their curiosity will appreciate having
this book to get them quickly up to speed with Blender. Others, who
are already familiar with the concepts of 3-D imaging, will not be
disappointed by the approach of Wartmann's book because its main
concern is to familiarize the reader with using the unique angle
with which Blender creates 3-D images/animation.</p></div></div>
