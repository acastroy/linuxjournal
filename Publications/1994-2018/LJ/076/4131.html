    From resellers to solution providers, today's VARs are bringing Linux
    solutions to the world of application service.
    &ldquo;It was the best of times. It was the worst of times.&rdquo; --Charles Dickens
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21d0580.0x22c86b8"></a></h2></div></div><p>The above is a statement well-known
throughout literature and throughout evolving societies. In this
ever-changing, pervasive Internet society, such times are felt in
all aspects of business. The Internet has shifted the power of
presence and acquisition and is beginning to shift the power of
commerce. Many value-added resellers (VARs) have recognized this
shift and have been able to change with the new economy. They are
deploying solutions that take advantage of this new market, a
market that provides more margins in service than in products. Now
and in the future, service margins will be &ldquo;king&rdquo;.
</p><p>In fact, VARs are suggesting that their business is not even
associated with the process of being a &ldquo;reseller&rdquo; of products,
but a seller of services. These services include messaging,
commerce, maintenance, support, software and hardware leasing to
name a few. Quoting Scott McNealy of Sun Microsystems,</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Five years from now, if you're a CIO with a head
for business, you won't be buying computers anymore. You won't buy
software either. You'll rent all your resources from a service
provider.</p></blockquote></div><p>Many of the services can be made available because of the
Internet and the low costs associated with its pervasive presence.
Titles such as Internet Integrators, e-Solution Providers (eSP),
e-Business Integrators and Application Service Providers (ASP) are
now being declared throughout the channel. While the ASP market
will continue to define itself, the one thing projected among all
analysts is that this market is going to explode over the next two
to five years. Analysts such as IDC project the ASP market to be in
excess of eight billion dollars, while Dataquest put this market in
excess of 20 billion dollars during the same time period. However,
the solutions these providers offer must allow customers to take
advantage of ever-increasing Internet services that can be
customized and based on a scalable and stable platform.
</p><p>In addition, Linux is causing another market shift. Linux is
being seen as a real business solution and is one of the
fastest-growing server solutions in the industry. Examples of these
solutions are being found in all sizes of corporations. The market
conditions required for Linux to succeed are coming into focus.
Some of these market conditions include industry leaders porting
their software packages to Linux, hardware vendors' platforms being
&ldquo;certified&rdquo; on Linux, Microsoft being declared a monopoly, users
seeking viable software alternatives that do not crash and those
who want to take advantage of the Internet's pervasive presence.
Those solution providers who adapt their business models to provide
such services and solutions will tap into a multi-billion-dollar
market.</p><p>By combining customizable, extremely reliable and stable
Linux-based solutions with the exploding ASP market, opportunities
of service and product revenue abound for serving the largest to
the smallest corporation. In a recent survey conducted among VARs,
one-third stated they already support some type of Linux solution,
while one-quarter will utilize Linux to deliver e-business
solutions via the Internet. In other words, solution providers must
recognize that they need to &ldquo;deliver E or be Eaten&rdquo;; Linux is a
platform which can deliver the &ldquo;E&rdquo;.</p><p>A question that solution providers constantly ask about the
Linux model is, &ldquo;How do I make money?&rdquo;. The answer is the same
whether the operating system is proprietary or open&mdash;sell
solutions, not simply a software package! However, Linux solutions
are generally open for customization, are extremely stable and are
low-cost by nature. Because of these qualities, service margins are
increased. Linux was created on the Internet, by the Internet, for
the Internet, and is optimized to work in this environment
remotely. With such benefits, solution providers do not need to
make on-site visits for service offerings such as configuration,
deployment, diagnostics or administration.</p><p>As many solution providers begin to realize they can take
advantage of Linux-based solutions, analysts and others are
predicting revenue opportunities in the Linux traditional and
specialized server markets.</p><p>A Dataquest study suggests that Linux servers will
&ldquo;represent approximately 3.4 percent of traditional server revenue
or $1.9 billion ... by 2003.&rdquo; Recently in Caldera Systems' &ldquo;Tell
All and Win Solutions&rdquo; contest, some of Caldera's e-Solution
Providers (eSPs) described how they deployed OpenLinux as a
traditional server by completely replacing NT servers. Some eSPs
leverage OpenLinux by providing add-on solutions. For example, one
client needed to upgrade to NT from NetWare 4.11 and ran low on
disk space. Unfortunately, the client could not afford to add disks
to the NT server, so they utilized their old NetWare server,
OpenLinux 2.3 and Samba to create a software repository to solve
the problem. Other providers utilize Linux as an Intel UNIX
alternative and re-deploy their Intel UNIX applications for their
clients.</p><p>Quoting from the same study regarding server appliances,
&ldquo;Dataquest believes that Linux servers will represent
approximately 24 percent of server appliance revenue, or $3.8
billion... by 2003 ... The key trend is optimization and it is
occurring on the software side and the hardware side.&rdquo; As the
Server Product Matrix in the study indicates, optimization will be
critical for those servers in the future. Having open-source
software allows for optimization.</p><p>These server appliances, or &ldquo;specialized servers&rdquo; as they
may be called, will be deployed by solution providers and ASPs.
Examples of these solutions from eSPs include Internet servers,
file servers and backup servers, to name a few. The reason? These
low-cost, specialized servers allow a client to continue using
their existing hardware while increasing functionality. In
addition, the cost to deploy such servers is minimal.</p><p>As for Linux client solutions, many eSPs are utilizing
OpenLinux Desktop for Internet access devices. For example, one eSP
utilizes OpenLinux Desktop in a library setting to provide kiosk
security that was cost-prohibitive utilizing Microsoft Windows.
Through OpenLinux Desktop, the eSP was able to provide a web
browser on the desktop that offered Internet access and access to
CD-ROMs available from the library. Another client solution
involved leveraging OpenLinux and Sun products for creating
&ldquo;powerful solutions&rdquo; for Java programs.</p><p>The solutions mentioned above solved real-life problems. The
solutions were not cost prohibitive, but actually reduced short-
and long-term costs to the customer while increasing margins to the
solution provider. It is not a matter of &ldquo;if&rdquo; solution providers
will be providing Linux-based solutions, but &ldquo;when&rdquo;.</p><p>While the Internet is creating the &ldquo;new economy&rdquo;, Linux is
enabling customers to experience it. Some customers receive these
solutions by having solution providers deploy them in-house, while
others are leveraging the ASP model.</p><p>Indeed the times continue to change. For those prepared to
accept the opportunities by integrating Linux into solutions, it
will be the best of times. For those who continue to hold on to the
old paradigm and refuse to embrace new opportunities, it will be
the worst of times.</p></div></div>
