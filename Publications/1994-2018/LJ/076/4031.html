has made on-line storage, print service and IP addressing critical
issues for many installations. Enter Linksys with a Red Hat
Linux-based solution, the EtherFast Instant GigaDrive. This product
provides 20GB of instant storage to your Linux or &ldquo;other
operating&rdquo; system LAN without the hassle of adding a keyboard,
monitor or mouse.
</p><p>Linksys has been a Linux-friendly hardware manufacturer for a
long time. Most network-savvy Linux users know that Linksys was the
first company to list Linux as a supported operating system on the
outside of its networking products' boxes.</p><p>I recently spent the afternoon playing with this new network
toy from the Irvine, California-based company. The GigaDrive is one
of those new breed of small network storage boxes you plug in to a
hub on your LAN, turn on, web administer, use&mdash;and fall in love
with.</p><p>Hooking up this compact device to your network is a snap. In
this review, I will cover some of the basics and features of this
new, first-generation, Linux-based networking product.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ff1580.0x20e9ad8"></a>Specifications</h2></div></div><p>The box weighs five pounds, measures 8'' wide, 11'' long and
3'' high and includes a parallel port and an RJ45 jack. A small
switch is used on the back when you connect the GigaDrive to a LAN
hub or directly to a PC. Indicator LEDs on the front show remaining
hard-drive capacity, power, status, hard-drive activity, NIC
activity and whether DHCP service is being used.</p><p>The GigaDrive is basically a single-board, 45.26 BogoMIPS
Pentium computer with (contrary to earlier reports on the Internet)
only 16MB RAM, and a spacious 20GB drive running Red Hat Linux
2.0.36. The file system is installed on a 154MB root file system,
and a 33MB swap partition is configured as a separate partition.
The rest of the 20GB drive is devoted to a Linux EXT2 native file
system, leaving nearly the entire drive available for storage of
your LAN's or users' data.</p><p>When in use, several megabytes of memory remain free, as the
majority of memory is used by normal Linux processes, such as the
LDP printer d&aelig;mon, Apache, the AppleTalk
<span   class="bold"><b>atalkd</b></span> d&aelig;mon and Samba's
<span   class="bold"><b>smbd</b></span> d&aelig;mon. The default swap
partition should be barely (if at all) used under load.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ff1580.0x20e9d40"></a>Configuration</h2></div></div><p>A small, 30-page manual, Windows NT install disk and CD-ROM
for Windows-based installation are included. The machine is
initially configured by running, of all things, a Windows-based
setup and configuration program. Why support for Linux-based
configuration and installation is not included is beyond me. A
convenient Win client provides initial setup, such as IP assignment
and setting of the date and time.</p><p>Linksys has prepared this device as a hands-off Linux system.
This means that (supposedly) your only interaction with the
GigaDrive is meant to be through a Netscape web page. After
connecting the unit to your LAN, pressing the power button and
waiting a few minutes, you can set the GigaDrive's server name (I
called mine &ldquo;gigi&rdquo;), system date and time, IP address, Windows
workgroup name and AppleTalk zone.</p><p>You can also configure the GigaDrive as a DHCP server, in
which case you'll need to specify a range of valid IP addresses.
The GigaDrive can also be configured to obtain its IP addresses
from another server.</p><p>After assigning an administrative password, I could manage
the GigaDrive remotely, using a URL like this:</p><p><a href="http://gigi/CGI_main/index.htm" target="_self">gigi/CGI_main/index.htm</a></p><p>Alternatively, you can specify the GigaDrive's default IP
address and jump right in to remote configuration. Once you
connect, a Javascript runs that changes your Netscape window and
presents a setup dialog. Once the unit is configured, you'll need
to use a login dialog, and then you'll see a connect window, as
shown in Figure 1.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4031f1.large.jpg"><img src="4031f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1. Connect Window</p></div></div>
</p><p>The Connect window lists the GigaDrive, presents information
on your unit and offers an Administer button. Click this button to
administer the GigaDrive, and you'll see a dialog with numerous
buttons to configure the system and administer users or shares on
the drive, as shown in Figure 2.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4031f2.large.jpg"><img src="4031f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 2.</p></div></div>
</p><p>The configuration buttons provide changes to networking, the
system, utilities and status information. These are handy for
changing the IP address, setting network features (such as turning
DHCP on or off), adjusting date and time settings and
troubleshooting. The GigaDrive can even e-mail you if there's a
problem!</p><p>The storage management buttons allow you to browse the
visible or &ldquo;public&rdquo; portions of the GigaDrive's hard drive and
administer groups, shares and users. If you're new to Windows
networking, you'll want to read the GigaDrive manual for a quick
tip on how groups, shares and users are viewed by Samba, which
provides networking storage and printer sharing. Plug a printer
into the GigaDrive's parallel port, and you have an instant
networked printer and print server. Windows users will find the
GigaDrive and any attached printer under Network
Neighborhood.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ff1580.0x20ea580"></a>In Use</h2></div></div><p>Although I was initially disappointed that only Samba was
supported, I found that performing a Linux SMB mount was just as
easy as using NFS, if not easier. With the ability to mount your
remote share, there's really no reason to use FTP or another means
of file transfers.</p><p>Although one normally avoids creating SUID root programs, a
simple</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# chmod 4711 /usr/bin/smbmnt
# chmod 4711 /usr/bin/smbumount
</pre><p>will allow you to quickly and easily mount public shares
locally like this:
<pre     class="programlisting">
# smbmount //gigi/public backup
</pre>


After entering your password, you'll find all your public shares on
the GigaDrive files mounted locally (in this case, in the local
directory named &ldquo;backup&rdquo; from the GigaDrive named &ldquo;gigi&rdquo;).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ff1580.0x20ea7e8"></a>Hacking the GigaDrive</h2></div></div><p>I knew there had to be more to the GigaDrive besides a simple
web-based interface. Heck, I wanted to be able to use TELNET to log
in to the machine and peek around its insides, behind the facade of
CGI scripts. But I worried a little about what would happen if the
system became corrupted or a problem developed with the
GigaDrive.</p><p>I e-mailed Linksys tech support with some questions and
received a speedy reply, which shows good customer support.
According to Linksys technical support, if the GigaDrive &ldquo;crashes,
you would have to RMA it... at this time there are no restore disks
for the gigadrive to restore it yet.&rdquo;</p><p>This is quite interesting, because when I looked at the
Windows CD-ROM included with the GigaDrive, I found out that the CD
is actually a Red Hat Linux 2.0.36 install CD with a custom install
program to restore the GigaDrive's file system on a new
drive!</p><p>It took me about 20 minutes to figure out how to enable
TELNET on the GigaDrive. One way to do this is to remotely run a
simple, undocumented CGI script installed on the drive. After
another 20 minutes, I was able to get the Red Hat system's root
password, figure out a special TELNET user password and then TELNET
in to the GigaDrive, gain root access and create my own user
account &ldquo;behind&rdquo; the Samba and web-based interface. From there,
it was a simple matter to copy favorite libc5-based clients, such
as the <span   class="bold"><b>pico</b></span> text editor, onto the
Red Hat file system. This will also be necessary if you want to
install (unsupported) NFS or FTP service on your GigaDrive.</p><p>Now, before you throw your hands up in horror (&ldquo;Oh my God!
Anyone can get into our GigaDrive!&rdquo;), you should know that
cracking the root password won't do any good unless you can gain
TELNET access (root TELNET access is denied through a TCP wrapper,
and TELNET is disabled by default). The base Red Hat 2.0.36 system
on the GigaDrive also uses shadow passwords, and you cannot get the
special TELNET user password unless you know something about your
GigaDrive&mdash;I'm not going to say what.</p><p>The GigaDrive is quite secure when properly installed and
configured. There is no way a casual or even determined cracker can
gain access, unless you leave your own password on your desktop or
under your doormat.</p><p>I really like my &ldquo;gigi&rdquo; GigaDrive, and I really like
Linksys for its hardware support for the Linux community. I
heartily recommend the GigaDrive for any home, home-office or
small-business user who needs quick, inexpensive, on-line and
secure storage for a small network. You can also find the GigaDrive
at a discounted price if you shop around, which makes this Linksys
product a winner in a growing field of instant-storage
devices.</p></div></div>
