    A quick introduction to the Bash shell.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x248e580.0x25865b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>Welcome to the world of Bash, most widely
used shell in Linux. Bash is surprisingly configurable, and, by the
time you finish reading this article, you'll have an environment
more comfortable for you. Bash does not differentiate between
internal shell variables and external environment variables. A
shell variable is a variable (usually all caps), associated with a
value, and carried around between shells. Many programs use their
own variables, like <b  >PILOTRATE</b>, which they check.
Bash has its own variables, like <b  >MAIL</b>, that are
important to it. Environment variables are set using the syntax:
<pre     class="programlisting">
export VAR=VALUE
</pre>


or in two lines:
<pre     class="programlisting">
VAR=VALUE
export VAR
</pre>


To check the value of an environment variable, type <b  >echo
$VAR</b>, or to see all set variables, type
<b  >env</b>. bash executes your ~/.bash_profile file for
the login shell (on the console), and ~/.bashrc for non-login
shells (xterms and the like). Often you may just want to link one
to the other. If you export a variable, or set an alias on the
command line, it only stays active for that one bash session. You
must put it in your login script for it to stick. If you start
having a monolithic .bashrc file and want better organization, you
can split it up. Often, people break up their .bashrc into aliases,
variables and functions, and the .bashrc simply executes the
others. To have your .bashrc execute other files put in a line like
this:
<pre     class="programlisting">
source FILE
</pre>


</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x248e580.0x2586920"></a>The Prompt</h2></div></div><p>The first environment variable we'll discuss is PS1. PS1
stores a character string that is interpreted by bash for use as
your prompt. Here is a sample PS1 and its generated prompt:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
PS1='&lt;\u@\h:\w&gt;$'
&lt;blackmad@moomintroll:/etc&gt;
</pre><p>Backslashed characters are interpreted, while other
characters are displayed verbatim. <b  >\u</b> is
translated to user name, <b  >\h</b> is translated to
host name up to the first period, and <b  >\w</b> is the
working directory. Some of the most important backslashed
characters, which can also be found in the bash manpage, in the PS1
section, are shown in the table &ldquo;Interpreted Characters.&rdquo;
</p><p><a href="4063t1.html" target="_self">Table 1. Interpreted
Characters</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x248e580.0x2586c90"></a>Cool Xterm Title</h2></div></div><p>One of the cool things in all X terminal emulators (xterm,
rxvt, Eterm, ...) is that if you print
<b  >"\033]0;STRING_HERE\007"</b>, the title of the term
changes to <b  >STRING_HERE</b>. Try it by typing:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
echo -n "\033]0;Be Happy\007"
</pre><p>What I do with this is put a small function in my .bashrc
function xtitle (see Listing 1), and I call this after I've set my
PS1 variable, so at the end of my .bashrc file I have the line:
<pre     class="programlisting">
PS1=''\u@\h:\w&gt;$''
xtitle
export PS1
</pre>


This means that if I'm in a terminal emulator, it will set
<b  >TITLEBAR</b>, a string which will append
user@hostname:directory to my prompt string (so it's printed each
time I get a new prompt), and then export it. (Note that if your
terminal emulator sets <b  >$TERM</b> to something other
then xterm* or rxvt*, you need to add another case, with <b  >|
<i><tt>WEIRD_TERM_ENV</tt></i></b> on the line
with <b  >xterm* | rxvt*</b>) before the close
parenthesis.
</p><p><a href="4063l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1. Function
xtitle</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x248e580.0x25871b8"></a>Aliases</h2></div></div><p>One of the most useful things to use with Bash is aliases.
Aliases simply direct Bash to interpret a text string as something
else. For example, you can fix it so that when you type
<b  >happy</b>, Bash interprets it as:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
echo I'm a shiny happy shell
</pre><p>All aliases take the same form:
<pre     class="programlisting">
alias ALIAS="COMMAND"
</pre>


Often, you may want to change the default behavior of a command,
such as <span   class="bold"><b>ls</b></span>. I alias ls in this
way:
<pre     class="programlisting">
alias ls="ls -aF --color"
</pre>


<span   class="bold"><b>ls</b></span> now prints all files, in color,
with classification. <span   class="bold"><b>\ls</b></span> will
execute the unaliased command. Other times you may decide to define
a whole new command in order to shorten the amount of repetitive
typing. Here are a few aliases I use:
<pre     class="programlisting">
alias mkall=\
        "./configure &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; sudo make install"
alias whizz="ssh whizziwig@www.whizziwig.com"
alias tgz="tar -xvzf" alias ll="ls -aFl"
alias ls-d="ls -Sc"
</pre>


These all save time and keystrokes, and since anything you type
after the alias is still passed to Bash, it will just translate the
part that is aliased. In my case, executing <b  >tgz
linux-2.2.14.tar.gz</b> actually executes <b  >tar -xvzf
linux-2.2.14.tar.gz</b>.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x248e580.0x2587688"></a>Mail</h2></div></div><p>The <b  >$MAIL</b> variable specifies which mailbox
you want Bash to poll for new mail. You generally want to set this
to your inbox. I use procmail, so I have many mail folders. My
inbox (where mail that's actually addressed to me gets sent) is
/home/blackmad/Mail/inbox, so when I get new e-mail there, Bash
tells me: &ldquo;You have mail in /home/blackmad/Mail/inbox.&rdquo;</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x248e580.0x25877e8"></a>PATH</h2></div></div><p>The <b  >PATH</b> variable determines where, and in
what order, Bash will look for executables. Each directory is
separated by a colon (:). Bash interprets your path from right to
left. Let's say your <b  >PATH</b> is set to
<b  >/usr/bin:/bin/:/sbin/:/sbin/</b>. When you enter a
command, Bash will look for it in its internal shell functions
first, then /usr/bin, then /bin and so on, until it either finds
the command or gets to the end of your <b  >PATH</b>.
Often you may simply want to append or prefix your current
<b  >PATH</b>; you can do this by specifying</p><pre     class="programlisting">
PATH="$PATH:/next/path:/next_next/path"
</pre><p>or
<pre     class="programlisting">
PATH="/prev/path:$PATH:/next/path"
export PATH
</pre>


In the first example, Bash will look through
<b  >/next/path</b> and
<b  >/next_next/path</b> after it finishes with your
current <b  >PATH</b>. In the second example, Bash will
first look in <b  >/prev/path</b>. You may want to prefix
your <b  >PATH</b> with /usr/local/bin, since that is
where hand-compiled programs are usually located, and these are
generally more recent then those that came with your distribution.
You may also want to prefix ~/bin and have a bin directory in your
home directory where you can put customized versions of programs
and scripts (useful if you don't have root on the box).

everything in it, you can toss in programs you want to run each
time you log in. At the end of my .bashrc file, I have the
following:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
fortune
mesg y
users
</pre><p>So whenever I log in,
<span   class="bold"><b>fortune</b></span> greets me with a bit of
wisdom, messages are turned on, and I find out who's logged in to
the systems.
