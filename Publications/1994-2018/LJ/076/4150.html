application to lay out and produce <i  >LJ</i>. Is this
correct? I produce a couple of newsletters for some local
non-profits and want to move from MS Publisher to something in
Linux. Thanks, and keep up the great work! P.S. Well, of course, I
am a subscriber :)</p><p>&mdash;David Raeker-Jordan rkrjrdn@epix.net</p><p>Adobe has a beta release of FrameMaker for Linux. Framemaker
is great for books and could be used for newsletters, but isn't the
right tool for a magazine.</p><p>We continue to talk to Adobe about porting their software to
Linux. Their new program, InDesign, is a magazine layout tool.
Letting them know about your interest could help make a Linux port
happen.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c3c580.0x1d34348"></a>The Answer Is...</h2></div></div><p>I just thought I'd note what a great site this is! I've been
using Linux since the old Slackware was first released, and had
just kind of fumbled my way along. Sure enough, we now have six
Linux servers running here! And then a friend wanted a little Linux
server too, so he brought along an old 586-100 which we turned into
a Linux box. (Let's see NT run on that!) Anyway, he had an old
Colorado Tape backup unit in it, and I thought, bugger, I've never
used a tape drive under Linux before. Then I came across your
article at
<a href="../022/1215.html" target="_self">http://www.linuxjournal.com/lj-issues/issue22/1215.html</a>.</p><p>It was a piece of cake! It worked the first time. This brings
out one of the best things about Linux: it's public! That is, not
just to share around, but the information is out there and if
there's anything you ever want to do, chances are someone has
already done it, documented it and can often tell you how to do it,
too! As someone once said, it's all about the community atmosphere,
one for all and all for one, etc.</p><p>So thanks heaps for keeping all this information on-line and
making it available. I'll make sure I subscribe to your magazine
(if I can from here!).</p><p>&mdash;Timothy Findlay tfindlay@prodevelop.com.au</p><p>You sure can&mdash;we have 1000 subscribers in Australia!</p><p>I would just like to point out that lclint was written by
David Evans, not John Guttag and Jim Horning, as stated in the
article in issue 73. Guttag and Horning are credited by Dr. Evans
with having had the &ldquo;original idea&rdquo;, but it was Evans who wrote
the program.</p><p>Also, lclint can be downloaded directly from Dr. Evans' web
page at
<a href="http://lclint.cs.virginia.edu" target="_self">lclint.cs.virginia.edu</a>.</p><p>&mdash;Michael Powe michael@trollope.org</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c3c580.0x1d34768"></a>xv Article Feedback</h2></div></div><p>One of the things I love about <i  >LJ</i> is the
mix of heavy technical reading and light information, like the use
of <span   class="bold"><b>xv</b></span>. I was happy to read about
xv, a tool I've been using for the past five years. But if you got
scared off by the Root menu, you missed out on the best of all: it
refers to the root window, the background image on your desktop.
<span   class="bold"><b>xv</b></span> allows you to stretch, tile, or
otherwise fill the boring gray of the desktop with an image.
<span   class="bold"><b>xv</b></span> also has powerful command-line
options, and back in school I used a start-up script to retrieve
the latest Dr. Fun cartoon via FTP. The script would then call on
xv to stretch it, dither it, and put it automatically on the
desktop, for my daily entertainment. Just my two cents&mdash;thanks for
this great magazine.</p><p>&mdash;Michael Jastram micky@alum.mit.edu</p><p>I enjoyed reading your article on
<span   class="bold"><b>xv</b></span>. My only question to you at
this point is, how does this program deal with the Unisys patent
issue on GIF files?</p><p>&mdash;Donald Warf warfster@mail.tidalwave.net</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>xv</b></span> itself does not deal with
that issue, other than that it is an excellent tool to use to
convert GIF files to a &ldquo;free&rdquo; format such as PNG.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c3c580.0x1d34be0"></a>More on Content</h2></div></div><p>I would like to thank you for your article on XVScan, though
I'm rather disappointed that you didn't fact-check it with me or on
our web site before publication.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The license is not per concurrent user, but rather
per installed computer. So, a work group can install XVScan on the
computer with the scanner, and even though everyone uses it, only
one license is required.</p></li><li><p>Not all &ldquo;Linux-supported&rdquo; scanners are supported
by XVScan: only those listed on our web site at
<a href="http://www.tummy.com/xvscan/scanners.html" target="_self">www.tummy.com/xvscan/scanners.html</a>
are. This includes all HP SCSI ScanJet scanners from the IIc to the
most recent ones, and two Microtek scanners (E3 and E6 are no
longer available). Many more scanners are supported by SANE
(<a href="http://www.mostang.com/SANE" target="_self">http://www.mostang.com/SANE/</a>),
a free scanner driver that works with the GIMP.</p></li></ul></div><p>I would appreciate it if you would correct your on-line
version of the review on these two points, and print a correction
in the next issue of the magazine. Again, thanks for the review.
</p><p>&mdash;Evelyn Mitchell efm@tummy.com</p><p>We stand corrected. Sorry for the errors.  &mdash;Editor</p><p>I have been a subscriber to the print version of
<i  >LJ</i> for the past two years. Over these two
years, the printed magazine has grown to 160 pages. Congratulations
on having done a good job of growing the number of pages in the
magazine, and taking it the way of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Byte</em></span> and
all the other magazines that start and survive with the support of
the technical user or novice who wished to learn something, and
then become a huge glossy container for all the junk peddling that
so-called advertising agencies churn out. This is
<span   class="emphasis"><em>junk</em></span> that I do not wish to read, let alone pay
freight for.</p><p>I agree that advertising is where you and your publishers and
owners get their icing from, but I request that a balance be struck
on the so-called advertising, plain essays and informative
technical articles, but not at the expense of code, especially
since that is what the open software under GPL is all about.
Therefore, please include the full code listings. I can appreciate
how <i  >LJ</i> provides a downloadable version of the
program listings, because it saves a tremendous amount of typing
time, especially for slow two-finger typists like me.
Unfortunately, the downloading can be very time-consuming and
frustrating on a slow link, which happens frequently. And, many
times the downloading has to be restarted because the file is only
partially downloaded and the server connection has broken. Well, I
suppose if this is what electronic commerce is all about, I shall
have to bear with it, just like the vast silent majority.</p><p>The <span   class="emphasis"><em>most</em></span> important reason is that I am a
print reader. I can take the light magazine anywhere with me to
read at my convenience&mdash;even to bed; but can you plug the
flat-batteried 7-pound laptop into something (needing power to
recharge) beside a lovely waterfall?</p><p>So maybe it's time to review your editorial content policy
before you lose that group of readers who buy
<i  >LJ</i> for its detailed technical content and not
its glossy paper or models (e.g., there were only two pages of Best
of Technical Support out of 160!). If Linux was so perfect, and
easy to install and use, it would have put Windows on the side path
a long, long time ago. But, as most people will endorse, it has a
rather steep learning curve, and the newbies need all the help and
support they can get.</p><p>&mdash;Tirath tirathp@pd.jaring.my</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>The reason</em></span> <i  >LJ</i> has been able to grow is
because of advertising revenue. This isn't an issue of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>icing</em></span>; it is a fact of life. For most of the
first three years of publication, <i  >LJ</i> lost
money. Today, editorial content has grown as advertising has grown.
While the magazine may weigh more than you want, that additional
advertising is what has made additional editorial content
possible.</p><p>What we have done is taken advertising related to Linux only.
Many of our readers see added value here. Those who don't may want
to consider the fact that these ads are what make the magazine and
our web site possible.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c3c580.0x1d35630"></a>Is <i  >LJ</i> Partial to
Python?</h2></div></div><p>I've been a subscriber for almost a year now and in this
year, I've seen more articles on Python than on any other language.
It seems that every month, you have someone to write well about
Python and who despises other languages.</p><p>I like Python a lot, but that's not the only thing I program
in and I don't think it's fair to other languages, because you
always have Eric Raymond and Guido van Rossum talking about...
Python! The thing is, they are people just like you and I, with
their own personalities and preferences accordingly.</p><p>Why don't you have articles that advocate other languages, so
we can read what their thoughts are and compare ideas? Why just
Python?</p><p>&mdash;Roberto Mello rmello@cc.usu.edu</p><p>Take another look. At the Forge almost always includes Perl
code. Kernel Korner regularly includes C code. Java articles appear
regularly as well. Yes, we are excited about Python, but not at the
exclusion of other languages.</p><p>I read with interest your addendum on Python, but here is my
&ldquo;problem&rdquo; which might not be so uncommon. I would like to get
back into programming (I have not written a single line of code for
about 20 years; then it was FORTRAN and BASIC). Now, I am totally
puzzled as to which language I should learn; Python, C++, Perl,
Java... where do I start?</p><p>I would like to see a series of articles on the strong points
of each language and the type of applications they are best suited
for. Then I should be able to make a better choice. I am pretty
sure that would raise lots of bandwidth.</p><p><i  >Linux Journal</i> is great, it makes my day
when I receive it, so keep up the good work.</p><p>&mdash;L. Paul Bedard pbedard@saglac.qc.ca</p><p>Good suggestion. I have added it to our list of articles wanted.
&mdash;Editor</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c3c580.0x1d35b00"></a>People Behind Linux?</h2></div></div><p>&ldquo;People who helped make Linux possible&rdquo;, eh? Ian Kluft? How
did he merit more write-up than H.J. Lu? It doesn't even appear
that he made any kernel contribution at all:</p><p>Ian Kluft ikluft@thunder.sbay.org Smail binary packages for
Slackware and Debian</p><p>And from the current &ldquo;Credits&rdquo; file, it appears that he's
added &ldquo;beta tester&rdquo; and &ldquo;vote-taker&rdquo; to his list of Linux
&ldquo;contributions&rdquo;.</p><p>So, you really had to scrape the bottom of the barrel to
flesh out your article, eh? I mean <span   class="emphasis"><em>really</em></span>!!
How hard is it to go to the linux-kernel mailing list and discover
that Stephen Tweedie's e-mail address is sct@redhat.com and
interview him?</p><p>&mdash;Ronald Cole ronald@forte-intl.com</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>There are so many contributors to the Linux effort
that we knew we would miss some important people. We have been
contacting people we missed, and by the time you read this, there
