    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d59580.0x1e514a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>Extending the mnemonic, disyllabic fame
of A&amp;M (Hymns Ancient and Modern), S&amp;M (don't ask) and
K&amp;R (Kernighan and Ritchie), I propose C&amp;B for Eric S.
Raymond's <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Cathedral &amp; The Bazaar</em></span>,
O'Reilly, 1999. Here's a book that will survive Guy Kawasaki's
hyper-blurb: &ldquo;The most important book about technology today, with
implications that go far beyond programming.&rdquo; It may even, in
future editions, distance itself from Bob Young's foreword, written
before the Linux Red Hat CEO started challenging Bill Gates as
Mister Midas #1.
</p><p>As a longstanding Jolt judge in the book category (since
1991, in fact, when <span   class="emphasis"><em>Software Development</em></span>
magazine initiated these prestigious Academy-type awards; see note
1), I've been judiciously cautious in my reviewing strategy,
resisting all but the most perverse publicational PR sexual
enticements. My critical objectivity has been further strained by
the fact that, over the years, I've been personally involved with
many of the writers under scrutiny. Also, authors are more aware of
the hard slog involved than are unpublished doryhores (see note 2)
and tend to review with more sympathy and fewer sour grapes. A
classic example from the early UNIX days was the late Professor Jim
Joyce of UCB. He never, alas, got around to writing the &ldquo;perfect&rdquo;
UNIX book, but gained infamy with his deflating reviews of other
authors' attempts. Of one, he wrote, &ldquo;I won't say there's a
mistake on every page, but there are certainly more mistakes than
pages.&rdquo;</p><p>Yet in praising C&amp;B, I swear I'm uninfluenced by a
feeling of friendship and gratitude to Eric Raymond stretching back
to his seminal work (with Guy L. Steele, Jr. and others) on the
weird delights of hacker culture and its lexicon. (Eric also kindly
reviewed my <span   class="emphasis"><em>Devil's DP Dictionary</em></span> back in
1981, and encouraged my update, <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Computer
Contradictionary</em></span> (1995)--but again, I deny any cozy back
scratching!)</p><p>C&amp;B is, first off, a great read, written for a wide
audience including many who when polled &ldquo;Which OS do you use?&rdquo;
answer &ldquo;What's an OS?&rdquo; The main theme, as you must know, is the
OSS (Open Source Software, see note 3) revolution: what, why, how
and whence. In particular, the theme is the unpredictable successes
of GNU, Linux and Apache, based on an approach that seems to defy
the sacred rules of cathedral-capitalism (or what Radio Tirana used
to call the &ldquo;howling Wall Street jackals&rdquo;, see Note 4).</p><p>The gist is that many thousands of programmers are
contributing their time and skills on a voluntary, unpaid basis.
The motivations vary, but one that Eric stresses is the traditional
hacker <span   class="emphasis"><em>egoboo</em></span> (&ldquo;egoboost&rdquo;), and I suppose,
an appearance on my new TV show, &ldquo;Homes of the Poor and
Famous&rdquo;.</p><p>Even stranger, and generating mixed feelings among the OSS
purists, is how OSS has, in many instances, formed a symbiotic
relation with the big-money bottom-liners who are rushing to
exploit the Linux phenomenon. (At the recent ACM2000 Awards, Apache
won the coveted IBM Systems' prize.)</p><p>The wonderful thing about C&amp;B, unlike the spate of bland
software-development and people-ware books, is the violent
controversy generated, some of which rises beyond the boring
anecdotal to the exciting <span   class="emphasis"><em>ad hominem</em></span>. The most
detailed attack on C&amp;B has come from Bertrand Meyer (another
esteemed friend, mon dieu), available at
<a href="http://www.sdmagazine.com/features/2000/03/f4.shtml" target="_self">www.sdmagazine.com/features/2000/03/f4.shtml</a>.</p><p>I've looked on OSS from both sides&mdash;and what strikes me is
how often each side ignores ecumenical approaches from the other.
Bertrand declares, &ldquo;Accept that both commercial and free software
have a role to play and that neither will ever go away.&rdquo; Eric
makes similar statements. But where's the controversial fun in
that?</p><p><a href="4146s1.html" target="_self">Notes</a></p></div></div>
