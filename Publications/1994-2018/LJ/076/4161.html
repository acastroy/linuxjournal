    In this issue, we have a double feature: we look at using Linux
    at home, and on the Macintosh.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc91580.0xd89138"></a></h2></div></div><p>Use of Linux continues to grow in all
computing markets. Over The past few years has seen Linux grow
fastest in the server market, where it currently owns 31% of the
market (compared to 24% for Windows NT). Today, it appears that
Linux is growing fastest in the Embedded Systems market. In fact,
next month's issue of <i  >LJ</i> will focus on that
market. Look forward to an article on the Helius router. Learn
about &ldquo;plain Linux&rdquo;, Yopy and much more.
</p><p>In this issue, we have a double feature: we look at using
Linux at home, and on the Macintosh. Certainly, a home Linux system
could be running on a Mac, so the two subjects fit together well.
Using Linux in the home is vital to its growth. Having a version of
Quicken for Linux is a necessary step forward. In this issue, Ralph
Krause details various options for personal finance
management.</p><p>Setting up Linux to run on a Mac opens up the wonderful world
of Linux to a whole new set of users. You don't necessarily need to
throw that Mac away&mdash;learn how to install Linux, instead! Stew
Benedict and Richard Kinne explain procedures for installing and
configuring a Mac to run Linux.</p><p>While our features are here to address the issue focus, you
might want to remember that Linux is Linux. That is, Linux at work,
Linux at home and even Linux on a server is all the same basic
Linux. Even if your only interest is in running Linux at home, much
of what you will see in <i  >Linux Journal</i> applies
as well. Our Linux Apprentice column, for example, contains useful
information and tips&mdash;no matter where you run Linux. This month we
learn how to configure a heterogeneous Linux/Windows home network.
Book and product reviews always contain much information. Root
through our reviews of routers, Wordperfect Office 2000 Deluxe,
OpenLinux eDesktop 2.4, Imagestream routers and much more. And
don't forget this month's Take Command, which explains the klogd
kernel logging d&aelig;mon. All this in just one issue of
<i  >LJ</i>! Read on.</p><p>Our first focus article on the Mac side is by Stew Benedict:
Yellow Dog Linux on the iMac. Yellow Dog is a port specific for the
Mac, and Stew takes you through his experiences of getting Yellow
Dog up and running.</p><p>Our other Mac feature is Richard Kinne's piece on Linux on
the PowerPC. Richard discusses the various distribution choices for
the Mac, and then goes on the concentrate on the LinuxPPC package.
With commercial applications for LinuxPPC lagging behind their
counterpart for the x86 platform, Richard explains why a Mac user
of Linux isn't out in the cold.</p><p>Our third feature looks at finance programs available for
Linux. Reviewed packages include cbb, Moneydance, QHacc, gAcc and
GnuCash. The article is a great guide to your options and includes
information on file compatibility with the de facto QIF
format.</p></div></div>
