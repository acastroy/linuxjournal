    This spring's outbreak of viruses has caused me to think
    about the burden that should be borne by a manufacturer.
    There is both a moral and a legal accountability any
    manufacturer has to its customers.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x145c580.0x1554608"></a></h2></div></div><p> I'll readily admit that I don't use any
Microsoft products: in fact, none of my machines has a DOS or a
Windows partition. And I think early 1997 was the last time I sat
down at an x86 box running Windows. But this spring's outbreak of
viruses has caused me to think about the burden that should be
borne by a manufacturer.
</p><p>Any manufacturer has both a moral and a legal accountability
to its customers. The various manufacturers of automobiles,
children's toys and tobacco products, for example, have learned
painful lessons about accountability through product liability
suits.</p><p>&ldquo;ILOVEYOU&rdquo; and &ldquo;Killer Resume&rdquo; exploit holes in Microsoft
Outlook that any less-avaricious company would have tried to stop
several software generations ago. (I might note that the first RFC
concerning security is 602 (December 1973), and was written by Bob
Metcalfe, the inventor of Ethernet.) In my view, Microsoft has
willfully ignored customer security for at least 20 years.</p><p>As Gene Spafford (Purdue University) has pointed out, even
though Microsoft (and the tobacco companies) sell products that
customers appear to want to buy,</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>does that make the tobacco companies less
culpable for selling a product they know to be dangerous? Does it
matter that the consumers shell out money willingly for the
product? (Even those who have some idea of the danger believe they
have no control or choice.)
</p><p>There is a fundamental question involved in the area of
informed consent. If the consumers actually understood the
technology and the risks posed by their choices, and if they
actually were able to make an unconstrained choice, would they make
the purchases? If not, there is a moral (and potentially, legal)
obligation for the vendor to make wise decisions on their
behalf.</p></blockquote></div><p>Gerald Shifrin (on the IP mailing list) noted:
<div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>As an ordinary non-attorney consumer of computer
products, it seems reasonable to me to expect that my software
should ask permission before sending email to everyone in my
address book or performing a mass deletion or modification of my
files. If vendors like Microsoft allow or assist unsolicited
foreign email to perform these acts, they are, at least in my mind,
guilty of gross negligence.</p></blockquote></div>

Well, yes.
</p><p>In fact, I found it puzzling that after &ldquo;Melissa&rdquo; and then
&ldquo;ILOVEYOU&rdquo; and now &ldquo;Killer Resume&rdquo;, the newspapers aren't
noting mass filings of product liability suits against Microsoft.
If the world's economy can be brought to its knees by very simple
code delivered via e-mail to PCs running Outlook or Observer or
Explorer, then parts of that economy should be holding the
manufacturer responsible.</p><p>Kevin G. Barkes (on the IP mailing list) posted:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Another real-world analogy: you're tooling down
the Interstate in your Chevy and hit a bump in the road. The doors
fall off and the engine explodes. You have the ambulance driver
stop at the dealership on the way to the trauma center so you can
chew out the service manager. He sneers at you condescendingly and
points to a paragraph of six-point type buried in a totally
unrelated portion of the owners' manual:
</p><p>The doors of your car will fall off and the engine will
explode when you hit a bump while traveling on an Interstate
highway. One of our engineers thought this feature would be neat
and we have added it at no extra charge to you. If you disagree
(you weenie), you can disable this feature by performing the
following procedure. First, obtain three chickens, two brown
recluse spiders, a length of nylon rope and a virgin ...</p></blockquote></div><p>Barkes points out that &ldquo;Melissa&rdquo; and &ldquo;ILOVEYOU&rdquo; were
&ldquo;badly-written programs created by rank amateurs&rdquo;. What would
happen if a really malicious first-rate programmer wanted to target
Microsoft Outlook or Outlook Express?
</p><p>Another list member said this about Spafford's
posting:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>To further agree with Gene's point about tobacco
and &ldquo;what consumers want&rdquo;, let me suggest that at any one point
the market offers only a tiny subset of what is possible to create
for consumers. Mere selection cannot create possibilities that are
not developed or invented. Monopolies distort the creation of
selections&mdash;in particular in systems' properties like
security.</p></blockquote></div><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Because of its installed base dominance,
Microsoft's primary drive for innovation comes from a need to
motivate an orderly &ldquo;upgrade&rdquo; revenue stream, while at the same
time blocking competitors from entering the market to take that
revenue away. That means innovations will be small, incremental,
and extremely easy for customers to adopt.</p></blockquote></div><p>By the time you read this, all questions on the DoJ's case
against Microsoft will have been answered, pending a decade of
appeals. But even a partly knowledgeable reaction on the part of
customers may well put Microsoft into the product liability dock,
and send Outlook and its kin the way of the Chevy Corvair.
