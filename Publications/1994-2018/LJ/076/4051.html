so ... <span   class="emphasis"><em>right</em></span>, that they worm their way into
your brain and are just about impossible to fight off. You hear
someone talking and, without even needing to think about what they
have said, you know they are talking truth. Linux is awesome. True.
Microsoft is a monopoly. True. The patent office has gone insane.
True. Linux will never be taken seriously by the computer industry
as a whole until mainstream office software becomes available.
True.
</p><p>But are these truths really true? In the case of Linux,
Microsoft and the patent office, of course they are! What about
Linux needing mainstream office software to be accepted by
mainstream users? Widely believed? Yes, but...truth, in a warm wash
of golden light and trumpeting trumpets? Linux needs applications,
that is true. But we need applications that are unique to Linux,
applications that will force users through Linux's doors, and not
provide them with another excuse for walking past.</p><p>There have always been excuses, and there will always be
excuses. From &ldquo;not pretty enough&rdquo; to &ldquo;hard to use&rdquo; to &ldquo;no
commercial support&rdquo; to, well, I've never heard anyone cite their
fear of penguins, but somewhere on this planet, someone is avoiding
Linux because the penguin reminds them of Big Bird-inspired
nightmares they had when they were four.</p><p>Excuses or not, there are some sizable reasons why
full-featured office software may be a long time coming from the
GNU world. First amongst them is the nature of office-software
users. Unlike development tools and Internet servers, word
processors and spreadsheets are generally used by non-technical
people with non-technical problems. The users don't necessarily
have the skills to write their own word processor the way a
programmer can write their own compiler. They don't need those
skills. The second big reason is the lack of standards. There are
no ANSI-standard word processor files, no central body dictates
spreadsheet interfaces, no RFC explains existing file formats. In
fact, it is just the opposite: the interfaces and file formats have
been used as an anti-competitive trump card so many times that even
mainstream office applications can have difficulty reading older
versions of their own files.</p><p>Would-be office software developers can't even go their own
way and ignore existing office products, because users need file
compatibility and interface familiarity.</p><p>So, the options can be reduced to one: commercial software.
Here, the requirements shift. You still need file compatibility and
an easy interface, but you also need a company that will stand
behind their product. Ideally, they will also have a name that
draws users. Unlike most GNU software, commercial applications must
compete not only for users but also for user money. They must be
able to stand feature-to-feature against the best products from the
biggest companies. In office software, that means standing against
Microsoft. [Although with the recent DoJ ruling, this may change.
Someday. Perhaps. &mdash;Ed]</p><p>Fighting Microsoft in the commercial world means being a
company with the money and staff to go one-on-one with the richest
and most aggressive corporation in the industry&mdash;and not get bought
up or buried. Unlike GNU/Linux, a temporary setback isn't just a
matter of spending more time coding and waiting for the next
opportunity to arrive. It means angry shareholders, lawsuits,
layoffs, shattered dreams and all the nasty stuff that happens when
people lose their shirts.</p><p>You need a company with not only the will but the strength to
fight.</p><p>Corel has uniquely positioned themselves to fill that need.
While most of us sat on the sidelines and grumbled about
Microsoft's tactics, Corel decided to play the game, fighting
Microsoft head-on using Microsoft's own tricks. Corel and Microsoft
have always had similar business strategies. Both grew from humble
beginnings, in part, by augmenting their product development
resources through purchasing companies and products to combine with
their own development efforts&mdash;shepherding the best they could
build and buy toward commercial success. Corel's office suite,
containing mostly bought goods, is no different. Each of the major
applications started life as another company's brainchild, but
Corel has added several of their own applications and given them
all a consistent look and feel.</p><p>The key word, when defining either company's strategy, has
always been &ldquo;opportunistic&rdquo;. However, a few years ago, Corel
decided to take the gloves off and face Microsoft on Microsoft's
home turf. The size difference is undeniable, the strategy bold. So
far, the going has been rough for Corel, but the future looks very
bright if Corel's latest moves are right.</p><p>And what is their goal? To capture the business desktop.
Their strategy? Do it any way they can. Sell an office suite
head-to-head with Microsoft Office. Sell a desktop operating system
head-to-head with Windows. Make their software multi-platform.
Remove barriers to leaving Microsoft, and provide alternatives with
a good mix of features and price.</p><p>Oh, and sell Linux. Corel saw Linux and realized exactly what
each of us did when we encountered the Penguin: here is something
truly great and truly threatening to Microsoft. Corel quickly
committed themselves to providing Linux versions of their
application software, developing their own Linux distribution, even
making a try at Linux-based thin-network clients and other
Linux-centric products&mdash;and they have shown some remarkably good
judgment in the process. The Corel LinuxOS distribution is based on
Debian GNU/Linux, one of the oldest and most respected
distributions around. Their approach to porting their applications
was equally practical. Since supporting multiple source code bases
or spending the necessary time on a massive inter-OS port would
take too long, they spent their time making their applications run
under WINE, the GNU free Windows emulator for Linux. The bulk of
the Linux-specific software in WordPerfect Office 2000 is actually
in the installation program.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28d9580.0x29d1f50"></a>And Finally, the Product Review</h2></div></div><p>WordPerfect Office 2000 Deluxe includes everything most
business users need to make a computer useful: a word processor,
spreadsheet, database, calendar/PIM, presentation graphics software
and even a game. One box contains everything needed to use Linux in
an office environment, and if you don't have Linux yet, there is
even a CD with Corel's LinuxOS distribution.</p><p>At the heart of it all is WordPerfect. Hardly new or unknown
in the word processing game, WordPerfect has been around since the
beginning, and has steadily improved and expanded since its
inception. WordPerfect 9 provides all the features expected in a
professional-quality word processor, from page layout to automatic
spelling correction to PDF generation; full-featured grammar
checking, an &ldquo;Expert&rdquo; designed to walk you through the process of
creating a document, and more. It may not have every feature
imaginable, but it has more than most people will ever use.</p><p>Quattro Pro, Paradox and Corel Presentation Graphics round
out the office suite. The spreadsheet, Quattro Pro, and database,
Paradox, are longtime contenders in the office software world, but
are less well-known than WordPerfect. Quattro Pro has all the
modern spreadsheet features you could ask for and a consistent and
easy-to-use interface. Paradox provides more database functionality
than most end users will ever need. When it comes to graphics, few
companies have the history and experience of Corel. With that in
mind, the features of Corel Presentation Graphics look downright
dowdy compared to CorelDraw, but it is designed to serve a
different purpose and works well for office meetings and sales
presentations.</p><p>Railroad Tycoon II from Loki is there to ease you through any
frustrating moments you may experience, although some may question
the rationale behind including a game in what is otherwise rather
straight-laced business software.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28d9580.0x29d2160"></a>Using It</h2></div></div><p>Office software inspires user loyalty. After all, if you
spend eight hours a day for years working with a program, you are
going to understand it pretty well. Little changes can make a big
difference to someone who &ldquo;knows&rdquo; how a program should work. For
all that, the WordPerfect Office interfaces are standardized enough
that, unless you are a power user of another suite, you won't be
too bothered by the differences you encounter. If you are already
using WordPerfect for Windows, you will feel right at home.
WordPerfect for Linux looks exactly like, well, WordPerfect. The
other applications in the suite are equally unsurprising in their
appearance.</p><p>Whether you like the interface or not, some of the features
are undeniably cute, and some are better than the competition. The
WordPerfect grammar and spell checkers seem to ace Microsoft's
offerings; the dictionary is larger and the grammar checker gives a
little more detail. If you like thesauri, a drop-down on the
property bar will keep you occupied, as it automatically finds
alternate words while you type. Upon further consideration, that's
a feature rife with opportunity for abuse; but, abusable or not,
WordPerfect has enough features to keep anyone with something to
say busy for a long time.</p><p>The other applications in the suite are similar. The features
may not be the ones you are used to, but you will rarely leave
tasks unfinished for lack of features.</p><p>More important to most of us than feature selection is file
compatibility. The programs in the WordPerfect suite all have
import and export filters for a wide range of competing products,
including the latest versions of Word. They even work, most of the
time. There can be real, though arbitrary, incompatibilities
between programs, which will cause problems from time to time. When
importing an Excel spreadsheet to Quattro Pro, the import filter
took exception to having a hyphen in the spreadsheet name. This is
not a problem in Excel and shouldn't be a problem in Quattro Pro,
but it is. The import filter offered to replace the hyphen with an
underscore character, and other than the name change, the file read
perfectly.</p><p>File compatibility is not a two-way street, however. WP can
read most other file formats, but most programs are unable to read
WordPerfect files. If you need to access your documents using Word,
you must save them in Word format. Even then, you may not be able
to access the file exactly as it was; differences in available
fonts alone can cause otherwise perfect file conversions to look
like a madman was in charge of your document layout.</p><p>All of the programs share some idiosyncrasies caused by the
use of WINE. For example, when saving, some of the dialog boxes
refer to your home directory as the D: drive, and the floppy
(referred to as the A: drive) is always listed as a destination,
but saves to the floppy only when you have a disk mounted. That
could cause some confusion, especially for new Linux users.</p><p>The first time WordPerfect starts up for a new user, it must
do some final setup, like create a directory for user-specific
files, generate font information, ask the user if they intend to
comply with the license and other little jobs of that nature.
Unfortunately, WP does not tell you anything is taking place while
it does that. You click, and nothing happens. Or nothing happens
right away. Somewhere between 10 and 40 seconds after clicking on
the WordPerfect icon, a copyright screen appears to let you know
that your computer isn't being eaten by a runaway word
processor.</p><p>The performance was acceptable on modern systems. I tested on
an older P90 that was definitely struggling and would be marginal
for word processing, unacceptable for more. Linux is less
resource-intensive than most operating systems, and WordPerfect and
Quattro Pro running at the same time with moderately sized
documents took between 29MB and 34MB of RAM (not counting buffers
or cache), depending on the test system. A full installation
requires over 450MB of drive space, not counting operating system,
games, clip art or additional fonts. If you want to install
everything in the box, you will need at least 1GB available.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28d9580.0x29d24d0"></a>Installation</h2></div></div><p>Corel is aiming at several types of users with WordPerfect
Office: people who already use Linux but want the power of a
professional office suite; people who are putting together a new
computer and don't want to tithe to Microsoft; and existing
WordPerfect users who are ready to make the switch to Linux. To
support the widest range of existing systems, they include an
installation program that recognizes your distribution and installs
itself accordingly. Corel also provides the suite in both Red Hat
RPM and Debian DEB files, so if you have problems with the
installation program, you can perform the installation manually.
People buying WordPerfect Office as a complete desktop solution get
a general-release version of LinuxOS, identical to what you can
download from Corel's web site.</p><p>I installed WordPerfect Office on three computers running
three different Linux distributions, just to see what how it would
handle the differences.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28d9580.0x29d2630"></a>The Old System</h2></div></div><p>The first was a typical older system, a P90 with 32MB of RAM,
a 4X CD-ROM and a 2GB hard drive. This is significantly below the
recommended minimum system requirements, and you'll quickly see why
when you try to run the office applications. It is the sort of
system that Linux is often called upon to resurrect (or at least
sustain) for a few more years after Windows bloat has rendered it
&ldquo;obsolete&rdquo;. Don't expect WordPerfect to help, though&mdash;Corel
recommends a minimum of a 166&mdash;200MHz CPU, and they mean it.</p><p>I started by popping the LinuxOS CD into the drive and
rebooting, hoping the BIOS was modern enough to boot from the
CD-ROM. It was, and after a few moments of earnest disk access, I
was rewarded with a subdued low-res color graphic of Stonehenge, a
sundial and other oddities, with messages politely telling me to be
patient while Linux loaded.</p><p>Once the system was sure I remembered why nobody sells 4X CD
drives any more, it got on with its job and started asking me
questions. Not many questions, however. Agree to the license? Want
the full installation? Repartition the hard drive? Yes. Yes. Yes.
My name is Jon, and so on. Five questions later, the installation
began in earnest, and I, remembering how slow a 90MHz CPU feels in
this age of 700MHz laptops, left it to its devices and went off to
have dinner.</p><p>When I got back, the system was patiently waiting for me to
eject any floppy disks that might have snuck into the drive so that
it could reboot. A quick click of the &ldquo;OK&rdquo; button, and the system
automatically ejected the installation CD and started toward its
first LinuxOS boot.</p><p>Corel has done their best to hide the &ldquo;Linux&rdquo; in
&ldquo;LinuxOS&rdquo;. A graphical boot loader hides as much detail as it
can, telling you in the simplest possible terms that, yes, the
system is booting, and you should just hang on while it does its
job. The system probes your hardware and auto-configures itself
based on what it recognizes, which may or may not be what is
actually there. Once the auto-configuration process is complete,
you are presented with a simple graphical login prompt. You can log
in as root or the one regular user account created during the
installation process, and, after setting your password, you are
ready to go.</p><p>This is about as hands-off as you can get in a Linux
installation. The system defaulted to 1024 by 768, 16-bit graphics,
no network and no sound, which is surprisingly good considering how
little I had to do to get it working. I would have preferred to
answer some questions about my network card and preset the
passwords, but their decision to keep the installation simple and
hands-off is probably justified considering the target
audience.</p><p>KDE is the default user interface, and Corel has kept that as
simple as possible, too. No questions are asked about how you want
the system to look. There is no choice of having a CD-ROM icon on
your desktop. Instead, you are presented with a rather Windows-like
desktop with a few icons on the left edge and a bar along the
bottom having a few icons on the left and a clock on the right. The
configuration isn't totally Windows-like, with four virtual desktop
icons and no &ldquo;Start&rdquo; button, but any Windows user will be able to
figure out that the icon where the &ldquo;Start&rdquo; button would be does
the Start button's job.</p><p>For everything Corel intends LinuxOS to be, it is perhaps a
little too simple. Corel seems to have done a good job of removing
redundant menu options, which also means that unless you know where
to look, you are going to have a harder time finding some
features.</p><p>After a little bit of random searching, I had a directory
listing of the WordPerfect CD on screen. A quick double-click of
the setup icon launched the WordPerfect Installer.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28d9580.0x29d29f8"></a>The New System</h2></div></div><p>I also installed WordPerfect on a new 500MHz Dell Inspiron
7500 Laptop running Mandrake Linux. Installation on this system was
actually easier than using LinuxOS, or at least it required less
thought. I just popped the CD in, and a few double-clicks later,
the installation was on its way.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28d9580.0x29d2b00"></a>The Easiest System of All</h2></div></div><p>The third computer to receive WordPerfect was an AMD K6-2
system running Caldera eDesktop 2.4. Unlike the Corel or Mandrake
systems, Caldera immediately saw that something interesting was on
the WordPerfect CD and started the installation process on its
own.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28d9580.0x29d2c08"></a>And What Was the Installation Like?</h2></div></div><p>In all three cases, the start of the installation process
foretold the greatest problem&mdash;nothing happened. Okay, that's not
totally fair, the hard disk light started flashing; but in all
three cases, there was a significant delay between starting the
installation program and any indication it was running. The lack of
feedback is frustrating when the installation begins, but an equal
lack of feedback when something goes wrong can cause more than
frustration. If an error occurs, the installation program closes
without explanation.</p><p>Installation must be done as root. It starts with the
ever-present license agreement query and finishes by asking if you
want a full or partial install. Everything else is automatic,
although the installation program does give you a chance to panic
and abort if you don't like the target directories. The
installation program uses the system package tool for the actual
installation, which is why the software installs in the normal
system directories and not the &ldquo;local&rdquo; directories many
commercial applications use. After the installation has started, a
progress bar and slideshow presentation let you know something is
happening.</p><p>Using the system package tool is a rather neat solution to
providing cross-distribution Linux software, but Corel should work
on fault recovery. In two out of the three installations, something
happened (me) to cause the Corel installer to die without so much
as a grunt of pain. Prematurely closing the installation program
caused the worst problem, leaving the installer permanently unable
to run on the system. If you get in too much trouble using the
installation program, you can always use your system's native
package tool to install manually. After I realized the full impact
of my fateful installation-stopping mouse click, I was able to
install WordPerfect using Debian's
<span   class="bold"><b>apt-get</b></span>, which Corel uses for the
LinuxOS package tool. Manual installation instructions are provided
in an HTML README file on the CD.</p><p>WordPerfect automatically installs itself in KDE's
Applications submenu for all users. After installing, you must
either log out or restart KDE in order to see the updated menu.
This isn't a problem, because if you do try to run the applications
as root, you will be politely warned that it really isn't safe. You
can, but it is not recommended.</p><p>Installation took from fifteen minutes to two hours depending
on the computer, and, uneventful process or not, the software did
install on all three systems.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28d9580.0x29c9758"></a>Problems? What Problems?</h2></div></div><p>I didn't have very many problems with WordPerfect Office or
LinuxOS. The worst one occurred on the Mandrake-based laptop, which
received its copy of Mandrake from an older CD. It would open,
import and edit files flawlessly, but invariably crashed when
called upon to save those files. Not simply crash, but wipe out the
source file and any backups that may have been ferreted away. After
a great deal of trial and error, I realized that virtually none of
the WordPerfect software would run reliably on the laptop, even
though most of it ran perfectly. Delving deeper, the problems
occurred only for users; when the WordPerfect applications were run
by root, they worked fine. This pointed to a problem with the
operating system, and upgrading the Mandrake installation seems to
have buried the problem.</p><p>When it did crash, WordPerfect was less than perfect about
having a backup saved. It tries, but it doesn't always
succeed.</p><p>I noticed only one problem with LinuxOS: the system was
unable to establish PPP dialup connections as a user. As root, KPPP
dials without difficulty, but normal users get an error message
claiming PPP is not installed in the kernel. This is at odds with
Corel's positioning of LinuxOS as a desktop operating system for
non-technical users.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28d9580.0x29c9910"></a>In the End</h2></div></div><p>WordPerfect Office 2000 Deluxe offers a real solution for
people who want the power of mainstream office software without
contributing to the Bill Gates Retirement Fund. It is an even
better solution for people who use Linux and need access to
full-featured office software without rebooting. It is at its best
in environments where compatibility with other software packages
isn't the most important issue. The file import/export capabilities
provide a link to other popular office software, but if
compatibility is a matter of daily importance, you will find
weaknesses. Overall, it is a great set of programs with the promise
of becoming even better.</p><p><a href="4051s1.html" target="_self">The Good/The Bad</a></p></div></div>
