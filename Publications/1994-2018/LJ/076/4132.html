    Linux kernel developers realized that a kernel-based web server
    was needed.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1481580.0x1579660"></a></h2></div></div><p>Web servers have become an important part
of today's infrastructure for business, trading, entertainment and
information. Some of the Web's sites take millions of hits every
day, or even every hour. It is only natural that computer science
researchers soon began wondering how to make web servers faster,
more resource-efficient and fail-safe.
</p><p>The search for more speed triggered a whole new area of
operating system theory research, that of execution path analysis.
The author of this article, while a Ph.D. student, researched this
topic at length studying the Apache server. One of the most
interesting discoveries was that for static pages, more than 80
percent of the instructions are actually executed in kernel space
(protected mode). This has some serious implications.</p><p>First, as we learned in the previous three columns, the only
way to enter kernel space for a user program such as Apache is to
execute a system call. System calls are expensive because they
involve complex checks and search many kernel tables.</p><p>Also, switching from user space and back often flushes the
on-processor TLB (Translation Lookaside Buffer) cache as well as
primary and secondary cache entries.</p><p>As a consequence, Linux kernel developers realized that a
kernel-based web server was needed. Such a kernel-space web server
would not incur the costs involved in switching back and forth to
and from protected mode.</p><p>Just such a kernel-space web server, called kHTTPd, was
implemented in Linux kernel versions 2.3.<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> and
2.4. kHTTPd is different from other kernel web servers in that it
runs from within the Linux kernel as a module (device
driver).</p><p>kHTTPd handles only static (file-based) web pages, and passes
all requests for non-static information to a regular user-space web
server such as Apache or Zeus. Static web pages, while not complex
to serve, are nevertheless very important. This is because
virtually all images are static, as are a large portion of HTML
pages. A &ldquo;regular&rdquo; web server adds little value for static pages;
it is simply a &ldquo;copy file to network&rdquo; operation. The Linux kernel
is very good at this; the NFS (network file system) d&aelig;mon,
for example, also runs in the kernel.</p><p>&ldquo;Accelerating&rdquo; the simple case of serving static pages
within the kernel leaves user-space d&aelig;mons free to do what
they are very good at: generating user-specific, dynamic content. A
user-space web server such as Apache, typically loaded with many
features and many execution paths, can't be as fast as kHTTPd.
There are, however, a few web servers that are as simple as kHTTPd
but implemented in user space, so they are not expensive consumers
of processor cycles, even compared with kHTTPd.</p><p>kHTTPd is very simple; it can't handle dynamic content. So,
it proxies all requests for those directories you configure via the
sysctl called &ldquo;dynamic&rdquo; to a fully functional user-space web
server such as Apache. It's a global win, though, since most of the
transfers of a common web server are images, which are definitely
static.</p><p>kHTTPd is actually not much different from a normal http
d&aelig;mon in principle. The main difference is that it bypasses
the syscall layer. Normally, an http server contains code like
this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
socket(..)
bind(..)
listen(..)
accept(..)
</pre><p>and each call has to enter the kernel, look up kernel
structures as function(s) of the parameter(s) passed, return
information to user space, etc.
</p><p>Being a kernel d&aelig;mon itself, kHTTPd interfaces directly
with the internal kernel structures and system calls involved and
so avoids the user-kernel interaction completely. Also, because
it's a kernel d&aelig;mon, it avoids <b  >switch_mm</b>
and TLB flushes. Last but not least, it avoids all enter/exit
kernel overhead.</p><p>There are not many data structures for kHTTPd. They are in
net/kHTTPd/structure.h.</p><p>The first is a per-connection structure. The second is a
per-kHTTPd-thread structure by which many http_requests can be
queued.</p><p><a href="4132l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1.
/proc/sys/net/khttpd/structure.h</a></p><p>kHTTPd can be compiled as a loadable module, or linked
statically into the kernel. Linking statically into the kernel will
provide better performance, because it will be allocated in a more
efficient and TLB-persistent page-table mapping.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1481580.0x1579df0"></a>Configuring kHTTPd</h2></div></div><p>Control of kHTTPD is performed via the /proc filesystem at
/proc/sys/net/khttpd. Table 1 shows the sysctl parameters which can
be set, along with a description of each (from the docs).</p><p><a href="4132t1.html" target="_self">Table 1. Parameters Configurable

traffic and mostly static web pages. Using kHTTPd is very easy, and
tests with this setup have shown a dramatic increase in throughput
compared to standard user space web servers. The code itself has
proven very stable and safe. Once again, Linux is a technology
leader. Right on!</p></div></div>
