were focused on particular window managers: Enlightenment and
Window Maker. I looked very closely at those two window managers
because they epitomize the personalization that is possible in the
Linux desktop. Unlike in the Mac or PC world, the look and feel of
the Linux desktop can vary to the extreme. One Linux user's
windowing interface need not look&mdash;or act&mdash;anything like anyone
else's. The windowing interface you choose is like a big empty
apartment. Not until you add the furniture and hang some pictures
does it become a livable space. The kitchen is still a kitchen, but
in Linux, it's <span   class="emphasis"><em>your</em></span> kitchen.
</p><p>In this, the fourth and final part of the series, I'm going
to take a quick look at some of the other, less well-known window
managers available for Linux. Most of them have unique benefits
over any other window manager&mdash;smaller memory footprints, more
efficient code, better extensibility and so forth. They all look
and behave slightly differently, although aside from AfterStep,
none are designed with the graphical variety intended in both
Enlightenment and Window Maker. That doesn't mean you don't want to
consider them. On the contrary, there are definite situations in
which you'll want to consider these alternatives, particularly if
you do much work on a laptop.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x141e580.0x15167c0"></a>AfterStep</h2></div></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>URL:

</p><p>When I originally started this series, I had planned on
looking at AfterStep in the same thorough manner I looked at E and
Window Maker. After doing some research, I discovered Window Maker
and AfterStep are pretty much the same beast. Internally and
politically they may differ, but from an end-user perspective
they're very similar, so much that if you read the previous
article, you're up to date with AfterStep.</p><p>Still, there are a few things I need to mention about this
window manager. AfterStep adds a bar across the top of the display,
similar to the task bar of GNOME and KDE. The bar actually shows up
only when the first application has been started; after that, each
application gets added to the bar. It allows you to jump to
applications very quickly, although personally I don't particularly
like these types of features.</p><p>AfterStep features can be enabled or disabled prior to
compiling the software. The configure script has far more options
than most of the other window managers. This allows you to turn off
some features, hopefully slimming down the window manager for use
on resource-limited systems. However, if you use the
<b  >-prefix</b> option, be aware that the &ldquo;make
install&rdquo; process doesn't create the /bin and /man directories
under the directory you specified&mdash;you'll have to do that
manually.</p><p>Unlike Window Maker, AfterStep has a pager similar to FVWM's
pager, which I like quite a bit. It appears to look and work much
like the one I'm used to and is available in the default
configuration. Although I probably won't switch to AfterStep (the
icon features I disliked in Window Maker are also present in
AfterStep), I am more curious about it now that I've found a
reasonable pager.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x141e580.0x1516fa8"></a>Blackbox</h2></div></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>URL:

available from the main Blackbox site. Supports Window Maker dock
applications through the use of a built-in tool called the
Slit.</p></li></ul></div><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4001f2.large.jpg"><img src="4001f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 2. Blackbox, Using an Accompanying
Theme</p></div></div>
</p><p>Of all the window managers I tried, Blackbox is certainly the
easiest to build and install. It needs no special libraries, has no
special requirements and took only a minute or two to compile.
Obviously, this will depend on your hardware configuration, but the
point is, this is the slimmest, most streamlined window manager
available. That also means it's the one with the fewest bells and
whistles.</p><p>While most of the other window managers provide some form of
pizzazz through icons or image handling, Blackbox provides nothing
more than simple gradients. It does include a tool for placing
background images on the root window, but that's about all the
pizzazz you'll find here. Still, the implementation does include
support for dockable applications from Window Maker, through a
built-in function called the Slit. I didn't try this feature, since
the point of Blackbox is to <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> add snazzy
appearance. It's truly a window manager designed to provide a
decent look with as small a memory footprint as possible. This
makes Blackbox a likely candidate for use on laptops.</p><p>Like with most window managers, you have to edit text files
to make changes to the root menu. This isn't a serious problem,
however. A fairly complete description of the menu file format is
available on-line, linked from the Blackbox web site.</p><p>Blackbox has a panel across the bottom of the screen which
includes a clock, two sets of arrows for cycling through windows
and desktops, and an area displaying the title from the window
which currently has the keyboard focus. An additional tool,
BBPager, is available which provides many of the same pager
features that FVWM's and AfterStep's pagers do. Although the pager
accepts standard <b  >-geometry</b> settings to set its
position on the screen, the panel appears to be forced to the
bottom of the display. I'd like a way of changing that, to move it
to the top or side of the display, but didn't see whether that was
possible.</p><p>One thing Blackbox doesn't do is enforce edge resistance by
default. Edge resistance lets you slide a window up against an edge
of the display, but not past it without a little applied force. I
like window managers that do this; I seldom use windows that span
workspaces, but do like to butt windows up against the edge of the
display.</p><p>In general, I like Blackbox; I just need to learn how to
configure it properly.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x141e580.0x1517898"></a>Icewm</h2></div></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>URL:

<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4001f3.large.jpg"><img src="4001f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 3. Icewm's Default Theme</p></div></div>
</p><p>The basic installation comes up looking a little like a
Windows interface. At least, it's very usable right from the start,
even if the theme makes me slightly ill. There doesn't appear to be
a quick way of changing themes right from the menus or from the
panel, as you can with Blackbox, but it does come with a number of
different themes you can install manually.</p><p>One interesting feature is the extra blank bar that appears
when you set the <b  >TaskBarDoubleHeight</b> option in
the configuration file. This provides an area in which you can type
a command to launch programs without having to open an xterm. This
is nifty for all those times I do <b  >echo 123/54 |
bc</b>, which I do quite a bit. If the command (such as my
example) is not a program, it is run as a shell command.</p><p>Icewm, like Blackbox, is designed to have a small memory
footprint. Unlike Blackbox, it also tries to provide the icons and
fluff that many users expect from window managers these days.
Configuring menus can be done using some graphical tools, although
both tools are fairly crude. Chances are you'll probably end up
configuring menus by hand.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x141e580.0x150e968"></a>Sawmill (or Sawfish)</h2></div></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>URL:
<a href="http://sawmill.sourceforge.net" target="_self">sawmill.sourceforge.net</a></p></li><li><p>Requirements: Imlib, librep Lisp interpreter (0.9+)

source.</p></li></ul></div><p>Sawmill was, at one time, the default window manager for
GNOME on Red Hat distributions&mdash;or at least I think it was. I'm not
sure what they use these days. If you go to the main web site for
Sawmill, you'll find it's presented more as a developer's platform
than something an ordinary end user will be interested in. Use of
Lisp is probably technically appropriate, but is likely to scare
off the non-technical crowd.
</p><p>Unfortunately, Sawmill would not build on my stock Red Hat
5.2 system because it was missing GNU MP, yet another of the
massively obscure requirements so many packages seem to have these
days. Switching over to my Red Hat 6.1 box, I had the same problem,
so Sawmill never got built. Since there were multiple packages to
download, I didn't try the RPMs either. Sorry&mdash;plug-n-play is
essential here. One package, build and install. I'm not tolerant of
much more than that these days.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x141e580.0x150ee38"></a>FVWM</h2></div></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>URL:

<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4001f4.large.jpg"><img src="4001f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 4. My FVWM Theme</p></div></div>
</p><p>After all this, we're finally down to what I actually use
myself&mdash;FVWM2. It's one of the grandfathers, two or three times
removed in some cases, of most of the rest of the window managers
I've talked about. Why do I use it? Because I have an extensive
menu system designed around a minimalist display that I haven't
been able to duplicate with any of the other window managers. I
also adore the FVWM Pager. With it, I can move windows around
between desktops without actually having to move to those desktops.
I can also see at a glance what I have open. I tend to use three
desktops with multiple pages, and use the same pages for the same
things&mdash;xterms with logins to specific machines, Netscape running
across the network on different boxes but displayed locally, my
XNotesPlus package and so forth. With FVWM's pager, I can easily
see what I have open. Then I just click once to jump between
multiple projects&mdash;say, an article for <i  >Linux Journal</i>, some analysis for Linsight and administrative
work from my Graphics Muse site. It's a very handy tool. It also
lets me work without dealing with a bunch of nasty icons.</p><p>I haven't been able to find anything quite like this in any
of the other window managers in such a minimalist form.
Enlightenment's pagers are close, but Enlightenment has a heavy
memory requirement. With FVWM, I can run close to the same
configuration on any system I have, and I have a bunch. AfterStep
has a similar pager, but those big ugly icons annoy me.</p><p>Above all else, the window manager, to an old UNIX hack like
myself, should help me do my work. It shouldn't sing and dance in
front of me and <span   class="emphasis"><em>then</em></span> do the work. After
everything I've said about personalizing the workspace, my way of
doing so is to remove the visibility of the workspace, save for a
clever <span   class="emphasis"><em>X Files</em></span>-style background I generated
with the GIMP. I use a toolbar across the top of the display with a
ton of menus for launching various applications. It is a bit of an
annoyance that FVWM requires me to restart the window manager every
time I make a change to one of the menus, but it's only a minor
annoyance.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x141e580.0x150f678"></a>Series Summary</h2></div></div><p>So there you have it. A few other window managers are
probably out there, but we've covered all the ones with any serious
following on Linux. Using a window manager of your own choice isn't
too difficult, even if you plan on using GNOME or KDE, since most
window managers either already do or will soon support the two
primary Linux desktop environments. Your choice will be based more
on what you want to look at and how much hardware you have on which
to run it. In the end, the key is that you have a choice, and that
leaves you in <span   class="emphasis"><em>control</em></span> of your desktop.</p></div></div>
