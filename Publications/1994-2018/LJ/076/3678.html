    Graphical installation environments help Macintoshes play better than

    with Linux.

popularity over the last few years is, of course, an
understatement. One cannot read any computer-related medium today
without being bombarded with news and views on the Linux operating
system. Some would even have you believe that Linux has the chance
to unseat Windows as the operating system of popular choice. In the
Intel-based world, we can choose from several Linux packages that
can be installed on our machines. Intel-based Linux is even being
courted by the game publishers, with such popular titles as Quake
III now available.
</p><p>What some people may not realize is that Linux for the
PowerPC chip, usually on a Macintosh platform, is not far behind
and has experienced similar growth in the last few years since its
first inception as MkLinux back in 1996. Today, PowerPC users can
choose among the original MkLinux package, which still offers its
Mach kernel version of Linux, or the PowerPC and Yellow Dog
packages with their monolithic RPM-based distributions. New
distributions on the PowerPC chip horizon include SuSE, a popular
German-based package, TurboLinux, popular in Asia, and RockLinux,
billed as a &ldquo;power user&rdquo; distribution.</p><p>This article concentrates on the LinuxPPC distribution
package, its installation and use on the Macintosh PowerBook,
specifically the G3 Wallstreet PowerBook. Longtime readers of
<i  >Linux Journal</i> might find that odd, since I
wrote the breakthrough article on MkLinux back in 1996. As with
everything connected with Apple Computer, MkLinux went through some
difficulties in the late '90s. In the summer of 1998, Apple stopped
its support of MkLinux and development was turned over to the
MkLinux community, which caused a slowdown in support of Apple's
newer machines, as MkLinux was largely still working off of the DR3
kernel release. At the same time, I became a certified &ldquo;road
warrior&rdquo; by getting rid of my desktop machine and computing
exclusively on my Wallstreet G3 PowerBook. MkLinux's support of
that model was far from ready for prime time. I am happy to report,
however, that the MkLinux community has been busy generating what
they have called &ldquo;generic kernels&rdquo; that do support most of
Apple's latest machines, including the PowerBooks. However, since
that wasn't the case a couple of years ago, I migrated to the
LinuxPPC package.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10f4580.0x11ec818"></a>Installing LinuxPPC</h2></div></div><p>LinuxPPC recently released their LinuxPPC 2000 package. This
package contained, of course, various kernels in the
2.2.<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> range, including some specifically
compiled for certain models of Macintosh PowerBooks. Also included
are both the KDE and GNOME desktop environments, the Netscape
browser, and a Mac-on-Linux emulator that allows you to run the Mac
OS in a window from within Linux. The CD also contains the full
range of Linux development tools including GNU C, C++ and Java.
Nice extras include PalmPilot synchronization software for both the
KDE and GNOME environments. A second CD provides all relevant
source code.</p><p>If you're not willing to wait for the CDs or aren't into
development or the KDE desktop environment, you can download a
LinuxPPC 2000 &ldquo;lite&rdquo; version (see Resources). The LinuxPPC lite
version includes the basic system, libraries and the GNOME desktop
environment. The file is about 170MB, so even though it's not a
quick download, LinuxPPC did give some thought to those of us using
modem connections to the Internet.</p><p>One of the highly touted features of the LinuxPPC 2000
release is its user-friendly graphical installation environment.
The installation CD is meant to boot your system and load whatever
it needs onto the Macintosh in order to start installing Linux.
These components will vary from system to system, depending on
whether or not the &ldquo;Open Firmware&rdquo; of the computer involved is
well-supported, or whether the system boots better using the
included BootX utility that operates somewhat like LILO on
Intel-based machines. Due to oddities in the Open Firmware
implementation on the Wallstreet PowerBook G3, it commonly uses
BootX in order to load Linux, and the installer realizes this. Once
any Macintosh portion of the installation is done, the computer
reboots and continues with the Linux installation process.</p><p>The graphical installation environment now comes into play.
The computer will boot into Linux enough to give you a simple,
restricted X Window System environment. These simple windows will
guide you through disk partitioning, formatting, mounting, choosing
packages for installation and allowing you to choose your root
password. Upon reboot, your Linux installation is complete. If for
some reason the X environment will not load, the DOS-like Red Hat
installer (common with LinuxPPC in the past and familiar to anyone
who has loaded Red Hat Linux on anything in the last few years)
will automatically be invoked, allowing you to continue with your
installation.</p><p>Simple, right? Well, anyone who has ever installed Linux onto
any system knows that, try as the package companies may,
installation is never quite that simple. It's worth sharing a
couple of &ldquo;gotchas&rdquo; I experienced during my own installation. If
you'll be using BootX to do your LILO-like choosing between MacOS
and Linux, you must remember to reset the control panel from the
RAM disk used by the system to do the initial installation to the
root partition. Remember to write down which partition you use for
root, since you'll need it at this point.</p><p>If you're not an old hand at Linux installation, that is, if
the concept of the user-friendly installation interface is a
selling point for you, accept the fact that the initial default
desktop environment for the LinuxPPC installation will be GNOME.
This was a little disheartening to me, since I'm a KDE fan and I
wanted to set up KDE as my desktop environment. You are able to do
that, but let the installation install GNOME as the default at
first. Problems have been reported and experienced in getting KDE
to run right after installation, because the installer apparently
doesn't install the QT1x libraries that KDE needs. It's a simple
matter, upon reboot, to go into GNOME, install the libraries via
the RPM program if needed, then go into KDE. Once there, you can
modify and customize things easily.</p><p>The good news is the installation procedure, if allowed to
install the defaults, solved all the previous installation problems
I'd had with Xconfig in the past.</p><p>Congratulations! You now have a portable UNIX system that
would have run several colleges in the late '80s. So now, what can
you do with this newfound power on a PowerPC-based Macintosh
laptop?</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10f4580.0x11ecbe0"></a>Things to Do</h2></div></div><p>The great thing about laptops today is that, for most intents
and purposes, they are the equal of desktop machines. You may not
want to do heavy-duty video production on a PowerBook using any
operating system, but for writing, database work,
telecommunications, networking (<span   class="emphasis"><em>especially</em></span>
networking) and game playing, the PowerBook running Linux is the
equal of any machine in its class.</p><p>Programming can be a major use of a home-based Linux machine.
There is no better platform than Linux for learning to program.
UNIXl recently, I wouldn't have said that, because my concept of
programming in a UNIX environment was always command-line-based,
and professional programming has long since left the command-line
world. With the proliferation of X-based GUI environments like
GNOME and KDE, not only can a home-based Linux machine enable you
to get a good introduction in modern, object-oriented languages
like C++, Java and Tcl/Tk, but you have the opportunity to
significantly contribute to the Linux community as your skills
develop. Now you can develop those valuable skills on the bus ride
home with all the included development packages Linux can put on
your PowerBook.</p><p>A prime use for a home-based Linux machine is in networking.
The Internet was built, and continues to be dominated by,
UNIX-based machines. High-speed broadband Internet access has
entered the home, and it's here that Linux can play one of its most
useful roles. Included in any Linux computer is the ability to act
as a masquerading gateway machine, allowing many machines on one
side of the gateway machine to effectively share one Internet IP
address at the same time. This ability allows you to put all your
home machines onto an Internet connection simultaneously.</p><p>This use mandates grabbing the source code for the kernel you
are running (it's on the CD if you bought the package, and on the
Net if you downloaded the package) and recompile the kernel to
include IP masquerading. Once that's done, grab the latest version
of IP chains from
<a href="ftp://ftp.linuxppc.org" target="_self">ftp://ftp.linuxppc.org/</a>.
This tool will allow you to set up your IP masquerading gateway
very simply via scripts. More information on how this might be set
up for your machine can be found in the Linux on PowerPC
FAQ-O-Matic (see Resources).</p><p>Feel a little queasy right now at the thought of compiling
your own kernel? Well, especially for something as popular as IP
masquerading, someone has already done the work for you.
Investigate, via the Linux on PowerPC FAQ-O-Matic, the possibility
of using a pre-compiled kernel which has already been set up for
the features you need. With IP masquerading set up on an older
PowerPC Macintosh (even a PowerBook), your home can enjoy the same
networking possibilities, for a lower cost and less with
complexity, that large corporations did just a couple of years
ago.</p><p>Linux machines are better at multitasking their resources
than any other operating system on the market today. You have
unparalleled control over how much CPU time each application will
need on average. I use this ability to run such applications as
SETI@home and the RC5 code-cracking client in the background while
using my machine to do other things. Both projects have PPC Linux
versions available as binaries, or you can build your own client
from sources in the RC5 project's case. Here, the creativity of the
Linux programming community has shown through most strongly. For
both of these projects, Linux users have far more choice and
control over the information these clients are generating than with
either Windows or Mac OS. Use your portable Linux power to
contribute to the search for ET or to convince the government that
we need larger cryptography keys (see Resources).</p><p>How about everyday, real-world applications like word
processing, databases and spreadsheets? Even though Linux started
life as a &ldquo;geek project&rdquo;, significant progress is being made in
getting office productivity packages onto PPC Linux. Having said
that, I also have to report that PPC Linux is behind Intel-based
Linux in this regard. The &ldquo;version&rdquo; of Linux you're using isn't a
problem if you have the program's source code and can build the
binaries yourself, but commercial applications such as Corel
WordPerfect don't give their source code away for us to build PPC
versions of their programs. We have to persuade these companies
that there are enough of us out here in the PPC world to care
about!</p><p>Does this mean we're out in the cold? Of course not! More and
more progress is being made in educating companies to jump onto the
Linux bandwagon to offer PPC versions of their binaries. And, as is
usual with the Linux community, we've taken the bull by the horns
ourselves. One of the most exciting &ldquo;office productivity&rdquo;
projects currently taking place is KOffice, a Microsoft Office-like
program suite made to operate under KDE and licensed under the
GPL.</p><p>KOffice, which is currently designated &ldquo;alpha software&rdquo;,
consists of several parts. KWord is the suite's word processor. It
supports frames, multiple columns, headers, footers, numbering of
chapters, auto-correction, spell checking and templates. Import
filters that include Word97 are being written. The suite's
spreadsheet component is called Kspread. Other components include
KPresenter, KIllustrator, KImageShop, Katabase, KChart and KImage.
These components each do exactly what you might guess they would.
KIllustrator is a vector drawing program, whereas KImageShop is an
image processor and KImage is an image viewer.</p><p>What makes me excited about KOffice as opposed to other
possible productivity software offerings such as Corel WordPerfect
or Sun's StarOffice? Quite simply, KOffice is distributed under the
GPL. Leaving aside the legal, financial and possible moral issues
with regard to the GPL, the fact that KOffice is distributed under
that license means more than just being able to read and study the
source code. Even though KOffice might be directly marketed to the
x86 crowd, a recompile of the sources will make it a wonderful tool
for the portable PPC-chip folks. That's an advantage you don't get
with Corel or even Sun, as friendly as they have been to the Linux
and Macintosh communities. KDE is currently at version 1.1.2, with
the much-awaited version 2.0 due out by the time you read this.
KOffice is designed to be integrated into KDE as a collection of
components. Indeed, components and how KDE uses them are the main
difference between KDE V1.1.<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> and the upcoming
KDE V2.0.</p><p>Linux has continued its great advance into the
PowerPC/Macintosh world. Slowly&mdash;I think more slowly than most
Linux fans would want&mdash;the operating system is moving into an arena
where it might be generally useful. Still, right now, Linux is a
specialized operating system catering to developers, networkers and
IT professionals. With the ever-increasing hardware support in both
the Intel and PowerPC chip communities, and with GUI desktop
support given by such packages as KDE and GNOME, Linux is
positioning itself for mainstream big time. Already, this is
percolating down to us in the form of equal installations on laptop
computers, and attention by big-name publishers and developers in
both the Intel and PPC-based worlds. The future continues to look
bright.</p><p><a href="3678s2.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p><p><a href="3678s1.html" target="_self">The Good, The Bad</a></p></div></div>
