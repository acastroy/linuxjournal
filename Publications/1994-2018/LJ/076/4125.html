mean the system architecture) to have two screens, i.e., two
monitors on the same machine? Also with two graphics cards, of
course. Is it possible to have them running together, either in
text mode or serving X? And is it possible to have only one actual
X desktop, but two virtual ones projected over two different
screens?  &mdash;Eduardo Garcia, egarcia@msl.es</p><p>The &ldquo;two screens&rdquo; support you've mentioned is called
multi-headed display support. It is the ability to use two (three
and so on) monitors simultaneously and usually make them act as one
huge virtual desktop. The commercial X servers such as Accelerated
X (<a href="http://www.xig.com" target="_self">http://www.xig.com/</a>) and
Metro-X
(<a href="http://www.metrolink.com" target="_self">http://www.metrolink.com/</a>)
already have such support, and recently XFree supports this too
(but it is not stable enough, in my opinion). Be aware, though,
that your hardware (graphics card) must also support this.  &mdash;Mario
de Mello Bittencourt Neto, mneto@argo.com.br</p><p>With XFree 4.0, you can run X on two cards and two monitors,
either as independent sessions or as one big screen (Xinerama). It
should also be possible to get XFree 4.0 to open one X session on
the secondary screen (i.e., not the one Linux is displaying console
messages on) and keep text mode in the other monitor, but there
isn't a convenient way to switch back and forth between the two
screens (you'd have to use <b  >CTRL+ALT+FN</b>). Frame
buffer (FB) support will also work with two video cards, so my
guess is that the FB application gets to say which FB display to
write on.  &mdash;Marc Merlin, marc_bts@valinux.com</p><p>As installation of XFree86 4.0 is not for the faint-hearted,
you may want to hold off until RPM packages start to appear before
trying it.  &mdash;Erik Ratcliffe, erik@calderasystems.com</p><p>It depends on your X server software. XFree86 version 4
(which is more recent than the version included in your Red Hat
distribution) has some support for multi-headed configurations; you
can check their release notes under
<a href="http://www.xfree86.org" target="_self">http://www.xfree86.org/</a>.  &mdash;Scott

That is, when you use this system call, where exactly does it look
for the file we want to open?</p><p>&mdash;Kumhaar, kumhaar@yahoo.com</p><p>If you supply an absolute file name (that is, one that starts
with a &ldquo;/&rdquo;), then fopen starts at the root directory. Otherwise,
the file name is relative, so fopen starts looking for the file in
the process's current working directory. This directory is
initially the same as the parent process's current working
directory (so if you ran the program from a shell, it's whatever
directory you were in when you ran it), but the current working
directory can be changed by calling
<span   class="bold"><b>chdir</b></span> or
<span   class="bold"><b>fchdir</b></span>. By the way, as a pedantic
note, fopen is not a system call; it's a C library function.
<span   class="bold"><b>fopen</b></span> does part of its work in
terms of the system <span   class="bold"><b>call
open</b></span>.  &mdash;Scott Maxwell, maxwell@ScottMaxwell.org</p><p>The fopen library function is the analog of the low-level
open system call. You use it mainly for files and terminal
input/output. When you need explicit control over devices, you are
better off with the low-level system calls, as they eliminate
potentially undesirable side effects from libraries, like
input/output buffering.</p><p>If successful, fopen returns a non-null FILE * pointer. If it
fails, it returns the value NULL, defined in stdio.h.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>fopen</b></span> uses the open system
call. Here is how the open system call works:</p><p>1. When the kernel receives an open system call, it starts
the function called sys_open. You can find the code in the kernel
source in fs/open.c. <b  >sys_open (const char * filename, int
flags, int mode)</b></p><p>2. From the file name, sys_open will try to get the
associated inode structure. This inode structure is located in the
directory where the file is (the directory is a special file). To
get the inode of the directory with the relevant information,
sys_open will have to recurse by starting to read the current
directory to get the inode of the relative directory, and so
on.</p><p>If the file name starts with a /, the process is the same,
except that it will start with inode 2 (inode number of /) on the
root partition.</p><p>3. Once the inode of the file is found, sys_open will read
the file operation associated with the file's inode, and run the
open method associated with that inode/file.</p><p>This open method may be related to a device module if the
file is a device (see major number and /proc/devices) or to a
specific file system (<b  >df -k
<i><tt>filename</tt></i> -&gt; proc swap ext2</b>
...)</p><p>4. This open method returns a &ldquo;struct file *&rdquo; which is
associated with a file descriptor.</p><p>sys_open will return a file descriptor, an integer greater
than 0. If sys_open fails, it returns an integer less than 0. fopen
will then associate this file descriptor (int) to a file stream
(FILE *).</p><p>I hope this helps.  &mdash;Emmanuel-Robert Mayssat,
emayssat@valinux.com</p><p>fopen(2) takes two parameters. The first is the file to open,
and the second tells the system to open it for reading, writing,
reading and writing, and other options. If you do not specify a
path to the file to open, fopen() will look for that file in the
current directory.  &mdash;Chad Robinson, Chad.Robinson@brt.com</p><p>Feel free to refer to the manual pages: use Chapter 2 for the
system calls (e.g., <b  >man 2 open</b>) and Chapter 3
for library functions (<b  >man 3 fopen</b>).  &mdash;Alessandro
Rubini, alessandro.rubini@linux.it</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21f9580.0x22f1ea0"></a>Signal-7</h2></div></div><p>I have tried unsuccessfully to install Linux 6.1. Here's what
happens:</p><p>I put in the CD and the boot disk. The Linux program
decompresses all the &ldquo;running/sbin/loader&rdquo;. Then it waits a few
minutes and says:</p><pre     class="programlisting">

</pre><p>I have asked everyone I know what &ldquo;signal 7&rdquo; means, but to
no avail.
</p><p>&mdash;Michael C. Fields, kindra@2fords.net</p><p>Signal 7 is &ldquo;bus error&rdquo;, as reported by
/usr/include/asm/signal.h (included by /usr/include/signal.h, the
first place to look). This is most likely a hardware problem on
your box, similar to the &ldquo;signal 11&rdquo; (segmentation fault)
problem. Please refer to the sig11 FAQ at
<a href="http://www.bitwizard.nl" target="_self">http://www.bitwizard.nl/</a>.  &mdash;Alessandro
Rubini, alessandro.rubini@linux.it</p><p>You fail to mention which distribution you are trying to
install, but luckily, my crystal ball is telling me that it would
be Red Hat, or a derivative thereof. Signal 7 is SIGBUS, which
means that there are some hardware/driver issues. I'd try a newer
version of Red Hat or a different distribution in case a different
kernel helps on your machine.  &mdash;Marc Merlin,

Robinson, Chad.Robinson@brt.com</p><p>If you want to know more about parport, take a look at the
file Documentation/parport.txt in the kernel sources hierarchy. For
your personal use, you should use low-level inb/outb functions (try
<b  >man outb</b>). There is an excellent (of course :-))

Pentium III 450, with a SIS 620 video card and operating under
Windows 98. I succeeded in making the partition on the disk for
where to install OpenLinux, but when trying to install it, first it
appears on the screen where the recognition of the hardware of the
machine is made, and then the screen becomes frozen after showing
vertical gray lines. I don't know what the problem could be. Would
you help me?</p><p>&mdash;Susana Diaz, subediaz@satlink.com</p><p>The SiS 620 chipset is supported by the SVGA server, but for
whatever reason, it will not run in 16-color VGA mode (which is
what OpenLinux's graphic installer uses). What you'll need to do is
use the character-mode installation, then run either lizardx,
XF86Setup or xf86config after the installation is done to configure
the X Window System. The disk images for the character-mode
installation are found in the /col/launch/lisa/floppy directory.
Use RAWRITE (in DOS/Windows) or <span   class="bold"><b>dd</b></span>
(in UNIX/Linux) to transfer the install.144 image to a formatted
1.44MB diskette. Use the new diskette to launch the
installation.  &mdash;Erik Ratcliffe, erik@calderasystems.com</p><p>Many on-line help resources are available on the SSC web
