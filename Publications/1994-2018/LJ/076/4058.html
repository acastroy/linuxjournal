</p><p>The syslog d&aelig;mon takes messages sent through the syslog
applications programming interface (the openlog, syslog and
closelog library calls) and dispatches them to various files,
sockets, users, pipes, or the bit-bucket (meaning a
&ldquo;discard&rdquo;--any log message that doesn't match a selector in the
syslog.conf file is discarded). Kernel messages, however, cannot
use the syslog API.</p><p>The basic reason for this is that the syslog API is provided
by the kernel itself. Code that can be called by itself is said to
be &ldquo;reentrant&rdquo;. In order to be reentrant, a secondary call must
have no effect on a prior call. If code makes any use of global or
static variables, for example, it cannot be reentrant, since a
change to a static variable in the secondary call will change it in
the primary call.</p><p>Think about it this way: what would happen if a program were
in the middle of a syslog call when the kernel needed to call the
syslog function to report some kernel event? Unless the syslog call
were totally reentrant, the kernel call would clobber the
user-space call.</p><p>Many parts of the kernel are reentrant, either by being truly
reentrant or through the use of selective locking. It would be very
bad news indeed if a user-space program could block kernel
execution merely by getting stuck in a system call. For this reason
(among others), a very clean separation is maintained between the
functions that kernel-space code may use and the code that
user-space code may use. No kernel API function is dependent on the
state of any user-space call (or, to be a bit more precise, those
dependencies that exist are predictable and well understood). Thus,
the kernel doesn't have to worry about what user-space programs are
calling what user-space API functions from moment to moment. The
kernel code may simply get on with business.</p><p>The kernel does, however, need a way to send messages to
report abnormal situations, and, when debugging kernel layer code,
to &ldquo;see how far we got&rdquo;. Thus, the kernel has its own logging
API.</p><p>(For the curious, the user-space syslog call is provided by a
function in the kernel called <b  >sys_syslog</b>. The
kernel syslog call is called <b  >printk</b>. You can
find the source code for both in your own copy of the Linux kernel
source, which is more than likely to be in the /usr/src/linux
directory on your system. Go ahead and look. Remember, it's
<span   class="emphasis"><em>your</em></span> source!)</p><p>The kernel is built for simplicity and speed. Thus, the
kernel's conception of logging is a bit more basic than that of
syslog. Kernel messages are simple text with the convention that a
priority of 0 to 7 will be encoded in
<span   class="emphasis"><em>&lt;n&gt;</em></span> characters (where
<span   class="emphasis"><em>n</em></span> is the priority, from 0 to 7) prefixed to
the rest of the message text. The kernel logging API doesn't have
the concept of a &ldquo;facility&rdquo; as syslogd does. Level 7 is the
lowest priority and level 0 is the highest.</p><p>Sometimes, as when a protection fault occurs, the kernel logs
contain memory addresses. The protection fault report from a Linux
kernel isn't much use to anyone in debugging your problem, because
kernels are almost certainly locally compiled. Even if you have
never recompiled your kernel, the sheer number of distributions and
versions of distributions out there makes it impossible for someone
to help you with a raw protection fault log.</p><p>Fortunately, Linux kernels since 1.3.43 have reported
addresses in a standard format. The klogd program recognizes that
format and attempts to resolve addresses to symbol names so that
one can actually find the object or code an address refers to.
Later on, we'll cover how klogd does this.</p><p>These aspects of kernel messages (separate API, non-syslog
attributes and memory address resolution) are the reason for a
separate d&aelig;mon for kernel messages. There were (and are)
patched versions of syslog that pick up kernel messages, but this
practice is no longer popular, and with good reason. A clean
separation of user-space and kernel-space features makes sense. If
syslogd did some of these things, it would tie syslogd fairly
tightly to the kernel version. Of course, klogd is bound fairly
tightly, but this is considered much more acceptable, since it
&ldquo;encapsulates&rdquo; this &ldquo;dependent&rdquo; code and then passes it on to a
standard logging mechanism (syslogd).</p><p>So, what klogd does, basically, is read kernel log messages,
transforms them slightly (by resolving kernel memory addresses to
symbols) and then calls the user-space syslog API with the kernel
facility and the priority as encoded in the kernel message. This is
the d&aelig;mon's default behavior. Let's take a look at how the
default behavior can be modified.</p><p>First off, klogd does not have a configuration file as
syslogd does. Its behavior can be modified only through
command-line switches and signals. We'll cover the switches first,
then we'll discuss address resolution. Finally, we'll go over the
signals to which klogd responds.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xabf580.0xbb7d98"></a>Command-Line Switches</h2></div></div><p><b  >-c</b> Default console logging level. The
kernel writes log messages not only to the kernel message buffer,
but also to the system console (usually /dev/console). The default
level for the kernel is 7, which means that messages of a value
lower than 7 (higher priority) are written to the console. Often,
you will want to change this once klogd is running, so the console
isn't always scrolling through a lot of low-priority messages. The
klogd/syslogd combination gives you quite a bit more control over
your kernel messages than simply dumping them to a screen. You can
specify a number <span   class="emphasis"><em>n</em></span> here (ex. -c 4) where
messages of a value lower than but not equal to
<span   class="emphasis"><em>n</em></span> will go to the console. Note that klogd
doesn't route messages to the console itself. It merely provides
this interface to change the kernel's setting of the console
logging level. Keep in mind that lower values of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>n</em></span> are higher priority messages.</p><p><b  >-d</b> Debugging mode. This generates lots of
output on <b  >stderr</b>. Give it a try if you're
curious, although I do not recommend running this way for any
length of time.</p><p><b  >-f</b> Log messages to file. This switch
allows you to bypass the syslogd interface and log kernel messages
directly to a file. You lose all of syslogd's ability to separate
messages by facility and priority, to route a message to multiple
destinations, and to route to pipes, sockets and users. It has
obvious value, however, if for some reason you aren't running
syslogd! (Ex. <b  >-f /var/log/kernel.log</b>)</p><p><b  >-i</b>, <b  >-I</b> Signal the
currently running klogd. We'll go over these two switches (they are
distinct!) in the section on memory address resolution.</p><p><b  >-n</b> Do not auto-background. There are three
ways you might run a d&aelig;mon: by command at the console, by
startup script, or directly with the System V init model
(/etc/inittab). When you run with init, you don't want the process
to &ldquo;fork and die&rdquo; (which is how a *nix process puts itself in the
background; see chapter 2.6 of W. Richard Stevens' excellent book
<span   class="emphasis"><em>UNIX Network Programming</em></span> if none of this makes
any sense) as you would in the other two cases. Generally, this
need not concern you if klogd is already running on your
box.</p><p><b  >-o</b> One-shot mode. When started with this
option, klogd will read all the messages presently in the kernel
log buffer, and then it will exit.</p><p><b  >-p</b> Paranoia mode. This changes when klogd
loads kernel symbol data. We'll cover this in more detail in the
section on memory address resolution.</p><p><b  >-s</b> Force system call mode. Normally, klogd
checks at startup for the existence of the /proc/kmsg file. If it
is there, this is opened as the place to read kernel messages. If
it is not there, klogd will poll the kernel through a system call
for kernel messages. The /proc/kmsg is favored because it has lower
overhead, especially when there are no kernel messages (which is a
common case). You can override the preference for the /proc/kmsg
interface and force klogd to use the system call instead with this
switch.</p><p><b  >-k</b> Kernel symbol file. See the section on
memory address resolution.</p><p><b  >-v</b> Print version and exit. This document
is based on klogd 1.3-3.</p><p><b  >-x</b> Do not resolve addresses. See the
section on memory address resolution for more information.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xabf580.0xbb8840"></a>Memory Address Resolution</h2></div></div><p>(The following discussion presumes Linux running on an x86
processor. I would imagine other processors are similar, but I have
not examined the code for them, so I'm not prepared to state that
the following holds true for those processors.)</p><p>Let's begin by noting that real protection exceptions
resulting in kernel logs are very rare events. Most protection
faults occur in user-space code. User-space protection faults
result in a program termination and core file dump. You can use the
core file and your favorite debugger to post-mortem the
application. These events hardly bother the Linux kernel, which
merrily goes on handling all the other applications in the
system.</p><p>The faults we are talking about here are processor exceptions
that happen in kernel code. These are so rare that I have seen only
five since I started using Linux in 1993. Three of them occurred
when I was using the &ldquo;TAMU&rdquo; Linux release from Texas A&amp;M
University. We're talking pre-0.99 Linux. I think that was to be
expected. The next occurred when I had a dying hard drive and my
swap partition was the defective area. The fifth and last occurred
when I had an overheating CPU in my laptop. Since 1994, I haven't
seen one for any reason, excepting a hardware failure.</p><p>That said, they do happen. Some never-before-used combination
of hardware leads to a combination of kernel code never previously
run; or perhaps you are a daring soul and you are running a
development kernel. Whatever the reason, sometimes good code goes
bad. The good news is Linux is an open-source OS. You can fix the
bug. Or if not, you can post a bug report that goes directly to the
people who can fix the bug. Try <span   class="emphasis"><em>that</em></span> with
Windows!</p><p>When a protection fault occurs, Linux dumps out a dump of the
processor state, including all the registers and the last several
entries of the system stack. The latter is critical for finding the
source of the problem. Trouble is, the raw dump consists entirely
of memory addresses. Since Linux is an open-source system and since
many installations have been custom compiled, the likelihood that
these addresses will help anyone at a support desk to figure out
the problem is small indeed.</p><p>Luckily, if you built your kernel in a normal way, there is a
file called System.map installed with your kernel (probably in
/boot). This maps code and symbols to physical addresses. The klogd
d&aelig;mon reads this file. This takes care of all the
&ldquo;compiled-in&rdquo; kernel code, but since the
2.0.<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> kernel series, Linux has supported
kernel modules, which are dynamically loaded kernel-code modules.
These could be at any address, depending on which are loaded at a
given moment and in what order.</p><p>At program start, or in response to a signal, klogd will
query the kernel for a list of modules and their load addresses.
Kernel modules may register individual function or identifier
addresses with the kernel when they are loaded. The klogd
d&aelig;mon will use this information to report addresses in a
fault dump. It is important to note that module addresses from
klogd can be out of date! If modules are loaded or unloaded after
klogd is initialized, then these module/address resolutions will be
incorrect. Your distribution may take care of this for you by
providing scripted utilities to refresh klogd automatically. If it
does not, then some of the switches we skipped over earlier come
into play to help you keep the memory map up to date.</p><p>The <b  >-i</b> switch tells klogd to reload the
module symbols. The <b  >-I</b> tells klogd to reload the
System.map file. The <b  >-p</b> switch enables
&ldquo;paranoia&rdquo; mode. What this does is cause klogd to attempt to
reload the module symbols whenever it sees &ldquo;Oops&rdquo; in the kernel
message stream. Protection faults have this string in them. I
personally consider this kludgy, and I don't use it. Also, if there
has been a protection fault, it is possible that the kernel is
about to halt or the memory map may be in a corrupt state. It is
available if you want it. The <b  >-k</b> option allows
you to specify the file that contains the kernel symbol
information. See the section on multiple kernels below. The
<b  >-x</b> switch tells klogd to not read kernel and
module symbols and simply to dump the protection fault messages
untranslated.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xabf580.0xfb1068"></a>Multiple Kernels</h2></div></div><p>Linux beginners are unlikely to encounter this, but more
seasoned users will often have more than one bootable kernel on
their system at a time. If the box is a hobbyist or kernel hacker's
box, it is likely to have a number of stable and a number of
development series kernels on it. I myself always keep three
generations of stable kernels on my systems, so that if a bug
should show up, I can immediately reboot into the older
kernel.</p><p>When klogd starts, it identifies the kernel version (all
kernels since 1.3.43 put version information in the map files) and
then looks at:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/boot/System.map
/System.map
/usr/src/linux/System.map
</pre><p>It will use the kernel version information to choose the
correct one, if possible. When I have a development series kernel
on a box, I leave the stable kernel map in /boot and I leave the
development kernel map in /usr/src/linux. As for my two &ldquo;old&rdquo;
stable kernels, I just live with the fact that klogd will not be
able to resolve addresses in the event of a fault if I boot into
them. Remember, you can use the <b  >-k</b> switch on
klogd to force it to use a particular map file if you build an
archive of them.
</p><p>Just bear in mind as you read this discussion that these
events are so rare that in 15 machine years (three machines running
Linux 24x7 for five years), I have seen this happen twice, and both
times it was due to failing hardware.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xabf580.0xfb1328"></a>Signals</h2></div></div><p>In addition to the command-line switches, klogd will respond
to certain signals. You send signals with the
<span   class="bold"><b>kill</b></span> command.</p><p>The signals klogd responds to are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>SIGTSTP/SIGCONT</p></li></ul></div><p><b  >SIGTSTP</b> suspends and
<b  >SIGCONT</b> resumes kernel logging. The resuming
includes re-initialization, so you can use this to, for example,
unmount the /proc file system without killing klogd:
<pre     class="programlisting">
kill -TSTP &lt;pid&gt;
umount /proc
kill -CONT &lt;pid&gt;
</pre>


<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>SIGUSR1/SIGUSR2</p></li></ul></div>

<b  >SIGUSR1</b> causes a reload of the kernel module
symbols. <b  >SIGUSR2</b> reloads both the static kernel
symbols and the module symbols.
</p><p>See the Memory Address Resolution section for more
information.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>SIGINT/SIGHUP/SIGKILL/SIGTERM</p></li></ul></div><p>These signals all gracefully shut down klogd.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xabf580.0xfb1ab8"></a>Summary</h2></div></div><p>The klogd works with syslogd to handle the dispatch of kernel
messages. It exists solely because the kernel itself is unable to
use the syslog API directly. Klogd provides for resolving raw
memory addresses into kernel symbol names.</p></div></div>
