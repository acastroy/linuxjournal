    This Perl-based web helper and MySQL work together to let you
    quickly build a user registration system for your web site.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1258580.0x1350768"></a></h2></div></div><p>Over the last two months, we looked at
the Perl-based web development known as Mason. Mason, written and
maintained by Jonathan Swartz, is based on the idea of
&ldquo;components&rdquo;, flexible templates that can contain HTML, Perl
code, or a bit of each. Mason makes it possible to create large,
dynamic web sites in a relatively short period of time. Moreover,
it lends itself to easy and extensive code reuse, removing many of
the common maintenance issues associated with web sites.
</p><p>Because Mason is traditionally run on top of
<span   class="bold"><b>mod_perl</b></span>, an Apache module that
places a complete Perl binary inside of the web server, it can take
advantage of other Perl modules developed for mod_perl. One
particularly useful example of such a module is
<span   class="bold"><b>Apache::Session</b></span>, which makes it
possible to get around some of the problems associated with HTTP's
statelessness.</p><p>This month, we will look at Apache::Session, using it to
create a simple user registration system based on Mason. This
system can make it relatively simple to create a personalized web
site, connecting information in a relational database with a
particular user.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1258580.0x13509d0"></a>Session Management</h2></div></div><p>HTTP was designed to be a lightweight protocol, with each
transaction taking a minimum amount of time. As a result, it is
fairly minimalist, with each connection consisting of a single
request-response pair. (Modern versions of HTTP support multiple
request-response pairs within a single transaction, but my
impression is that the single-transaction version 1.0 is still the
norm.)</p><p>In this model, the HTTP client connects to the server, sends
a request and an optional parameter, and then one or more headers
that describe the browser's capabilities. The HTTP server then
returns one or more headers describing the response, followed by
the response itself. The response can be an HTML-formatted text
document, an image, or an error message indicating that the request
could not be fulfilled. After the server sends this response, it
closes the connection.</p><p>Because each HTTP transaction takes place in a vacuum,
without any information from other transactions, it is difficult to
keep track of a user's actions. The web has no sense of &ldquo;logging
in&rdquo; or &ldquo;logging out&rdquo;, unlike a traditional computer environment.
It is impossible to know whether five HTTP requests were initiated
by five separate users on the same computer, or one user interested
in five different URLs.</p><p>Two main techniques get around these problems. The first,
called &ldquo;cookies&rdquo;, allows the server to store a name-value pair on
the user's computer. The cookie is set in a &ldquo;Set-Cookie&rdquo; header
at the beginning of the server's HTTP response. Every time the
browser returns to a site within this server's domain, it sends a
&ldquo;Cookie&rdquo; header as part of the request, with the name-value pair
that was previously stored. Cookies are limited in length, can be
deleted by a browser at any time and can easily be inspected and
modified by a user.</p><p>Another technique, which we will not explore this month,
involves the use of a URL's &ldquo;path_info&rdquo; segment. For example,
consider the URL
<a href="http://www.example.com/cgi-bin/foo.pl/abc/def" target="_self">www.example.com/cgi-bin/foo.pl/abc/def</a>.
If /cgi-bin/foo.pl exists on the server, then /abc/def is passed as
an additional argument that exists separately from any name-value
pairs submitted from the client.</p><p>While neither cookies nor path_info is a perfect solution for
the issue of state on the Web, they are sufficient for most needs.
However, these solutions address only the problems with HTTP; they
don't provide a means for giving our programs a sense of
state.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Apache::Session</b></span> bridges this
gap, making it possible to associate arbitrary information along
with a user. (We will soon discover that things are not quite this
simple, but the overall principle is sound.)
<span   class="bold"><b>Apache::Session</b></span>, which is
available from CPAN, works with either cookies or path_info, and
can store information using mechanisms ranging from ASCII files to
relational databases. It is designed to work with mod_perl, and
thus works with Mason; the documentation indicates that
Apache::Session should also work under CGI, although I have not
tested this claim.</p><p>Because of their versatility and speed, and because
Apache::Session works best when associated with additional
information in a relational database, we will use MySQL for our
back end, called the &ldquo;object store&rdquo; in the module's
documentation. In order to do this, we will need to create a table
named &ldquo;sessions&rdquo; in our database, which looks something like
this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
CREATE TABLE sessions (
    id CHAR(16),
    length INT(11),
    a_session TEXT
);
</pre><p><span   class="bold"><b>Apache::Session</b></span> requires the
table to be named <span   class="bold"><b>sessions</b></span> and
that it contain three columns: an
<span   class="bold"><b>id</b></span> column of type
<b  >CHAR(16)</b>, a
<span   class="bold"><b>length</b></span> column of type
<b  >INT(11)</b> and an
<span   class="bold"><b>a_session</b></span> column of type TEXT or
BLOB, which can contain any amount of binary data.
</p><p>Each unique session is identified by a unique 16-character
string, stored in the id column. The actual session data is stored
in the a_session column, in the &ldquo;nfreeze&rdquo; format defined by the
Storable module. (Storable is also available from CPAN.)</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1258580.0x13511b8"></a>Apache::Storable and Mason</h2></div></div><p>Each time a user's browser sends an HTTP request to the web
server, it sends whatever cookies have been stored by that domain.
So if a cookie was set by cnn.com, my browser will return only that
cookie&mdash;which is, after all, simply a name-value pair&mdash;when I visit
<a href="http://www.cnn.com" target="_self">http://www.cnn.com/</a>
again.</p><p>The cookie version of
<span   class="bold"><b>Apache::Storable</b></span> takes advantage
of this by storing a unique identifier in a cookie. This unique
identifier corresponds to the id column in the sessions table. This
allows us to retrieve any data that have been stored in a_session.
Because a_session is defined to be infinitely long, the amount of
data we can store is limited only by our database and our file
system.</p><p>Data stored in table sessions by Apache::Session is available
to programs via the global <b  >%session</b> hash.
<span   class="bold"><b>%session</b></span> is created anew for each
incoming HTTP request, and refers to only the data stored in
a_session. Storing something in %session places it in the a_session
column, and retrieving something from %session gets the value from
a_session. Assuming that the variables
<b  >$first_name</b>, <b  >$last_name</b> and
<b  >$email</b> contain the appropriate pieces of
information, we could store them reliably with the following lines
of Perl:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$session{first_name} = $first_name;
$session{last_name} = $last_name;
$session{email} = $email;
</pre><p>Since each user (actually, each session) is stored in a
separate row of the database, we do not need to worry about users
clashing with each other.
</p><p>In order for sessions to work, we must make a connection
between the <span   class="bold"><b>Apache::Session::DBI</b></span>
module and the corresponding sessions table on disk. This
connection must take into account three different possibilities:
(a) that the user sends us a valid ID cookie, (b) that the user
sends us an invalid ID cookie, and (c) that the user sends us no ID
cookie at all.</p><p>The first case is the easiest; the program merely needs to
re-establish the connection between %session and the appropriate
row in sessions, using Perl's &ldquo;tie&rdquo; mechanism. In the second
case, the program must create a new session if it could not
re-establish a previous one. And if the user sends no cookie at
all, then we must create a new row in sessions, attach a unique ID
to it and send that unique ID to the user's browser in the form of
a cookie.</p><p>When working with Mason, we put all this in our start-up
file. This file, which the Mason documentation calls handler.pl
(but which I prefer to call mason.pl), defines all of Mason's main
behaviors and allows us to define global variables that other
elements of the system will require. Defining %session in mason.pl
also ensures that it is available in all Mason components. See
Listing 1 for a simple example of mason.pl for a site that wants to
include sessions. (Much of Listing 1 comes straight from the Mason
documentation.)</p><p><a href="4143l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a></p><p>The most important part of this file is a call to Perl's
<span   class="bold"><b>eval</b></span> command.
<span   class="bold"><b>eval</b></span> comes in two forms, one of
which takes a code block as an argument, and forms as a primitive
form of error-checking. Inside our code block, we attempt to use
Perl's <span   class="bold"><b>tie</b></span> command to connect the
hash
<span   class="bold"><b>%HTML::Mason::Commands::session</b></span> to
the Apache::Session::DBI module. Tying these two together means
that the default storage and retrieval mechanism associated with
hashes no longer applies for %session&mdash;when we retrieve or modify
its value, one or more methods in Apache::Session::DBI will take
over:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
eval {
    tie %HTML::Mason::Commands::session, 'Apache::Session::DBI',
        ($cookies{'AF_SID'} ? $cookies{'AF_SID'}-&gt;value() : undef),
        {
         DataSource =&gt; $dbsource,
         UserName =&gt; $dbuser,
         Password =&gt; $dbpass
        };
};
</pre><p>If this eval is unsuccessful, the variable
<b  >$@</b> will contain the error message. Here, we test
to see if the object exists in the data store. If so, then we
assign the user a new session:
<pre     class="programlisting">
if ( $@ )
{
    if ( $@ =~ m#^Object does not exist in the data store# )
    {
        tie %HTML::Mason::Commands::session,
'Apache::Session::DBI',
            undef,
            {
             DataSource =&gt; $dbsource,
             UserName =&gt; $dbuser,
             Password =&gt; $dbpass
            };
        undef $cookies{'AF_SID'};
       }
}
</pre>


Finally, if the user does not pass us any identifying
<span   class="bold"><b>AF_SID</b></span> cookie at all, we create a
new one and tell <span   class="bold"><b>mod_perl</b></span> to send
it along with the rest of the outgoing headers:
<pre     class="programlisting">
if ( !$cookies{'AF_SID'} )
{
    my $cookie =
       new CGI::Cookie(-name =&gt; 'AF_SID',
                       -value =&gt;
                       $HTML::Mason::Commands::session{_session_id},
                       -path =&gt; '/',);
    $r-&gt;header_out('Set-Cookie', =&gt; $cookie);
}
</pre>


Once these are in place, any Mason component can store and retrieve
information in %session.
<span   class="bold"><b>Apache::Session's</b></span> use of the
Storable module means that references and complex data structures
(such as arrays of arrays, and hashes of hashes) can be stored in
%session without us having to worry about losing data.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1258580.0x13485a0"></a>What Do We Store?</h2></div></div><p>Just because we <span   class="emphasis"><em>can</em></span> store anything in
<span   class="bold"><b>%session</b></span> does not mean we
necessarily should. For instance, a site that wants to keep track
of users' names and e-mail addresses could potentially store this
information in %session. While doing so makes the information
readily available from within Mason components, it creates other
problems. For instance, it would be difficult to retrieve the rows
of &ldquo;sessions&rdquo; and use them to create a mass mailing to
subscribers' e-mail addresses.</p><p>For this reason, I generally use Apache::Session to store
only one value, the primary key associated with the user's row in a
<span   class="bold"><b>Users</b></span> table. (There are other ways
to accomplish the same task, such as including the user's unique
16-character ID field in the Users table and adding a &ldquo;UNIQUE&rdquo;
constraint on it.) If
<span   class="bold"><b>$session{user_id}</b></span> exists, then we
can assume the user has previously registered, and use that value
to retrieve other information from Users. If $session{user_id} does
not exist, then we assume the user is new to our system.</p><p>Here is one possible definition for a Users table which we
can use in this way:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
CREATE TABLE Users (
    user_id MEDIUMINT AUTO_INCREMENT,
    username VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    password VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
    password_hint VARCHAR(60) NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY(user_id),
    UNIQUE(username),
    UNIQUE(email)
);
</pre><p>We define all of the columns in this database as NOT NULL,
meaning that they are mandatory fields. Aside from the user's
unique ID (which is automatically generated by MySQL), user name
and e-mail address, we require a password and a password hint. As
we will see, these will allow us to create a full login system, and
to handle some of the problems associated with HTTP cookies.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1258580.0x1348968"></a>Registration Components</h2></div></div><p>Now that we have defined a Users table, it is time to define
some Mason components. Some of these components will be similar to
subroutine, and others will be similar to HTML fragments. As we saw
last month, both are acceptable (and welcome) types of Mason
components. I typically use an .html suffix on top-level components
that are visible to the user, and a .comp suffix on others&mdash;but you
may wish to set up your own conventions.</p><p>Before we do anything else, we will need a component that
allows us to connect to the database, and to retrieve a database
handle (traditionally known as <b  >$dbh</b>). Because
Mason typically runs under mod_perl, we will take advantage of the
<span   class="bold"><b>Apache::DBI</b></span> module, which keeps a
database connection open even after an HTTP request has been
served. Reusing database connections in this way dramatically
increases the speed of our application, since logging in to a
database can be relatively slow.</p><p>Listing 2 contains a simple Mason component that connects to
the database and returns a valid <b  >$dbh</b>. By
putting this functionality inside one component, we avoid having to
include that code inside every other component on the site.
Moreover, it means that if we have to modify the data source name
(&ldquo;DSN&rdquo; in Perl lingo), we can do so by changing one file.</p><p><a href="4143l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2</a></p><p>Notice how database-connect consists solely of
<b  >&lt;%perl&gt;</b> and
<b  >&lt;%once&gt;</b> sections, without any HTML. This
is an example of a component that acts purely as a Perl subroutine,
returning a value to its caller. By contrast, Listing 3 contains
register-form.html, a top-level component that contains only a few
lines of Perl. The majority of register-form.html is straight HTML,
and can be written by a graphic designer, rather than a
programmer.</p><p><a href="4143l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3</a></p><p>Registering is a relatively straightforward process.
Information typed into register-form.html is sent to register.html
(see Listing 4). The latter retrieves the name-value pairs from the
form, placing them into scalar variables using the Mason
<b  >&lt;%args&gt;</b> section. If one or more elements
are missing, register.html gives the user an error message
indicating that the information needs to be updated.</p><p><a href="4143l4.html" target="_self">Listing 4</a></p><p>If the user's registration information appears to be
complete, register.html performs a quick SELECT to ensure that the
user name will indeed be unique. True, we have defined the table
such that a user name must be unique, but we would rather produce a
nice-looking error message for our users than display an error
message from the database.</p><p>Note that this code creates a race condition; it is possible
that two users could try to register with the same user name
simultaneously. Both would be told that the user name is available,
and yet only one would be allowed to insert the requested user
name. Databases that support transactions, such as PostgreSQL, can
avoid this problem by wrapping the <b  >SELECT</b> and
the following <b  >INSERT</b> into a single transaction,
which can then be rolled back if there is an error.</p><p><a href="4143l5.html" target="_self">Listing 5</a></p><p><span   class="bold"><b>register-form.html</b></span> attempts
to be somewhat helpful, reminding users if they are already logged
in. (After all, there usually isn't any reason to register if
you're already logged in.) It uses the component get-user-info.comp
(see Listing 5), which takes one argument (a user ID) and returns a
hash reference describing the user with that ID. Since user IDs are
stored in %session with the
<span   class="bold"><b>user_id</b></span> key, we can retrieve a
hash reference with user information as follows:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
my $user_info = $m-&gt;comp("get-user-info.comp",
                          user_id =&gt; $session{user_id});
</pre><p>If <b  >$session{user_id}</b> is undefined&mdash;that
is, if the user has no session&mdash;then get-user-info.comp returns
undef. Otherwise, a program can retrieve information for the user
with the hash reference's keys. Indeed, the top of
register-form.html demonstrates this:
<pre     class="programlisting">
% if ($user_info) {
&lt;P&gt;You are currently logged in as &lt;b&gt;&lt;% $user_info-&gt;{username} %&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. Do
you really want to register?&lt;/P&gt;
% } else {
&lt;P&gt;You are not logged in. Go ahead and register!&lt;/P&gt;
% }
</pre>


</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1258580.0x1349468"></a>Logging In and Out</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>register.html</b></span> automatically
logs in a user. By this, we mean that it sets the value of
<b  >$session{user_id}</b> to a valid primary key for the
Users table. When $session{user_id} is set, a user is said to be
logged in; when it is undefined, the user is not.</p><p><a href="4143l6.html" target="_self">Listing 6</a></p><p>Logging out a user, then, is as simple as undefining the
value $session{user_id}. We do exactly this in Listing 6,
logout.html. Once a user visits this page, he or she is no longer
logged in. Note that the line</p><pre     class="programlisting">
undef $session{user_id};
</pre><p>does not remove the user_id key from %session. Rather, it
assigns the undefined value to $session{user_id}.
</p><p>If a user fails to log out, then the session will remain
active for as long as the session cookie exists. Cookies are
normally assigned an expiration date when they are created,
indicating the maximum date on which they should be transmitted to
a server. If no expiration date is mentioned, the cookie should
disappear when the user exits from the browser. Session cookies are
normally set with the latter expiration date, forcing them to
disappear when the user quits from the browser.</p><p>However, this doesn't mean that users can ignore the
&ldquo;logout&rdquo; button. On the contrary, someone who fails to log out is
effectively saying that any HTTP requests originating from a
particular computer should be attributed to his or her user name.
In a typical office, where everyone has their own computer, this
might not be a serious issue. However, a student in a recent class
I taught told me that she was able to read someone else's e-mail at
an Internet cafe, because Yahoo! Mail had failed to log out the
previous user.</p><p>If the information is particularly sensitive, you might want
to force users to re-register every 15 or 30 minutes. Simply set
the cookie expiration date and time to be something in the very
near future, and the cookies will expire automatically.</p><p>Logging in is slightly more complicated, in that we must ask
the user for a user name and password. These pieces of information,
supplied from login-form.html (listing 7), are passed to the
<span   class="bold"><b>login.html</b></span> component (listing 8).
<span   class="bold"><b>login.html</b></span> performs two tasks: it
submits a <b  >SELECT</b> query to the database,
requesting the user_id column for the submitted user name and
password. If no such row exists,
<b  >$sth-&gt;fetchrow_array</b> returns undef, and we
thus know that the user does not exist. If it does exist, then we
retrieve all the relevant information about this user into a hash
reference and set $session{user_id} to the newly rediscovered user
ID. This restores the session information to the user's browser,
which sets it in a cookie (or path_info, as appropriate).</p><p><a href="4143l7.html" target="_self">Listing 7</a></p><p><a href="4143l8.html" target="_self">Listing 8</a></p><p>While there is no room to discuss it here, it would obviously
not be very difficult to create a &ldquo;password-remind.html&rdquo;
component which allows users to retrieve their password using the
hint they entered in the initial registration form.</p><p>Of course, personalized sites are rather uninteresting if
they store only the user's name and e-mail address. Things get much
more interesting if the site keeps track of users' interests,
birthdays and stock portfolios. But once we have a unique ID that
represents this user&mdash;the user_id column in Users&mdash;we can create as
many tables as we like, identifying each user with their primary
key.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1258580.0x1349ca8"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>Session management can be a tricky subject when working with
the Web, since it means using a stateless connection for something
it was never intended to do. With the help of Mason and
Apache::Session, it is not difficult to develop a personalized site

output accordingly.</p><p><a href="4143s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
