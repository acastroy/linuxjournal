    No hype here&mdash;find out what Java really is and what choices
    you have with Java for Linux.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19c0580.0x1ab8558"></a></h2></div></div><p>Given the amount of hype that Linux and
Java are currently receiving, the combination of the two rates a
solid 12 on a hype scale ranging from 1 to 10. However, being an
engineer&mdash;and thus a skeptic&mdash;at heart, I prefer hard facts over
marketing slogans. So, I set out to create a simple benchmark
program to compare different Java implementations for Linux.
</p><p>No matter what the hype says, I believe the most important
contribution of Java is that it is simply a very well-designed
programming language that most professionals enjoy using. Some of
the features of Java that make it attractive for software engineers
are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Java is a &ldquo;pure&rdquo; object-oriented programming
language (unlike C++, which is a hybrid), with a simple and elegant
object model. Depending on your point of view, this may be an
advantage or disadvantage. My personal experience is that
programmers who are new to objects get up to speed a lot faster if
they use &ldquo;pure&rdquo; OO languages such as Smalltalk, Eiffel or Java as
opposed to hybrids such as C++.</p></li><li><p>Java avoids many of the complexities of C++, thus
making programs less error-prone and programmers more productive.
For example, in Java there is only one way to make a new object:
you call the new operator and get a reference (or pointer, if you
like) to the object. Compare this to the many ways to create
objects in C++.</p></li><li><p>Java needs no preprocessor and therefore is immune
to &ldquo;macroitis&rdquo; and endlessly nested include files.</p></li><li><p>Java has a garbage collector to free memory
consumed by objects which are no longer used. In C and C++, a fair
amount of design and programming work must be spent on memory
allocation and deallocation schemes. Freeing objects in Java is
automatic (as it is in Smalltalk and Eiffel).</p></li><li><p>The sizes of basic data types such as int and float
are defined by the Java language specification, so an int is always
32 bits, regardless of the platform your program runs on. How often
have you implicitly assumed that a pointer has the same size as an
integer in a C program, and suffered the consequences when you
ported your program to an architecture where this is not
true?</p></li><li><p>Finally, Java has built-in support for
multithreading and synchronization of multiple threads, and comes
with a huge class library out of the box (although some people,
including myself, feel that the library has gotten too huge
lately).</p></li></ul></div><p>Java is still not a standardized language, and it is doubtful
if it will ever be. Sun has the final say over what's in the
language and the libraries and what isn't, period. The &ldquo;Java 2
Platform&rdquo; or simply the Java Developer Kit (JDK) V1.2 has about
1200 classes in its libraries. Sun ships its JDK on Solaris/SPARC,
Solaris/Intel, Windows-32 and recently on Linux, too. IBM has
recently released a JDK 1.3 implementation for Linux. I ran the
benchmark with this JDK on the same hardware and OS as all other
benchmarks and got the following numbers:
</p><p>Elapsed time: 1384 millisecondsObjects / millisecond:
361Output of java-version: Classic VM (J2RE 1.3.0 IBM
buildcxdev-20000502 (JIT enabled: jitc))</p><p>Sun's JDK achieves platform independence of Java programs by
relying on an architecture-neutral intermediate code called
&ldquo;bytecode&rdquo;, which is interpreted on each target machine. The
interpreter is called a &ldquo;Java Virtual Machine&rdquo; or JVM for
short.</p><p>Since interpretation is slow, most JVMs come with a Just in
Time Compiler (JIT). A JIT translates bytecodes into machine code
on the fly, i.e., while the interpreter is running. The resulting
machine code is stored in memory and lost when the interpreter
terminates. Generally speaking, pure interpreters show faster
program startup times, while a JVM with a JIT takes longer to start
(because it compiles bytecodes); but once a program is up and
running, it is faster than an interpreted program. There are many
optimizations that can be made to interpreters and JIT compilers.
Sun's &ldquo;Hotspot&rdquo; JVM, which is not yet available under Linux, but
should be eventually, is one attempt to get the best from both
worlds.</p><p>Finally, there is nothing in the Java language specification
which prevents the application of standard compiler technology,
i.e., compiling Java source code directly into machine code. The
Java front end to the GNU compiler system does just that.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19c0580.0x1ab8ce8"></a>Java Implementations for Linux</h2></div></div><p>At the time of this writing, there were quite a few Java
implementations available for Linux. These are the ones I am aware
of and was able to get to work:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The Blackdown port of the Sun JDK, version 1.2.2. I
tested release candidate 4 of this port, which includes both an
interpreter and a JIT. The JIT is a port of the JIT shipped by Sun
with the JDK for Solaris. By default, the JIT is enabled, but it
can be turned off with a command-line switch. The documentation
that comes with this port warns that the JIT is not yet entirely
reliable. I downloaded this port from one of the numerous Blackdown
FTP mirrors, which are accessible from Blackdown's homepage at
<a href="http://www.blackdown.org" target="_self">http://www.blackdown.org/</a>.</p></li><li><p>Sun's own version of the Blackdown port of Sun's
JDK, version 1.2.2. Recently Sun began to publish a JDK for Linux
on their own web site. This port is, as far as I can tell, the same
as published by the Blackdown folks. There is at least one
noticeable difference though: Sun's version comes without a JIT; it
is an interpreter only. However, Sun recommends using the JIT
developed by Borland. I downloaded this port from Sun's Javasoft
web site at
<a href="http://www.javasoft.com" target="_self">http://www.javasoft.com/</a>.</p></li><li><p>Borland's JIT for the Sun and Blackdown ports of
the JDK 1.1.2. This is not a complete Java developer kit; it is
only a JIT. It works with the Blackdown port of Sun's JDK 1.2.2,
and hence with the Linux JDK 1.2.2 published by Sun. I downloaded
this JIT, which is a simple shared library of about 170KB, from
Borland's web site at
<a href="http://www.borland.com" target="_self">http://www.borland.com/</a>.</p></li><li><p>The Blackdown port of the Sun JDK 1.1.8. I tested
version 1 of this port, which only includes an interpreter (unlike
the Windows version which comes with a JIT).</p></li><li><p>IBM's JDK version 1.1.8 for Linux. This JDK has a
reputation of being &ldquo;very fast&rdquo; and also very stable. It comes
with a JIT, which is enabled by default, but can be turned off with
a command-line switch. I downloaded this JDK from IBM's web site at
<a href="http://www.ibm.com" target="_self">http://www.ibm.com/</a>.</p></li><li><p>Kaffe version 1.0b4 from Transvirtual Technologies.
Kaffe was developed by Tim Wilkonson and others from scratch,
without any code from Sun. The version of Kaffe I used is
compatible with Sun's JDK 1.1. I used the Kaffe package which is on
the Red Hat 6.1 CD-ROM; however, there is a web site devoted to the
open-source version of Kaffe at
<a href="http://www.kaffe.org" target="_self">http://www.kaffe.org/</a>.
Kaffe is available for a wide range of UNIX versions and processor
architectures, not just for Linux on x86 processors. The version of
Kaffe I used includes a JIT, which is always on, or at least, I
couldn't figure out how to turn it off.</p></li><li><p>The native Java compiler from Cygnus Support
shipped with their Codefusion-1.0 development environment. This
compiler is an enhanced version of EGCS, the Experimental GNU
Compiler System, although you can hardly call this high-quality
compiler &ldquo;experimental&rdquo; any more. Unlike all other Java
implementations I looked at, this compiler generates native code
which is link-compatible with object files created from C and C++
source files. The compiler comes with a library with the necessary
runtime support for Java programs, which includes, among other
things, a garbage collector. The version of EGCS I used
(&ldquo;2.9-codefusion-990706&rdquo;) is not free; you have to buy it from
Cygnus. Their web site is at
<a href="http://www.cygnus.com/" target="_self">www.cygnus.com/</a>
or

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19c0580.0x1ab9790"></a>The Benchmark</h2></div></div><p>Let's start this section with a disclaimer: writing
meaningful benchmark programs is very difficult, and no single
benchmark can do justice to all aspects of a complex system such as
a Java implementation. The benchmark I used is no exception. There
are many issues it doesn't address; for example, it doesn't cover
multi-threading issues, database access or graphics
performance.</p><p>That said, let's look at the benchmark. The benchmark program
does what most object-oriented programs do from a technical point
of view: creating objects and calling methods on them. More
specifically, the benchmark creates half a million very simple
account objects, adds an amount to each object created, then adds
up the amounts of all objects. The result of the benchmark is the
elapsed time it takes to create and process all objects, and
derived from that, the number of objects created and processed per
millisecond.</p><p>I ran all benchmarks on a Dell Latitude CP Notebook with a
233MHz CPU and 128MB of RAM under Red Hat Linux 6.1. The code of
the benchmark program is given in Listing 1.</p><p><a href="4005l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1. Java Benchmark Source
Code</a></p><p>As already said, this benchmark is not perfect, but I think
it does give an indication of the relative performance of different
Java implementations on the same platform.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19c0580.0x1ab9a50"></a>Results</h2></div></div><p>Now to the results. It comes as no big surprise that a JIT is
generally faster than an interpreter, and native code is even
faster than a JIT. Table 2 summarizes the results.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4005t2.large.jpg"><img src="4005t2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Table 2. Java Benchmark Results</p></div></div>
</p><p>There are some observations I feel are worth mentioning.
First, Java 1.2 implementations are generally faster than Java 1.1
implementations. This is a strong argument to choose Java 1.2 over
Java 1.1, in addition to the much greater functionality offered by
Java 1.2. Second, the fastest Java 1.2 implementation is currently
the Blackdown port with the JIT enabled. The JIT provided by
Borland does not speed things up, at least not in this benchmark.
Third, if you have to stick with Java 1.1 (e.g., for compatibility
reasons), your best options are currently Kaffe 1.0b4 and IBM's JDK
1.1.8 with the JIT enabled. Fourth, if you don't need Java
bytecodes and Java 1.2, the fastest option of all is to use the
Java front end of EGCS. I was not able to test the open-source
version of EGCS with <span   class="bold"><b>gcj</b></span>, but I
suspect the performance of it is within a few percentage points of
the version sold commercially by Cygnus/Red Hat.</p><p>Finally, I ran the benchmark on the same hardware with Sun's
JDK 1.2.2 on Windows NT 4.0 with service pack 5. The results are
disappointing for Linux aficionados. The benchmark reports 198
objects per millisecond with the JIT enabled, and 133 objects per
millisecond in interpreter mode. In other words, the Java
interpreter on Windows is faster than the fastest JIT available for
Linux, and the Windows JIT is faster than native code on Linux. As
long as Java performance on Linux is not as good as on Windows, I
don't think Linux will become the platform of choice for Java
developers. Let's hope that in the near future companies such as
Sun or IBM invest at least as much time in tuning Java on Linux as
they do in tuning Java on Windows now.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19c0580.0x1ab0700"></a>What About C++?</h2></div></div><p>Being a longtime C and C++ programmer, I could not resist the
temptation to write a similar benchmark in C++. Listing 2 has the
code of the C++ version of the benchmark.</p><p><a href="4005l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2. C++ Benchmark Source
Code</a></p><p>I compiled the C++ benchmark program with both the standard
C++ compiler that comes with Red Hat 6.1 (EGCS 2.91.66) and the C++
compiler included in Cygnus's Codefusion 1.0 development
environment. Table 3 shows the results of the C++ benchmark.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4005t3f.large.jpg"><img src="4005t3f.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Table 3. C++ Benchmark Results</p></div></div>
</p><p>The benchmark shows that a comparable C++ program is still
faster, by a factor of 3, than the fastest Java implementation (the
gcj native code compiler), and even 4.3 times faster than the
fastest Java JIT.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19c0580.0x1ab0b78"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>If there is any conclusion to this simple benchmark at all,
it is this: I'm very much impressed by Java as a programming
language (i.e., its design), but I'm not too impressed by current
Java implementations on Linux or any other platform, for that
matter.</p><p>Java implementations are a good example for one of the oldest
laws of computing, which says that software becomes slower faster
than hardware becomes faster. No doubt, Java has its place, and
very often&mdash;in fact, more often than not&mdash;its advantage in
programmer productivity outweighs its disadvantage in performance
compared to C++. Buying a CPU which is four times faster is usually
less expensive than spending two times as long to develop an
application. At least, this is true for custom-developed systems.
Embedded systems or mass-marketed software with hundreds of
thousands of copies are an entirely different story. Saving $5 on a
CPU chip in a $100 device can make all the difference and pay for
increased development time.</p><p>It comes as no surprise that Java is used today mostly for
custom-developed enterprise applications, where development cost
and time are of paramount importance. As long as Java
implementations are not within 80% of the performance of comparable
C++ applications, I don't think we will see off-the-shelf products
such as word processors or spreadsheets written in Java.</p><p>Wouldn't it be nice to have a programming language with the
elegance and simplicity of Java and the efficiency of C? Well,
maybe this will be the next big open-source project.</p><p>All listings referred to in this article are available by
