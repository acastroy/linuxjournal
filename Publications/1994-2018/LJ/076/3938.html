office, home office) network based on widely available and
relatively inexpensive cards from Proxim, their new Symphony
series. After watching the wireless networking developments for
quite a while, I have finally found an affordable wireless solution
that works with Linux. Until now, wireless network cards cost
hundreds of dollars and hubs cost thousands.
</p><p>My goal was to give my notebook computer running Win98 the
ability to move about my SOHO. I was successful in accomplishing
this at a cost of only $250 by utilizing my existing Linux server
and two Symphony cards.</p><p>I use Linux as a multi-function server with Samba and
dial-on-demand ISDN to provide masquerading for all the machines on
my internal network. The Linux server is connected to the internal
network on its eth0 interface. I added a Proxim PCI Symphony card
to this box, which is now up and running as eth1. (See Figure
1.)</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="3938f1.large.jpg"><img src="3938f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1. Network Diagram</p></div></div>
</p><p>Now that all the networking is set up, I have full
connectivity to my internal network and to the Internet, and am
able to work anywhere in the house. There is no apparent reduction
in performance browsing the Web or e-mailing, since the bandwidth
of the wireless segment is not the constraint. An FTP download from
the server to the notebook transferred a 560KB file in about nine
seconds, for a throughput of just under 64KB per second. It's not
quite like a wired Ethernet, but it's also not too shabby.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2912580.0x2a0aea0"></a>The Challenge</h2></div></div><p>My home has finished ceilings downstairs where my SOHO is
located, making it very inconvenient to pull network or phone wires
to other areas. I also have visions of being able to work outside
on the deck when the weather permits. Clearly, some form of
wireless networking would be ideal. I had been watching the
wireless networking offerings off and on for the last couple of
years, but prices were just too high.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2912580.0x2a0afa8"></a>The Answer</h2></div></div><p>Recently, I came across the Proxim &ldquo;Symphony&rdquo; line of
wireless networking products. They use the 2.4GHz technology found
in cordless phones to achieve a raw throughput of 1.6Mbps. This
gives performance that is comparable with the ARCnet I ran before
Ethernet became ubiquitous. Even better, the product line is widely
distributed and is reasonably priced.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2912580.0x2a0b0b0"></a>Available Components and Sources</h2></div></div><p>Proxim produces a full complement of wireless components in
the Symphony line. There are cards for both the ISA and PCI bus,
and a PC-Card for notebook computers. They also offer a Wireless
Bridge and Wireless Modem for users who need them. I found the
interface card products on the shelf at the local Best Buy, and the
full line of products on-line at OnSale/Egghead and AtCost. There
are many other sources such as CDW, HardwareStreet.com, Office Max,
Office Depot and Staples. I ordered a PCI card for the Linux server
and a PC Card (see Figure 2) for my notebook from OnSale's AtCost
for about $120 US and $130 US respectively, with free shipping. As
you will see below, those of us fortunate enough to employ Linux as
our Internet connectivity server can avoid purchasing the Wireless
Bridge for about $370 or the Wireless Modem for about $225.</p><p>

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2912580.0x2a0b3c8"></a>Technical Resources and Help</h2></div></div><p>The Proxim web site at
http://www.proxim.com/symphony/index.htm has a complete set of
information including on-line manuals, software, FAQs and tech
tips. Under operating system support, they point you to Linux
drivers from
<a href="http://www.komacke.com/distribution.html" target="_self">www.komacke.com/distribution.html</a>.
Proxim does not directly support Linux, but I had great help from
Dave Koberstein, the rl2 driver developer, and other folks on the
rl2-library mail list. You can easily subscribe at
<a href="http://www.komacke.com/maillists.html" target="_self">www.komacke.com/maillists.html</a>.
The rl2 part of the name comes from the original and much
higher-cost Proxim product line RangeLAN2. The mail list was
instrumental in answering several basic questions I had regarding
the usefulness of these cards under Linux and getting the driver
working.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2912580.0x2a0b580"></a>What the Data Sheets Don't Explain</h2></div></div><p>The Proxim data sheets did a fine job of describing the
products and functionality for use in a Windows NT environment, but
did not provide some of the gory technical details I needed. Proxim
delivers a layer of peer-to-peer networking setup software to
configure and operate their products that insulates the user from
the Microsoft networking properties dialogs. My questions
were:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Did these cards act like standard Ethernet
interface cards to the operating system? Yes, the cards present a
standard Ethernet interface to Windows and Linux. Under
Win9<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> and NT, you use the standard Microsoft
network property dialogs to set up and control the wireless network
card.</p></li><li><p>Could standard network routing be used on a Linux
server to eliminate the need for a costly Wireless Bridge to
provide the connectivity to the rest of an installed Ethernet? Yes,
once a Proxim wireless card is installed and set up on the Linux
box, standard TCP/IP routing provides the connectivity to the other
Ethernet hosts and the Internet.</p></li></ul></div><p>Thanks to the Linux driver mail list, I had enough
information to proceed.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2912580.0x2a0b8f0"></a>Network Architecture</h2></div></div><p>The existing network operates on the private class C network
192.168.1.0. The Linux server provides IP masquerading for all
systems on the internal network through an
<span   class="bold"><b>ipfwadm</b></span> firewall and
<span   class="bold"><b>diald</b></span> support for an ISDN
connection to the Internet. I am currently running Debian 2.0 with
kernel 2.0.34 on the server. I chose to use 192.168.4.0 as the
network number for the new wireless segment.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2912580.0x2a0baa8"></a>PC Card Installation on Windows</h2></div></div><p>Installation of the Proxim drivers on the notebook is quite
straightforward. Make a note of the Secid you use, since this will
need to be used for the Linux driver and any other nodes that will
be on the same wireless segment. After the Proxim installation is
done, go to the &ldquo;Microsoft Network Neighborhood | Properties&rdquo; to
bring up the Network dialog box. On the Configuration tab, select
TCP/IP Symphony Cordless PC Card Adapter&mdash;Properties to set the
network parameters, using the appropriate addresses for your
system, as follows:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
IP Address:
     IP address:         192.168.4.2
     Subnet Mask:        255.255.255.0
WINS Configuration:
     Enable WINS Resolution Add 192.168.1.254 as a WINS server
Gateway:
     Add 192.168.4.1 as a new gateway
DNS Configuration:
     Enable DNS
     Enter a Host name and your Domain name
     Enter one or more IP addresses of your DNS server(s)
     Add Domain Suffix Search Orders as desired
</pre><p>The &ldquo;new gateway&rdquo; entry will be the IP address of the eth1
interface on the Linux box.
</p><p>I use the domain name of my ISP and their DNS servers. You
will need to use entries that correspond to your network and ISP.
With diald, the first DNS query for a new connection brings the
line up to the ISP. I chose to use a different host name for the
notebook, depending on whether the Symphony card is active or if
the regular wired 10/100 PC Card is active. When on the wireless
network, the notebook is on the 192.168.4 segment; when it is on
the wired Ethernet, it's on the 192.168.1 segment. I use different
host names so I can state them explicitly in the /etc/hosts table
on the Linux server.</p><p>On the Identification tab, set the computer name, workgroup
and an optional computer description. Use the same name you used in
the DNS setting above, and the name of the workgroup for your
Microsoft networking. This will allow you to browse the shares on
your Linux Samba server if the workgroups match. Once again, I made
sure that the notebook, when on the wireless interface, had a
different name than when it was on the wired network, since its IP
address will be different.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2912580.0x2a025a0"></a>Linux Installation</h2></div></div><p>First, you need to fetch the driver from the
<a href="ftp://ftp.komacke.com/pub/rl2isa-drive" target="_self">ftp.komacke.com/pub/rl2isa-drive</a> site.
If you are running a 2.0.3<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> kernel, I
would recommend trying the rl2-1.5.1.tgz version. As of this
writing, the latest version, rl2-1.5.3.tgz, had changes to support
2.2.<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> kernels, but broke for the older
kernels. A kind soul from the driver mail list helped identify the
version that worked for me. The Symphony driver is used as an
installable module, so you must have module support compiled into
your kernel.</p><p>Place the .tgz file in a suitable directory, and unpack it
with:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
tar -xvzf rl2-1.5.1.tgz
</pre><p>This will create a tree of directories under the current
directory. I like to use /usr/src for source files, so I ended up
with the driver source tree in /usr/src/rl2-1.5.1.
</p><p>The rl2-version directory contains very good README files
explaining the installation process. The examples and defaults are
for Red Hat Linux, so I needed to answer several of the prompts
differently for my Debian Linux host during the <b  >make
config</b> step.</p><p>For Debian, I answered as follows:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Module location?     /lib/modules/2.0.34/net
Executables?             /usr/local/bin
Man pages?               /usr/man
System header files?     /usr/src/kernel-source-2.0.34/include
CardType default []:     5
PC Card support? []:     n
</pre><p>Be especially careful with module location and system header
files. Until I got them right, the driver module produced would not
load. The README file gives the CardType values; 5 is PCI.
</p><p>Next, do <b  >make modules</b> followed by
<b  >make  modules_install</b>. If the driver module
compiles without error, you should be able to do an <b  >insmod
rlmod</b> and see the initialization message on the console
and in /var/log.messages. You can confirm that the module has been
loaded by doing <b  >lsmod</b>. Since I used a PCI card,
the I/O address and interrupt were set automatically when the
driver module loaded.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2912580.0x2a02c28"></a>Setting Up the eth1 Interface</h2></div></div><p>Establish the IP address for the eth1 interface by
typing</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ifconfig eth1 192.168.4.1 broadcast 192.168.4.255\ netmask 255.255.255.0
</pre><p>Set the Secid for the Symphony wireless segment with the
following command:
<pre     class="programlisting">
rl2cfg dev eth1 secid
</pre>


Use the same Secid you used when setting up the notebook above,
making sure you type it the same, including upper/lowercase. The
Secid needs to be set only once; it is stored on the card in
<b  >nvram</b>. The rlmod driver versions after 1.5.1 use
<span   class="bold"><b>proxcfg</b></span> instead of
<span   class="bold"><b>rl2cfg</b></span> to set parameters for the
Symphony card. Check the man page and READMEs.
</p><p>Now, establish the route for the eth1 interface by
typing</p><pre     class="programlisting">
route add -net 192.168.4.0 dev eth1
</pre><p>You can check your results by typing <b  >ifconfig
eth1</b> and <b  >netstat -r</b>. You should be
able to see that the eth1 interface is fully configured with its IP
address and that there is a route using eth1 to the 192.168.4.0
network.
</p><p>There is one more configuration command that sets the
Symphony card mode to &ldquo;master&rdquo; and sets its name. Type the
following, using an appropriate name for your server:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
rl2cfg dev eth1 msta
</pre><p>If you don't have a firewall running on your Linux system,
you should be able to ping the notebook from Linux and ping Linux
from the notebook using the IP addresses. You should also be able
to telnet to the Linux system from the notebook, again using the
Linux server's IP address. If this works, you're just about there;
if not, check your log files for errors.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2912580.0x2a03200"></a>Finishing Up the Setup</h2></div></div><p>Add a line to the /etc/hosts table on the Linux server,
giving the IP address of the notebook when on the wireless subnet,
using your domain as appropriate.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
192.168.4.2    wnb-dfoxwnb-dfox.
</pre><p>If you don't already have a c:\windows\hosts file with an
entry for the Linux server on your notebook from a wired Ethernet
configuration, create one now. The pertinent line entry in my
c:\windows\hosts is:
<pre     class="programlisting">
192.168.1.254   server1       server1.
</pre>


If you have a firewall running on the Linux server, you will need
to add input and output rules for the eth1 interface to allow the
packets to be passed. I added lines to these two sections of
/etc/rc.boot/masq as shown:
<pre     class="programlisting">
# local interface, local machines, going anywhere
# is valid
ipfwadm -I -a accept -W eth1 -S 192.168.4.0/24\
  -D 0.0.0.0/0
# local interface, any source going to local net
# is valid
ipfwadm -O -a accept -W eth1 -S 0.0.0.0/0 \
 -D 192.168.4.0/24
</pre>


Depending on your Linux distribution and version and whether you
are using ipfwadm or <span   class="bold"><b>ipchains</b></span>, the
location and name of the rules file will vary. Refer to the
documentation for your firewall package. At this point, you should
be able to ping and use telnet by host name between the notebook
and all systems on your original network.
</p><p>To allow packets to be forwarded to the Internet through the
firewall from the wireless segment, you will need to add rules
similar to the following:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# Masquerade from local net on local interface to
# anywhere
ipfwadm -F -a masquerade -W eth0 -S 192.168.4.0/24\ -D 0.0.0.0/0
ipfwadm -F -a masquerade -W ppp0 -S 192.168.4.0/24\ -D 0.0.0.0/0
ipfwadm -F -a masquerade -W sl0 -S 192.168.4.0/24\ -D 0.0.0.0/0
</pre><p>Due to the way diald works, there are rules for both ppp0 and
sl0. Remember to restart your firewall rule set after making
changes.
</p><p>Once I had the firewall rules in place, I had full
connectivity from the notebook to all local hosts and the Internet.
The last service to get working was the Samba sharing from the
Linux server. It took a little head scratching, but finally I
realized I had a line in /etc/smb.conf that limited which networks
had access to the Samba server. Since the wireless segment was new,
it needed to be added to the config file, and then Samba needed to
be restarted. The revised line in /etc/smb.conf is shown
below.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
hosts allow = localhost, 192.168.1., 192.168.4.
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2912580.0x2a03678"></a>Integrating with Linux Startup Code</h2></div></div><p>Once everything is working, you need to add the commands to
initialize the wireless eth1 interface on system boot. Debian Linux
uses SysV init, so I added the following lines to the
/etc/init.d/network file after the eth0 interface section and
before the line setting the default route:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
insmod rlmod
ifconfig eth1 192.168.4.1 netmask 255.255.255.0\
  broadcast 192.168.4.255
route add -net 192.168.4.0 dev eth1 \
  /usr/local/bin/rl2cfg dev eth1 msta name server1
</pre><p>These lines load the module, configure the eth1 interface,
add the route and set the mode to master. Make sure it all comes up
on reboot.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2912580.0x2a03830"></a>Testing and Performance</h2></div></div><p>When on the wireless segment, the notebook has full
connectivity to the rest of the local network and to the Internet;
it's just a little slower. The Proxim specs state a range of 150
feet. I have had no trouble with the connection anywhere within our
house. I've measured FTP performance for a half-megabyte file at
about 64Kbps download and about 56Kbps on upload between the
notebook and Linux server. I am pleased with this performance,
since I don't plan on transferring large amounts of data while on
the wireless segment. When I need to do that, I simply take the
notebook back down to the office and switch it back to the wired
Ethernet interface. During normal Internet browsing and e-mailing,
there is no noticeable performance degradation.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2912580.0x2a03938"></a>Switching from Wireless to Wired and
Back</h2></div></div><p>Proxim supplies a handy feature in the Maestro utility for
switching back and forth between a wired and wireless Ethernet
interface. The Maestro utility is installed as part of the
Win9<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> setup, and normally resides at the
bottom right side of the taskbar. If you double-click the Maestro
icon, click Configure, then click the Network Profiles tab, you
will be there.</p><p>Win9<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> can store only one set of many of
the network parameters, even though there may be more than one
network interface and environment. Maestro creates a couple of new
registry sections, one for the &ldquo;Original&rdquo; network settings
(<b  >profile0</b>) and one for the &ldquo;Symphony&rdquo; network
settings (<b  >profile1</b>). This makes it very easy to
switch between a wired Ethernet interface and a wireless Symphony
card on your notebook. The alternative is to change settings on
several different screens manually when changing interfaces.</p><p>After fiddling with it for a bit, I realized it saves the
necessary network parameters for profile0 when you change to
profile1 and click &ldquo;OK&rdquo; and vice versa. This makes it relatively
easy to get the settings the way you want them without actually
changing the cards and rebooting each time. You can click back and
forth as many times as you want. For instance, select the
&ldquo;Symphony&rdquo; profile, click &ldquo;OK&rdquo;, then use the Windows network
properties dialogs to make changes. When finished, click the &ldquo;OK&rdquo;
on the Microsoft dialog, but don't reboot. Then go back to Maestro,
click the &ldquo;Original&rdquo; profile, then &ldquo;OK&rdquo;, and your profile1
settings will be saved. If you don't let it shut down your system,
you can go back and forth until you get the settings you want for
each profile.</p><p>When you actually want to switch cards, run Maestro and
select the correct profile for the card to which you want to
switch. Click &ldquo;OK&rdquo;, then confirm the box that offers to shut down
the system. After the system powers down, insert the correct card
and power it up. It will have all the appropriate settings for that
interface card and environment. If you are curious and want to see
everything it saves, use <span   class="bold"><b>regedit</b></span>
to look in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\ProximSwitch.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2912580.0x2a03d00"></a>Expanding the Concept</h2></div></div><p>Proxim states that you may have up to ten machines on a
wireless segment. You may also have several wireless segments
within the same physical area by using different Secids for each
wireless segment. For some installations, this may be very useful.
Dave Koberstein reports that the ten-unit limit is based on
limitations of the Proxim Wireless Bridge and Wireless Modem. If
you use Linux as the wireless router, you are limited only by what
you consider acceptable performance and how many nodes you can fit
into a 150-foot radius.</p><p>There are some exciting new developments for
2.2.<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> kernel versions and the later rl2 driver
versions. Bridging is reported to work with kernel 2.2.14 and
rl2-1.5.3. The configuration is more complex, but you can avoid the
need for different names and IP addresses when on wireless. The
next driver, rl2-1.6.0, will have improved reporting, improved
troubleshooting capability and will show up in the
Win9<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> Symphony tools network map. Subscribe to
the mail list to check these out.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2912580.0x2a03f10"></a>Summary</h2></div></div><p>After using my notebook on a wireless segment for a couple of
weeks now, I must say I am quite pleased. I have good performance
at a reasonable price and am able to configure and operate the
wireless network with standard networking tools. I have great
expansion capabilities and have avoided purchasing a costly
Wireless Bridge. There is a great deal of help available, both from
the Proxim documentation and web site and the Linux driver web site
and mail list. This solution meets my needs quite nicely.</p><p><a href="3938s1.html" target="_self">Acknowledgements</a></p><p><a href="3938s2.html" target="_self">The Good/The Bad</a></p></div></div>
