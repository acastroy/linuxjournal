them, the value of Linux is self-evident: it is Linux&mdash;Linux is
cool. Spending long hours and sleepless nights keeping up with the
latest drivers, the greatest new applications and all the hot news
is entertainment for a real enthusiast. Like a video game or a
puzzle, it is a chance to think, learn and show off. It can even be
financially rewarding for those with talent.
</p><p>Businesses have a different perspective. Hours spent working
with Linux (or any OS) aren't fun or rewarding&mdash;they are a wasted
resource, also known as lost money. Businesses, especially
businesses that do more than develop tech gear for tech people,
have real-world problems, and the only reason they want computers
is to help solve those problems. They don't even care how the
problems are solved, as long as the solution works, and when they
choose a computer system or OS they aren't interested in new
drivers, hot applications or cool news. They are interested in
enhancing their bottom line.</p><p>Caldera Systems, one of the first companies formed
specifically to &ldquo;productize&rdquo; Linux, understands the distinction.
They know that, unlike the techno-freaks and Linux fanatics that
give Linux its technical drive, business users don't care what goes
on under the hood and behind the scenes in an OS, as long as it
works. They understand that the people who make corporate
technology decisions must justify&mdash;in cold, practical terms&mdash;the
technology they adopt. They must be able to point to clear benefits
that will positively affect the corporate bottom line, not just
say, &ldquo;This is neat, let's use it!&rdquo; They must also be able to
allay the fears of upper management, fears ranging from reliability
and product support to the simple fear of change. They also know
that if a technology change turns into a fiasco, they will have a
long time to think about what went wrong as they search for another
job.</p><p>Caldera understands the business view of technology and has
been working for years to turn Linux into a product that
businesses, businesspeople or anyone new to Linux can be
comfortable using. The latest product in Caldera's
business-friendly lineup is eDesktop 2.4, designed to bring the
power and cost-effectiveness of Linux to the corporate and home
desktop. It is easy to install, 99% pre-configured, uses the
elegant and easy-to-use K Desktop Environment and comes with a
complete set of administration tools, so anyone with even basic
computer skills can configure and maintain their system. Caldera
has also bundled, developed or encouraged the development of Linux
versions of many of the tools, protocols and features that
businesses want and IT managers need. Interoperability with NovelT
NetWare servers, web-based remote administration and a suite of
Internet applications, including Netscape Communicator 4.7 which is
pre-loaded and provides most of the plug-ins people need (news,
mail and chat clients), Macromedia Flash Player, Real Networks
RealPlayer, Adobe Acrobat and a host of other applications and
servers.</p><p>Caldera eDesktop 2.4 has a little something for everyone,
including techno-freaks and Linux fanatics, but nowhere does it
shine brighter than as a Linux for non-Linux users&mdash;at home or in
the office.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15aa580.0x16a2ce8"></a>Documentation</h2></div></div><p>For anyone not totally committed to a self-image of
superhuman technical ability, a well-written manual is important.
When delving into an unfamiliar technology, the manual must be
especially good. A poorly written manual can mean the difference
between a useful product and a frustrating waste of money. Caldera
obviously knows most of their target audience won't know a lot
about Linux when they begin using eDesktop, and the manual is both
well-written and complete. When it comes to pertinent,
easy-to-follow documentation, Caldera has done their job by
describing the installation, configuration and administration of
eDesktop in excellent detail. They also include many references and
links to other information sources for users who wish to learn
more.</p><p>While the manual is very good, &ldquo;User's Guide&rdquo; may be a bit
of a misnomer. It is more an &ldquo;Installation and Administration
Guide&rdquo; for people new to Linux than a user's guide. The manual
tackles, fearlessly and with admirable clarity, the task of getting
first-time Linux users comfortable making configuration changes,
managing users, working with the command-line interface and doing
everything else that longtime Linux users take for granted. It
spends very little time on the minutiae of actually using the
eDesktop, which is perfect for home or small business users, who
usually manage their own systems. Corporate IS departments will
probably not want to hand out the manual to office staff who need
to get up to speed on <span   class="emphasis"><em>using</em></span> Linux/KDE,
though&mdash;of the roughly 500 pages of manual, about 75 are specific
to using, rather than administering, OpenLinux eDesktop.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15aa580.0x16a2ea0"></a>Installation</h2></div></div><p>OpenLinux eDesktop 2.4 can be installed a few different ways,
but the easiest way is to insert the CD and reboot (a boot floppy
is included for computers that cannot boot from CD). That allows
you to install eDesktop in whatever free space is available on your
hard disk or to overwrite any operating system you may have been
using, and take up the whole disk. If you aren't ready to commit
yourself to Linux completely, you will really appreciate the
inclusion of PartitionMagic. PartitionMagic allows you to shrink
your Windows partition without reformatting your hard disk or
losing data. Just by inserting the eDesktop installation CD while
running Windows, and walking through a few simple steps, you can
make room for Linux without deleting your old operating system or
data files. [The often-recommended advice of many computer
professionals: make a backup of all important files or your entire
hard drive, before doing any significant installation.
&mdash;Editor]</p><p>While PartitionMagic is a great add-on for users wishing to
try out Linux, the version shipped with eDesktop has one serious
flaw. Because it is specifically for use with eDesktop, there are
only a few partition sizes it will create. Specifically, there is
&ldquo;too small for eDesktop&rdquo; and &ldquo;too small for Windows&rdquo;. You can
create either a really small Linux partition (350MB), a slightly
small Linux partition (700MB) or take everything but 100MB of the
hard disk for Linux. The first two choices aren't good for much
more than trying out eDesktop, and anyone familiar with Windows
will recognize the problem with the third option&mdash;Windows with only
100 megabytes of free space is even less usable than normal.</p><p>Whatever first step you take, the second step for first-time
installers is Caldera's slick graphical installation tool, which
they call the Lizard. Lizard guides you through all of the
important decisions about your installation: setting system
information, partitioning the hard disk (if you didn't use
PartitionMagic), selecting your monitor and other hardware,
choosing the software to install, setting up user accounts and,
perhaps most uniquely, configuring dialup Internet access.</p><p>Caldera has made some of the hardest parts of Linux
installation easy by including a couple of impressive databases.
Getting the most out of your video card and monitor, a task that
usually requires a fair amount of trial-and-error, is easy with
eDesktop because of the huge monitor selection database, which
seems to contain just about every monitor ever produced. Also handy
is the database of ISPs that covers most of the world and makes
setting up dialup Internet access easy for customers of major
ISPs.</p><p>Lizard is smart enough to start copying files as soon as it
knows where to put them, so on a fast computer the actual
installation process is very quick, not much longer than answering
the configuration questions. If you finish configuring the system
before all the files are copied, Caldera provides a bit of
entertainment in the form of a game to pass the time.</p><p>Lizard is very easy to use but acts as a gatekeeper of sorts
for eDesktop. Its first task is to perform a hardware compatibility
test, and if it doesn't think eDesktop will run on your computer,
it refuses to proceed with the installation. This would be fine,
except that it is a bit too strict in its testing. Lizard sometimes
refuses to install eDesktop on systems with newer video cards, even
though the display driver, or X Server, that eDesktop uses is
compatible with those cards. For example, Lizard refused to install
eDesktop on a laptop with an ATI Rage LT video chipset that is
supported by eDesktop's Xfree86 version 3.3.6 X server. On systems
Lizard refuses to interact with, you can install eDesktop using a
backup, text-mode installation program called LISA.</p><p>There are several automated installation methods for system
administrators and IT departments that need to get a lot of systems
up and running with identical configurations. If you have a LAN,
you can set up an install server and quickly install eDesktop on
any computer on your LAN. Just insert a floppy, reboot and the
installation program takes care of the rest. You can also create a
boot floppy with Lizard, configured to install the default
configuration without prompting, or create a custom installation,
specifying the exact programs you wish to install on each
system.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15aa580.0x16a31b8"></a>Use</h2></div></div><p>Perhaps the most significant aspect of using eDesktop 2.4 is
there really isn't much to say about it. For the user interface,
Caldera uses KDE, the K Desktop Environment, which has become the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>de facto</em></span> standard for Linux desktops. With
good reason, too: KDE is easy to use, looks great, is very
configurable and uses an interface metaphor most Windows users are
familiar with, the bottom-of-the-screen control bar, complete with
a &ldquo;start button&rdquo; labelled &ldquo;K&rdquo;.</p><p>Most of the pre-installed and bundled applications work
without much tinkering. The bundled commercial software must be
installed after eDesktop is up and running, but the process is easy
and fast. eDesktop is exactly what a business desktop OS should be:
a gateway to the applications where you do your real work. It gets
out of your way and lets you do your work, without forcing you to
learn and re-learn its own features. That is not to say that it
lacks features. KDE starts out with power-user features like
multiple virtual desktops and is one of the most configurable user
environments around, so you can tailor its look and behavior to
your needs.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15aa580.0x16a3370"></a>Administration</h2></div></div><p>The three most common complaints new users have about Linux
are it's too hard to install, has too few applications, and in the
long term, probably the most important is that it's too difficult
to &ldquo;administer&rdquo;. &ldquo;Administer&rdquo; in quotes, because that's
probably the last term most new Linux users would think of; they
just want to keep their computer running, their software up to date
and their data safe. Whatever you call it, making a Linux system do
what you want is often viewed as a dark art involving mysterious
knowledge, and probably, animal sacrifice.</p><p>This is not true with eDesktop. Caldera has provided an
overflowing banquet of administration tools in the form of two
system administration interfaces which, if they don't actually
guide you through every necessary administration task, at least
provide a clear view of what you can and cannot change. COAS
(Caldera Open Administration System) provides a graphical
administration interface for use from the desktop, allowing you to
configure most (but not all) system features without resorting to a
shell or a text editor. For environments requiring more centralized
management, there is Webmin, a new tool that allows you to perform
most routine system administration tasks remotely from any computer
with a web browser. COAS and Webmin don't change the need to
administer, but they do make it easy for people who don't know&mdash;and
don't want to know&mdash;about &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; Linux configuration files
to get started administering their systems, without learning a
bunch of technical mumbo jumbo.</p><p>There are still quite a few tasks that will require a text
editor and shell knowledge. From compiling new kernels to
reconfiguring LILO, many advanced (but necessary) administration
tasks haven't made it into the graphical or web administration
tools yet. Fortunately, the manual describes these tasks in detail,
providing step-by-step instructions for the most common
administration tasks that cannot be performed with the
administration tools.</p><p>The system's native package tool&mdash;the program you use to
install and remove most software&mdash;is the Red Hat Package Manager
(RPM). RPM is the most widely used package tool in the Linux
community, and it is the most popular method for distributing
third-party software. To easily manage installed packages, eDesktop
uses <span   class="bold"><b>Kpackage</b></span>, which allows you to
browse packages installed on your system and easily add or remove
software.</p><p>Linux users familiar with package tools like Debian's
<span   class="bold"><b>dselect</b></span> will suffer from
Kpackage's inability to automatically download packages from
Internet servers. To upgrade an installed package with OpenLinux,
you must manually transfer the package to your system, and then
install it. <span   class="bold"><b>dselect</b></span> can
automatically retrieve a list of available packages from an
Internet server, compare the package versions from that server to
what is installed on your computer and (with your permission)
download and install replacements for any older packages you might
have. That sort of feature would go a long way toward enhancing
Caldera's place in corporate IS department hearts, and it would
help new Linux users by automating one of the most boring system
administration tasks&mdash;upgrading older software and making sure that
potentially security-compromised software is replaced
promptly.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15aa580.0x16a36e0"></a>Neat Stuff</h2></div></div><p>You will find a long list of neat add-on packages in the
eDesktop 2.4 package. Depending on how you will use it, you may
find some of the programs great&mdash;or totally useless. Corporate
users in mixed computing environments may find the Citrix ICA and
NetWare clients very useful. Web and Internet developers will like
the Cameleo Lite graphics program, Omnis Studio Rapid Internet
Application Development Environment, JDK 1.2.2, Apache and other
Internet development tools. Small and home office users will find
the StarOffice suite and the Moneydance personal finance
application handy. There is something for everyone in the eDesktop
box, but it is all rather straight-laced utilitarian software and
much of it is very specialized. If you don't have a Citrix server,
you don't have a use for the Citrix ICA client.</p><p>If you are looking for entertainment from your OS, you are
going to have some shopping or downloading to do.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15aa580.0x16a3840"></a>Problems</h2></div></div><p>The single biggest problem with OpenLinux is Caldera's
&ldquo;simplicity by hiding details&rdquo; design philosophy. Hiding
irrelevant or distracting details is a good thing. Hiding the truly
useless babble that Linux often displays can go beyond a good
thing. However, unless details and babble are replaced with concise
descriptions of what the system is doing, you can be left wondering
and frustrated when problems occur. If you take away the
information an &ldquo;expert&rdquo; would use to diagnose a problem, you need
to replace it with software smart enough to figure out the problem
on its own.</p><p>An example is the all-or-nothing installation: some systems
that should be supported aren't, because Caldera, in their wish to
keep the installation process simple for new users, went too far in
checking the system for compatibility and removing the details of
those checks from user view. It is a tradeoff, and users of
mainstream hardware and software will benefit; however, I would
like to see the Lizard and all of Caldera's software a little more
willing to divulge troubleshooting information. Even a note about
what went wrong, a query asking how to proceed and a warning that
if you proceed, things might not work as expected, would let more
people use the eDesktop. If Caldera invested the same effort,
energy and skill they have contributed to COAS and Webmin in
developing software that monitored the system status and
reported&mdash;in plain language&mdash;everything that is going right and
wrong, they would have the perfect counter to the &ldquo;Linux is only
for geeks&rdquo; argument. Not only a counter argument, they would truly
be simplifying, instead of hiding, the most complex part of using
Linux.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15aa580.0x16a39a0"></a>Summary</h2></div></div><p>You won't find a simpler or easier-to-use full-featured Linux
distribution anywhere, though you may find another Linux
distribution that is better suited for some uses. Caldera has done
a lot to make Linux easy for new users to adopt by making eDesktop
the easiest and least risky, commercial Linux distribution for
people who want to learn about Linux.</p><p><a href="4052s1.html" target="_self">The Good/The Bad</a></p></div></div>
