many households, the need to network all machines and provide
Internet access is important. Linux offers a stable network
environment that can enable different operating systems (UNIX,
Windows and Macintosh) to work together, and is quite easy to set
up and administer. Such networks facilitate convenient file and
print sharing and centralized backups. I will describe my home
network configuration (see Figure 1) which is a mixture of Linux
and Windows systems.
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3505f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Network Configuration
</p></div></div>

</p><p>I will assume you have basic knowledge of Linux installation
and administration, and that PPP is set up on your Linux box. I
will explain in detail how to network the Windows 95 machine named
&ldquo;ancho&rdquo; with the Linux server named &ldquo;serrano&rdquo;. Adding other
machines to the network is essentially a repetition of this
process. I will also briefly discuss setting up the Linux client
and NFS.</p><p>The Linux machine serrano is the file and print server for
the Windows 95 and Linux clients, and connects to the outside world
through a PPP dial-up connection. It also acts as a firewall; all
other machines can reach the outside world through it. The CD-ROM
drive on serrano is also available to the other machines on the
network.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x137e580.0x14769d0"></a>Hardware</h2></div></div><p>My hardware consists of 486 DX2/66 machines with 32MB RAM,
and a Pentium 100 notebook which is used both on and off the
network. I use NE2000 network cards (Realtek PnP, about $15) and
coaxial 10Base-2 cables. If you have PCI boards (and I certainly
hope you do), setup is easier, but the networking particulars still
apply.</p><p>The Linux kernel probes address 0x300 for NE2000 cards, so
the jumpers on the card are set for this I/O address on the Linux
machine. On the Windows 95 machines, the network card jumpers are
set for Plug-and-Play mode. When you network the machines with
coaxial cables, make sure you use 50-ohm terminators (about $3 at
Radio Shack) at the ends.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x137e580.0x1476b30"></a>Software Installation and Configuration</h2></div></div><p>I installed Red Hat Linux 5.2 off a CD. Installing everything
took about 500MB of disk space. I have used Linux for a while now,
so this part was painless. I was able to get X working nicely, PPP
configured and a printer set up.</p><p>If you have a machine with a CD-ROM drive, Windows 95
installation should also be easy. I had to install Windows 95 from
a parallel port CD-ROM drive. That was tricky, and took several
tries.</p><p>The first goal in the networking effort is to establish
communication between the Linux machine serrano and the Win95
machine ancho.</p><p>All the network configurations on serrano can be done from
the Red Hat control panel (Network Configurator). Read the
Net-3.HOWTO for more information on Linux networking. Basically,
you need to have the eth0 interface with IP 192.168.1.1 (or
something like that) attached to it. To do this manually, execute
the following command as root:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/sbin/ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.1 netmask\
255.255.255.0 up
</pre><p>The IP addresses chosen correspond to class C addresses.
Typically, these are used for intranet networks. I had to
explicitly put in a route:
<pre     class="programlisting">
route add -net 192.168.1.0 eth0
</pre>


This routing command says all packets to the 192.168.1.0 network
should be sent to the eth0 interface. This line is appended to the
/etc/rc.local file, so that the route is set up at boot time.
</p><p>On serrano, set up the host table /etc/hosts in a manner
similar to this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
192.168.1.1     serrano    loghost
192.168.1.3     jalapeno   #Linux machine
192.168.1.100   piquin     #Linux/Windows
192.168.1.2     ancho      #Windows machine
127.0.0.1       localhost
</pre><p>To confirm that the eth0 interface is working, type
<b  >/sbin/ifconfig  eth0</b>. The output from this
command will look like Listing 1. If you then type
<b  >more  /proc/net/dev</b>, the output will look
like Listing 2. If PPP is up, you will see an additional line for
the ppp0 interface. This should take care of serrano.
</p><p><a href="3505l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a></p><p><a href="3505l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2</a></p><p>Now we proceed to the network configuration of ancho, the
Windows 95 machine. You should have Windows 95 installed, the
network card detected and drivers installed. At the time of network
card installation, you will be asked for a machine name and a
workgroup name. Give the machine name &ldquo;ANCHO&rdquo;, workgroup
&ldquo;WORKGROUP&rdquo; and some optional comment like &ldquo;My Compaq 486
machine&rdquo;.</p><p>Go to the Control Panel and select &ldquo;Networking&rdquo;. Under
&ldquo;The following network components are installed&rdquo;, you should see
your network card (mine says &ldquo;Realtek RTL8019 PnP LAN Adaptor or
compatible&rdquo;). You may see NetBEUI and IPX/SPX and TCP/IP in the
same window. If you do not see TCP/IP, choose &ldquo;Add&rdquo;, then
&ldquo;Protocol&rdquo;, click on &ldquo;Add&rdquo;, choose &ldquo;Microsoft&rdquo;, then choose
&ldquo;TCP/IP&rdquo; and click &ldquo;OK&rdquo;. This should add TCP/IP to the
installed components window. Once TCP/IP is added, if you highlight
it, you will be able to choose &ldquo;Properties&rdquo;. When you click
&ldquo;Properties&rdquo;, you will see a dialog containing several tabs. Pick
these tabs, and assign the following:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
IP Address

  IP Address: 192.168.1.2
  Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0

  192.168.1.1
DNS Configuration
  Enable DNS
  Host name: ancho
  DNS Server search order: 192.168.1.1
WINS Configuration
  <span   class="emphasis"><em>Leave it Disabled</em></span>.
</pre><p>You may leave the DNS disabled, or add your ISP's DNS server
IP address. The important items here are your gateway and IP
address. After you specify these and click &ldquo;OK&rdquo;, the machine will
reboot.
</p><p>After reboot, open a DOS window and type <b  >ping
192.168.1.1</b>. After a short pause, you should get a
response like &ldquo;Reply from 192.168.1.1: bytes=32 time=4ms TTL=64&rdquo;,
repeated four times. If this fails, your network setup was not
successful.</p><p>Now go to serrano and type <b  >ping -c2 ancho</b>.
If it can find ancho, you should get these two messages:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
64 bytes from 192.168.1.3: icmp_seq=0 ttl=32 time=3.9 ms
64 bytes from 192.168.1.3: icmp_seq=1 ttl=32 time=2.3 ms
</pre><p>The <b  >-c2</b> argument to ping sends two
packets. Without it, ping will have to be terminated with
<b  >CTRL-C</b>.
</p><p>If this works, congratulations&mdash;the Linux machine and the
Windows 95 machine can find each other.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x137e580.0x1477630"></a>Samba Setup</h2></div></div><p>To enable file and print sharing between Linux and Windows 95
machines, you need the Samba suite, which is installed as part of
the Red Hat installation.</p><p>I wanted to use serrano as a file server so I can install all
my Windows 95 software on serrano. Under my home directory on
serrano, I created a directory called samba, which will be used to
install all my Windows 95 software. I will make this directory
(/home/easwaran/samba) visible from ancho as its D: drive. In
addition I have a DeskJet 540 printer, attached to serrano, that I
want to use to print from ancho. I also want to access the CD-ROM
drive on serrano from ancho. My CD-ROM mount point on serrano is
/mnt/cdrom, and I would like ancho to see this as the E:
drive.</p><p>Samba is configured via the file /etc/smb.conf. Read the
Samba documentation available at
<a href="http://www.samba.org" target="_self">http://www.samba.org/</a> for
more details. My smb.conf file is shown in Listing 3. Samba gives
many other options: the original /etc/smb.conf file has many good
examples. Also check the Samba documentation
(/usr/doc/HOWTO/SMB-HOWTO or
<a href="http://www.samba.org" target="_self">http://www.samba.org/</a>).</p><p><a href="3505l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x137e580.0x1477948"></a>Mounting Directories from the Linux
Machine</h2></div></div><p>Using the smb.conf file, I have made my serrano home
directory (/home/easwaran) and the /tmp directory on serrano
visible to the Windows 95 machine. The names in square brackets,
[easdir] and [cdrom], are the names under which
/home/easwaran/samba and /mnt/cdrom will be available to ancho and
seen under &ldquo;Network Neighborhood&rdquo;. The line</p><pre     class="programlisting">
log file = /var/log/samba-log.%m
</pre><p>toward the beginning of smb.conf file directs Samba to log in
to /var/log/samba-log.serrano. In case of trouble, this will be
quite useful.
</p><p>Once you have modified /etc/smb.conf, stop and restart
Samba:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/etc/rc.d/init.d/smb stop
/etc/rc.d/init.d/smb start
</pre><p>In the following instructions, I assume your Windows 95 logon
password is the same as your login password for serrano. If they
are not the same, you will get a password prompt when you try to
mount a directory from serrano on ancho. I make the passwords the
same to avoid the hassle, but this may not be a good idea in other
situations.
</p><p>At this point, if you click on &ldquo;Network Neighborhood&rdquo; on
the Windows 95 machine ancho, you should see serrano listed.
Double-click on serrano, and you should see the directories cdrom,
easdir, tmp, easwaran, lp and others you may have shared. Open a
DOS window and type</p><pre     class="programlisting">
net use d: \\serrano\easdir
</pre><p>You should then see &ldquo;command completed successfully&rdquo;, which
means that /home/easwaran/samba is available to you on ancho as
your D: drive. You can install software and do whatever you want in
this directory.
</p><p>The command</p><pre     class="programlisting">
net use e: \\serrano\cdrom
</pre><p>will mount the CD-ROM on serrano as your E: drive on ancho.
Make sure your CD is mounted on serrano as /mnt/cdrom&mdash;you may have
to do this manually. When I installed Red Hat 5.0, initially only
root had mount permission for the CD-ROM drive, so that had to be
changed.
</p><p>To have these drives automatically mounted each time you boot
your Windows 95 machine, you can put the <b  >net use</b>
commands in your Startup folder. To do this, look for Windows 95
help under Startup. Alternatively, you could open the &ldquo;Network
Neighborhood&rdquo;, select the machine and the directory and click the
right mouse button. This will give you an option to &ldquo;Map Network
Drive&rdquo;. Here, you can specify the drive letter for that directory
to be mounted under, and whether this drive is to be mapped at
logon time.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x137e580.0x1870118"></a>Printer Setup</h2></div></div><p>Installing the printer correctly on the Linux machine is easy
to do from the Red Hat control panel. We need to make this printer
the default printer for ancho. Go to ancho's Control Panel, click
&ldquo;Printers&rdquo;, then &ldquo;Add Printer&rdquo;. Choose &ldquo;Remote Printer,
Browse&rdquo;. At this point, you should see your printer on serrano
listed as lp. Select it, click &ldquo;OK&rdquo; and follow the instructions.
You will have to load the driver for your printer. (Check the
Windows 95 CD or the printer manufacturer's disks or find it on the
Web.) Print a test page, and make this your default printer.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x137e580.0x1870220"></a>Sharing Windows 95 Directories</h2></div></div><p>The next task is to make the C: drive on ancho visible to
serrano and other machines on the network. Click on &ldquo;Network&rdquo; in
the Control Panel and make sure you have &ldquo;Client for Microsoft
Networks&rdquo; installed (if not, install it). Under &ldquo;File and Print
Sharing&rdquo;, click on &ldquo;want to be able to give others access to my
files&rdquo; and &ldquo;OK&rdquo;. This may install some more files from the
Windows 95 CD. If you now go to &ldquo;My Computer&rdquo;, click on &ldquo;C:&rdquo;
and pull down &ldquo;Properties&rdquo;, you should see &ldquo;Sharing&rdquo; in the
menu; click on it. Then click on &ldquo;Shared as&rdquo; and give a share
name, &ldquo;C-Ancho&rdquo; with Access Type: Full. Type in an access
password; I use the same one as my Windows login password. Click
&ldquo;OK&rdquo;. Now your C: drive on ancho is available to any machine on
the network under the name C-Ancho. The icon for the C: drive under
&ldquo;My Computer&rdquo; will have a blue hand holding the drive.</p><p>There is an FTP-like interface that allows you to mount the
C: drive from ancho on serrano. If you type <b  >smbclient -L
ancho</b> on serrano, you should get a listing of shared
resources on ancho similar to the one shown in Listing 4.</p><p><a href="3505l4.html" target="_self">Listing 4</a></p><p>If you type <b  >smbclient \\ancho\C-ANCHO</b> on
serrano, you will be prompted for the password (the one you gave
ancho to share its C: drive) and you will get an
<b  >smb&gt;</b> prompt. If you type
<b  >ls</b>, you will see the files and directories on
ancho's C: drive. Read the SMB-HOWTO documentation in
/usr/doc/HOWTO for more information.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x137e580.0x18705e8"></a>IP Masquerade Installation&mdash;Reaching the Outside
World</h2></div></div><p>I have a PPP account at my school that assigns an IP address
each time I connect through the ppp0 device, which is my default
gateway.</p><p>To enable machines behind the firewall to communicate with
the outside world, you can install IP masquerade. This requires
support for the firewall to be built into the kernel. Detailed
instructions on how to recompile your kernel with IP firewall
support is in the IP-masquerade HOWTO
(<a href="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/IP-Masquerade-HOWTO.html" target="_self">www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/IP-Masquerade-HOWTO.html</a>),
available at the LDP (Linux Documentation Project) site. The Red
Hat's 5.0 kernel has this support already compiled in. You need to
enable IP forwarding on the firewall machine serrano. On Red Hat,
this is done by setting <b  >FORWARD_IPV4=yes</b> in the
/etc/sysconfig/network file and restarting network services. Then
execute</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ipfwadm -F -p deny
ipfwadm -F -a m -S 192.168.1.0/24 -D 0.0.0.0/0
</pre><p>as root, or place these commands in your /etc/rc.d/rc.local
file for automatic execution. For explanation of the commands, read
the IP-Masquerade-HOWTO.
</p><p>You can play with the
<span   class="bold"><b>ipfwadm</b></span> command to selectively
grant access to the machines on your network to the outside world.
Once this is done, you can open a DOS window on your Windows 95
machine and ping a machine on the Internet. If this works, you can
access any machine on the Internet from any machine on your
network. To the outside machines, all of the TCP/IP packets will
appear to come from your firewall machine.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x137e580.0x1870958"></a>Configuring the Linux Client</h2></div></div><p>The Linux client (piquin, 192.168.1.100) should be set up
with the server 192.168.1.1 as its default gateway. This is done
with the route command</p><pre     class="programlisting">
route add -net default gw 192.168.1.1
</pre><p>File sharing between two Linux machines is done easily with
NFS. The NFS d&aelig;mon, <span   class="bold"><b>nfsd</b></span>, is
usually started at boot time. We would like to make directories on
serrano available to other Linux clients via NFS. To do this,
specify the directories to be exported in the /etc/exports file. I
have the following /etc/exports files on serrano:
<pre     class="programlisting">
/home           jalapeno(rw) piquin(rw)
/home/easwaran  jalapeno(rw) piquin(rw)
/mnt/cdrom      jalapeno(rw) piquin(rw)
</pre>


This allows the /home, /home/easwaran and /mnt/cdrom to be exported
to jalapeno and piquin, with read and write permission. Reboot the
machine after you modify this file, or use these two commands:
<pre     class="programlisting">
kill -HUP rpc.nfsd
kill -HUP rpc.mounted
</pre>


On the Linux client, piquin, one needs to edit the /etc/fstab file
to enable mounting of remote directories. On piquin, the /etc/fstab
file has this entry:
<pre     class="programlisting">
serrano:/home/easwaran /home/easwaran/serrano\
nfs defaults,rw,user,noauto 1 1
</pre>


This command allows any user to mount /home/easwaran from serrano
on piquin as the directory /home/easwaran/serrano. If
<b  >auto</b> is used instead of
<b  >noauto</b>, this remote directory would be
automatically mounted at boot time. To mount this NFS directory
manually, type <b  >mount /home/easwaran/serrano</b>. In
this case, because the directory mount point is easwaran's home,
easwaran can use the mounted directory as can anyone with
permissions to easwaran's subdirectory, serrano. easwaran has read
and write permissions on /home/easwaran/serrano.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x137e580.0x1870d78"></a>Linux Remote Printing</h2></div></div><p>To enable the client Linux machine piquin to print on
serrano, we need to configure the lp print d&aelig;mon
<span   class="bold"><b>lpd</b></span>. See the Printing-HOWTO
(/usr/doc/HOWTO/Printing-HOWTO.gz or visit LDP) for additional
documentation and alternatives to lp. On serrano, create an
/etc/hosts.lpd file listing the machines allowed to print on it. I
added piquin to this file.</p><p>Printing with lpd is controlled via the /etc/printcap file.
On serrano, the file looks like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">

        :lp=/dev/lp1:\
        :if=/var/spool/lpd/lp/filter:
</pre><p><b  >lp</b> and <b  >dj</b> are names for
the printer; <b  >sd</b> is the spool directory; the
<b  >mx</b> line means there is no maximum size for files

<b  >lp</b> is the actual line printer device; and
<b  >if</b> is a magic filter shell script that deals
with staircase effects when printing text files and other special
processing that files need. On Red Hat Linux, the control panel has
a print configuration tool that allows easy configuration of
printers.
</p><p>On piquin, the /etc/printcap file should look like
this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
lp|dj:\
      :sd=/var/spool/lpd/dj:\
      :rm=serrano:\
      :rp=lp:\
      :lp=/dev/null:\
      :sh:
</pre><p><b  >rm</b> defines a remote machine;
<b  >rp</b> defines the name of the remote printer; and
<b  >sd</b> is the local spool directory. Make sure the
spool directory exists. After making changes to the /etc/printcap
file, restart the lpd d&aelig;mon or reboot. Now, if you print on
piquin, it should appear on the printer attached to serrano.
