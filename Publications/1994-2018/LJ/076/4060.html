use for web applications. We're told it &ldquo;emphasizes applications
using PostgreSQL and MySQL, two powerful database management
systems&rdquo;. The preface suggests taking a 30-minute &ldquo;test drive&rdquo;
on the book's accompanying web site; unfortunately, the site wasn't
available as of this writing. A note indicated they had a hard
drive crash and were rebuilding the system. [The site has since
been restored, and everything works except the login.
&mdash;Editor]</p><p>The first chapter is an overview of the book. Chapters 2
through 11 are referred to as background information relating to
web-based technologies. Sample applications comprise Chapter 12,
followed by a few pages of technical notes in Chapter 13. The
reader is only one-third of the way through the book at this point
and may be startled to find that a sixteen-page index for the PHP3
Language and a Function Reference make up the bulk of the remaining
pages.</p><p>Two appendices are included. The first deals with CGI
variables; the second concerns timing comparisons between MySQL and
two different configurations of PostgreSQL. The reading list
doesn't specifically deal with PHP, PostgreSQL or MySQL. The
references listed are excellent material for general programming
and web development, but the list is broad rather than specific to
the topic of the book itself. There are two additional indexes in
the back: one for alphabetically listed PHP3 functions and another
for the book itself.</p><p>A CD-ROM with PHP3, PostgreSQL, the latest GPL version of
MySQL, various RFC text files and W3C's HTML 3.2, 4.0 and CSS2
specifications comes with the book. According to a list in Chapter
1, the CD should also contain &ldquo;all code built in this book&rdquo;, but
that wasn't the case. To be fair, the CD does include the full
source for every version of PHP from v2.0 through v3.0.12 in tar.gz
format and several Linux Red Hat RPMs for both PHP and PostgreSQL.
It also has the PHP3 manual in several formats.</p><p>Generally, you would expect to read a discussion on the
choice of operating system before reading about how to install
software. However, UNIX (and more specifically, Linux) is covered
briefly in chapter 7, &ldquo;Why UNIX (Why not Windows?)&rdquo;, while
Chapter 1 describes how to install the supplied software from the
CD.</p><p>Chapter 2 discusses PHP, and the next chapter offers a look
at databases, SQL and PHP. This is followed by a brief chapter
about UNIX (and Linux) and then a discussion of Internet and
browser basics. Logically, one would have expected the flow to have
been UNIX first (if at all), followed by Internet and browser
basics, HTML, PHP and then databases.</p><p>The PostgreSQL chapter includes a chart comparing its
features with other databases such as Oracle 8, Sybase 11 and
MiniSQL. Strangely, the chart doesn't make any references to MySQL.
The chapter also contains examples showing the syntax for
connecting to a PostgreSQL database using PHP3 and how inserts and
selections are made.</p><p>The chapter on MySQL seems to be missing some information.
Instead of following the same pattern as the previous chapter,
readers are given three short paragraphs about the history of MySQL
and seven paragraphs discussing speed differences compared to
PostgreSQL. If this were the beginning of the MySQL chapter and it
carried on to cover connecting to MySQL databases and other MySQL
information in a format similar to that of the PostgreSQL chapter,
all would be well, but it's only a brief description of the
software speed. Not even a look into the format of commands is
offered. This wouldn't be an issue, except the preface of the book
says it &ldquo;emphasizes applications using PostgreSQL and MySQL.&rdquo;
Both database types should have been given the same type of
coverage. As it is, MySQL could well have been &ldquo;swept into&rdquo; the
short (three-page) Chapter 6, &ldquo;Other SQL Databases&rdquo;.</p><p>The PHP3 Language chapter is fairly detailed and uses several
examples. Many of these contain humour to help teach functions and
how they're used. The example used for classes was the most
memorable for its humour. I found this chapter most informative,
but wish more time had been spent on how classes are used in
real-world applications.</p><p>Chapter 11 comes back to a fuller discussion of databases and
SQL, as well as database design. There seems to be only brief
coverage of column (field) types such as string, numeric, date,
etc. used in databases, although each type is mentioned within the
scope of examples given. A beginner's book on building database
applications should have more information on this topic in order to
explain the pros and cons for some of the more common choices
available. I expected to see the examples in the format of
PostgreSQL first, followed by MySQL to show similarities and
important differences between the two types of databases, but this
wasn't the case.</p><p>The applications include Hello World, File-Based Counter,
Data-Based Counter, Real-Time Graphics, Jeff's Super Form (a
web-to-e-mail form), Specific Form Processor (a web-to-e-mail form
that stores information in a database), Querying Application and
Login Authentication (in which users allowed to access a page are
stored in a database).</p><p>The application section had numerous typos that hopefully
will be removed in the next edition of the book. Moderately
experienced readers should be able to catch most errors, but
inexperienced users might not. For example, the text discussing the
second application uses a different variable than was used in the
&ldquo;Complete Code&rdquo; listing&mdash;<b  >$counter</b> mysteriously
changes to <b  >$tcounter</b> two pages after the
complete listing.</p><p>The Real Time Graphics application shows how to build a
runtime graphic &ldquo;button&rdquo; using text based on the user's input.
However, it's not fully explained that in order for this code to
work, there must be an existing graphic (&ldquo;image/logo1.gif&rdquo;).
Perhaps the authors assumed the code (and graphic) would be
included on the CD. Once a suitable image file was mustered, the
example code worked as described. Beginners may find this
frustrating and give up before going further.</p><p>Again, all of the database applications are listed using
PostgreSQL exclusively. This could be forgiven if the front of the
book had listed only the one type of database. Trying to use the
examples as given require numerous modifications when used with
MySQL.</p><p>After each application, in a segment labeled
&ldquo;Troubleshooting&rdquo;, readers are told &ldquo;What can go wrong? About a
million things&rdquo; and &ldquo;try your application directly on the Readers
Only PHP3 Web Site&rdquo;. The same paragraph is repeated word-for-word
between each application. A short list of the most common types of
errors would have been more appropriate.</p><p>The bulk of the book is the &ldquo;Language and Function Reference
for PHP3&rdquo;, and as stated in the preface, this section isn't a
repeat of the PHP3 manual. Items are listed by functional category,
and each item includes a short example on how to use it. Where
required, further information on the item is given in a clearly
boxed area. It provides a convenient off-line reference for PHP3,
and seems to have had a great deal of time and effort put into
it.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Building Database Applications on the Web Using
PHP3</em></span> doesn't live up to its title. It
<span   class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> a reasonable PHP3 reference, and it's nice
to have this in a printed format. The writing style used is upbeat
and pleasant, and the segments that cover detailed information are
clear and understandable. The problem lies in the organization of
the book, numerous typos and missing details.</p></div></div>
