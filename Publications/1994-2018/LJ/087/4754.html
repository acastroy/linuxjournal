</p><p>Do I need to put a copyright notice on my software?</p><p>&mdash;Laura Owen, Women.Com</p><p>Until 1976, copyright law imposed formal notice requirements.
The failure of a copyright owner, through carelessness or
inadvertence, to comply with the notice requirements caused the
work to fall into the public domain. In 1976 Congress amended the
Copyright Act to liberalize the notice requirement. Placement of a
notice was still required, but if the owner neglected to do so, the
defect could be cured by registration of the copyright and other
actions within five years after publication. Then, in 1989, a new
Copyright Act came into effect, bringing US law into compliance
with the Berne Convention. For the first time, notice on published
copies was no longer a condition of copyright protection. A
copyright notice is still important, however. The Copyright Act, in
section 401(d), provides that the presence of a copyright notice
prevents a copyright infringer from claiming her infringement was
innocent. That is, it prevents her from making the &ldquo;I didn't know
I was doing something wrong&rdquo; defense. This has a major impact on
potential damages for infringement. An &ldquo;innocent infringer&rdquo; may
convince a court to reduce the award of statutory damages to $200,
but a &ldquo;willful infringer&rdquo; can be held liable for statutory
damages of up to $100,000. A copyright notice is easy to write. For
most software, it consists of the following three elements: the
symbol &copy;, the word &ldquo;Copyright&rdquo; or the abbreviation &ldquo;Copr&rdquo;;
the year of first publication of the work; and the name of the
owner of the copyright. Make sure your copyright notice is affixed
to copies in such manner and location as to give reasonable notice
of your copyright. Put a notice on disks or CDs containing your
software, in documentation accompanying your software and on web
sites from which your software is downloaded. A proper copyright
notice, even though not mandatory, can have a big payoff if you
ever have to enforce your copyright.</p><p>Can a software license restrict my ability to use
software?</p><p>&mdash;Harry Adams, Oracle Corp.</p><p>Most software licenses are based on copyright law. The owner
of a copyright in computer software has the exclusive rights to do
and to authorize, among other things, the reproduction of the
copyrighted work in copies. No third party can make a copy of
software without obtaining the permission of the copyright owner.
The word &ldquo;copy&rdquo; has a specific definition in the Copyright Act:
copies are &ldquo;material objects, other than phonorecords, in which a
work is fixed by any method now known or later developed, and from
which the work can be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise
communicated, either directly or with the aid of a machine or
device&rdquo;. That definition creates a unique problem for software.
The simple loading of a computer program into memory has been held
to involve the creation of a copy, one of the exclusive rights of
the copyright owner. So the mere act of running a program, and thus
making a copy of the software in memory, can only be done with
permission - unless we can point to another section of the
copyright law that expressly authorizes the making of copies to use
software. Congress resolved that problem in the Copyright Act of
1976 to allow software to be used when it added, in section 117, a
limitation on the exclusive rights of copyright owners.
Notwithstanding the other provisions of the law, it is not an
infringement for the owner of a copy of a computer program to make
or authorize the making of another copy of that program provided
that such a new copy &ldquo;is created as an essential step in the
utilization of the computer program or in conjunction with a
machine and that it is used in no other manner&rdquo;. To the extent
that software you license is protected by copyright, section 117 of
the Copyright Act provides that you are free to copy the software
into memory for execution, and thus to use it in the normal fashion
for which it is designed. Be careful though. Proprietary software
licenses can contain other restrictions on use. Those restrictions
do not stem from the copyright law, but they are imposed in a
contract (e.g., the license agreement) between you and the software
provider. Free and open-source software licenses do not impose such
abhorrent contractual limitations on use. When you use software
made available under licenses approved by the Free Software
Foundation (FSF) or Open Source Initiative (OSI), you can be
confident that you can use the software freely, just as the
Copyright Act provides.</p><p>Legal advice must be provided in the course of an
