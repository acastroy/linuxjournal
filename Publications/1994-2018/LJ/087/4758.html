so your article on MPEG-1 playback programs caught my eye
(<i  >LJ</i> May 2001). I found several factual errors
about MPEG in the article.</p><p>First, MPEG-2 video does not necessarily have better video
quality than MPEG-1: the differences between the video portions of
the MPEG-1 and MPEG-2 standards are fairly minor. An MPEG-1 file
with a 720 x 480 frame size, compressed to 6 Mbit/s is legal, and
will be very similar in appearance to a 720 x 480 6 Mbit/s MPEG-2
movie.</p><p>Second, the author states that &ldquo;not all MPEG-1 files are
entirely `compliant&rdquo;'. The MPEG standards define what a compliant
decoder is expected to be able to handle, but not how a compliant
encoder works. In other words, a compliant decoder is not one that
is &ldquo;tolerant&rdquo;, but is instead one that adheres closely to the
letter of the ISO 13818 standard, so as not to be surprised by the
output of a novel (but legal!) encoder. Unfortunately for free
software authors, these documents are expensive: the basic set of
MPEG-2 PDFs (ISO 13818-1 through -3) costs $424, and the complete
set is $1,390 (from
<a href="http://webstore.ansi.org" target="_self">http://webstore.ansi.org/</a>).
It's little wonder that commercial MPEG products far outstrip free
ones' capabilities, in nearly all cases.</p><p>Third, the author states that an &ldquo;MPEG-1 audio stream...is
an MP3 file&rdquo;. This is not always true, and is not even likely.
MPEG-1 defines three different audio encodings (or &ldquo;layers&rdquo;).
Layer I audio is the most basic, but it isn't used very often.
Layer II is the most common: video CDs and MPEG files you download
from the Internet almost always use Layer II audio. Layer III (aka
MP3) is optional, so most MPEG decoders don't include support for
it. Since few decoders support Layer III audio, most encoder
creators also don't bother including support for it.</p><p>&mdash;Warren Young</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc0c580.0xd043f8"></a>Certified Sword</h2></div></div><p>Just a note to let you know that the certified sword cuts
both directions (Editorial focus, <i  >LJ</i> May
2001). As CIO of a multimillion dollar corporation it is my job to
not only run the IS department but to hire and fire employees. One
of the first questions I ask is if the prospective employee has any
certifications, if so I politely tell them &ldquo;I'll let you know if
we can use you&rdquo; and promptly throw their application into the
garbage can.</p><p>Before you ask, no I am not certified. I have however taught
pre-MCSE classes at Unisoft Institute of Technology in Houston and
was horrified to learn that I had to teach the way the test worked,
and the way the real world worked (pre-MCSE in this case really
meant A+ and Networking certification). This effectively meant that
I held two classes in one, which to say the least was difficult.
Additionally, long ago before computers were my profession I was an
ASE-certified mechanic. Since I have passed 10 ASE certifications I
can tell you that they are just as much a joke as computer
certifications. I quickly realized that even holding all the
certifications I did, and after graduating from a top automotive
technical school with a 4.0 GPA and Alpha Beta Kappa National Honor
Society, that I was not a very good mechanic.</p><p>To me, being certified means that the person does not have
enough knowledge or experience to get the job on their own merits
and hopes that this piece of paper will help them, and it does not.
In my experience the only time certifications help you is when you
are applying to a business where the person responsible for
creating hiring policies is not a real computer technician.</p><p>I am forced to deal with MIS and IS degrees from recent
college graduates as well as a plethora of certifications on a
regular basis. Unfortunately, I have found that the people who have
neither a degree nor a certification but who have been working with
computers for ten years are much better equipped to handle the job.
At least if they are inexperienced I can teach them the way things
really work instead of attempting to retrain them after they have
their degree or certification.</p><p>&mdash;Allan Hall</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc0c580.0xd046b8"></a>Carried Away with Gratitude</h2></div></div><p>I very much enjoyed the April 2001 <i  >Linux Journal</i> article &ldquo;Linux on Carrier Grade Web Servers&rdquo;.
You did a nice job of describing the software choice, hardware
environment and test results. I look forward to future articles
discussing the other LVS implementations (direct routing and IP
tunneling) and comparing their stability and performance with that
of the NAT implementation.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>&mdash;Bill Landahl</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc0c580.0xd048c8"></a>Some Saucy Suggestions</h2></div></div><p>I enjoyed your articles on Linux Certification
(<i  >LJ</i> May 2001). I thought the &ldquo;real-life&rdquo;
experience was very telling, although perhaps toned-down a bit to
protect the vendors.</p><p>Here's my thoughts on what I read:</p><p>We can earn an extra $10K per year by becoming certified?
Really? Who can? New grads? Having worked on, supported and/or
maintained SVR4, AIX, HP-UX and Solaris for twenty years, I can't
imagine getting another $10K just because I had some Linux
certificate.</p><p>I looked at some of the questions from Red Hat's and Sair's
study guides and tests. What a crock! &ldquo;What's the fdisk type code
for a Linux swap partition?&rdquo; Who cares?! Look it up by typing
<b  >l</b> to list the types. Forgot that command? Type
<b  >?</b> to list them all. Better yet were the
impossible to understand questions and answers on Sair's test.
Their &ldquo;correct&rdquo; answer for <b  >wc -l *</b> is that it
returns the total number of lines in the files. Gee, my experience
is that it shows the line count for each file, followed by the
total, but that answer isn't available. Yes, they want the entire
Linux community to help improve the tests, but if they can't get
the simple things right, I'd hate to see how they do with the hard
topics.</p><p>Finally, the exam companies could learn a good lesson from
the FCC and ARRL. The amateur radio exams are also multiple choice,
but they are composed of a certain number of sub-elements. Each
sub-element has a number or required topics. Each topic has a
number of published questions and answers, with references to the
rules and regulations. The effect is, the actual exam might have
only 25 questions, but those questions are pulled from a pool of
several hundred, and each critical element is covered.</p><p>&mdash;Mike Hall</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc0c580.0xd04ce8"></a>Thanks for the GRUB</h2></div></div><p>Mr. Marshall,</p><p>I want to extend a gigantic thank you for the article in the
May 2001 issue of <i  >Linux Journal</i> on the GNU
Boot loader, &ldquo;Boot with GRUB&rdquo;. It could not have arrived at a
better time.</p><p>We have a Linux machine whose main (boot) hard-drive started
giving us IDE bus resets and other attendant errors. It became
unusable although we are pretty sure the files we need are probably
still good.</p><p>I tried constructing a new system from scratch and then
copying the needed files and applications to the new system.
Unfortunately this didn't work.</p><p>After some effort I was able to clone the bad drive onto a
similarly-sized replacement drive using Norton's Ghost program.
However, the LILO booter was no longer functional.</p><p>With the use of the information in your article I was able to
construct a boot floppy that would get the replacement drive
booted, and then I ran LILO on it to get the boot configuration
properly re-written onto the drive. It is now a booting
system.</p><p>&mdash;Keith Ericson</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc0c580.0xd05058"></a>What Do You Expect?</h2></div></div><p>In the &ldquo;Best of Technical Support&rdquo; May 2001 a suggestion
was made to use the command
<span   class="bold"><b>expect</b></span>. The editor inserted a note
that expect was described in an article published in the December
2000 <i  >Linux Journal</i> but did not mention the
specific article, author or page number. I relied on the
Interactive Journal to find it. However, expect did not get picked
up by your search engine. I ended up searching each article with my
web browser's find feature and did locate the article: &ldquo;Linux
System Administration: A User's Guide&rdquo; by Marcel Gagn&eacute;. May I
suggest that when referencing an earlier article that you use a
fuller citation. Thanks.</p><p>&mdash;George Palma</p><p>In addition to Marcel's article, we've run two other articles
on expect. One can be found in issue 54, &ldquo;Automating Tasks with
expect&rdquo; and one in 68, &ldquo;What Can You Expect?&rdquo;</p><p>&mdash;Editor</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc0c580.0xd05318"></a>History Lesson</h2></div></div><p>I would be more inclined to take Tobin Maginnis' infomercial
on Sair Certification, &ldquo;Why be Certified&rdquo;, seriously, if his
grasp of PC history wasn't as shaky as his understanding of
Shakespeare (<i  >LJ</i> May 2001).</p><p>When IBM introduced the original PC, it didn't
&ldquo;revolutionize the technology&rdquo;. The design borrowed pretty
heavily from the Apple II, and for the first few years of its life,
it was a fairly pathetic machine. However, it had the one magic
component, those three letters on the label. That made it socially
acceptable in the office, even though it was distinctly inferior to
the CP/M machines of the time. (On the positive side, it brought an
end to the bewildering proliferation of floppy disk formats then
current.)</p><p>Ever since Novell hit on the concept of certification as an
extra cash cow, and corrupted the term &ldquo;engineer&rdquo; in the process,
it's been making life easier for ignorant personnel (aka HR) types
to sort resumes into piles, and I don't suppose that's going to go
away. The only question is, to which pile will this certificate
direct my resume?</p><p>&mdash;Alan Rocker</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc0c580.0xd05580"></a>Deep Pockets</h2></div></div><p>I received the latest issue with the Training &amp;
Certification focus and was very disappointed to read that Red
Hat's RHCE program was given essentially no print space, despite
being widely recognized as the industry leader in Linux
certification.</p><p>Having just completed the course, I can say that it is an
accurate measure of a person's basic Linux systems administration
skills, and even with 6+ years experience administering Linux, I
found the class informative and the exam challenging.</p><p>I find the lack of mention of the course very disturbing, and
I can only hope that this is not the beginning of a trend that will
see <i  >LJ</i> catering towards advertisers with deep
pockets rather than accurately reporting on the Linux world.</p><p>&mdash;Cheyenne T. Greatorex, RHCE</p><p>Cheyenne, There certainly is no such trend. Between Sair, LCI
and Red Hat I would have to say that the latter has the deepest
pockets.</p><p>&mdash;Editor</p></div></div>
