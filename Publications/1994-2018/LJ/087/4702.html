    Mitch shows how to use gnome-python's libglade binding to
    build Python-based GUI applications with little manual coding.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc97580.0xd8f558"></a></h2></div></div><p>Glade is a GUI builder for the Gtk+
toolkit. Glade makes it easy to create user interfaces
interactively, and it can generate source code for those interfaces
as well as stubs for user interface callbacks.
</p><p>The libglade library allows programs to instantiate widget
hierarchies defined in Glade project files easily. It includes a
way to bind callbacks named in the project file to program-supplied
callback routines.</p><p>James Henstridge maintains both libglade and the gnome-python
package, which is a Python binding to the Gtk+ toolkit, the GNOME
user interface libraries and libglade itself. Using libglade
binding to build Python-based GUI applications can provide
significant savings in development and maintenance costs.</p><p>All code examples in this article have been developed using
Glade 0.5.11, gnome-python 1.0.53 and Python 2.1b1 running on
Mandrake Linux 7.2.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc97580.0xd8f768"></a>Running Glade</h2></div></div><p>When launched, Glade displays three top-level windows (see
Figure 1). The application main window shows the contents of the
current Glade project file as a list of top-level windows and
dialogs defined in the project file. The Palette window shows the
Gtk+ and GNOME widgets supported by Glade. When a widget is
selected for editing, the Properties window displays the current
values of that widget's properties.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4702f1.large.jpg"><img src="4702f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Launching Glade
</p></div></div><p>The Palette window partitions Glade's supported widgets into
three groups. &ldquo;GTK+ Basic&rdquo; widgets are the most commonly used
Gtk+ widgets. &ldquo;GTK+ Additional&rdquo; are less frequently used widgets
such as rulers and calendars. &ldquo;Gnome&rdquo; widgets are taken from the
GNOME UI library.</p><p>The Properties window displays widget properties in a
four-page notebook. The Widget page displays the widget's name
along with any properties that are specific to the widget's class.
When the widget is placed inside a constraint-based container such
as a GtkTable or GtkVBox, the Place page shows the properties that
control the widget's placement within its container; otherwise the
Place page is empty. The Basic page displays basic properties, such
as width and height, possessed by all kinds of widgets. Finally,
the Signals page lets you browse the set of Gtk+ signals that the
selected widget can emit and lets you bind signal handler functions
to those signals.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc97580.0xd8fad8"></a>Creating Widget Hierarchies</h2></div></div><p>The process of laying out a widget hierarchy within Glade is
similar to that in environments such as Visual Basic. The root of
every hierarchy is a top-level window or a dialog. Widgets can be
placed within these top-level containers by first selecting, in the
Glade Palette window, the type of widget to be created, then
clicking on any cross-hatched region within the containers.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc97580.0xd8fbe0"></a>Defining Signal Handlers</h2></div></div><p>The Signals page of the Glade Properties window lets you add
application-specific behavior to your application. The top part of
the page lists the signal handlers defined for the current widget.
The controls in the bottom part of the page let you select one of
the signals emitted by the widget and create a new handler for
it.</p><p>To define a new signal handler, click on the ellipsis button
to the right of the Signal entry field. A Select Signal dialog
appears, listing all of the signals that this widget can emit. The
signals are grouped by the Gtk+ widget class in which they are
defined (see Figure 2).</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4702f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Select Signal Dialog
</p></div></div><p>Once you have selected a signal, click OK in the Select
Signal dialog. The name of the selected signal appears in the
Signal entry field of the Signals page. Glade also automatically
fills in the Handler field, using the naming convention of
&ldquo;on_&lt;<span   class="emphasis"><em>widget</em></span>&gt;_&lt;<span   class="emphasis"><em>signal</em></span>&gt;&rdquo;.
You can change the name manually if Glade's naming conventions
don't suit your needs.</p><p>The bottom portion of the Signals page provides additional
entry fields where you can supply application-specific data,
specify an object to receive the signal, and so on. I always leave
these fields empty because they aren't needed when working with
gnome-python.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc97580.0xd90058"></a>Glade Project Files</h2></div></div><p>Glade saves information about a project in an XML-formatted
project file having a filename extension of .glade. Glade's use of
XML makes it easy to build separate add-on tools that operate on
project files, such as code generators for new programming
languages.</p><p>The first time you save a new project, Glade presents you
with a Project Options dialog. Most of the settings in the Project
Options dialog matter only when you are using Glade to generate
source code for your project. However, some settings, such as the
project directory, are important even when you are just using Glade
as a layout tool.</p><p>By default Glade assumes you want to save your new project
under your login directory, in a subdirectory named
Projects/project1. This is probably not what you want. I usually
save the project in the directory in which Glade was
started.</p><p>Fortunately, it's easy to reset the project directory. Just
click the Browse... button to the right of the Project Directory
entry field, and a dialog entitled Select the Project Directory
appears. This dialog selects Glade's current working directory by
default, so you can just click its OK button.</p><p>When you do so the Project Directory field in the Project
Options dialog changes to the current working directory, and the
Project Name field goes blank. Type in a new project name, and the
Program Name and Project File fields update accordingly (see Figure
3). When you click OK, your project will be saved to the specified
project file.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4702f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Project Options Dialog
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc97580.0xd90478"></a>Using libglade</h2></div></div><p>Once you have created a Glade project file, you can use
gnome-python's libglade module to create the visual hierarchy
described in the project file and to gain programmatic access to
the widgets in the hierarchy:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
import libglade
loader = libglade.GladeXML ("helloworld.glade", "window1")
</pre><p>The libglade library defines a class, GladeXML, which does
most of the work. To load a widget hierarchy, instantiate GladeXML
and pass it the name of the Glade project file, along with the name
of the topmost widget that you want to load from the file.
</p><p>Note that you can supply the name of any widget in the
hierarchy, even if it's buried deeply within a top-level window.
This makes it possible to partition complex visual hierarchies&mdash;for
example, the pages of a complex notebook-based interface&mdash;across
multiple Glade project files. It also makes it easy to handle
projects with dynamic visual content, loading only the components
that are appropriate at any given time.</p><p>Once you have loaded a widget hierarchy, GladeXML lets you
look up specific widgets by name via the
<span   class="bold"><b>get_widget</b></span> method.
<span   class="bold"><b>get_widget</b></span> returns the widget you
requested or &ldquo;None&rdquo; if the widget cannot be found:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
window1 = loader.get_widget("window1")
if window1:
    window1.set_title("Hello, World!")
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc97580.0xd907e8"></a>Connecting Signal Handlers</h2></div></div><p>One of the most powerful features of GladeXML is that it can
bind Python callable objects (methods, functions, etc.) to signal
handlers named in a Glade project file. The
<span   class="bold"><b>signal_autoconnect</b></span> method makes
this possible.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>signal_autoconnect</b></span> takes one
argument: a dictionary mapping signal handler names to Python
callables. For each of the signal handlers you've defined in your
Glade project file, signal_autoconnect looks up the corresponding
Python callable in the supplied dictionary. If a matching entry is
found it is bound to the signal. In other words, your Python
callable gets installed as the signal handler:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
def button1_click_handler(*args):
    print "Don't push that button!"
signal_handlers = {
    # Exit the main event loop when the user closes
      the main window.
    'on_window1_delete_event': gtk.mainquit,
    # Call button1_click_handler when the user clicks
      button1.
    'on_button1_clicked': button1_click_handler
    }
loader.signal_autoconnect(signal_handlers)
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc97580.0xd90a50"></a>GladeBase</h2></div></div><p>By itself, libglade greatly reduces the manual coding needed
for a gnome-python application. Widget hierarchies can be laid out
using Glade and loaded with just two or three lines of code, as
opposed to the hundreds that would be needed to create them using
direct pygtk calls. What's more, behaviors can be added simply by
assembling a dictionary of Python callables and passing it to
GladeXML.signal_autoconnect instead of repeatedly invoking widget
connect methods.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>libglade</b></span> saves a lot of
effort, but it could do more. For instance, large Python
applications are often structured as a small main program and an
associated collection of Python packages installed somewhere on the
Python path. Maintenance costs would be reduced if the
application's Glade project files could be stored together with its
Python packages and &ldquo;imported&rdquo; at runtime via relative
pathnames.</p><p>It would also be helpful if widgets could be accessed
directly as instance variables of some sort of UI hierarchy object
without having to be located via GladeXML.get_widget.</p><p>Finally, it should be possible to automate building a
dictionary of the callables in an object's namespace and passing
that dictionary to signal_autoconnect. This would allow clients to
define signal handlers as object methods and avoid explicitly
registering the handlers.</p><p>The following sections describe a module, GladeBase, that
provides these features. GladeBase also recasts the services of
libglade to fit the MVC (model view controller) design pattern (see
Listing 1 at
<a href="../listings/087/" target="_self">ftp://ftp.linuxjournal.com/pub/lj/listings/issue87/</a>).
GladeBase has two principal exports: class UI and class
Controller.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc97580.0xd875f8"></a>GladeBase.UI</h2></div></div><p>GladeBase.UI corresponds to the View component of the MVC
design pattern. It is responsible for creating a widget hierarchy
from a Glade project file and for updating the visual content of an
application under direction of an associated controller.
GladeBase.UI is derived from libglade's GladeXML class, so it
inherits all of the methods discussed earlier.</p><p>The GladeBase.UI constructor takes three arguments: the
filename of the Glade project file from which it will load its
widget hierarchy, the name of the widget that serves as the root of
the hierarchy and an optional keyword argument, gladeDir, which is
the relative pathname of a directory in which to look for Glade
project files.</p><p>The gladeDir keyword argument defaults to the current working
directory. It is joined with the filename argument to form the
relative pathname of the Glade project file.</p><p>It may seem odd to use both gladeDir and filename parameters
instead of specifying the location of the Glade project file with a
single relative pathname. But this separation can reduce
maintenance costs for any application that stores its Glade project
files in a single subpackage.</p><p>Such an application can define a subclass of GladeBase.UI,
which provides a hardwired value for gladeDir:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
import GladeBase
class UIBase(GladeBase.UI):
  def __init__(self, filename, rootname):
    GladeBase.UI.__init__(self, filename, rootname,
                          gladeDir="MyApp/GladeFiles")
class MainWinUI(UIBase):
  def __init__(self):
    UIBase.__init__(self, "main_win.glade", "window1")
</pre><p>Then the application can derive all of its UI classes from
this subclass. In this way the application can specify in one place
the relative pathname of the directory containing all of its Glade
project files.
</p><p>A helper module, PathFinder.py, enables GladeBase.UI to
search the Python path for files. The PathFinder.find function
takes a pathname as its sole argument. If the pathname is absolute,
it is returned without further processing. If it is a relative
pathname, the find function joins it with each Python path entry in
turn to create a candidate pathname. If the candidate pathname
exists, it is returned. If no candidate pathname matches, find
raises a PathFinder.Error exception (see Listing 2).</p><p><a href="4702l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2.
PathFinder.py</a></p><p>The GladeBase.UI.__getattr__ method makes it possible for
clients to access the widgets in a GladeBase.UI hierarchy as though
they were attributes of the instance. The __getattr__ method
assumes that the attribute name provided by the caller is the name
of a widget and looks up the widget using GladeXML.get_widget. Once
the widget is found, it is cached as a new instance variable to
speed up future access. If the requested widget can't be found,
__getattr__ raises an AttributeError.</p><p>If a widget hierarchy contains more than one widget with the
same name, there's no telling which one will be returned by
GladeBase.UI. When you're using GladeBase.UI it's a good idea to
name widgets the same way you would name Python instance
attributes: each name should be unique to the object and should be
a valid Python identifier.</p><p>Application-specific UI classes usually extend GladeBase.UI
with methods to perform complex user interface updates.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc97580.0xd87b20"></a>GladeBase.Controller</h2></div></div><p>GladeBase.Controller corresponds to the Controller component
of MVC. A Controller responds to user input events by translating
them into changes in the state of the application data model.
Similarly, it responds to changes in the data model by translating
them into UI updates.</p><p>GladeBase.Controller doesn't help you respond to changes in
your application's data model, but it does automatically wire up
signal handler methods to the signal handlers defined in a Glade
project file.</p><p>The GladeBase.Controller constructor takes one argument: an
instance of GladeBase.UI that is the UI to be controlled. During
initialization, a new GladeBase.Controller instance traverses its
class hierarchy, building up a dictionary of all callable objects
in the instance's namespace (the traversal starts with the instance
dictionary in case any callables have been defined as instance
attributes). GladeBase.Controller then passes this dictionary to
the signal_autoconnect method of the supplied GladeBase.UI
instance.</p><p>Application-specific controller classes extend
GladeBase.Controller simply by defining signal handler
methods:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
class Controller(GladeBase.Controller):
    def __init__(self, ui):
        ...
        GladeBase.Controller.__init__(self, ui)
    def on_window1_delete_event(self, *args):
        gtk.mainquit()
    def on_button1_clicked(self, *args):
        print "Button 1 clicked."
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc97580.0xd87d88"></a>Generating Controller Stubs</h2></div></div><p>GladeBase automates the conversion of Gtk+ widget hierarchies
to Python object hierarchies and automatically connects
Python-based signal handlers, but it still requires you to identify
and implement all of the signal handlers defined in a Glade project
file. For pure Gtk+ projects this is no problem because the only
signal handlers are the ones you explicitly define.</p><p>However, when you use Glade to build a GNOME application,
many signal handlers are defined automatically. For example, a new
Gnome Application window is created with a standard menubar whose
menu items all have predefined activate signal handlers. It can be
tedious to browse through GNOME-based projects, manually locating
predefined signal handlers and adding them to your application
controllers.</p><p>As noted earlier, Glade project files are stored in an XML
format (as of yet there is no DTD describing the structure of a
project file, but it is easy to understand by inspection). Python
2.0 includes an XML library, layered atop James Clark's Expat
library. So it's fairly easy to build a Python application that
rummages through a Glade project file, identifies all of the signal
handlers declared in a given widget hierarchy and generates a
stubbed Controller module for that hierarchy.</p><p>GladeProjectSignals.py (see Listing 3 at
<a href="../listings/087/" target="_self">ftp://ftp.linuxjournal.com/pub/lj/listings/issue87/</a>)
extracts signal-handler information from a Glade project file. The
module has two main abstractions. Class WidgetTreeSignals traverses
an XML DOM (document object model) tree representing a widget
hierarchy and records all of the signal handler declarations it
finds. Class GladeProjectSignals loads a Glade project file and
builds up a dictionary of WidgetTreeSignal instances, one for each
top-level widget defined in the project file.</p><p>The constructor for WidgetTreeSignals takes a DOM node as
argument. It assumes this node describes a widget and expects it to
contain a name node defining the widget's name. Having recorded the
widget's name, WidgetTreeSignals walks the DOM tree. It checks each
visited node to see if it is a signal node. If it is,
WidgetTreeSignals records the value of the node's handler child,
which should be the name of a signal handler. Otherwise,
WidgetTreeSignals assumes the node contains child nodes and
continues traversing those.</p><p>GladeProjectSignals is comparatively simple. It uses Python's
xml.dom.minidom package to load a Glade project file as a DOM tree.
Then it searches the tree for top-level widget nodes (a Glade
design file contains other top-level nodes such as the
GTK-Interface and project nodes). For every widget node found,
GladeProjectSignals creates a new WidgetTreeSignals instance, which
in turn lists the signal handlers defined by that widget and its
descendants. Each WidgetTreeSignal instance is stored in a
dictionary, self.widgets, keyed by top-level widget name.</p><p>ControllerGenerator.py (see Listing 4 at
<a href="../listings/087/" target="_self">ftp://ftp.linuxjournal.com/pub/lj/listings/issue87/</a>),
when invoked with a Glade project filename and the name of a
top-level widget defined in that file, prints out a stubbed
Controller for that widget and its children.</p><p>Most of the module's work is done by class
ControllerGenerator. This class defines a generate method that
takes a Glade project filename and top-level widget name as
arguments. The generate method uses an instance of
GladeProjectSignals to find the handlers for the named widget. Then
it creates a list of stubs for those handlers. Using a template
string and Python's string formatting operators, generate produces
a string containing the body of the stubbed Controller module and
returns that to its caller.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc97580.0xd881a8"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>Glade, libglade and gnome-python can greatly reduce the
effort of building Gtk+ and GNOME applications in Python. The tools
presented in this article reduce maintenance costs even further by
automating the conversion of Glade widget hierarchies to Python
object hierarchies, automatically connecting signal handlers
defined in Controllers and generating stubbed Controllers.</p><p><a href="4702s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
