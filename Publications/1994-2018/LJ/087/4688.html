</p><p>Good programming books are hard to find. By &ldquo;good&rdquo;, I mean
that things like an author's bias does not overshadow the value of
information in the work, the writing is clear, appendices are used
as addenda to the written work (and are not half of the text) and
assumptions about user knowledge/skill levels are consistent and
addressed in some kind of chronological order. Lastly, it's most
helpful if the book engages&mdash;not enrages&mdash;the reader.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Programming KDE 2.0: Creating Linux Desktop
Applications</em></span> (CMP, 2001) introduces the reader to
development of KDE applications. The approach B&ouml;l&ouml;ni
takes assumes at least a basic knowledge of C++ and systematically
takes the user through the basics of the Qt libraries, use of
components and all the way to &ldquo;expert touches&rdquo; to make your new
KDE application sparkle.</p><p>If you like KDE, this book is a fine piece of work and will
undoubtedly speed you on your way to creating a &ldquo;killer app&rdquo; of
the finest kind. You will have spent your money wisely.</p><p>If you do not like KDE, if you have found it wanting
(especially its meager memory resources), you will probably not
appreciate B&ouml;l&ouml;ni's &ldquo;boosterism&rdquo;, his detailed
expiation on the history of graphical desktops (unified graphical
desktops in particular) or his utter refusal to broach the subject
of memory management in KDE applications. The only part you might
find a bit amusing is the opening statement of Chapter 1: &ldquo;The K
Desktop Environment (KDE) is the most popular desktop environment
for UNIX-like systems and probably the largest open-source project
ever undertaken.&rdquo;</p><p>If you take things like this seriously, the author has
completed his unofficial (though not unofficious) task of
alienating his readers. If you take these things with a grain of
salt, it is almost possible to enjoy&mdash;and certainly benefit
from&mdash;the information within the book. Almost.</p><p>(For the record, the largest open-source project ever
undertaken would be the GNU project, without which neither Linux
nor KDE would have usable and free development tools to aid their
development.)</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1de6580.0x1edec90"></a>Highlights</h2></div></div><p>From a technical standpoint, there's not much to critique
about B&ouml;l&ouml;ni's work except its premise. The extensive
overhead of C++, even without the KDE libraries, components,
additional objects, etc. can be daunting for many Linux systems
that are not running a minimum of 128MB of RAM. Such information is
ignored, which I find a bit questionable.</p><p>Assuming the developer/user has a hefty amount of RAM and is
comfortable with C++, B&ouml;l&ouml;ni's technical expertise is
evident. The explanatory text and illustrative code samples
complement each other well. For the most part, no obvious glaring
errors appear in either, until we get to the end of the
book.</p><p>In Chapter 8: &ldquo;Expert Touches&rdquo;, B&ouml;l&ouml;ni provides a
wonderful discussion of communications in KDE, what protocols are
involved, what classes actually do&mdash;things like addressing,
&ldquo;marshaling&rdquo; data and registering an application. This is one
section where the author provides some useful information. For
example, his listing of code for &ldquo;LocalChat&rdquo; illustrates his
points well. Although the code is lengthy, it is well-commented and
is a real education in the grunt work of modern communications
tools.</p><p>Another feat is from the &ldquo;smart coders dupe stupid users&rdquo;
school of programming, by way of a flagrant attempt to explain away
the continental-drift speed for which KDE applications are known.
The phenomenon in question is termed &ldquo;perceived performance&rdquo;, as
in the benchmarks say one thing, but the user perceives it
differently. Whose benchmarks is he talking about? Which user(s)?
Linux users? Or the subset we can only call &ldquo;GNU-bies&rdquo;? (Thanks
to Jon Pennington for that wonderful term!) The ensuing discussion,
on &ldquo;tricking&rdquo; the user by employing splash screens (to &ldquo;hide&rdquo;
the length of time the application takes to load) is, one would
have thought, beneath someone of B&ouml;l&ouml;ni's caliber.</p><p>The author deigns to give us some &ldquo;parting thoughts&rdquo; in
Chapter 9 that are either (or both) vague (&ldquo;How to Make Money with
KDE&rdquo; says nothing about how, only that you can) or hypocritical
(Java's advantages are paid for with a massive performance loss?
Pots, kettles, lend us your callings!) and include the following
boast:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>All the reasons I mentioned for using KDE for
custom applications hold for off-the-shelf software, too. But you
must consider one more thing: the size of the market. Given that
KDE is bundled with all the commercial Linux distributions and with
all the major Unices, when writing a KDE application, you are
targeting practically 100% of the Linux/UNIX world.</p></blockquote></div><p>Please. There are a fairly large number of GNOME users that
would choose Glade in a heartbeat over KDE, to say nothing of some
very competent and critical coders using Enlightenment, WindowMaker
and even Blackbox. B&ouml;l&ouml;ni, by not taking these
users/developers into account, misses a large portion of his
potential audience.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1de6580.0x1edf000"></a>Technical Problems</h2></div></div><p>It's a wonderful thing when a book about software includes
the software to which it refers. The author has tried to do this
and with some forethought as to the various distributions on which
KDE 2.0 might be loaded. Having run previous versions of KDE, I
wasn't squeamish about testing it. This was, after all, a newer
release that is better, from some reports, than previous versions.
(Some outfits insist that &ldquo;eats more RAM&rdquo; is synonymous with
&ldquo;better&rdquo;.)</p><p>Suffice it to say that a certain libmng was missing from the
Debian binaries, resulting in a grumpy reviewer, an unhappy 64MB of
RAM (which was slowed down to the point of unusability) and a
crashing bore of a hard drive. Looking for the missing library
entailed a wild goose chase of several hours and bore no fruit.
libmng requires zlib. Requires it but can't see copies of
it.</p><p>Sigh.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1de6580.0x1edf1b8"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>If you have a lot of RAM, like C++ and like creating desktop
applications, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Programming KDE 2.0</em></span> is quite an
acceptable guide. If you're running Debian, don't use the CD that
comes with the book; go to the KDE site
(<a href="http://www.kde.org" target="_self">http://www.kde.org/</a>) and
download it. The book will come in handy as a reference. And if you
don't like KDE, the title alone should put a stop to any impulse
buying.</p></div></div>
