desktop with the most recent 2.1.1 release of the K Desktop
Environment
(<a href="http://www.kde.org" target="_self">http://www.kde.org/</a>). The
development cycle has intensified since the 1.0 series, bringing
new features and stability improvements to users at an
ever-increasing rate. In fact, as of this writing, the first alpha
version of KDE 2.2 has been released for testing. End users and
developers alike will benefit from the newest offering. Currently
supporting 34 languages, KDE is poised to answer many of the
questions surrounding Linux' viability on the desktop.
</p><p>In addition to stability enhancements, the latest release
includes a large number of cosmetic improvements that create a more
unified and polished interface. Kicker, the 2.0 replacement of
KPanel, received a number of new features as well as the return of
an old one. For all of those WindowMaker users who just can't bare
to part with their beloved dock applets, yearn no more. Kicker is
now able to swallow your favorite applets into a new dock
application bar (see Figure 1). Support has also been added for
child panels, and the external taskbar noticeably absent from
version 2.0 has returned, along with theme manager. Despite the
re-inclusion of the theme manager, a lack of integration between
the various theme-able elements of the desktop is still present.
Widget styles, icons, colors, backgrounds and KWin decorations each
need to be managed from their own individual Control Center
modules. The work of the KDE artists team is not be overlooked,
however. A number of icons were added and improved, and the new
splash screens serve to unify desktop applications (see Figure
2).</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4728f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

Figure 2. Desktop Splash Screens
</p></div></div><p>Perhaps one of the most significant advances in the latest
version is anti-aliased font support. In order to enable
anti-aliased fonts, KDE must be built upon QT 2.3, in combination
with XFree86's Xft extension. Linux has been somewhat plagued by
issues regarding true-type fonts and anti-aliasing; while these
advances greatly improve that, setting up anti-aliased fonts can be
a bit of a challenge. Instructions can be found at
<a href="http://trolls.troll.no/~lars/fonts/qt-fonts-HOWTO.html" target="_self">trolls.troll.no/~lars/fonts/qt-fonts-HOWTO.html</a>.
If you installed KDE via packages, it may not have been built using
the necessary libraries. If this is the case, you should check for
newer package versions prior to trying to configure anti-aliased
fonts. Figure 3 shows an enlarged comparison view of a web page as
viewed from within Konquerer with anti-aliased font support and
Netscape without anti-aliased font support.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4728f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Fonts with and without Anti-Alias Font Support
</p></div></div><p>Without a doubt, the gem of the whole project is Konquerer,
KDE's next-generation web browser, file manager and document
viewer. Konquerer's modular architecture allows for easy
extendibility to support current and emerging internet
technologies, such as HTML 4.0, Java, JavaScript, XML, Cascading
Style Sheets (CSS-1 and CSS-2) and SSL. In addition to built-in
components, Konquerer is able to utilize existing Netscape plugins
to provide support for Flash, RealAudio/Video and other multimedia
programs. Taking a page from Eazel's Nautilus, Konquerer added
support for text preview, a feature that creates a thumbnail of the
first few lines of a text document within the icon. When used in
combination with the experimental alpha blending support you are
able to get a semitransparent representation of the MIME-type icon
under the text. In addition to text and image preview, Konquerer is
also capable of generating thumbnails of HTML documents (see Figure
4). HTML files are read and thumbnailed in the background after
loading the directory view, allowing for a smooth browsing
experience.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4728f4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. HTML-file Thumbnails
</p></div></div><p>The mechanisms by which Konquerer becomes more of an
application framework than a file manager or web browser are called
IO Slaves. IO Slaves are small bits of code based on the KIO
library that know how to send and receive data using a specific
protocol. From its inception KDE has focused on network
transparency, and the KIO architecture has allowed for the creation
of a variety of special purpose plugins that enhance the
capabilities of Konquerer. Seamless support exists for browsing the
Linux filesystem, NFS shares, MS Windows shares, web pages, FTP
sites and LDAP directories, to name only a few. With a minimal
amount of code, developers can make available new protocols and
conduits to all KDE applications. Some of the other IO Slaves
developed or being developed include digital camera support via
Gphoto2, which allows for drag-and-drop access to images stored on
your digital camera, and enhancements to the existing audiocd
plugin that allow for drag-and-drop CD ripping and MP3/Ogg Vorbis
encoding. Many of Konquerer's IO Slaves exist without much fanfair,
yet are quite useful. For example, entering
<b  >man:/df"</b> or <b  >"#df</b> into
Konquerer will produce the man page for
<span   class="bold"><b>df</b></span> (or other command of your
choosing). For those preferring the GNU Info documentation browser,
give <b  >info:/df</b> a try. For quick access to your
floppy drive, enter <b  >floppy:/</b> into the location
bar. Another little-known addition to Konquerer is the new shell
command function. For example, while browsing a directory via
Konquerer, pressing Ctrl-e and entering a shell command like
<span   class="bold"><b>du</b></span> will present the user with a
dialog box displaying the output of the command in the currently
viewed directory. A list of currently installed IO Slaves is
available via the information section of the control center.</p><p>One particular IO Slave recently introduced pertains to LAN
browsing. Those coming from a Windows background will most likely
compare this to the Network Neighborhood. At the heart of this new
feature is LISa, or the LAN information server. Unlike the Windows'
Network Neighborhood, LISa only relies upon the TCP/IP stack and no
other protocols such as SMB or NetBIOS. In short, once you
configure LISa with information about the network to which you are
attached, it will probe devices found on the network for commonly
available services, such as FTP, SMB, NFS and HTTP (see Figure 5).
By entering <b  >lan:/</b> into Konquerer, you will be
presented with a list of all discovered servers and their
associated services. While it may sound like LISa would create a
lot of unnecessary network traffic, that is not the case. In fact,
the more clients you have on your network running LISa, the more
efficient it should become. LISa itself is a d&aelig;mon that
runs on the client. Upon startup, that d&aelig;mon sends out
a broadcast in an attempt to discover already existing LISa servers
on the network. In the event that one is found, the network servers
list is transferred to the new client without unnecessary network
probing. At any given point in time, there should be only a single
LISa node on the network doing the actual probing. LISa needs to be
run as root and can be configured via the Network/LAN browsing
control center module. LISa is a component of the kdenetwork
package.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4728f5.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

application development. Among these technologies are the desktop
communication protocol (DCOP), a component object model (KParts),
an XML-based GUI class and the previously mentioned I/O libraries
(KIO). Tying all of these various [development] tools back into the
desktop is the coordinated release of KDE's advanced IDE/RAD,
KDevelop 1.4. Multimedia components are handled via an architecture
built upon the network-transparent analog real-time synthesizer
(<span   class="bold"><b>aRts</b></span>).</p><p>DCOP is the much talked about client-to-client communication
protocol that replaced CORBA early on in the 2.0 development cycle.
DCOP is built upon the standard X11 ICE library and presents a
faster and more lightweight interface than what was previously
being developed with CORBA. KParts, KDE's component object model,
is what allows applications to share components and embed
themselves within one another. The most extensive use of this
technology can be seen in KOffice and Konquerer. Utilizing XML as a
method of creating GUI elements dynamically, developers are able to
provide a more customizable and standardized desktop interface. To
aid desktop constancy, KDE has worked at establishing coding
standards and a GUI styleguide. Since GUI elements are generated
dynamically, updates to the styleguide are reflected immediately
across GUI elements without recompilation or modification.
<span   class="bold"><b>aRts</b></span> utilizes a CORBA-like network
design enabling remote applications to output sound to the local
workstation, providing a multimedia compliment to the
network-transparent features provided by XFree86 and KIO. For more
information on KDevelop or KDE application development, see the
KDevelop 1.4 review on page xx. A wealth of developer-related
information, including tutorials, FAQs and standards guides, can be

desktop operating system over the past few years, and the latest
offering from the KDE camp is indeed a testament to this progress.
With the emergence of new companies, as well as older, more
established ones, focusing on improving and providing applications
for the Linux desktop, greater acceptance is likely not far behind.
The Kompany
(<a href="http://www.thekompany.com" target="_self">http://www.thekompany.com/</a>)
has been turning out an amazing number of much-needed Linux
applications. IBM has been working with Trolltech on integration of
their ViaVoice software into QT to provide speech recognition to
Linux users. KDE development as a whole is moving at a rate faster
than ever before. Each release brings Linux one step closer to
coming out of the data-center and onto the desktop.</p><p><a href="4728s1.html" target="_self">The Good/The Bad</a></p></div></div>
