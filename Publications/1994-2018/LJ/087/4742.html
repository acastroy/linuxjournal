Summit in New York (April 2-4, 2001), where I was on a panel about
&ldquo;The Future of Personalization&rdquo; (briefly, I said there wasn't much
hope, but that's another story). Sitting near me in the audience
was John K. Thompson, VP Worldwide Marketing for a company called
<a href="http://www.whitecross.com" target="_self">WhiteCross</a>.
</p><p>&ldquo;You know&rdquo;, he said, &ldquo;we have the world's fastest Linux
analytical platform. Interested?&rdquo;</p><p>Well, yeah. So a couple hours later we met again, and an
interview followed.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: <span   class="emphasis"><em>Where did
WhiteCross come from?</em></span></p><p><span   class="bold"><b>John</b></span>: We were founded in
1992 by guys who left Teradata. From the beginning we were in the
business of business intelligence: crunching huge amounts of
analytical data. So we built a platform that was about analytical
speed, all-out speed. To do that we started by building a massively
parallel computational system based on Lynx (now LynuxWorks). The
hardware platform was built from pure commodity products: AMD
333MHz chips, IBM SSA drives, Ethernet interconnects.</p><p>Then we started to work on the next generation, called
Lightning. It will scale up to 1.2GHz chips with bigger drives, but
it's still rack-mounted and still fifty times the performance of
the NCR and Sun StarFire boxes.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: <span   class="emphasis"><em>And this is
where Linux came in?</em></span></p><p><span   class="bold"><b>John</b></span>: Right. We decided the
best way to do the new platform was to port the existing platform
over to Linux. Which we did. We now run our ASP in our data centers
in San Francisco and Bracknell, outside of London, and sell
services on top of those. We offer outsourced turnkey analytical
solutions.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: <span   class="emphasis"><em>Give me some
more technical detail here.</em></span></p><p><span   class="bold"><b>John</b></span>: The way this is
written is all about analytics. SQL interface via ODBC. The data
exploration server is a two-tier architectured system. The first
layer is a Sun UNIX platform running Solaris. These are our
communications processors that interface with external systems and
take in data feeds&mdash;loads, streams. We can run these in parallel.
Whether ASCII, EBCDIC or whatever, we convert the data into binary
and load it into the massively parallel part of the system, the DES
(data exploration server).</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: <span   class="emphasis"><em>Which runs on
Linux.</em></span></p><p><span   class="bold"><b>John</b></span>: Right. This is what
used to run on Lynx and now runs on Linux. We can set these up so
they're always running in parallel.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: <span   class="emphasis"><em>What are the
performance improvements over the old system?</em></span></p><p><span   class="bold"><b>John</b></span>: At Freeserve, a large
ISP in the UK, it took 28 hours to do their log files for daily
reporting. We came in and set up the load process on a one-rack
system. It loaded in 50 minutes.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: <span   class="emphasis"><em>How much
better does Linux perform than the old system?</em></span></p><p><span   class="bold"><b>John</b></span>: We have a table where
we compared the new and the old OSes. It lists about 105
operations. When we averaged them all out, Linux came out 20 times
faster.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: <span   class="emphasis"><em>Not too
sloppy.</em></span></p><p><span   class="bold"><b>John</b></span>: What we do is all
about performance. We wouldn't have made the change if the
difference wasn't so high. Between 85 and 95 operations were faster
on Linux. Access to memory, disk reads, swapping cache, disk
writes...Linux kicked butt on nearly all of them.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: <span   class="emphasis"><em>Tell me more
about how your system works.</em></span></p><p><span   class="bold"><b>John</b></span>: Look at it as a
two-tiered system that is massively parallel and can grow with any
client requirements. One of the technical benefits is that a
database made of homogeneous data is as easy to maintain and
operate as one made of fifty different data sources. We're taking
the entire database, bringing it to binary and analyzing the entire
base every time we run against it. So rather than optimization,
indexes and other performance enhancing techniques that DBAs
(database administrators) use, we just put in the data and run
against all of it all of the time. Just snap in more disk and
processor cards. Grow incrementally. The total cost of operation is
marginal compared to a Sun or an Oracle implementation. We're not
worried about user queries, usage patterns or load times, which are
where DBAs spend most of their time. Their question is, &ldquo;How do you
load two terabytes of data in the batch window?&rdquo; We answer that
question. We have an implementation in the US where we're loading
85GB a day in real time, and the system isn't even
straining.</p><p>From a customer perspective, people want to look at divergent
sets of data: product, customer, usage, whatever. What's
traditionally done is make them build different databases. That
fragments the view of the organization and the customers. While
we're loading so much data per day, we're taking a census of the
activity of the customer, the services, the products they're
using&mdash;with this unified data ensemble. We're enabling them to look
at all the views of the business in one data set. They can look at
customers, products, services, network capacity, pricing analysis,
strategic planning on market entry, whatever&mdash;all on one data
set.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: <span   class="emphasis"><em>Is this a
standalone system?</em></span></p><p><span   class="bold"><b>John</b></span>: This goes in as a
complement to other platforms. It adds scaling of data and
analytical processing. It doesn't displace the data warehouse.
We're talking about building a facility that allows simple
reporting, multidimensional analysis, data mining and data
exploration in a very active platform. If you look at most data
warehouses, they're pretty static. We're offering them a dynamic
facility. This dynamism is allowed&mdash;at virtually no cost
whatsoever&mdash;by Linux.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: <span   class="emphasis"><em>So why
Linux?</em></span></p><p><span   class="bold"><b>John</b></span>: It's so flexible.
People usually hear about Linux as a file, print or web server.
We're asking it to do a similar thing. Swapping memory, moving data
on and off disk, parsing an SQL statement and a ton of computation.
The OS does everything in the box. But the key advantage with Linux
is that we can expand just by adding more racks. Plug and
crunch.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: <span   class="emphasis"><em>It should be
easier to manage as well.</em></span></p><p><span   class="bold"><b>John</b></span>: It's very easy to
monitor and administer. We monitor client systems constantly,
sending alerts saying, for example, &ldquo;You're going to go critical on
disk.&rdquo; This lets them give us the signal to add more cards. Then
it's just a hardware cost. The system reconfigures itself and away
it goes. It senses the presence of another card, decides if it's a
processor or disk card, addresses it and carries on.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: <span   class="emphasis"><em>Essentially
the OS falls away both as a cost and an issue.</em></span></p><p><span   class="bold"><b>John</b></span>: Exactly. The only
issue is hardware, and managing it is easy and routine. A lot of
people think there's nothing new in hardware, but this is a new and
simple way to add functionality by adding components that work
together in a way nobody thought they would.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: <span   class="emphasis"><em>Can't beat
the cost on the OS side, either.</em></span></p><p><span   class="bold"><b>John</b></span>: Right. Go get a hot
dog and some Linux. But the openness is a huge benefit too. What
we're doing is an open systems approach engineered in a unique way.
People accept Sun's Starfire and NCR's WorldMark servers as open,
but it's not true. Linux is truly open. It's so ready, any time you
want. When you've got commodity chips strapped together with
commodity drives hooked together with fast Ethernet interconnects,
then you want a commodity OS, and Linux is it.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: <span   class="emphasis"><em>Are you using
a Linux distribution, or something from one of the embedded
toolchain companies?</em></span></p><p><span   class="bold"><b>John</b></span>: The Linux is all ours.
We took the basic kernel and extended it with our own drivers, just
like we had done with Lynx.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc Searls</b></span> is senior editor
