    Take advantage of the ability to track file versions, collaborate
    on projects and get back yesterday's work.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1764580.0x185c608"></a></h2></div></div><p>If you have downloaded software from the
Internet, especially from SourceForge, you probably noticed the
letters CVS. CVS stands for Concurrent Versions System and is a
tool that allows developers to keep track of their projects. It
also allows developers to collaborate on projects.
</p><p>While CVS may be used on large projects with many developers
over a network, this article focuses on its usefulness for
individuals on local systems. A common occurrence with CVS might
begin with making changes to a script or configuration file and
then moving on to other tasks. After some time has passed, you find
your changes aren't working, and you don't have a backup of the
original file, and you can't quite remember all the changes you
made. CVS can help prevent this situation because it keeps track of
changes made to files and allows you to revert to working versions
of them.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1764580.0x185c768"></a>A Brief Overview of CVS</h2></div></div><p>Files under the control of CVS are stored in a special
directory called a repository, and each file has a revision number
maintained by CVS. To make a change to a file, you first must get a
copy of it from the repository. You can get a copy of the latest
revision of a file or any earlier revision stored in CVS. When you
are through working with the file, you put it back into the
repository, and its revision number increases incrementally. Each
time you commit a file to the repository you can supply a log
message that helps keep track of which changes were made to the
file over time.</p><p>CVS differs from other version control systems in that it
doesn't lock files; different developers can check out a file and
work on it at the same time. CVS makes sure one developer's edits
don't conflict with edits made by another developer when the file
is put back into the repository. If conflicts are found, CVS places
markers in the second developer's copy of the file, allowing him or
her to find and resolve the conflicts. Once the conflicts are
resolved, the developer then commits the file to the
repository.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1764580.0x185c8c8"></a>Installing CVS</h2></div></div><p>There is nothing tricky involved in installing CVS. You can
either download and compile the source or install an RPM package or
its equivalent.</p><p>Once CVS is installed you will have to decide where to locate
the repository. It should be in a partition that has a good amount
of free space and one to which you have write permission. Once you
have decided on a location for the repository, you have to create
it and populate it with CVS administration files. This is done
using the CVS <span   class="bold"><b>init</b></span> command. If you
want your repository to be in /usr/local/cvsstuff, you would
execute the CVS command shown below:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cvs -d /usr/local/cvsstuff init
</pre><p>The CVSROOT environment variable, or -d switch, tells CVS
commands which repository to act upon. The CVSROOT variable can be
set by adding the following line to your .bash_profile:
<pre     class="programlisting">
export CVSROOT=/usr/local/cvsstuff
</pre>


</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1764580.0x185cb88"></a>Populating the Repository</h2></div></div><p>To put existing projects into the repository, use the
<span   class="bold"><b>import</b></span> command. For example, say
you have the directory structure shown below and will add other
client directories in the future.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
html_projects/
         client1/
            images/
         client2/
            images/
</pre><p>To place html_projects and everything under it into the
repository, you would use the following commands:
<pre     class="programlisting">
cd html_projects
cvs import -m "Put html_projects in the repository" html_projects vendor release
</pre>


The -m option supplies a log message for the transaction; if you
don't use it CVS starts your default editor so you can type a
message, then finishes the operation when you exit the editor. The
vendor and release tags aren't used by CVS but are required
nonetheless. A typical vendor tag could be your company name, and
&ldquo;start&rdquo; makes a good release tag. If your project contains binary
files, such as pictures, read up on the -k option to ensure they
are copied into the repository correctly.
</p><p>If you were to now look in your repository, you should find a
directory called html_projects containing copies of all the files
in the original html_projects directory.</p><p>Creating a new project under CVS is simply a matter of
creating an empty directory structure and then importing it into
the repository via the import command. As you create the files for
the new project, use the CVS <span   class="bold"><b>add</b></span>
command to put them in the repository.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1764580.0x185cef8"></a>Using CVS</h2></div></div><p>The basic steps for using CVS are as follows: check a project
out of the repository, make changes to project files and verify
whether they work, commit the modified files back into the
repository and supply notes on the changes you made.</p><p>You have to check out files from CVS before you can edit
them. By default CVS checks out the latest revision of a project,
but you can specify earlier revisions if you wish. When you check
out a project from the repository, CVS copies the project's files
to the current directory, creating subdirectories as necessary. You
can check out project files by specifying a directory name (e.g.,
html_projects) or by specifying a specific project file (e.g.,
html_projects/client1/index.html). Specifying a file still creates
the project's directory structure in your working directory, but
only the specified file is copied from the repository.</p><p>To check out client1's files, move to a directory where you
can work, such as your home directory, and then issue the CVS
<span   class="bold"><b>checkout</b></span> command shown below. You
can easily end up with several copies of a project scattered about
if you don't switch to the same starting directory each time you
run the checkout command.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cvs checkout html_projects/client1
</pre><p>Next, switch to the client1 directory (<b  >cd
~/html_projects/client1</b>) and make changes to the files
using your favorite editing tool. Make sure your changes work
before committing a file back into the repository. A common mistake
when using version control software is to check in files too soon.
This causes the repository to contain many versions of the file,
most of which don't work.
</p><p>To put the changed file into the repository, use the
following command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cvs commit -m "made some changes" index.html
</pre><p>CVS will let you know if the file was successfully placed in
the repository and what its new revision number is.
</p><p>You can retrieve earlier revisions of a file by specifying a
revision number or a date with the checkout command. For example,
if index.html is currently at revision 1.3 and you want to retrieve
yesterday's version, which was 1.2, you can do so with either of
the following commands:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cvs checkout -r 1.2 html_projects/client1/index.html
</pre><p>or
<pre     class="programlisting">
cvs checkout -D yesterday html_projects/client1/index.html
</pre>


The -r switch allows you to specify a revision number, while the -D
switch allows you to specify a date. You can specify an ISO
standard date such as 2000-03-23 or a relative date such as
&ldquo;yesterday&rdquo;.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1764580.0x185d478"></a>Adding and Removing Project Files</h2></div></div><p>To add a file to an existing project, check out the project
then create the new file in the project's working directory. Add it
to the repository using the following commands:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cvs add newfile
cvs commit -m "Added newfile to the project" newfile
</pre><p>Removing files is very similar to adding them. First check
out the project, and then delete the files you wish to remove from
the working directory. Remove them from the repository with:
<pre     class="programlisting">
cvs remove newfile
cvs commit -m "Removed newfile from project" newfile
</pre>


</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1764580.0x185d688"></a>Project Aliases</h2></div></div><p>One way to deal with a repository full of project directories
is to take advantage of the ability to use aliases in place of
directory names in CVS commands. Aliases allow you to use short,
meaningful names for projects instead of long directory names. An
alias can also be used to group separate projects under a single
name so they can all be checked out with one command. Finally, an
alias can list specific project files, such as documentation or
header files, allowing you to check out small pieces of a project.
To use aliases you must edit the modules file in the CVSROOT
directory of the repository. This is explained in the CVS
documentation.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1764580.0x185d790"></a>Tagging Project Files</h2></div></div><p>CVS allows you to supply a symbolic or logical name (e.g.,
release-1 or beta) to all the files in a project with the
<span   class="bold"><b>tag</b></span> command. Since each file in a
project might have a different revision number, a tag provides a
way to take a snapshot of the project at a given moment. You can
then use the tag with the -r switch when checking out a project to
retrieve that snapshot, without having to remember the version
numbers of each file in the project. One thing to note is that tags
can't contain spaces or periods.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1764580.0x185d8f0"></a>Project Branches</h2></div></div><p>CVS allows you to create branches of a project where each
branch contains project code in different states, such as a bug-fix
branch and a new features branch. You can work on different
branches without affecting the other branches and then you can
merge the changes from one branch into another
automatically.</p><p>For the sake of example, let's assume you're working on a
project called FaxMan and have released version 1.0. You tagged the
source files in the repository as rel-1-0 upon release, then
started working on version 2.0. Then you get complaints of bugs in
version 1.0 that have to be fixed. To create a branch of the FaxMan
project containing version 1.0 you can use:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cvs rtag -b -r rel-1-0 rel-1-0-bugfix FaxMan
</pre><p>The <span   class="bold"><b>rtag</b></span> command assigns a
new tag (rel-1-0-bugfix) to the code in the repository. The -b flag
means the tag is a new branch, and -r rel-1-0 means this branch
contains the code previously tagged as rel-1-0.
</p><p>To check out and work on the version 1.0 code you would use
the following command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cvs checkout -r rel-1-0-bugfix FaxMan
</pre><p>To merge the bug fixes with the current FaxMan code you first
check out the latest code and then tell CVS to merge the
rel-1-0-bugfix code with it. This is done using:
<pre     class="programlisting">
cvs checkout FaxMan
cvs update -j rel-1-0-bugfix
</pre>


</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1764580.0x185dcb8"></a>CVS Clients</h2></div></div><p>There are several CVS clients available so you don't have to
manipulate CVS from the command line.
<span   class="bold"><b>TkCVS</b></span> is currently at version 6.4
and requires Tcl/Tk 8.1 or better.
<span   class="bold"><b>Pharmacy</b></span>, which is currently at
version 0.2.1, is part of the GNOME project, while
<span   class="bold"><b>Cervisia</b></span>, at version 1.0 stable,
uses the Qt and KDE libraries. Another client that uses the Qt
toolkit is <span   class="bold"><b>LinCVS</b></span>, version 0.3.
See the Resources section for pointers to these projects.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1764580.0x18547b0"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>While CVS is a very powerful tool that allows far-flung
developers to collaborate on projects over the Internet, it is also
easy to configure and use on a local machine. If you frequently
update files and need to keep track of the changes, CVS allows you
to build a record of what changes were made.</p><p><a href="4701s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p><p><a href="4701s2.html" target="_self">Bubble Reviews of CVS
