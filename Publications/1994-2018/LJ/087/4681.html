    bugs.

do nothing. Memory misuse results in a good portion of fatal
program errors, such as program termination and unexpected
behavior.
</p><p>Memory is a device for handling information. Program memory
is usually associated with the amount of physical memory a computer
has but can also reside on secondary storage, such as disk drives,
when not in use. Memory for users is managed by two devices: the
kernel itself and the actual program using calls to memory
functions such as malloc().</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11bc580.0x12b4768"></a>Kernel Memory</h2></div></div><p>The operating system kernel manages all the memory
requirements for a particular program, or instances of a program
(because operating systems can execute several instances of a
program simultaneously). When a user executes a program, the kernel
allocates an area of memory for the program. This program then
manages the area of memory by splitting it into several
areas:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Text&mdash;where only the read-only parts of the program
are stored. This is usually the actual instruction code of the
program. Several instances of the same program can share this area
of memory.</p></li><li><p>Static Data&mdash;the area where preknown memory is
allocated. This is generally for global variables and static C++
class members. The operating system allocates a copy of this memory
area for each instance of the program.</p></li><li><p>Memory Arena (also known as break space)--the area
where dynamic runtime memory is stored. The memory arena consists
of the heap and unused memory. The heap is where all user-allocated
memory is located. The heap grows up from a lower memory address to
a higher memory address.</p></li><li><p>Stack&mdash;whenever a program makes a function call,
the current function's state needs to be saved onto the stack. The
stack grows down from a higher memory address to a lower memory
address. A unique memory arena and stack exists for each instance
of the program.</p></li></ul></div><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4681f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Memory Associated with an Instance of a Program
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11bc580.0x12b4d40"></a>User Memory</h2></div></div><p>User-allocatable memory is located in the heap in the memory
arena. The memory arena is managed by the routines malloc(),
realloc(), free() and calloc(). They are part of libc. However, it
is possible to substitute these functions with another
implementation that may provide better performance for a particular
use. See sidebar for a list of alternate memory functions.</p><p><a href="4681s1.html" target="_self">Alternate Memory
Functions</a></p><p>On Linux systems, programs expand the size of the memory
arena in precalculated increments, usually one memory page in size
or aligned with a boundary. Once the heap requires more than what
is available in the memory arena, the memory routines call the
brk() system call that requests additional memory from the kernel.
The actual increment size can be set by the sbrk() call.</p><p>To view the current stack and memory arena of any process,
look at the contents of /proc/&lt;pid&gt;/maps for a particular
process, where pid is the process id (see Listing 1).</p><p><a href="4681l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1. Output from
/proc/&lt;pid&gt;/maps</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11bc580.0x12b5058"></a>Structure</h2></div></div><p>Each time new memory is allocated with malloc(), a little
more memory is obtained than requested. The memory routines use
this extra memory for maintenance. To obtain the real amount of
memory allocated for user manipulation, use the function call
malloc_usable_space(). The real memory chunk is usually eight bytes
larger.</p><p>The structure of a memory chunk has the size of the chunk
prepended and added to the end of the chunk (see Figure 2). The
size value also has a bit flag that indicates whether the memory
management system maintains the memory chunk immediately before the
current one.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4681f2.large.jpg"><img src="4681f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. The Memory Chunk Structure
</p></div></div><p>The memory routines in GNU libc use bins to store memory
chunks of similar size to assist in improving performance and
preventing fragmented memory areas, where you have unused memory
gaps throughout the memory arena. These memory routines are also
threadsafe. Though these routines are quick and stable, there may
be areas of possible improvement, such as speed and memory
coverage.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11bc580.0x12b53c8"></a>Debugging</h2></div></div><p>Memory can cause bugs and usually unwanted memory behavior.
One way is by the usage of freed memory, which is the usage of a
memory chunk that the program has already freed. Although this will
not necessarily cause problems immediately, something will go wrong
once a new memory allocation takes over that same area of memory.
As a result, the same memory area is used for two different
purposes, which causes unexpected values that may lead to a program
core dump if the memory area contains pointer values or
offsets.</p><p>Another problem is trampling over the preamble to a memory
chunk. If the program overwrites the preamble to a memory chunk,
the memory management system will possibly fail or act unexpectedly
when encountering the corrupted memory chunk.</p><p>Sometimes trampling occurs over an adjacent memory chunk, and
this might corrupt data. The user might only pick up this kind of
error later during program execution with odd values and program
behavior.</p><p>Similarly, if the management information of a freed memory
chunk is wrecked by trampling or unwarranted use, it is highly
likely that the memory management system will cause an
error.</p><p>Usage of the unallocated space in the memory arena could also
have an effect. It may be possible to use the memory outside of the
heap, which is still within the memory arena. This generally will
not cause errors until newly allocated memory uses some of this
space. This error could be very difficult to detect because the
subsequent memory actions could keep within the heap space.</p><p>The most obvious and immediate error is when a program
attempts to use memory outside of the memory arena and the program
memory scope. This results in a SIGSEGV (segmentation violation
fault), and the program will automatically dump core.</p><p>The most damaging and trickiest-to-debug memory error is when
the stack of the program is corrupted. The program stores local
variables, parameters and registers from previous frames and, most
importantly, the return address in the stack. So if the stack
becomes corrupted, the program may become impossible to debug with
a conventional debugger, as the stack frames themselves are
rendered useless. Debugging stack memory problems is limited to a
few open-source (e.g., libsafe) and proprietary memory debuggers
because program execution needs to be altered or enhanced to detect
stack memory violations.</p><p>There are several ways of attempting to catch and find memory
misuses. Unfortunately, some have side effects, such as slower
program execution speed and more memory usage, and consequently,
they may be unusable in memory-intensive programs.</p><p>The buggy program examples used with the following memory
debuggers can be seen in Listings 2, 3 and 4.</p><p><a href="4681l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2. mytest00.c Example
Program</a></p><p><a href="4681l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3. mytest01.c Example
Program</a></p><p><a href="4681l4.html" target="_self">Listing 4. mytest02.c Example
Program</a></p><p>By default there is an environment variable, MALLOC_CHECK_,
that can be set to enable rudimentary debugging with the default
malloc. MALLOC_CHECK_ can be set to one, in order to provide some
error reporting, or set to two to abort the program whenever any
malloc error occurs. The output can be cryptic because the debug
mode reports problem areas as addresses rather than readable
symbols. As a result, it is a good idea to have a debugger on hand
to determine where in the program these errors are occurring. The
following is an example using default memory debugging:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;home&gt;$ MALLOC_CHECK_=1 ./mytest00
malloc: using debugging hooks
hello Linux users
free(): invalid pointer 0x80496d0
hello again
free(): invalid pointer 0x80496d0
realloc(): invalid pointer 0x80496d0
malloc: top chunk is corrupt
hello there
</pre><p>The output indicates the problem in mytest00.c, line 8
(Listing 2), where the strcpy() function overflows and corrupts the
memory chunk pointed to by msg. The subsequent debugging messages
are because of this corruption.
</p><p>There are several excellent open-source memory tools
available (see sidebar for a list). Each implementation differs in
memory bug coverage, output and interaction.</p><p><a href="4681s2.html" target="_self">Open-Source Memory
Tools</a></p><p>Electric Fence is one tool that is simple to use. The library
performs several memory checks and when encountering an error,
stops the program. This usually results in a core dump, which the
user then can investigate with a debugger. Electric Fence is most
useful when employed within a debugger, such as the GNU debugger
(GDB). When Electric Fence stops the program, GDB regains control
at the exact location in the program where the error occurred (see
Listing 5).</p><p><a href="4681l5.html" target="_self">Listing 5. Memory Debugging with
Electric Fence within GDB</a></p><p>This example output shows the test built with the Electric
Fence library executing under GDB. The very first violation at
mytest00.c line 8 results in a SIGSEGV. When examining the stack
trace provided by GDB, the user can identify the problem
location.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>libsafe</b></span> is used to check a
number of possible stack frame boundary violations limited to a few
C functions (strcpy, strcat, getwd, gets, scanf, vscanf, fscanf,
realpath, sprintf and vsprintf).</p><p>The libsafe example output is terse. As soon as a stack error
occurs, libsafe displays an error and terminates the program.
However, libsafe sends the details of the actual error to various
e-mail recipients. Granted, this is a convoluted way of reporting
the error, but users primarily use libsafe to detect attempted
security breaches that exploit buffer overflow. With a bit of
editing, a developer can enhance the libsafe code to report
messages that are more informative. Another option is to execute
the program in GDB and set a breakpoint on _libsafe_die(), which is
hit as soon as a stack violation is detected by libsafe. In the
following example libsafe detects stack trampling caused by
strcpy() in line 8 of mytest01.c (Listing 3):</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;home&gt;$ LD_PRELOAD=/lib/libsafe.so.1.3  ./mytest01
Detected an attempt to write across stack boundary.
Terminating mytest01.
Null message body; hope that's ok
# Email is the sent with the following subject header
libsafe violation for /tmp/mytest01, pid=27265;
overflow caused by strcpy()
</pre><p><span   class="bold"><b>debauch</b></span> limits its output to
contain addresses instead of symbols, which makes it necessary to
be used with a debugger. <span   class="bold"><b>debauch</b></span>
has special capabilities that users can activate specifically for
GDB use. These capabilities allow better tracking of memory
allocation and deallocation calls.
<span   class="bold"><b>debauch</b></span> is thorough and detects
and recovers from many of the memory errors (see Listing 6).
</p><p><a href="4681l6.html" target="_self">Listing 6. Memory Debugging with
debauch</a></p><p><span   class="bold"><b>memprof</b></span>'s main feature is
the GUI interface, which makes it easy to understand and to see
where memory leaks occur. It has fairly powerful capabilities due
to the fact that it utilizes functions that GDB uses to control
processes via the binary file descriptor (BFD) library. Figure 3
shows that memprof has detected the leak in the function
alloc_two() in mytest02.c.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4681f3.large.jpg"><img src="4681f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 3. Memory Debugging with
memprof</p></div></div>
</p><p>Apart from open-source memory tools, several proprietary
tools are available that provide graphical user interfaces and more
thorough checks than open-source versions (see sidebar for a list
of proprietary memory tools).</p><p><a href="4681s3.html" target="_self">Proprietary Memory
Tools</a></p><p>Possibly, the last option is to write your own memory
handling functions. This might be useful in becoming familiar with
memory management or providing performance enhancement due to your
particular needs, such a quick allocation and deallocation of large
memory areas.</p><p>Debugging memory problems is important, for not only program
stability, but security as well. There are several memory debuggers
available for Linux, each with their own particular set of
capabilities and usage criteria. The best approach is to test a
program with more than one of these memory debuggers with a
debugger such as GDB, as the combined power may detect a wider
range of memory problems.</p></div></div>
