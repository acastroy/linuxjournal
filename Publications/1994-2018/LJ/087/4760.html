resultant message:</p><pre     class="programlisting">

I have been reading about PAM but have not figured it out yet.
Could someone give me assistance to make this command work? I don't
mind if I temporally dummy up my security in /etc/pam.d, but my
last attempt made it impossible to even log in. Ouch!  &mdash;Les
Hilliard, les.hilliard@home.com
</p><p>On the machine where you want to put the tar file, create a
.rhosts file in the home directory, with 0400 permissions. The
.rhosts file should a single line, &ldquo;X.X.X.X user&rdquo;, where X.X.X.X
is the IP address of the machine where the tar command is run and
the user is the user id of the person running the command. Run the
following command on the other machine:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
tar -cvf root@mm:/root/aaa.tar work/
</pre><p>where mm is the remote machine name or IP address
and work is the local directory. Beware that this will also allow
rlogin without a prompt for password.  &mdash;Usman S. Ansari,

machine was recently rebuilt, so the kernel and libraries are very
recent). When I was trying to run it, I got the following error
message:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/usr/local/bin/netscape
/usr/local/bin/netscape: error in loading
  shared libraries:
libstdc++-libc6.1-1.so.2: cannot open shared
  object file: No such file or directory
</pre><p>Checking my libraries confirmed that I didn't have that
particular library installed, but a newer one:
<pre     class="programlisting">
# cd /usr/lib
# ls libstdc++*
libstdc++-3-libc6.1-2-2.10.0.a
libstdc++.a.2.10.0
libstdc++-3-libc6.1-2-2.10.0.so
libstdc++-libc6.1.so
libstdc++-libc6.1-2.a.3
libstdc++-libc6.1-2.so.3
</pre>


I successfully resolved the problem by providing a symbolic link to
the newer library:
<pre     class="programlisting">
# ln -s libstdc++-libc6.1-2.so.3
  libstdc++-libc6.1-1.so.2
</pre>


This solved the problem, and Netscape is running smoothly. However,
this incident left me with a number of questions:
</p><p>What is the meaning of the .2 and .3 at the end of the
filename?</p><p>Is this solution appropriate? I would have liked to create a
shorter link, like libstdc++-libc6.1.so, but that didn't work.
Would it have been more appropriate to actually find libc6.1-1 and
install it next to the existing one?</p><p>My assumption is the Netscape binaries had the library
version hardcoded (I believe this version of Netscape is not
available as source code); is that correct?  &mdash;Michael,
micky@alum.mit.edu</p><p>The reason a library maintainer changes a revision is there
is a significant change in the underlying code or interface. The
maintainer usually feels it would not be wise for a program
dynamically linked with an older version of the library to
automatically work with the newer version. &ldquo;Appropriate&rdquo; is in
the eyes of the beholder. It is possible that the dynamically
linked program you are &ldquo;tricking&rdquo; could disastrously crash,
destroying itself and other things. Most likely, though, it won't.
But, it definitely would be safer to find the actual dynamically
linked library. The Netscape 4.x binaries have some interfaces (to
the dynamically linked library) and versions hard
coded.  &mdash;Christopher Wingert, cwingert@qualcomm.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdf9580.0xef17c0"></a>Mandrake without X</h2></div></div><p>I am currently using Mandrake 7.2 as a server platform. I do
