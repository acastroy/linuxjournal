    Have fun with these development tools, but don't forget to take
    a break from coding and read something.

something you might see on a bookmobile poster, but seriously, read
more. There are so many tools for writing stuff, and so many places
to distribute what we write, that the appeal of writing is getting
dangerous. Meanwhile, reading isn't getting any easier.
</p><p>The first high-level advice every programmer gets is &ldquo;Don't
write what you can reuse.&rdquo; Good, but you need to read in order to
learn what to reuse. Effective code reuse isn't just a matter of
&ldquo;I need SSL, so I'll do a search on +ssl +library.&rdquo;
Congratulations, you found OpenSSL, but how did you know SSL would
help you? Because, not having lived in a cave for the last ten
years, you read about it somewhere. What else&mdash;maybe something not
as famous as SSL&mdash;could you use? If you don't read, you'll never
learn and just end up writing it yourself.</p><p>Brian Behlendorf once wrote, &ldquo;The world needs less
software.&rdquo; That doesn't mean we shouldn't write software if we
have to, just that we shouldn't write it for the wrong reasons. At
first it's more fun to write your own thing than to grovel through
and understand somebody else's, but someday that nifty new thing
will be the stuff you wrote a long time ago and are sick of
maintaining. Learn to reuse and you're learning to make other
people do work for you.</p><p>A contributor to one project's mailing list asked the
question, &ldquo;Should I get in the credits list for a patch that only
removes code?&rdquo; It was a GUI project, and the patch made a dialog
box use some default layout settings instead of a
tightly-controlled but broken layout. Of course you should get in
the credits list for removing code. You made the program better and
smaller at the same time. And you provided an example for others.
Removing code can take more understanding and skill than adding it,
and people who can do it successfully should be at the top of the
credits list.</p><p>Remember XCoffee? It was a great idea&mdash;a special-purpose
server application that just serves up coffee pictures over the Net
and a special-purpose client application that just displayed coffee
pictures. Pretty advanced for its time, but just coffee pictures?
And just one picture per instance of the client? The original
XCoffee got replaced with a web site&mdash;no special client software,
it works on clients without X, and all the hard-to-get-right
network stuff is handled by the web server. If you knew of a
general solution that let you slaughter your offspring, would you
do it?</p><p>Speaking of reading, what's in this issue? Until something
better comes along, if you want to do source code control, or
browse many projects' development code that hasn't been officially
released, you need to know CVS. Ralph Krause gives you the basics
on page PAGE.</p><p>Memory management errors cause everything from the first
segmentation fault in your first C program to security flaws that
destroy entire companies. Improve your memory-fu by reading up on
helpful free tools, some of which are built into the GNU C library.
Petr Sorfa explains memory management and memory troubleshooting on
page PAGE.</p><p>If you're a crusty old UNIX bastard who's been with us since
issue one, you're probably getting set to scoff when we mention
anything having to do with integrated development environments. So
you go scoff over there while I tell these nice people about
KDevelop and Glade.</p><p>On page PAGE Mitch Chapman introduces Glade, a fun tool that
lets you break out GUI design from coding. Point and click to
design the GTK interface, and write the code separately. Best of
all, he's using Python for the examples, which fits nicely into the
exciting new &ldquo;use an object-oriented scripting language for the
stuff that doesn't have to be fast&rdquo; coding philosophy.</p><p>Not to exclude the KDE side of the desktop wars, Petr Sorfa
explains KDevelop on page PAGE in the Product Review section.
Naturally, as a KDE application, it's focused on C++ and Qt, and
for a C++ programmer, to try the Qt GUI toolkit is to love it. Qt
has an aesthetic cleanliness about it that C++ people seem to find
difficult to express in words, but that's okay. KDevelop integrates
with CVS&mdash;very neato&mdash;and with Qt Designer, which as you might
guess is a user-interface design tool for Qt (look for an article
on Qt in our next issue).</p><p>Have fun with these development tools, but don't forget to
take a break from coding and read something.</p><p>&mdash;Don Marti, Technical Editor</p><p><a href="4265s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
