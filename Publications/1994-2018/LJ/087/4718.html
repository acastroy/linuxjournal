    Set up Tripwire to catch intruders big and small.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2966580.0x2a5e450"></a></h2></div></div><p>As impregnable as we hope our hardened
systems are, security isn't a game of absolutes: the potential for
system breaches must be recognized. Tripwire Open Source is a free
and open-source software package that gives us a reasonable chance
of being notified of possible breaches as soon as they occur.
</p><p>Integrity checkers such as Tripwire create cryptographic
&ldquo;fingerprints&rdquo; of system binaries, configuration files and other
things likely to be tampered with in the course of, or subsequent
to, a security breach. They then periodically check those files
against the stored fingerprints and e-mail discrepancies back to
you.</p><p>Tripwire is the most well known and mature integrity-checking
system, and the one we're about to discuss in depth. You may also
be interested in AIDE, which runs on more platforms than Tripwire
Open Source, and FCheck, which is written 100% in Perl and, thus,
even less platform-dependent than AIDE or Tripwire (it even runs on
Windows). See the Resources section at the end of this article for
links to AIDE's and FCheck's web sites.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2966580.0x2a5e608"></a>Whither Integrity Checking?</h2></div></div><p>Integrity checking mechanisms are like system backups; we
hope we'll never need them, but heaven help us if we do and they're
not there. Also, like system backups, integrity checking is an
important component of a larger plan. If a system has been
hardened, patched and maintained according to the industry's
highest standards (or at least common sense), an integrity checker
will provide a final safety net that helps minimize the damage done
by whatever brilliant cracker manages to sneak in.</p><p>The principle on which integrity checkers operate is simple:
if a file changes unexpectedly, there's a good chance it's been
altered by an intruder. For example, one of the first things a
system cracker will often do after &ldquo;rooting&rdquo; a system is replace
common system utilities such as
<span   class="bold"><b>ls</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>ps</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>netstat</b></span> with &ldquo;rootkit&rdquo;, which
makes them appear to work normally but conveniently fail to list
files, processes and connections (respectively) that might betray
the cracker's presence.</p><p>Integrity checkers can be used to create a database of hashes
(checksums) of important system binaries, configuration files or
anything else we don't expect or want to have changed. By
periodically checking those files against the integrity checker's
database, we can minimize the chances of our system being
compromised without ever knowing it. The less time between a
system's compromise and the administrator's learning of it, the
greater the chance administrators can catch, or at least evict, the
intruders.</p><p>One caveat: any integrity-checker with an untrustworty
database is worthless. It is imperative to create this database as
soon as possible after installing the host's operating system from
trusted media. I repeat: installing, configuring and maintaining an
integrity-checker is not worth the effort unless its database was
initialized on a clean system.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2966580.0x2a5e920"></a>Tripwire&mdash;the First and Still Foremost Integrity
Checker</h2></div></div><p>Among the most celebrated and useful things to come out of
Purdue's COAST project
(<a href="http://www.cerias.purdue.edu/coast" target="_self">http://www.cerias.purdue.edu/coast/</a>)
is Tripwire, created by Dr. Eugene Spafford and Gene Kim.
Originally both open source and free, Tripwire went commercial in
1997, and fee-free use was restricted to academic and other
non-commercial settings.</p><p>Happily, last October Tripwire, Inc. released Tripwire Open
Source, Linux Edition. Commercial versions of Tripwire until then
had included features not available in the older Academic Source
Release. In contrast, Tripwire Open Source is a more-or-less
current version of the commercial product. Other than lacking
enterprise features such as centralized management of multiple
systems, it is very similar to the Tripwire for Servers
product.</p><p>Note that Tripwire Open Source is free for use only on
non-commercial Unices, i.e., Linux and Free/Net/OpenBSD. In fact,
it's only officially supported on Red Hat Linux and FreeBSD,
although there's no reason it shouldn't compile and run equally
well on other Linux and BSD distributions. Only the older Academic
Source Release is free for use on commercial Unices such as Sun
Solaris and IBM AIX; the proprietary version must be purchased for
these systems.</p><p>But we're all Linux geeks here, right? For the remainder of
this discussion I'll focus on Tripwire Open Source, Linux
Edition.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2966580.0x2a5eb88"></a>Obtaining, Compiling or Installing
Tripwire</h2></div></div><p>As of this writing, the most current version of Tripwire Open
Source is 2.3.1-2. It can be downloaded as a source-code tarball at
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/tripwire" target="_self">http://sourceforge.net/projects/tripwire/</a>.
I strongly recommend that you obtain, compile and install this
version. While Tripwire has had only one significant security
problem (and only a denial-of-service risk, at that) in its
history, we use Tripwire because we're paranoid. For paranoiacs,
only the latest (stable) version is good enough.</p><p>Having said that, the binary version included with Red Hat
7.0 is reasonably up-to-date. As far as I can tell, the differences
between Red Hat's v2.3-55 RPM and the official source-release
v2.3.1-2 involve non-security-related bugfixes; therefore you're
probably taking no huge risk in using your stock RH 7.0 RPM. But
don't say I told you to!</p><p>To compile Tripwire Open Source, move the archive to /usr/src
and un-tar it, e.g., <b  >tar -xzvf
./tripwire-2.3.1-2.tar.gz</b>. Next, check whether you have a
symbolic link from /usr/bin/gmake to /usr/bin/make (non-Linux
Unices don't all come with GNU
<span   class="bold"><b>make</b></span>, so Tripwire explicitly looks
for <span   class="bold"><b>gmake</b></span>--of course, on most
Linux systems this is simply called make). If you don't have it,
the command to create this link is <b  >ln -s /usr/bin/make
/usr/bin/gmake</b>.</p><p>Another thing to check for is a full set of subdirectories in
/usr/share/man&mdash;Tripwire will need to place man pages in man4, man5
and man8. On my Debian system /usr/man/man4 was missing, and as a
result the installer created a file called /usr/share/man/man4
that, of course, was actually a man page incorrectly copied to that
name rather within it.</p><p>Finally, read the source's README and INSTALL files, change
to the source-tree's src directory (e.g.,
/usr/src/tripwire-2.3.1-2/src), and make any changes you deem
necessary to the variable-definitions in src/Makefile. Be sure to
verify that the appropriate SYSPRE definition is uncommented
(<b  >SYSPRE = i386-pc-linux</b>, <b  >SYSPRE =
sparc-linux</b>, etc.).</p><p>Now we're ready to compile, type <b  >make
release</b>. This will take awhile, so now is a good time to
grab a sandwich. When the build is done, navigate up one directory
level, e.g., /usr/src/tripwire-2.3.1-2, and execute these two
commands:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cp ./install/install.cfg .
cp ./install/install.sh .
</pre><p>Now open install.cfg with your favorite text editor; while
the default paths are probably fine, you should at the very least
examine the Mail Options section. This is where we initially tell
Tripwire how to route its logs. If we set TWMAILMETHOD=SENDMAIL and
specify a value for TWMAILPROGRAM, Tripwire will use the specified
local mailer (<span   class="bold"><b>sendmail</b></span> by default)
to deliver its reports to a local user or group.
</p><p>If instead we set TWMAILMETHOD=SMTP and specify values for
TWSMTPHOST and TWSMTPPORT, Tripwire will mail its reports to an
external e-mail address via the specified SMTP server and port.
Note that if you change your mind later, Mail Options settings can
be changed in Tripwire's configuration file at any time.</p><p>If the system on which you're installing Tripwire is a
multiuser system, and one that you or other system administrators
routinely log on to and read e-mail, the SENDMAIL method is
probably preferable. If the system is a host you typically
administer remotely from other systems, the SMTP method is probably
better.</p><p>Once install.cfg is set to your liking, it's time to install
Tripwire. Simply enter <b  >sh ./install.sh</b>. You will
be prompted for site and local passwords; the site password
protects Tripwire's configuration and policy files, whereas the
local password protects Tripwire databases and reports. This allows
the use of a single policy across multiple hosts in such a way as
to centralize control of Tripwire policies but distribute
responsibility for database management and report
generation.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2966580.0x2a5f370"></a>A Note about RPMs</h2></div></div><p>Needless to say, it's simpler and faster to install RPMs (but
again, note that the most up-to-date version of Tripwire may not be
available in this format). The only thing you need to know is that
after you run <span   class="bold"><b>rpm</b></span>, you'll need to
enter /etc/tripwire/<span   class="bold"><b>twinstall.sh</b></span>
to generate site and local passwords. This script behaves much like
the end of the source distribution's
<span   class="bold"><b>install.sh</b></span> script&mdash;see the
previous paragraph.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2966580.0x2a5f580"></a>Using Tripwire</h2></div></div><p>As useful as Tripwire is, it has a reputation for being
difficult to configure (which is, of course, true of most powerful
and flexible tools). But it's really not as bad as all that, and by
following the simple instructions I'm about to set forth, you can
use Tripwire effectively enough to catch yourself some bad guys. So
now, let's enter the elite ranks of users who have not only
installed, but actually used, Tripwire!</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2966580.0x2a5f688"></a>Managing the Configuration File</h2></div></div><p>The first thing we need to do is double-check our
configuration file, tw.cfg. Actually, this file was just encrypted
by the installation script, but for our convenience a clear-text
copy called twcfg.txt should reside in /etc/tripwire. This is the
place to change any settings you've had second thoughts about since
running the installation script, and the variables are named
accordingly.</p><p>If you make any changes, re-encrypt the configuration file
with the command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
twadmin --create-cfgfile --site-keyfile <span   class="emphasis"><em>./site.key twcfg.txt</em></span>
</pre><p>where site.key is the name of the site-key created at
installation time and twcft.txt is the name of the clear-text
configuration file you just edited and wish to encrypt. That may
seem obvious given that these are the default names for these
files, but you can name them whatever you like. Regardless, don't
forget to specify the keyfile, or
<span   class="bold"><b>twadmin</b></span> will return an error
(remember, the point of this exercise is to encrypt the
configuration file).
</p><p>Warning: you should not, as a matter of practice, leave
clear-text copies of your Tripwire configuration (tw.cfg) or policy
(tw.pol) files on your hard drive. After editing and encrypting
them, delete the clear-text versions. You can always retrieve them
later with the command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
twadmin --print-cfgfile &gt; <span   class="emphasis"><em>mycfg.txt</em></span>
</pre><p>where, predictably, you can substitute mycfg.txt with
whatever you like.
</p><p>Although I haven't yet described Tripwire binaries in any
detail (it's more useful to explain them in context), you've no
doubt guessed by now that twadmin is used to manage Tripwire's
configuration, key and (initially, at least) policy files.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2966580.0x2a5fb00"></a>Managing the Policy File</h2></div></div><p>Like the Tripwire configuration file, policies are edited as
text files but are encrypted and signed before being installed.
Unlike the configuration file, however, we only use the twadmin
command to install a policy file for the first time on a given
system; subsequently we'll use the
<span   class="bold"><b>tripwire</b></span> command in policy-update
mode.</p><p>In any event, the command to install a policy the first time
after installing Tripwire is:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
twadmin --create-polfile <span   class="emphasis"><em>twpol.txt</em></span>
</pre><p>where twpol.txt is the name of the clear-text policy file you
wish to install.
</p><p>As with configuration files, you shouldn't leave clear-text
policy files on your system. If you need to refer to or edit the
policy later, you can retrieve it by typing:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
twadmin --print-polfile &gt; <span   class="emphasis"><em>mypol.txt</em></span>
</pre><p>mypol.txt can be whatever you wish to call the clear-text
copy of the policy. (See a pattern here?)
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2966580.0x2e58170"></a>Editing or Creating a Policy</h2></div></div><p>And now we begin the serious voodoo. Tripwire's policy file
is its brain: it specifies what to look at, what to look for and
what to do about it. It's also a little on the user-hostile side,
though not nearly so bad in this regard as, say, sendmail.cf (but
prepare to memorize some abbreviations).</p><p>Naturally Tripwire Open Source comes with a default policy
file, and naturally you may, if you like, use this as your very own
personal Tripwire policy. But since the default policy was created
for a Red Hat system running nearly everything in the distribution,
you should probably edit this policy heavily rather than use it as
is.</p><p>First, a word about tuning. If your policy doesn't check
enough files or doesn't look closely enough at the ones it does
check, Tripwire's purpose is defeated and shenanigans will go
undetected. Conversely, if the policy looks too critically at files
you expect to change anyhow, Tripwire will generate &ldquo;false
positives&rdquo; that serve no purpose other than to distract your
attention from actual discrepancies.</p><p>It's doubtful you'll create a sane baseline the first time
around. You'll almost certainly need to adjust your policy on an
ongoing basis and especially after the first time you run an
integrity-check. Thus, even if you do have a Red Hat system with
exactly the same configuration as the one for which the default
Tripwire Open Source policy was designed, you still need to learn
proper Tripwire policy syntax. Let's get cracking.</p><p>I'm going to explain policy file structure and syntax by
dissecting a working policy file into manageable chunks. The first
chunk we'll look at is from the very beginning of our sample policy
file and lists some variable definitions:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
WEBROOT=/home/mick/www;
CGIBINS=/home/mick/www/cgi-bin;
TWPOL="/etc/tripwire";
TWDB="/var/lib/tripwire";
</pre><p>We can use these variables to save valuable touch-typing
energy. On to the next chunk, some fancier variable definitions:
<pre     class="programlisting">
BINS          = $(ReadOnly) ; # Binaries that should
                                not change
SEC_INVARIANT = +tpug ;       # Dir.s that shouldn't
                                change perms/ownership
SIG_MED       = 66 ;          # Important but not
                                system-critical files
</pre>


Unlike the first set of variable definitions that involved simple
path-shortcuts, these are a bit fancier. The first line shows us
how to set one variable to the value of another&mdash;similar to bash
shell syntax, but note the parentheses around the second variable's
name.
</p><p>The second line defines a &ldquo;property mask&rdquo;; property masks
are abbreviations of the file properties Tripwire examines. Since
property mask strings can be cryptic and unwieldy, most people
prefer to use variables to refer to them. In fact, Tripwire comes
with a number of predeclared variables set to common property
masks, and the first line actually refers to one of these,
ReadOnly, a property mask for files that shouldn't change in any
way, like binaries. We'll discuss property masks in detail, but all
in good time.</p><p>The third line creates a name for a severity level. Severity
levels can be used to differentiate between rules of varying
importance. When the tripwire command is invoked with the
--severity N parameter, only rules with assigned severity levels
equal to or greater than N will be parsed. If this parameter is not
used, all rules will be parsed. Also note that if a rule has no
severity level associated with it, the level will be set to zero by
default. That is, that rule will only be parsed when the --severity
parameter isn't specified.</p><p>Now that we've got a feel for policy variables and what
they're used for, let's start looking at actual rules:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# Mick's Web Junk
(
  rulename = "MickWeb",
  severity = $(SIG_MED),
  emailto = mick@uselesswebjunk.com
)
{
  $(WEBROOT)             -&gt; $(ReadOnly) (recurse=1) ;
  !$(WEBROOT)/guestbook.html ;
  $(CGIBINS)             -&gt; $(BINS)     ;
  /var/log/httpd         -&gt; $(Growing)  ;
}
</pre><p>This is a very rich chunk, so we'll begin with rule
structure. Rules may either stand alone or be grouped together
based on common attributes; this listing shows a group of rules
(contained within curly brackets) with several shared attributes
(in parentheses, above the rules). This group's rulename is
&ldquo;MickWeb&rdquo;, the group's severity is 66 and reports involving this
group will be e-mailed to mick@uselesswebjunk.com. Note that
attributes are separated by commas, whereas each rule ends with a
semicolon.
</p><p>Attributes can also be assigned to individual rules. The
first rule in this group has the attribute recurse set to 1, which
means that the directory /home/mick/www will be checked down one
level (i.e., the directory itself plus everything immediately
&ldquo;below&rdquo;, but no further). Note that by default, directories will
be recursed as far down as they go; in effect, the recurse
attribute has a default value of &ldquo;True&rdquo;.</p><p>Attributes listed in rule statements usually override those
listed in parentheses above such rules' group. The exception is the
attribute &ldquo;emailto&rdquo;, which is cumulative: if a group has a shared
emailto string and one of that group's rules has a different
emailto string, reports relevant to that rule will be e-mailed to
all e-mail addresses in those two strings.</p><p>By the way, there are only four attributes: rulename,
severity, emailto and recurse. For more detailed information on
these see the Resources section.</p><p>After the group attributes for MickWeb we have some actual
rules. Note the use of variables to specify both objects (the
Tripwire term for files and directories) and property masks. In
fact, none of the rules uses a &ldquo;longhand&rdquo; property mask. This is
common practice and perfectly acceptable.</p><p>Immediately below the first rule, which tells Tripwire to
treat the first level of my WWW directory as read-only, we have a
statement beginning with an exclamation point. This statement is
called a stop point, and it defines an exception to a rule. In this
case, the stop point tells Tripwire to ignore changes to the file
/home/mick/www/guestbook.html. Attributes do not apply to (nor may
they be assigned to) stop points.</p><p>There, that's a complete policy file (technically, at
least&mdash;it doesn't check any system binaries or configuration files
at all&mdash;real policies are much longer). Listing 1 shows it in all
its non-dissected glory.</p><p><a href="4718l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1. Sample Policy
File</a></p><p>You may have noticed this entire file only contains one
explicit reference to a property mask: the variable declaration in
which SEC_INVARIANT is set to &ldquo;+tpug&rdquo;. What does that
mean?</p><p>A property mask is a series of file/directory properties that
should be checked or ignored for a given object. Properties
following a plus sign are checked; those following a minus sign are
ignored. The properties are abbreviated as outlined in Table
1.</p><p><a href="4718t1.html" target="_self">Table 1. Property Mask
Values</a></p><p>Tripwire's own documentation describes these properties in
depth. If you're unfamiliar with some of the more arcane file
attributes (e.g., inode reference count) I recommend the paper
&ldquo;Design and Implementation of the Second Extended Filesystem&rdquo; by
Card, Ts'o and Tweedie (see Resources, below). As for hash-types,
note that you generally won't want to use more than one or two
cryptographic hashes per rule: these are CPU-intensive. On the
other hand, do not rely solely on CRC-32 hashes, which are fast but
much easier to subvert.</p><p>As I mentioned earlier, Tripwire has a number of predefined
(hard coded) variables that describe property masks, shown in Table
2.</p><p><a href="4718t2.html" target="_self">Table 2. Predefined Tripwire
Property Mask Variables</a></p><p>In most cases it's simpler to use these predefined masks than
to &ldquo;roll your own&rdquo;. Note, however, that you can combine these
variables with additional properties, e.g.,</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/dev/console  -&gt; $(Dynamic) -u ;
# Dynamic, but UID can change
</pre><p>is the same thing as
<pre     class="programlisting">
/dev/console  -&gt; +pingutd-srlbamcCMSH-u
</pre>


After you've created what seems like a reasonable policy, you need
to install it. Again, the command to install a system's first
Tripwire policy is:
<pre     class="programlisting">
twadmin --create-polfile <span   class="emphasis"><em>policyfile.txt</em></span>
</pre>


The last step in setting up Tripwire is to create (initialize) its
database. Important: there's no point in initializing a Tripwire
database on a system that's been up and, therefore, has possibly
been compromised already! Tripwire installation, configuration and
initialization should occur as soon after OS installation as
possible.
</p><p>To initialize the database, we now use the tripwire command:
<b  >tripwire --init</b>. Doesn't get much simpler than
that, does it? But use the --init directive only when creating a
new database. If you need to change your Tripwire policy later,
it's better to use the following commands:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
twadmin --print-polfile &gt; mypolicy.txt
  # dump current installed plcy
vi mypolicy.txt
  # make changes to policy
tripwire --update-policy mypolicy.txt
  # install new policy --
  # DON'T USE TWADMIN FOR THIS!
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2966580.0x2e58f30"></a>Running Checks with Tripwire</h2></div></div><p>Once we've got a database installed, we can run periodic
checks against it. At its simplest, the command to do so is:
<b  >tripwire --check</b>. This compares all protected
files against the hash-database and prints a report both to the
screen and a binary file. The report can be viewed again with the
command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
twprint --print-report --report-level <span   class="emphasis"><em>N</em></span> --twrfile <span   class="emphasis"><em>/path/file</em></span>
</pre><p>where N is a number from 0 to 4, 0 being a one-line summary
and 4 being a full report with full details. /path/file is the full
path and name of the latest report (by default it should reside in
/var/lib/tripwire/report).
</p><p>To have Tripwire automatically e-mail the report to all
recipients specified in the policy, we could have run our check
like this instead:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
tripwire --check --email-report
</pre><p>Note that the report is still printed to standard output and
saved in /var/lib/tripwire/report as well.
</p><p>If you've installed the Tripwire RPM on a Red Hat 7 system,
your system is already set up to run Tripwire periodically in check
mode. The RPM includes the script
/etc/cron.daily/<span   class="bold"><b>tripwire-check</b></span>. If
you've used the emailto attribute in your Tripwire policy, however,
you may wish to edit the second-to-last line of this script to
read:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
test -f /etc/tripwire/tw.cfg &amp;&amp; /usr/sbin/tripwire --check --email-report
</pre><p>(This line by default lacks the --email-report flag.)
</p><p>Tripwire won't tell you much unless you run regular checks,
either manually, via cron/anacron or some combination
thereof.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2966580.0x2e594b0"></a>There Were Violations! Now What?</h2></div></div><p>So, what happens when Tripwire reports violations? That's up
to you. Often, violations will be the result of a too-restrictive
Tripwire policy rather than actual skullduggery. You'll need to
decide which are which and what to do about them.</p><p>Either way, you'll probably want to update the Tripwire
database after violations are found so that it reflects any
legitimate changes to the files and directories being monitored.
There are two ways to do this. The first is to run the tripwire
command in update mode:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
tripwire --update --twrfile /var/lib/tripwire/report/myhost-date.twr
</pre><p>The last argument is the absolute path to the report you wish
to use as the basis for this update. This opens the report with the
editor specified in tw.cfg so you can indicate which, if any, of
the changed files/directories you wish Tripwire not to update in
its database. In other words, when you exit the editing session,
Tripwire will update the attributes and hashes in its database only
for those report entries with an X next to them (they all are by
default).
</p><p>Here's an excerpt from a tripwire-update session:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Remove the "x" from the adjacent box to prevent
updating the database with the new values for this
object.
Modified:
[x] "/home/mick/www"
</pre><p>If I delete the &ldquo;x&rdquo; from this entry, exit the editor and
run a check, the /home/mick/www change will be reported again; the
database will not have updated to reflect this change. In short, if
the change is legitimate, leave the &ldquo;x&rdquo; there. If it isn't or
you're not sure, remove the &ldquo;x&rdquo;.
</p><p>The second way to update the Tripwire database is to do the
actual check in &ldquo;interactive&rdquo; mode, which immediately triggers an
update session after the check finishes. Thus,</p><pre     class="programlisting">
tripwire --check --interactive
</pre><p>is the same thing as
<pre     class="programlisting">
tripwire --check
tripwire --twrfile /var/lib/tripwire/report/reportname.twr
</pre>


but with the added advantage of saving you the trouble of looking
up the report's filename (since it includes a timestamp, this isn't
easily guessed).
</p><p>When you get false positives, it will often make sense to
fine-tune your policy. Remember to do this in the manner described
at the end of the Editing or Creating a Policy section
above.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2966580.0x2e59980"></a>Now Go Forth and Trip Yourself Some
Crackers!</h2></div></div><p>Before we sign off for this month, I leave you with two
excellent tips I learned from Ron Forrester, Project Manager for
Tripwire Open Source:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Always set MAILNOVIOLATIONS=TRUE [in tw.cfg] so you
get a heartbeat from tripwire, i.e., if your cron job runs Tripwire
once an hour, and you don't get a report for more than an hour, you
know something is up.</p></li><li><p>Always leave a violation or two (say
/etc/sendmail.st) in&mdash;this makes it more difficult for an intruder
to forge a report. It is quite easy to forge a report with no
violations, but add a known violation or two, and it gets much more
difficult.</p></li></ol></div><p>I hope that's enough to get you started; there's much I
haven't covered here or have only touched on. Believe you me, this
tool's power is worth its learning curve, and the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Tripwire Open Source Manual</em></span> (see below) is
both comprehensive and extremely well-written. Good luck!
