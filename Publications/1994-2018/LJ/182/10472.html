Wolfram Research's gridMathematica</h2></div></div><p>
Wolfram Research's new gridMathematica 7 enables users to utilize the
built-in parallelization capabilities of its Mathematica application and,
thus, run more tasks in parallel on more powerful hardware and clusters.
gridMathematica adds extra computation kernels and automated network
distribution tools, allowing users to achieve faster execution &ldquo;without
changing a line of code&rdquo;, says Wolfram. Three different products are
part of the series: gridMathematica Local, gridMathematica Server
and Wolfram Lightweight Grid Manager. gridMathematica requires
Mathematica and is available for Linux, Mac OS X and Windows.

John Lamb's <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Greening of IT</em></span> (IBM Press)</h2></div></div><p>
More so than nearly all its rivals, IBM has made &ldquo;going green&rdquo; a core
mission. Not only has IBM rolled out its &ldquo;Big Green&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Big Green
Linux&rdquo; initiatives, but it also has now published one of the few books
on green IT, called <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Greening of IT: How Companies Can Make a
Difference for the Environment</em></span>. In the book, IBM senior staffer, John
Lamb, tackles both macro and micro issues surrounding the reduction of
the environmental impact caused by IT operations. At the macro scale,
Lamb looks at the role of governments and electrical utilities and the
importance of good regulations and incentives. At the micro level, Lamb
examines the nuts and bolts of reducing energy consumption in the data
center, covering organizational issues, ROI, procurement, asset disposal,
measurement of energy consumption, virtualization, cooling equipment and
much more. Finally, the author explores case studies of all types and
sizes worldwide, including IBM's own $1 billion Big Green initiative.

Super Talent's UltraDrive Family of Solid-State Drives</h2></div></div><p>
The crew at Super Talent has been busy preparing not one but two new
families of solid-state drives (SSDs), the UltraDrive ME and UltraDrive LE. The company calls the lines &ldquo;next-generation SSDs&rdquo; that offer
&ldquo;noticeable performance gains at boot time, application loading and
accessing data&rdquo;. Although both lines offer 32GB, 64GB and 128GB variants,
the UltraDrive ME line offers an additional 256GB model. The UltraDrive
LE is rated for a maximum sequential read speed of 230MB/s, while the
UltraDrive ME comes in at 200MB/s. Regarding maximum sequential write
speed, the UltraDrive LE clocks 170MB/s, and the UltraDrive ME at 160MB/s.
Super Talent says that the drives are designed to be &ldquo;compatible with
all known operating systems&rdquo;, including Linux, DOS and Windows.

ScaleMP's vSMP Foundation</h2></div></div><p>
Making the area of virtualization even more interesting is ScaleMP's
updated Versatile SMP (vSMP) Foundation 2.0 virtualization solution.
vSMP Foundation aggregates multiple industry-standard off-the-shelf x86
servers (rackmounted or blade systems) into one single virtual high-end
system for the HPC market. This new release of vSMP, says ScaleMP, offers
&ldquo;significantly enhanced performance&rdquo; through support for the forthcoming
Intel Nehalem processor family, as well as enhanced enterprise-class
features, such as increased high-availability, partitioning of a single
virtual system into multiple isolated environments, extended remote
management, enhanced profiling capabilities and support for Emulex
LightPulse Fibre Channel HBAs.

Compiere Cloud Edition ERP</h2></div></div><p>
Compiere ERP&mdash;a comprehensive open-source application that automates
business processes, such as accounting, purchasing, order fulfillment,
manufacturing, warehousing and CRM&mdash;is now available on the Amazon
Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2). The new Compiere Cloud Edition is
delivered with a complete technology stack&mdash;that is, an operating system,
application server and database that can be deployed on Amazon EC2
&ldquo;in a matter of minutes&rdquo;. Compiere says that the &ldquo;convenient virtual
computing environment&rdquo; reduces the cost of ERP deployment by eliminating
up-front capital costs for hardware and software and reducing ongoing IT
infrastructure support costs. The company also notes the advantages of
cloud computing, which allows IT departments to increase capacity
or add capabilities &ldquo;on the fly&rdquo; without investing in new hardware,
personnel or software by accessing virtual servers available over the
Internet to handle computing needs. A range of subscriptions include
application support, service packs and access to Compiere automated
upgrade tools.

Justin Seitz's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Gray Hat Python</em></span> (No Starch Press)</h2></div></div><p>
Publisher No Starch Press touts Justin Seitz's new book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Gray Hat
Python</em></span>
as &ldquo;the first Python book written for security analysts&rdquo;. Subtitled
&ldquo;Python Programming for Hackers and Reverse Engineers&rdquo;, the book explains
the intricacies of using Python to assist in security analysis tasks,
teaching readers how to design debuggers, create powerful fuzzers,
utilize open-source libraries to automate tedious tasks, interface
with security tools and more. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Gray Hat Python</em></span>, says No Starch, covers
everything from the nuts and bolts of how to use the language for basic
code and DLL injection to using Python to analyze binaries and disassemble
software. More than anything, however, the book reveals how superior
the Python language is when it comes to hacking, reverse engineering,
malware analysis and software testing.
