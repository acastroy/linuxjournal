RightWebPage&mdash;Web Conformance Tool (<a href="http://rightwebpage.org" target="_self">rightwebpage.org</a>)</h2></div></div><p>
For people designing their own Web pages, editing someone else's or
simply learning how to make their own, RightWebPage is an invaluable
tool that puts Web pages through the most stringent of tests. Not only
does it follow strict W3C standards, it also supports Linux, Mac OS
and Windows. According to the Web site:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
RightWebPage verifies and corrects many aspects of conformance of Web
sites to standards of Internet best practices, such as W3C WCAG and ISO/IEC
23026:2006 - Software Engineering - Recommended Practice for the Internet
- Web Site Engineering, Web Site Management and Web Site Life Cycle.
</p></blockquote></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10450f1.large.jpg"><img src="10450f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
RightWebPage&mdash;the Web Conformance Checker that Turns Pedantry into an Art
Form
</p></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Installation</b></span>
</p><p>
Head to the Web site's download section, and under GNU/Linux, there are
the options of RPM and deb packages in both 32- and 64-bit flavors,
as well as the obligatory tarball. I went with the deb package and
ran into some dependencies. Once I installed the packages tidy and
opensp though, things were fine. I'm ashamed to say that I couldn't work
out how to compile the source package though; if you're looking for a
<tt  >./configure</tt>, <tt  >make</tt>,
<tt  >make install</tt>, it's not here. However, that is how it
was at the
time of this writing, and in the space of a month (the last time I looked),
things have changed a great deal, so it may have improved by the time
you read this.
</p><p>
Once you have RightWebPage installed, you can run it with the command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ rightwebpage
</pre>
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Usage</b></span>
</p><p>
As soon as the program starts, you're presented with an introductory
splash screen that takes you through a series of prompts having to do with
needed information and parameters to check before you get started. First
up is the Web page URL (local or Internet). Next is Conformance Tests to
run, Document Type, Excessive Scrolling, Accessibility, User Agent
Emulation, Character Encoding...at this point, I got bored and
clicked Finish. If you choose a Web page to load, for a while no
information
appears on the screen. Give it a few moments,
and eventually everything appears. Oh, and a word of warning, this
process can be very CPU- and RAM-intensive.
</p><p>
Once your Web page has loaded, your data is split into four panels.
The first covers the filename(s) of what you're looking at. Next are
all the faults it has found (and there probably will be a lot of them),
which are broken down into categories and can be browsed at will. The
bottom panel contains the actual coding of the page you've loaded, which
also can be edited and saved and is quite helpfully color-coded. And,
the pi&egrave;ce de r&eacute;sistance, on the left is a preview panel of your Web page
fully rendered. Any changes you make can be saved, and you can revalidate
the Web page at any time.
</p><p>
Now I must warn you, your ego is in for a bruising. RightWebPage is beyond
anal in its stringency. I haven't written any Web sites for a number
of years, but when I have, I prided myself on strict adherence to Web
standards. Well, to my embarrassment, RightWebPage found 80 warnings and
42 alerts in a page that I thought would fare well! So, if you're looking
for 
a strict teacher, this is it. All in all, this is a brilliant piece of software
that will keep you on the straight and narrow in Web design, as long as
you're willing to submit to something that is
<span   class="emphasis"><em>seriously</em></span> pedantic.

Gourmet Recipe Manager (<a href="http://grecipe-manager.sourceforge.net" target="_self">grecipe-manager.sourceforge.net</a>)</h2></div></div><p>
If you're chasing recipes from around the world and want a neat program
with clever features to catalogue them all, Gourmet Recipe Manager (or
Gourmet for short) is definitely your tool. According to its Freshmeat
entry:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Gourmet Recipe Manager is a simple but powerful recipe-managing
application. Gourmet is intended for the GNOME desktop environment,
but works on any platform that GTK supports, including Windows.
</p><p>
Gourmet allows you to collect, search and organise your recipes, and to
generate shopping lists automatically from your collection. The latest
version also lets you calculate nutritional information for your
recipes using the USDA food database (or entering custom information
by hand).
</p></blockquote></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10450f2.large.jpg"><img src="10450f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
By using openly available formats that are in use all around the world,
tens of thousands of recipes are awaiting your download.
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10450f3.large.jpg"><img src="10450f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
As well as being able to change the number of ingredients dynamically by
altering the serving size, there are links to timing mechanisms all through
the recipes.
</p></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Installation</b></span>
</p><p>
Binaries are included for Debian- and RPM-based systems, as well as a
source code tarball. The Web site states the following dependencies:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Python 2.3 (2.4 is recommended).
</p></li><li><p>
PyGTK &gt; 2.3.9 and PyGnome. Note: with PyGTK &gt; 2.5, PyGnome bindings have
been split up. To print, you'll need, for example, the python-gnome2-extras package
as well as the the python-gnome2 package.
</p></li><li><p>
libglade.
</p></li><li><p>
SQLite and Python SQLite2 bindings.
</p></li><li><p>
distutils (to install), provided by the python-dev package.
</p></li><li><p>
Python Imaging Libraries (PIL).
</p></li></ol></div><p>
You'll also need the PyRTF library and the Gnomeprint bindings, but these
are non-essential. I went with the Debian package and found I needed
to install python-sqlalchemy to get the package running on my Ubuntu
system. If you go with the source version, download the tarball, extract
it, and open a terminal in the new folder.
</p><p>
As root or sudo, enter the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# python setup.py install
</pre>
</p><p>
Once that's out of the way, you now can run the program by looking in
your system's menu (it was in Applications&rarr;Utilities&rarr;Gourmet
Recipe Manager under KDE 4), or by entering the command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ gourmet
</pre>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Usage</b></span>
</p><p>
Before you can start looking at recipes, you need to download some
first. I had to search for a file and then import it before I could
use anything. I did a search for &ldquo;mastercook&rdquo; recipe files (Gourmet also
supports Meal-Master recipes, but I found the Mastercook recipes easier
to deal with), and found a Web page full of Mastercook recipes zipped
up. After downloading the zip and extracting it, I imported the *.mxp
file by clicking File&rarr;Import file.
</p><p>
Once you have imported a file successfully, there will be a new list of
recipes, and you can double-click on any recipe to view it. As well as a
recipe name, Gourmet helpfully includes food categories, the author of the
recipe, and some even carry a star rating. Once you have opened a recipe,
the instructions are presented neatly for you on the bottom left,
with the ingredients (and quantity thereof) listed on the right.
</p><p>
Cool features I found include a unit converter, the ability to generate a
printable shopping list based on the recipe's ingredients, as well as a
built-in timer. On the subject of timing, within each part of the recipe
that involves performing a task over a period of time, there's usually
a link to a timer that will be preset to however long you need to cook
and so on. On each of these timers is a start, pause and reset button,
allowing you to get the task timed and underway as you like.
</p><p>
There's also a seriously cool function called Servings, which changes
the quantities of the recipe's ingredients when you're
serving more or fewer people than the recipe's default. Simply change the
number of servings from the default number, and the ingredients list 
updates dynamically to tell you how much you need of each ingredient
for the new number of servings.
</p><p>
Gourmet Recipe Manager is a great tool that is well thought out,
and hopefully, it will find an audience among home enthusiasts and gourmet
chefs alike. Given that it runs on any platform that supports GTK
(especially Windows), hopefully its appeal and usage will extend far
beyond just the Linux platform to home PCs everywhere. With the added
bonus that there are tens of thousands of possibly supported recipes
from all over the world, food in some homes and restaurants may just
become a little more exotic.

gWaei&mdash;Japanese-English Dictionary (<a href="http://gwaei.sourceforge.net" target="_self">gwaei.sourceforge.net</a>)</h2></div></div><p>
Students of Japanese have had a number of tools available for Linux
for sometime, but here's a project that updates the situation and
brings several elements together from other projects to form one sleek
application. In the words of the gWaei Web site:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
gWaei is a Japanese-English dictionary program for the GNOME desktop. It
is made to be a modern drop-in replacement for Gjiten with many of the
same features. The dictionary files it uses are from Jim Breen's WWWJDIC
Project and are installed separately through the program.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
It features the following:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Easy dictionary installation with a click of a button.
</p></li><li><p>
Support for searching using regular expressions.
</p></li><li><p>
Streams results so the interface is never frozen.
</p></li><li><p>
Click Kanji in the results pane to look at information on it.
</p></li><li><p>
Simple interface that makes sense.
</p></li><li><p>
Intelligent design and Tab switches dictionaries.
</p></li><li><p>
Organizes relevant matches to the top of the results.
</p></li></ul></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10450f4.large.jpg"><img src="10450f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
gWaei is a quick and easy-to-use Japanese dictionary that updates
some old Linux favorites.
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10450f5.large.jpg"><img src="10450f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
The coolest feature in gWaei is this kanji pad, where you can draw kanji
with your mouse, and the computer dynamically alters the selection based
on your strokes.
</p></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Installation</b></span>
</p><p>
If you head to the Web site's download section, there are gWaei packages
available in deb, RPM and source tarball format. For me, the deb installed
with no problems, so I ran with that. When running with the source
version, I couldn't find all of the dependencies, but the Web site says
you need the following packages, along with their -dev counterparts:
gtk+-2.0, gconf-2.0, libcurl, libgnome-2.0 and libsexy.
</p><p>
The documentation also says that compiling the source is the standard fare of:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install
</pre>
</p><p>
After installation, I found gWaei in my menu under
Applications&rarr;Utilities&rarr;gWaei Japanese-English Dictionary. If you can't find gWaei
in your menu, enter the command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ gwaei
</pre>
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Usage</b></span>
</p><p>
Once gWaei starts, the first thing you see is a Settings
window that's broken into three tabs: Status, Install Dictionaries
and Advanced. Status tells you how things are currently set up, and
to start off with, all you'll see is Disabled. Click the Install
Dictionaries tab, and you'll see that there are buttons already set up to
install new dictionaries, called Add, for English, Kanji, Names and
Radicals. Once these are all installed, each of them will be changed to
Enabled back in the Status tab.
</p><p>
After these are installed, click Close, and you are in the program. The
first place you should go is the search bar. Enter something in
English or in Romaji (Japanese with the Latin alphabet we use), and
meanings and translations appear in the large field below with a
probable mix of kanji and kana, and an English translation. You 
also can enter searches in kana and kanji, but my brother has my Japanese
keyboard, so I couldn't really try it out.
</p><p>
For a really cool feature, click Insert&rarr;Using Kanjipad, and a blank
page comes up where you can draw kanji characters by hand with your
mouse. Various kanji characters then appear on the right and update,
depending on how many strokes you make and their shape. If you
click Insert&rarr;Using Radical Search Tool, you can search for radicals
on basic kanji characters, which also can be restricted by the number
of strokes.
</p><p>
All in all, gWaei is a great program with elegant simplicity,
and it has the features you need, whether you're in Japan or the West
(or anywhere else that's not Japan for that matter). If you're a Japanese
student, this should be standard issue in your arsenal.
