Use bash to calculate game outcomes and help you win at <span   class="emphasis"><em>Deal or
No Deal</em></span>.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x223c580.0x23343b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
I admit it, my kids and I often find ourselves at the local arcade playing
video games. There seems to be two basic types of arcades nowadays: those
where you play to earn free games and get the high score, and those that
are ticket-based where doing well on a game produces tickets that you cash
in
for cheesy tchotchkes or incredibly cheap stuffed animals.
</p><p>
We tend to go to the latter, and one of the games that's caught my
attention is a video version of the popular TV show <span   class="emphasis"><em>Deal or No
Deal</em></span>. It got
me thinking about odds and probability and how these games actually
work.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x223c580.0x2334618"></a>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Deal or No Deal</em></span>, the Game</h2></div></div><p>
The game is incredibly simple: you're told that there is a range of
prizes hidden in briefcases, and you choose which to eliminate and win
what's left in the last briefcase. It's not too exciting, except as you go
along, you're offered the opportunity to take a specific cash prize
instead of continuing the game.
</p><p>
On the TV show, there are 26 cases, and the prizes range from $0.01 to
$1,000,000.00 in uneven jumps. Attractive models hold each case, and the
game typically proceeds where the player guesses a bunch of cases to
eliminate, in clusters. If the eliminated cases have low-value prizes,
that's good&mdash;there is, therefore, a better chance of winning big
bucks. If they have high-value prizes inside, well, that's not good.
</p><p>
After each set of cases is eliminated, the house offers the player a
&ldquo;deal&rdquo; to stop playing the game&mdash;a payoff that's worth more
than the lowest unidentified prize but obviously lower than the highest
unidentified prize.
</p><p>
The prizes are 0.01, 1, 5, 10, 25, 50, 75, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500 and 750,
and then the big values: 1,000, 5,000, 10,000, 25,000, 50,000, 75,000,
100,000, 200,000, 300,000, 400,000, 500,000, 750,000 and 1,000,000.
</p><p>
Calculating the average payout, assuming you have an equal chance of
picking each of the cases at the beginning of the game, is easy: add
them up and divide by 26. The result is 131,477.54. If they offered me $130k
instead of playing the game? Even though it's a bit lower than the
average expected payout, I'd take it. Deal!
</p><p>
Let's say we're most of the way through the game though, and 20 of
the possible prizes are knocked out. What's left are 0.01, 50, 300,
1,000 and 250,000. Your chance of picking the 250,000 prize case? One in
five.
</p><p>
The expected payout is $50,270, and if that's what you're offered,
it's significantly better than four of the five possible outcomes you
face. My advice? Deal!
</p><p>
It turns out that there's some sort of random factor that's thrown in
to the &ldquo;deal&rdquo;, so in the game itself, they vary up or down a
percentile value.

Algorithms and Coding</h2></div></div><p>
To experiment with this as a shell script (yeah, it only took me half the
column to get to my first line of code), we need to work with arrays&mdash;something that's frankly a bit confusing. Here's how we could
define the 26 briefcases:


<pre     class="programlisting">
declare -a cases=(0.01 1 5 10 25 50 75 100 200 300 400 500 750
1000 5000 10000 25000 50000 75000 100000 200000 300000 400000
500000 750000 1000000)
</pre>
</p><p>
This might be the first time you've seen the
declare statement in the shell.
In this case, the -a flag declares the variable as being an array.
Its usage, however, is not mandatory&mdash;arrays can be implicitly declared
simply by using the array assignment syntax (a list of values inside
parentheses).
</p><p>
You reference individual array elements with $var[index], but there's a
twist because of how the shell parses content. What you need to do is
actually wrap it with curly braces: ${var[index]}. Add a #, and
you get the number of elements in the array, like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
echo Total number of array elements is ${#cases[*]}
</pre>
</p><p>
The value that'll be printed is 26, just what we want for <span   class="emphasis"><em>Deal or No
Deal</em></span>. To see value #11, you could use
<tt  >${cases[11]}</tt>, but that's wrong.
Why? Because shell arrays are indexed starting at zero, so case #11 is
actually ${cases[10]}, which, yeah, is pretty confusing.
</p><p>
Let's start by writing the snippet that can calculate expected payout
before you have picked a single briefcase out of the collection:

<pre     class="programlisting">

for (( val=0 ; $val &lt; ${#cases[*]} ; val+=1 )) ; do

    sum=$(( $sum+${cases[$val]} ))

done

echo sum = $sum, payout = $(( $sum / ${#cases[*]} ))

</pre>
</p><p>
The bad news? It turns out that the 0.01 value really messes things up,
as we can't do integer math with a non-integer value. So, because the
0.01 value actually proves not to influence things much, I'm going
to replace it with the value 0. Here's the output:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sum = 3418416, payout = 131477
</pre>
</p><p>
That's reasonably accurate. Our earlier calculation was 131,477.54.
Close enough for gaming work!
</p><p>
Now, let's randomly pick out 22 of the cases, calculate the expected
payout and offer a &ldquo;deal&rdquo; versus the values still remaining.
</p><p>
First, pick out some cases:

<pre     class="programlisting">

for (( picked=1 ; $picked &lt;= 22 ; )) ; do

  pick=$(( RANDOM % 26 ))

  if [ ${cases[$pick]} -ne -1 ] ; then

    cases[$pick]=-1

    picked=$(( $picked + 1 ))

  fi

done

</pre>
</p><p>
That gets all but four cases out of the game by setting their value to -1
(remembering that we're using 0 to represent $0.01). To see what's
left in the game and calculate the expected payout of only the remaining
values, do this:

<pre     class="programlisting">

for (( val=0 ; $val &lt; ${#cases[*]} ; val+=1 )) ; do

  if [ ${cases[$val]} -ne -1 ] ; then

    echo \(Still in the game: a prize \

      worth \$${cases[$val]}\)

    sum=$(( $sum+${cases[$val]} ))

    cnt=$(( $cnt+1 ))

  fi

done

echo Win \$$(( $sum / $cnt )) if you stop. \

     Deal, or no deal\?

exit 0

</pre>
</p><p>
Run the code, and here's a sample output:

<pre     class="programlisting">
(Still in the game: a prize worth $50)

(Still in the game: a prize worth $1000)

(Still in the game: a prize worth $5000)

(Still in the game: a prize worth $400000)

Win $101512 if you stop. Deal, or no deal?
</pre>
</p><p>
Would you take the deal, or try for the $400,000 case?
