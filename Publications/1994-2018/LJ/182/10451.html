The <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> Readers' Choice Awards have become an annual ritual,
almost as fun as the holiday season. Our editorial team members can't wait to
get their hands on the results to see what products and tools from the
Linux space are keeping you productive, satisfied and wowed. And, who
better to ask than our readers, the most talented, informed and (nearly
always for the better) opinionated group of Linux experts anywhere?
These characteristics are what make the awards such a great snapshot of
what's hot and what's not in Linux.
</p><p>
Before diving into the results, let me explain that the results,
although insightful, inherently fail to capture the true diversity of
preferences that exist in our community. I wish we had space to show you
the chaotic yet amazing mish-mash of responses to each question. As we
try to lasso you into organized responses, you are curiously galloping
off in pursuit of your category-busting solution as we hang on to the
rope for dear life. The reality is that you are always experimenting;
your opinions are fluid, and filling in virtual bubbles doesn't fully
explain the nuance of your relationship to your tools.
</p><p>
This is a survey of big trends, and the trend underlying them all is that
you embrace lots of tools. One respondent summed it up with &ldquo;All of the above,
many of the above&rdquo;, and another exclaimed, &ldquo;Variety is the
spice, baby!&rdquo;
</p><p>
Once again, in this year's competition, we designated only one winner per
category, with strong contenders receiving Honorable Mention awards.
For instance, in the categories where a cluster of formidable contenders
followed the outright winner, we designated up to three honorable mentions.
Besides a few exceptions, a product or service had to get at least 10%
of the vote for Honorable Mention status.
</p><p>
Here then, ladies and gentlemen, are <span   class="emphasis"><em>your</em></span> 2009
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> Readers'
Choice Awards.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x132a580.0x14227d0"></a>
Favorite Primary Linux Distribution of Choice</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>
Ubuntu</b></span> (45%)
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
Honorable Mention</em></span>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Debian</b></span> (10%)
</p><p>
The Ubuntu phenomenon, even by Linux standards, is truly paradigm-shifting
and it doesn't appear that it will be tanking any time soon. In the 2008
Readers' Choice Awards, we dubbed the ubiquitous Ubuntu &ldquo;the big
distro that did&rdquo; for unexpectedly leaving its myriad rivals as mere dots
in the rear-view mirror. In the 2009 tally, Ubuntu deserves an &ldquo;Energizer
Bunny Award&rdquo; for winning the Favorite Primary Linux Distro category,
increasing its popularity and becoming untouchable for the time being.
Ubuntu and its related Kubuntu and Edubuntu siblings raised their vote
tally from 37% in last year's awards to 45% this year. At whose expense
is Ubuntu gaining? Although Mandriva tumbled most dramatically from 14% to
2%, Fedora and Novell/SUSE hemorrhaged more than a few percentage points.
Meanwhile, Red Hat, CentOS and Debian ticked up a few points from last
year, the latter enough to warrant Honorable Mention with its 10% share
of your vote.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x132a580.0x1422bf0"></a>
Favorite Desktop Environment</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
GNOME</b></span> (53%)
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Honorable Mention</em></span>
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
KDE</b></span> (30%)
</p><p>
During the past year, GNOME has reached majority rule status, with 53% of
you electing it your favorite desktop environment. This trend is despite
the breakneck development of KDE 4 during the past year. Although GNOME
garnered only a few more votes than it did in 2008, KDE's vote count slipped
as you've warmed to Xfce, Fluxbox and Enlightenment. The long and
influential coattails of Ubuntu can only make any presidential candidate
green with envy.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x132a580.0x1422f60"></a>
Favorite Web Browser</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Firefox</b></span> (87%)
</p><p>
Firefox takes first prize as both your Favorite Web Browser for 2009
and the most extreme &ldquo;category crusher&rdquo; of this competition. No other
application (besides the competitor-less Apache) racked up a higher share
of votes (87%) than Firefox, although OpenOffice.org wasn't far behind.
Who can argue, as Firefox keeps getting faster and accumulates more
useful extensions? This year's surprise gainer was the historically
underappreciated Opera browser, which ratcheted up from 5% to 8% on the
heels of its impressive 9.5 and 9.6 releases. The worthy Konqueror
and the browsers based on the Firefox Gecko engine (for example, Flock and
Epiphany) were left behind in the catchall &ldquo;Other&rdquo; category. How will
this category look next year? Look for an inevitable battle royale if
Google can deliver a polished Chrome for Linux in time for you to give
it a test drive.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x132a580.0x1423220"></a>
Favorite E-Mail Client</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Mozilla Thunderbird</b></span> (38%)
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Honorable Mention</em></span>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Gmail Web Client</b></span> (31%)
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Evolution</b></span> (11%)
</p><p>
Congratulations to Mozilla Thunderbird for its third consecutive win
in the Favorite E-Mail Client category with 38% of the vote. The &ldquo;Holy
how did that happen, Batman?&rdquo; award, as well as Honorable Mention, go to
the runner up, Gmail, which got 11% more of your votes than last year,
while Thunderbird dropped 7%. Meanwhile, other non-Web-based clients,
Evolution and KMail, are ever more the favorites of fewer. Is the trend
toward Web-based clients inexorable, or can the non-Gmails of the world
find a formula to stanch the decline?

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x132a580.0x14236f0"></a>
Favorite Office Program</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>OpenOffice.org</b></span> (85%)
</p><p>
No news here, gang. OpenOffice.org, bolstered no doubt by its recent
3.0 release, retains its crown as your Favorite Office Program with the
same share of your vote as last year, 85%. The alternatives, AbiWord
and KOffice, each similarly continue to be the favorites of merely 3%
of you. As with Firefox, there seems to be some sort of correlation
between a program's cross-platform characteristics (should any exist)
and its category-crusher status. Honorable Mention for most definitive
response in this category goes to &ldquo;I hate all office
programs&rdquo;.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x132a580.0x1423958"></a>
Favorite Audio Tool</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Audacity</b></span> (73%)
</p><p>
In this year's competition, we decided it made sense to split up
audio-related programs into two categories. The first is Favorite
Audio Tool&mdash;that is, program for creating, manipulating and modifying audio
streams. The second is Favorite Audio Player&mdash;that is, program for playing
and organizing existing audio streams. The cross-platform Audacity sound
recorder and editor is yet another&mdash;cross-platform rule holds&mdash;category
crusher in the Favorite Audio Tool department, garnering top marks from
73% of you. Although the applications LMMS and Ardour each have a critical
mass of adherents, each is the favorite audio tool of only 6% of you.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x132a580.0x1423b68"></a>
Favorite Audio Player</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Amarok</b></span> (36%)
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Honorable Mention</em></span>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Rhythmbox</b></span> (18%)
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>XMMS</b></span> (12%)
</p><p>
Although alternatives have knocked Amarok back a few points from last year,
its 36% share of the vote tally helped the renowned audio player for
KDE remain undisputed champion in the Favorite Audio Player category.
Many of you also are aficionados of the audio players Rhythmbox and
XMMS, each of which received enough votes to warrant Honorable Mention.
It's interesting to see KDE flagging as your favorite desktop, yet the
KDE audio player, admittedly more feature-packed, has double the support
of the GNOME audio player, Rhythmbox.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x132a580.0x181c1d8"></a>
Favorite Media Player</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>VLC</b></span> (34%)
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Honorable Mention</em></span>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>MPlayer</b></span> (33%)
</p><p>
Ladies and gentlemen, we have a new champion in the Favorite Media
Player category. VLC, which last year landed in a close second place behind
MPlayer, won the category in a photo finish by a single percentage point.
Both players play pretty much any format you can throw at them, making
usability a key factor in your decision. Thus, more of you are opting for
the single-console approach of VLC rather than MPlayer. Other players that
recorded respectable results were Totem (9%), Kaffeine (8%), SMPlayer
(6%) and xine (5%).

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x132a580.0x181c548"></a>
Favorite Communications Tool</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Pidgin</b></span> (43%)
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Honorable Mention</em></span>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Skype</b></span> (18%)
</p><p>
Nothing changed in the Favorite Communications Tool category. Once
again, Pidgin Internet Messenger, the Swiss Army knife-esque messaging tool
formerly known as Gaim, took top honors with a 43% share of your votes.
Pidgin users appreciate the ability to monitor all of their messaging
accounts in 15 different protocols. Competitor Kopete, which slipped
from its Honorable Mention status from last year, does only 11 protocols.
Meanwhile, the closed-source Skype retained its Honorable Mention
laurels by earning 18% of your votes. That may be its ceiling until its
improbable open-source resurrection, as a sizable contingent of us
will never fill the bubble of any closed-source application, regardless
of how good it is.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x132a580.0x181c8b8"></a>
Favorite Graphics/Design Tool</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>GIMP</b></span> (76%)
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Honorable Mention</em></span>
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Inkscape</b></span> (11%)
</p><p>
The legendary GIMP remains your unrivaled choice for Favorite
Graphics/Design Tool, once again with 76% of the votes. It appears
though, that the vector-graphics application Inkscape is emerging from
the pack of graphics applications as a new favorite. Inkscape left the
single-digit vote-getters to reach 11% of your votes, enough to win it
Honorable Mention in the category. Are the impressive, mature programs
like Blender too specialized to warrant your vote? Maybe the category
is too broad. One write-in voter exclaimed, &ldquo;You're making me choose
between GIMP and Blender?!&rdquo;, and another explained, &ldquo;Blender, GIMP and
Inkscape are totally different tools for different purposes. They're all
my favorites in their respective categories&rdquo;. Points well taken.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x132a580.0x181ccd8"></a>
Favorite Digital Photo Management Tool</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Picasa</b></span> (34%)
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Honorable Mention</em></span>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>F-Spot</b></span> (17%)
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>digiKam</b></span> (13%)
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>gThumb</b></span> (11%)
</p><p>
Although much has changed in the crowded category of Favorite Digital
Photo Management Tool, one broad trend appears to hold. If a Google
application is around, it is likely to be slicing and dicing its rivals.
In the photo management category, the slicer-dicer is Picasa, and the
sliced and diced is digiKam. In the 2008 awards, Picasa and digiKam were
neck and neck with 25% of the votes. This year, Picasa wins the category,
leaving everyone else in the dust with its 34% of the vote. F-Spot (at
17%), digiKam (at 13%) and gThumb (at 11%) are still all popular enough
to deserve Honorable Mention. However, Picasa may continue to surge as
unique features, such as the ability to sync photos between
one's PC and Web-based albums seamlessly, make it a tough act to follow.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x132a580.0x181d1a8"></a>
Favorite Text Editor</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>vi</b></span> (36%)
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Honorable Mention</em></span>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>gedit</b></span> (19%)
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kate</b></span> (11%)
</p><p>
The more things change, the more they stay the same in the Favorite Text
Editor category. Vi wins again with a solid 36%, with gedit and Kate
taking Honorable Mention honors. Emacs and nano also are popular but
just missed the cut.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x132a580.0x181d570"></a>
Favorite Version Control System</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Subversion</b></span> (47%)
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Honorable Mention</em></span>
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
CVS</b></span> (16%)
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>git</b></span> (15%)
</p><p>
You left little doubt about who deserves to win Favorite Version Control
System, a new category in the 2009 Readers' Choice Awards. Subversion is
the favorite of 47% of you; CVS and git win Honorable Mention at 16%
and 15%, respectively.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x132a580.0x181d990"></a>
Favorite Database</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>MySQL</b></span> (61%)
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Honorable Mention</em></span>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>PostgreSQL</b></span> (18%)
</p><p>
MySQL's move over to Sun Microsystems doesn't appear to have dampened
your admiration for the legendary open-source database. Both this year
and last year, you deemed MySQL your Favorite Database, with 61%
of your votes this year. PostgreSQL also shared a similar fate as last year,
registering 18%, enough for Honorable Mention. SQLite, Oracle and
Firebird all polled in the single digits.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x132a580.0x181dca8"></a>
Favorite Linux Monitoring Application</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Nagios</b></span> (51%)
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Honorable Mention</em></span>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Hyperic HQ</b></span> (15%)
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>up.time</b></span> (11%)
</p><p>
Nagios was not only recently dubbed one of the most important open-source
apps of all time, but it also is the winner of the new Readers' Choice
category, Favorite Linux Monitoring Application. A slim majority 51%
of you use Nagios to keep close tabs on your networks of all shapes,
sizes and levels of complexity. Most of you not using Nagios opt for
the Honorable Mention candidates, Hyperic HQ (with 15%) and up.time
(11%). Ganglia and GroundWork also garnered respectable votes in the
single digits.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x132a580.0x181e0c8"></a>
Favorite Programming Language</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Python</b></span> (20%)
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Honorable Mention</em></span>
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
C++</b></span> (19%)
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Java</b></span> (17%)
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>C</b></span> (13%)
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Perl</b></span> (12%)
</p><p>
Last year, we created discord when we split programming languages
into two categories: Favorite Programming Language and Favorite
Scripting Language. Then, we limited your choices according to our own
definition of each. In order to shield ourselves from the avalanche of
&ldquo;WTFs&rdquo; (whew, we succeeded!), we gave you more latitude to decide which
is which. Therefore, the results look a bit different from last year.
In an interesting twist, Guido van Rossum's venerable Python, which took
First Place in last year's Favorite Scripting Language category, wins this
year's Favorite Programming Language award with a hefty 20% of your votes.
Close behind in the Honorable Mention group are your other favorites, with
few surprises: C++ with 19%, Java with 17%, C with 13% and Perl with 12%.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x132a580.0x1730280"></a>
Favorite Scripting Language</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>bash</b></span> (28%)
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Honorable Mention</em></span>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>PHP</b></span> (24%)
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Python</b></span> (19%)
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Perl</b></span> (14%)
</p><p>
The results of the Favorite Scripting Language illustrate the diversity of
opinions on what is a scripting language. Although the prosaic workhorse
bash (shell) wins the category with 28% of the tally, three other
quite different languages follow close behind in the Honorable Mention
category: the Web-centric PHP, the flexible Python and the Swiss
Army chainsaw of programming languages, Perl.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x132a580.0x17306f8"></a>
Favorite GUI Remote Access or Network Computing Solution</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>SSH and X</b></span> (40%)
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Honorable Mention</em></span>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>TightVNC</b></span> (14%)
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>rdesktop</b></span> (13%)
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>RealVNC</b></span> (12%)
</p><p>
Your inaugural choice for Favorite GUI Remote Access or Network Computing
Solution is clear. SSH and X wins hands-down with a commanding 40% share
of the votes. Meanwhile, a hefty chunk of you choose to go graphical,
using variants of VNC, such as TightVNC, RealVNC and UltraVNC. In fact,
if you add those three user groups together, you're just shy of winning
the category. TightVNC, rdesktop and RealVNC are all popular enough to
share the platform for Honorable Mention.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x132a580.0x1730b70"></a>
Favorite Linux IDE</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Eclipse</b></span> (42%)
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Honorable Mention</em></span>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>NetBeans</b></span> (14%)
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>KDevelop</b></span> (11%)
</p><p>
Yet another new category in this year's awards is Favorite Linux IDE,
which the ubiquitous Eclipse won commandingly and unsurprisingly with
42% of the votes cast. The fact that in Eclipse one can work in a lean
environment and add and subtract an incredible array functionality with
its myriad modules has closed the deal for nearly a majority of
you.
At the same time, the second largest vote-getter was &ldquo;Other&rdquo;. Clearly the
Linux developer community cannot be pigeonholed.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x132a580.0x1731040"></a>
Favorite Platform for Developing Rich Internet Apps</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Adobe Air</b></span> (21%)
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Honorable Mention</em></span>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Gears</b></span> (18%)
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>JavaFX</b></span> (15%)
</p><p>
When it comes to your Favorite Platform for Developing Rich Internet Apps
(yet another new category for 2009), you are less decided than in the
Linux IDE category. Although Adobe Air is the favorite of the most of you
at 21%, you also are using Gears and JavaFX in solid numbers, 18% and
15%, respectively, among others. Mono Moonlight and OpenLaszlo also were
close to the 10% mark. Will one of these tools break away to be the next
Eclipse in a few years? Tune in to this space next year to find out.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x132a580.0x1731408"></a>
Favorite Linux Game</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>

<span   class="bold"><b><span class="emphasis"><em>Tux Racer</em></span></b></span>, also

</p><p>
With some barely perceptible percentage changes, the Favorite Linux Game
category remains the same as last year, led by <span   class="emphasis"><em>Frozen
Bubble</em></span> and with
Honorable Mention going to <span   class="emphasis"><em>Doom</em></span> and the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Tux
Racer</em></span> series. Besides being
consistent, the Favorite Game category is characterized by having the
largest share of &ldquo;Other&rdquo; votes, with 27%, and the wittiest comments.
One of you commented &ldquo;Keeping it old school with SCUMM[VM]
games&rdquo;.
On the flip side, a surprising number of you also commented that you
&ldquo;have no time for games&rdquo; or &ldquo;don't like games&rdquo;. Meanwhile, this writer
is wondering whether the many commercial game companies that now make Linux
versions will ever break through with a runaway hit that could give
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Frozen Bubble</em></span> a challenge one day.

Favorite Virtualization Solution</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>VirtualBox</b></span> (32%)

</p><p>
We've been watching VirtualBox for a few years now, wondering when its
popularity would finally match its technical prowess. Well, 2009 is
finally VirtualBox's time in the sun, as this year it toppled VMware to
win Favorite Virtualization Solution. Last year, VirtualBox received
roughly half the votes of VMware (20% vs. 39%). This year, VirtualBox won
the matchup 32% to 30%. VMware and Wine, thus, took Honorable
Mention honors. Xen fell just short of 10% of the vote. [See Marcel
Gagn&eacute;'s Cooking with Linux on page 26 for more on VirtualBox.]

<span   class="bold"><b>Simple Linux Backup</b></span> (14%)
</p><p>
Once again, in the backup department we differentiated between
comprehensive applications, or systems (this category), and specific
utilities (see Favorite Backup Utility below). Regarding the Favorite
Backup System category, most of you continue to prefer the same systems as
last year, although the deck chairs have been rearranged a bit. This year,
the open-source application Amanda took the victory lap, which Simple
Linux Backup took last year. Still, the latter won Honorable Mention
this year along with Bacula (yet again) for network-based backup.
Favorite Backup System also has a variety of write-in votes with some
variation of &ldquo;roll my own solution&rdquo;.

</p><p>
Though rsync and tar are your perennial favorites for Favorite Backup
Utility, this year, the two flip-flopped positions, with tar taking the
crown last year and rsync taking it this year. rsync is the favorite
backup utility of 47% of you to tar's 34%.

</p><p>
As the fate of Ubuntu and siblings slopes ever upward, so too trends
the popularity of apt, the principal package management system for Ubuntu
and Debian. Once again, apt, with 37% of the votes, is the clear and
even more dominant victor as Favorite Package Management Application.
More of you also are turning to Synaptic, the groovy front end to apt,
to keep your system loaded with your favorite programs. The classic RPM
(10%) and its amigo Yum (13%) declined slightly from last year, as more
of you are leaving Fedora and Novell/SUSE in favor of Ubuntu.

No surprise that the blog publishing application WordPress once again wins
the category Favorite Content Management System with 25% of the vote.
In the Honorable Mention department, your same two favorite Web content
managers, Joomla! and Drupal, are present only to flip in popularity.
This year, Joomla! reached an impressive 23% to Drupal's 19%. Drupal got
our vote&mdash;LinuxJournal.com runs on it.

</p><p>
As with last year, the thought arises in Favorite Web Server category
of
whether we should just ask &ldquo;Do you use the Apache Web server, yes
or no?&rdquo; and leave it at that. Apache wins again in 2009 with 89% of
your votes.

Talk about a meteoric rise, Contegix went from one write-in vote in 2008 to champion
of the Favorite Linux-Friendly Web Hosting Company category in
2009.
Otherwise, four well-known names have remained among your perennial
favorites for years, namely Rackspace, GoDaddy.com, DreamHost and 1&amp;1.
Of the four, only Rackspace broke the 10% barrier this year for
Honorable Mention, while the other three were just shy of the mark.
GoDaddy.com was category winner last year, and DreamHost and 1&amp;1 were
the two Honorable Mentions.

Last year, we admittedly were dorks for having the category Favorite
Linux Handheld Device, which left so many cool Linux gadgets out in
the cold. The Nokia N800 won that one. This year, however, we've taken
our smart pills and expanded the category, calling it Favorite Linux-Based
Gadget. Not surprisingly, one of the most well-known devices, the ASUS
Eee PC won the category with 24% of the vote, followed by the Android G1,
which achieved Honorable Mention status with 22%. After the G1, the field
was so crowded, making it impossible, unfortunately, for any other device to
crack the 10% barrier. The Nokia N810 Tablet, Acer Aspire One, TomTom
Navigation System, OpenMoko FreeRunner, Amazon Kindle, the Palm Pre and
several write-ins all received a fair share of your vote, which shows how
sophisticated, interesting and crowded the Linux device space has become.

There is something oddly liberating about the &ldquo;big guys&rdquo; pre-installing
Linux on their PCs. At long last, when we go to buy a PC, a device so
central to our identities and livelihoods, we find the well-thought-out
preference for Linux taken seriously by the companies we want to
buy from. After being shut out so long for being too smart, it sure
feels good, doesn't it? Your vote for the ASUS Eee PC as Favorite Linux
Laptop (with 32% of the vote) tells us how much you appreciate the
opportunity to buy a laptop designed with Linux in mind and not just a
feature-handicapped afterthought to placate the pesky geeks. The group
of Honorable Mentions includes not only the returning Lenovo T61p (16%)
but also the newcomers Dell Inspiron Mini 9 (12%) and Acer Aspire One
(10%). Despite such euphoria over the big guys, you didn't forget our
Linux-specialist friends like Linux Certified, EmperorLinux and R Cubed
who kept us motoring during darker times. They fared well as a group
if you add up all the votes for their various models.

</p><p>
Let's start with the official results for Favorite Linux Desktop
Workstation. Dell won the category with 41% of your votes, and
Hewlett-Packard earned Honorable Mention with 16%. Unfortunately, the
official results fail to appreciate the &ldquo;roll-your-own&rdquo; spirit that is
so vital to our community. Because we didn't include a choice like &ldquo;I
configure my own desktop PCs&rdquo;, you told us as much in your own words.
In a classic survey creator's nightmare, the responses &ldquo;I do.
:)&rdquo; and
&ldquo;I do, as in self-built&rdquo; and &ldquo;Home-brewed&rdquo; all registered as separate
votes worth 0.05% each even though they mean the same thing. Allow me
put on my Katherine Harris hat and have a look at these &ldquo;hanging
chads&rdquo;, Florida-election-style, to shed some light on your
roll-your-own tendencies. Hours of investigative sleuthing revealed that roughly
12% of you configure your own desktop PCs. Therefore, the honorary
Honorable Mention award in this category goes to the
roll-your-own
spirit of the Linux Community.

While the roll-your-own philosophy is alive and well when it comes
to servers, you tend to feel more comfortable giving this business to
the big guys. Dell is the winner of the Favorite Linux Server category
with 32% of your votes. Your Honorable Mention winners, IBM and HP,
trailed Dell with 16% and 15%, respectively.

</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
Honorable Mention</em></span>
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
PowerTOP Tool</b></span> (16%)
</p><p>
Last year, VMware took top honors as Favorite &ldquo;Green&rdquo; Linux Product or
Solution partly because of how we phrased the question. This year,
to be more fair, we grouped virtualization solutions together, and they
won the category with 45% of your votes. The win makes sense given
the technology's impressive improvement in the efficiency of servers.
The PowerTOP tool for finding energy wasters on your systems also
is popular and won Honorable Mention with 16%. We failed to list the
recent (kernel 2.6.21) innovation of the tickless idle on Linux, which
takes advantage of low power states in modern processors. Are you
taking advantage of this feature? Next year, we'll ask you directly.
Finally, this author wishes to express his dismay at the significant
number of disparaging remarks in this survey toward green solutions.
Although the vast majority of respondents are positive to neutral in this
category, responses such as &ldquo;Don't drink the green Kool-Aid&rdquo;
and &ldquo;I don't
care!&rdquo; were plentiful. Will our progeny admire our arrogant proclivity
to waste natural resources and do little to change our ways? I doubt it.

Last year, we limited the selection in this category to books published from 2007 to the
date of the survey (February 2008). This year, we decided to try Favorite
Linux Book of All Time, and the results didn't gel as easily.
Because this category is so crowded, we decided to
toss out the 10% rule for Honorable Mention and honor your top five books.
Interestingly, two of your favorites were not technical guides but rather
required reading for understanding the Linux phenomenon, namely <span   class="emphasis"><em>Just
for Fun: The Story of an Accidental Revolutionary</em></span>, the story of Linus
Torvalds' rise to fame, and <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Cathedral and the
Bazaar</em></span>, Eric Raymond's
seminal book on the Open Source movement. Rounding out the Honorable
Mentions <span   class="emphasis"><em>Running Linux</em></span> and
<span   class="emphasis"><em>The Linux Bible</em></span>. The information-overloaded among you
meanwhile opted for the popular write-in candidates &ldquo;Too many to
choose&rdquo;
or &ldquo;Very tough question&rdquo;.

<span   class="bold"><b>Dave Taylor's Work the Shell</b></span> (10%)
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Mick Bauer's Paranoid Penguin</b></span> (10%)
</p><p>
Here is some <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> lore for you. Our publication used to have
a column called Kernel Korner, which many faithful readers
certainly remember. Kernel Korner dominated the Favorite <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span> Column category from the awards' inception in 1996 until 2000.
Things got competitive in 2001 when Marcel Gagn&eacute; and his
Cooking with Linux, the world's first column ever to pair practical
(and hilarious) Linux advice with appropriate wine selections. Cooking
with Linux
has been so popular ever since that it won Favorite <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span> Column
from 2001 to 2008, and last year, I suggested that &ldquo;Marcel
Gagn&eacute; is going
to have to be knocked off before anyone knocks him off the award
stand.&rdquo;
My prediction was premature, because this year, although Marcel won this
category again, he shares his title with Kyle Rankin's more recent Hack
and / column. Believe it or not, Marcel and Kyle received the exact same
number of votes, or 19% each. Congratulations are due to both excellent
columnists who offer vastly different but equally useful content in
their monthly musings. Meanwhile, Dave Taylor's Work the Shell and Mick
Bauer's Paranoid Penguin are both popular with 10% of you,
enough to award them Honorable Mention.

</p><p>
In the question for 2009 Linux Product of the Year, we didn't give you
any suggestions. We left the responses 100% up to you. Naturally, this
made nearly every response unique and left it up to us to categorize it.
Nevertheless, it is safe to proclaim that your 2009 <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span> Product
of the Year Award goes to the Android platform and its first commercial
implementation, the T-Mobile G1 phone. The pair garnered 9% of your
votes. Close behind, with 8% and Honorable Mention, was the Ubuntu
Linux distribution, followed by the KDE 4 desktop with 7% and, finally,
last year's winner, the ASUS Eee PC with 6%. Last year, the Eee PC reached
an impressive 37% of the votes. Interestingly, the development of Android
and the G1 phone, although popular and groundbreaking, didn't have quite the
same dominant effect that the Eee PC had last year&mdash;nor did any other
single product. This effect allowed you to remediate my lament from
last year that &ldquo;when Ubuntu releases yet another fantastic upgrade, our
expectations are met and the buzz meter quickly subsides&rdquo;. This year,
Ubuntu got the respect it deserves in this category for revolutionizing
the Linux desktop oh so gradually with each great upgrade.
