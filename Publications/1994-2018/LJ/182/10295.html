It is no exaggeration to claim that Paul Davis' software is employed
by every serious Linux audio user and developer.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1303580.0x13fb2a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Paul Davis' JACK sound server
is the cornerstone of the modern Linux audio system, and his Ardour DAW
(digital audio workstation) is regarded as the flagship application in
that system. He also has contributed significantly to many other sound
and music software projects, including ALSA, the default sound system
for the Linux kernel.
</p><p>
After graduating summa cum laude from Portsmouth Polytechnic (UK)
with a degree in biomolecular science, he followed a career course as
a software engineer, systems programmer and consultant for various
technical firms and institutes (a summary is available on-line
at <a href="http://www.ak.tu-berlin.de/menue/edgard-varese-gastprofessur/paul_davis" target="_self">www.ak.tu-berlin.de/menue/edgard-varese-gastprofessur/paul_davis</a>), specializing in UNIX C/C++
environments. In 1994, he became the second employee of Amazon.com,
where he developed essential software for the fledgling on-line
bookstore. Since 1998, he has been operating Linux Audio Systems, a
business venture &ldquo;...focused on using Linux as a platform for audio and
MIDI applications, with a particular focus on real-time performance and
commercial studio tools&rdquo;, as the man himself describes it. 
Currently, he
resides in Berlin where he is the Edgard Var&egrave;se Gastprofessor lecturing
at the Technische Universitat.

In addition to his reputation as a master programmer, Paul is highly
regarded in the Linux audio world as a model for team leadership and the
practical management of large-scale distributed development projects. He
has attracted a very talented crew of developers for his own projects,
and his opinions and views are often sought by novice (and not-so-novice)
programmers. The following interview reveals some of the reasons why.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1303580.0x13fb6c8"></a>
Writing Audio Software</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>DP:</b></span> Your education and professional history point toward a career as a
programmer in business or scientific fields. When and why did you decide
to write music and sound software for a living?
</p><p>
PD: After I left Amazon.com, I felt I wanted to leave programming
for good. That was fairly easy at first, because I was busy being an
at-home parent to my one-year-old daughter. However, after a couple 
years, I started to explore music making as a hobby, and I immediately
realized that for recording, computers and hard disk recording were the
way everything was going. For all kinds of reasons, I wasn't going to
use Windows or a Mac, but I decided I could leverage my exposure
to both Linux and my ten years of UNIX programming by doing things on
Linux. It turned out that the tools available at that time (1997) on
Linux were really not up to the task, and I foolishly decided that I
would just write my own. This came at a time when I didn't need to make
an income, and I basically focused on my own needs and desires, which
initially mostly were focused on pattern-based composition and real-time
synthesis. Eventually, the need for a reasonable recorder became more and
more clear, and at the end of 1999, RME released the first Hammerfall
card with 26 channels of input, 26 channels of output and an existing
Linux device driver (for OSS, not ALSA). It seemed clear that I
needed one of these, and that I should update the driver and then write
an HDR application. The driver took a few weeks, and a month or two
later, I had a working recorder. It was only a few months later that I
and other early users/testers recognized that a recorder by itself was
useless and that we needed an editor. Had I known then what I know now
about what is involved, I think I would have given up.
</p><p>
To get back to the focus of the question, I didn't really try to make an
income from my audio software until about three years ago when my
financial situation was becoming precarious. Before that, it was almost
entirely a labor of love and a lot of fun. Since then, it has become a
bit more of a burden&mdash;I try to work reasonable amounts, as people 
actually are paying me now, and it's very hard to make a living in the US by
giving away software! I often think that I (and my family) should move
to a much cheaper country, where the income I do make from Ardour would
go much further than it does here. Right now, alas, this is
not an option for us. And, although I don't like to go on about it too much,
income really is a major issue for me right now, with one child about to
head off to film school and another likely starting a four-year college in a
couple years. It's not clear that I can honestly say that I
<span   class="emphasis"><em>am</em></span>
making a living doing this, but somehow, I am still here when companies
like BeOS, Creamware and so many others have come and gone. It amazes me!
</p><p>
Writing software for musicians and audio engineers has revitalized my love
of programming. Helping people connect with their creative selves is a
real joy, and facing down huge technical hurdles is very satisfying. The
programming I did for 15 years before I started doing this stuff was
really just a warm up, both in terms of the satisfaction that I've gotten
from it and the pleasure I get from how my work affects others.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
DP:</b></span> What are some of the important differences between writing software
for a large-scale Web-based business and writing music and sound software?
What are the important similarities?
</p><p>
PD: I don't think there are any similarities other than the need to
write good code. One of joys of the way I have worked for the last seven or
eight years is that my work is dictated directly by users first and then by
my own aesthetics as a programmer. If I decide some code I've
written isn't good enough, I am free to rewrite it completely to meet
my own standards. Working inside a standard commercial operation, that
freedom is hard to find, and your priorities and deadlines are based on
marketing realities (and marketing aspirations). One could argue that
this delays development and releases, and to a certain extent that's
true. But I'm more interested in not facing nasty legacy code problems
in five years than I am in meeting someone's idea of when a release should
have been finished. The Linux kernel has followed much the same pathway,
and it has paid enormous dividends. The kernel code, for the most part,
keeps getting cleaner and cleaner even as the kernel gets bigger and
more complex. I can't say Ardour is quite as much of a success in
this area, but there is a similar motivation.
</p><p>
One day, I would like to know more about the internals of how Ableton
Live is developed. I have met the head of Ableton and was very struck by
what he told me about how they use a lot of formal software development
methods. I have very little experience with these techniques, and I
sometimes wonder if Live is a great program because of them or in spite
of them.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
DP:</b></span> Project management in the Free Software world has been compared
to herding cats. You are well regarded by your colleagues, and it's
obvious you know how to control a herd of very talented cats. So,
what's your secret? What significant problems have you encountered in
managing an international crew working (for free) on a project
as complex as Ardour?
</p><p>
PD: The problems didn't really show up in a big way until we
started adding MIDI support. This required many deep changes in the code,
and since that time, we have two branches of the code under development.
We face a real need to keep the MIDI one in sync with the non-MIDI
one (where until recently, most development has taken place). There
are no tricks to this&mdash;just hard work and a &ldquo;merge early, merge
often&rdquo; 
policy that sadly I have not adhered to myself. Speaking more broadly,
the most difficult problem is one of communication. We use IRC a great
deal, and it works very well for us as a loosely connected team. But
it has a great personal cost to me, in that I tend to feel a need to be
available to talk to people in Finland, Bali, Australia and San Francisco
no matter what time of day it is for me.
</p><p>
That said, as you noted, Ardour has some immensely talented
people working on the program, and these people generally do not require
much supervision. It is true that a much larger part of my days are now
spent on communication, but it's really similar to what I read about
Linus' role with the kernel. My main role is to foster consistency and
appropriate timing of new features than to be the guy who thinks up all
the cool stuff (though I'd like to think that from time to time I do
still think up some pretty cool stuff).

Music Matters</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>DP:</b></span> Have you pursued formal music studies at any time in your life?
</p><p>
PD: I studied flute in middle school, and in high school I used to
mess around on our family piano. I also did a lot of tape machine
experimental music&mdash;myself and several friends were part of a
(culturally) very important &ldquo;cassette swapping&rdquo; network in the UK during
the late 1970s that sanctioned all kinds of weird experimentation and
noise making. My early taste in music was dominated by German electronic
music, experimental composers and minimalism, which greatly affected
what I wanted to try to sound like as a teenage &ldquo;noise&rdquo; maker. I
tried to learn tabla about 15 years ago, but gave up realizing I was
as hopeless as I feared. About seven years ago, I started learning cello,
but when I noticed that despite being (relatively speaking) a person of
considerable leisure time, I still did not practice till right before
a lesson, I called it quits. It gives me a lot of joy that my daughter
(now 13) has taken up cello and is entering a phase now where she is
starting to sound quite pleasant.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
DP:</b></span> How important is a formal background in music for a programmer who
wants to write music and sound software?
</p><p>
PD: Well, in one sense, almost none. Most of the problems when writing
audio software are not about audio or music&mdash;they tend to be about
computers and programming languages and mistakes that you or other
people have made. But on a different level, having a clear understanding
of the variety of musical structure around the world, and a real sense
of how polyphonic music is composed both historically and today, can be
really helpful in developing software that is actually useful to
real musicians.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
DP:</b></span> What music do you prefer currently?
</p><p>
PD: My digital music collection has nearly 10,000 songs in it, and I
have another 800&ndash;1,000 vinyl albums. It would be hard to tag it with
a particular style, but on inspection, I have more music by ambient
electronic musician Steve Roach than anyone else, and by some strange
name-similar coincidence, the minimalist composer Steve Reich comes in
second (though a distant second). When I work, I often tend to listen to
drifting electronic soundscapes, though nearly as often I'm tuned into
SomaFM's Groove Salad or Secret Agent stations. At other times, I could
be listening to heavy dub reggae, Kurt Elling tearing up jazz standards,
Carnatic Indian classical or Soul Coughing.

On Ardour and JACK</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>DP:</b></span> Ardour 2 is rolling along nicely. What significant development remains
for that branch of the Ardour Project?
</p><p>
PD: Not very much is planned right now. I think there will be a 2.5.1
release in the not too distant future [it was released in September
2008], and after that, it will be mostly bug fixes. It's possible we
might add a few new features to get us to 2.6, but I don't see going
much beyond that with the 2.x series.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
DP:</b></span> Ardour 3 is certainly one of the most anticipated packages in the
world of music and sound software libre. What is its current status,
and what major challenges remain before a release is scheduled?
</p><p>
PD: There is one immediate challenge, which is merging the changes
between 2.4 and 2.5 to the 3.0 tree. A lot of work was done that touches
many things that changed independently in the 3.0 tree, and as a result,
the merge presents some major challenges. When 3.0 is released, it will
have all the features of the most recent 2.x release.
</p><p>
More long-term than getting this merge done, we have three major areas
to focus on. The first is getting 3.0 actually working at the same level
of functionality as 2.x. This will take a lot of sustained and minor bug
fixing to correct small things that got broken along the way. We also
need to ensure that 3.0 can handle sessions created with 2.x&mdash;right now,
this is not the case. And finally, we need to ensure that our initial
release is actually useful for people doing MIDI sequencing. I imagine
lots of evolution of our MIDI work flow, which is pretty different from
most DAWs already, but we need to start from somewhere that is actually
useful and not just a teaser. From our early testers, it seems we have
that, but quite a few rough edges and small buglets still
need to be sorted out.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
DP:</b></span> Besides a well-deserved vacation, what do you envision for yourself
beyond Ardour 3?
</p><p>
PD: We have items on the to-do list for Ardour 4 and beyond
already. Thinking that far ahead gives me a headache to be honest. My
main concern right now is moving Ardour in a direction where I can make
a reasonable (US) income and getting 3.0 out to
the public.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
DP:</b></span> JACK also has developed well, and I understand the jackdmp
project eventually will replace the current jackd. What improvements
will be seen at the programmer's level and by the normal user?
</p><p>
PD: For the programmer, almost none whatsoever. Jackdmp is both ABI-
and API-compatible with jackd, so you can compile JACK clients against
either one and run them against the other. This is entirely by
design&mdash;it's not an accident, and it will not change. For developers
of JACK,
jackdmp (in C++) is a much cleaner codebase than jackd, and this is
one of the major motivations for switching to it in the future. JACK, by
design, is rather complex software, but the jackd codebase (in C) has way
too much hackery and not enough clear design to be a good base for us
moving forward. Jackdmp's internal code design, apart from just support
for multiple processors, is much more modular, much more object-oriented
and basically easier to extend and even to comprehend.
</p><p>
For the user, jackdmp offers multiprocessor support for parallel audio
processing configurations (which are actually rather uncommon), and
in the future, it may offer ways for users to get all their processors
utilized by JACK even if the audio processing configuration has no
inherent parallelism. Other than that, we hope users will not see a
difference in the basic functionality. That said, other areas
evolving rapidly in the jackdmp codebase are ways to start, stop and
otherwise control JACK, and this will be of great benefit to many desktop
users once we release it.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
DP:</b></span> What are the most important aspects for programmers and users of
the new JACK MIDI capabilities?
</p><p>
PD: For programmers, the main benefits are first, a way to send MIDI
data between applications with sample-accurate timing, and next, a
consistent API for both audio and MIDI. There is one effect that can be
a bit of a complication&mdash;the consistent API means audio and MIDI
data arrive in the same thread. This is a rather fundamental change
from other systems where the audio and MIDI APIs are quite distinct
and tend to lead to applications handling audio data in one thread and
MIDI in another. It's an issue we're still working on in Ardour 3.0.
</p><p>
For users, the main benefits are hopefully just better ways to connect
independent applications and get maximal sync between them. This can be
tricky to get right at present, for reasons largely out of the user's
(or programmer's) control.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1303580.0x13fc900"></a>
Advice and Considerations</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>DP:</b></span> What advice do you typically give to someone who wants to get into
programming music and sound software libre?
</p><p>
PD: Please don't start a new project! Find some software that does
something useful for you, or close to what you are thinking about,
and consider improving it/changing it/redesigning it. Far too many new
developers massively underestimate the work involved in creating a useful,
final version of any audio/music software&mdash;I know I did, by an amount
measured in years! There are a few exceptions. Rui Nuno Capela's QTractor
Project is progressing at a pace that is embarrassing to me, and 
little tools like tuners and so forth can be quick to develop
and finish. But please, no more MIDI trackers, MIDI sequencers and so on
until you've done some work on the existing programs and have established
beyond all reasonable doubt that they cannot be bent to your will.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
DP:</b></span> Do you have any general advice for users of music and sound software
libre?
</p><p>
PD: No advice, only apologies for developers like myself using them as
Guinea pigs and testing platforms. Oh, and be patient. Oh, and send money!
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>DP:</b></span> What do you consider to be the greatest strength(s) and greatest
weakness(es) of Linux audio?
</p><p>
PD: I believe that from a technical standpoint, Linux is still a far
superior platform for audio than anything else out there. Not only
does it have better performance for just about anything that matters,
it also has a suite of development tools that make a developer's
life much easier. Many OS X developers love XCode on that platform,
which is great but locked into the Mac. And, where is valgrind when you
need it? When I started working more intensely on
the native OS X version of Ardour, I held OS X and Apple in very high
esteem. Their user interface work has always been exceptional. Sadly,
I have to admit that as I have gotten deeper into OS X as a developer,
I have become less and less impressed. The things that are really great
about Linux from a developer's perspective are just not there&mdash;most of
all simplicity and transparency. It also helps that I helped design
JACK, the audio I/O framework that most pro-audio and music apps on Linux
use&mdash;I am working in a style and paradigm I can truly call my own
(though I'd like to note that many other people have commented on its
simplicity for developers and its power for users).
</p><p>
However, useful software for noncomputer-centric users means a lot
of work for someone. And a lot of work implies a lot of time. In our
culture, a lot of time generally means a lot of money, one way or another
(inheritance, windfall or income). The Linux audio ecosystem has not yet
found good ways of generating this money, and as a result, our software
(my own and that of many Linux audio developers) lacks some of the
things that can be found in proprietary software for Windows or OS X. I
say that there is a direct relationship simply because of the time =
money equation. If I could pay the right three people to work on Ardour,
it's hard to imagine what we could not do. Ableton employs many, many
more people than that and it shows in their software. Look at something
incredibly basic like tempo-sync'ed LFOs in a plugin or softsynth. I
don't know of any Linux audio software that does this, but it's been in
proprietary software for at least five or six years.
</p><p>
So, we have a set of really, really excellent tools for users with a
technical/computer-centric perspective on their work. We have not reached
the same level of accomplishment in terms of providing tools for people
who don't want to understand how computers work. And by comparison with a
tool like GarageBand, we haven't even done very well at tools that hide
the assumptions about how &ldquo;professional&rdquo; audio software is supposed to
be used (GarageBand hides this very, very well, though at considerable
cost to users who develop sophisticated needs rather rapidly).
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>

PD: Moving to Berlin to teach for a semester at the Technical University
within a week of moving our son off to Los Angeles to go to film school
has to be one of the highest stress things I've ever been involved in.
