Using Nagios, you can monitor Dell servers with SNMP
via Dell's server administration tools.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd5e580.0xe56300"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Nagios has been around since 2002 and is considered stable software.
It is in use by the likes of American Public Media, JP Morgan Chase
and Yahoo, just to name a few.
It is an enterprise-level network and systems-monitoring platform.
Nagios performs checks of services and hosts using external programs called Nagios plugins.
</p><p>
SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) is a network protocol
designed for monitoring network-attached devices.
It uses OIDs (Object IDentifiers) for defining the information, known as MIBs
(Management Information Base), that can be monitored.
The design is extensible, so vendors can define their
own items to be monitored.
</p><p>
OpenManage is provided with Dell servers and is an extremely well-documented system (see Resources) that provides extensive server
administration capabilities. OpenManage works with both Linux and
Windows. The OpenManage &ldquo;SNMP Reference Guide&rdquo; (see Resources) is a
732-page document that is &ldquo;intended for system administrators, network
administrators and anyone who wants to write SNMP MIB applications
to monitor systems&rdquo;. The &ldquo;SNMP Reference Guide&rdquo; documents the SNMP
OIDs/MIBs for monitoring Dell's servers.
</p><p>
The system described here was implemented for a local utility company
when it upgraded to Dell Power Edge servers. As often is the case,
out of the box, Nagios didn't do exactly what the company needed, but being an
open-source project, it easily was extended to accomplish the goal.
All we needed was a Nagios plugin to monitor the new servers.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd5e580.0xe56720"></a>
Don't Re-invent the Wheel</h2></div></div><p>
The first thing I set out to do was find an existing Nagios plugin
that offered similar functionality to what we needed. Quite
a number of existing plugins are available. In less than one hour, I found
check_snmp_temperature.pl by William Leibzon. This is a plugin module that
monitors the temperature of various devices remotely via SNMP. Although
monitoring temperatures was not our goal, retrieving information via
SNMP and reporting it to Nagios was. The module is written in Perl and
after reading it over, it looked very well written.
</p><p>
Chapter 4 of the Dell's &ldquo;SNMP Reference Guide&rdquo; is the
&ldquo;System State Group&rdquo;.
It states:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
The Management Information Base (MIB) variables presented in
this section enable you to track various attributes that describe
the state of the critical components supported by your system.
Components monitored under the System State Group include power
supplies, AC power cords, AC power switches, and cooling devices,
as well as temperature, fan, amperage, and voltage probes.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
The associated OIDs provide the overall state of all the critical
subsystems that we were interested in. OIDs exist that provide
much greater detail, but in this situation, the requirement was
to be alerted only if a server had a problem and to indicate the particular
subsystem that had the problem. One subsystem was not
addressed in the &ldquo;System State Group&rdquo; chapter&mdash;the RAID
subsystem. There is,
however, an OID for monitoring it. This OID is described in Chapter 23,
the &ldquo;Storage Management Group&rdquo;.
</p><p>
As stated earlier, these OIDs are used to define particular MIBs that can
be queried via SNMP. On the Dell server, there is an SNMP server running.
The SNMP server answers queries that are in the form of a long string
of numbers (the OID). This string of numbers is understood by the SNMP
server to be a specific question. For instance, if you want to ask the
SNMP server &ldquo;How are your power supplies?&rdquo;, you would send it the OID
.1.3.6.1.4.1.674.10892.1.200.10.1.9.1 (Figure 1). The SNMP server
will respond with 3 if the power supplies are okay.

rollup for the entire agent including any monitored devices. The
status is intended to give initiative to an SNMP monitor to get
further data when this status is abnormal.</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>
One of the benefits to choosing these particular
OIDs turned out to be
that they all respond in the same format. Dell refers to this format as
DellStatus, and it maps integers to subsystem states:


<pre     class="programlisting">
Variable Name:           DellStatus
Data Type:               Integer
Possible Data Values     Meaning of Data Value:
  other(1)               The object's status is not
                            one of the following:
  unknown(2)             The object's status is unknown.
  ok(3)                  The object's status is OK.
  nonCritical(4)         The object's status is warning, noncritical.
  critical(5)            The object's status is critical (failure).
  nonRecoverable(6)      The object's status is nonrecoverable (dead).
</pre>
</p><p>
Now that we knew what we wanted to monitor, it was time to
modify check_snmp_temperature.pl to do what was needed.
The result, check_dell_openmanager.0.7-test.pl, is too long to
print here, but it is available on the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span> FTP site (see Resources).

Testing</h2></div></div><p>
Because I did not have a spare Dell Power Edge server sitting around
to test the modified script, I had to test it another way.
Reading the man page for snmpd.conf, I found that you could have external
programs answer certain OIDs using &ldquo;pass-through&rdquo; scripts.
The bash script (dell_open_manager_test.sh) below serves as my pass-through script for testing.
With this script, I can simulate all of the states that the Dell
server could be in:


<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/bash
#
# bash script to replicate a working Dell OpenManage SNMP agent
# works with Net-SNMP daemon. infotek@gmail.com

REQUEST_OID="$2"

echo "$REQUEST_OID";
case "$REQUEST_OID" in
  .1.3.6.1.4.1.674.10892.1.200.10.1.4.1)
    echo "integer"; echo "3"; exit 0 ;;
  .1.3.6.1.4.1.674.10892.1.200.10.1.9.1)
    echo "integer"; echo "5"; exit 0 ;;

    echo "integer"; echo "3"; exit 0 ;;
  .1.3.6.1.4.1.674.10893.1.20.110.13.0)
    echo "integer"; echo "3"; exit 0 ;;
  *)
    echo "string"; echo "$@"; exit 0 ;;
esac
exit
</pre>
</p><p>
To use the script, I added the following lines to the end of
./etc/snmp/snmpd.conf:

<pre     class="programlisting">
### dell open manager test
view systemview included .1.3.6.1.4.1.674
pass .1.3.6.1.4.1.674 /bin/bash \
              /usr/local/bin/dell_open_manager_test.sh
</pre>
</p><p>
To make the changes in the configuration file take effect, restart
the snmpd d&aelig;mon. On Slackware, this is done via the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# /etc/rc.d/rc.snmpd restart
Shutting down snmpd: . DONE
Starting snmpd: /usr/sbin/snmpd -A -p \
              /var/run/snmpd -a -c /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf
</pre>
</p><p>
To query the SNMP server, we use Net-SNMP's command-line snmpget utility:


<pre     class="programlisting">
# snmpget -v 1 -c public 127.0.0.1 \
                .1.3.6.1.4.1.674.10892.1.200.10.1.9.1
SNMPv2-SMI::enterprises.674.10892.1.200.10.1.9.1 = INTEGER: 3
</pre>
</p><p>
The response is an integer value of 3. The value 3 in
the DellStatus (see above) maps to &ldquo;ok(3) The object's status is
OK&rdquo;.
This tells us that the pass-through script is working.
Now, we test the /check_dell_openmanager.pl Perl script:


<pre     class="programlisting">
# ./check_dell_openmanager.pl -H 127.0.0.1 -C public -T pe2950
OK
</pre>
</p><p>
To test other values, simply modify the dell_open_manager_test.sh shell script.
For example, to simulate an error in the Cooling Device OID
(.1.3.6.1.4.1.674.10892.1.200.10.1.21), modify that OID's line in
the script to return a code of 4 for nonCritical:


<pre     class="programlisting">
.1.3.6.1.4.1.674.10892.1.200.10.1.21.1)
  echo "integer"; echo "4"; exit 0 ;;
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, running the Perl script produces a warning:


<pre     class="programlisting">
# ./check_dell_openmanager.pl -H 127.0.0.1 -C public -T pe2950
WARNING:Cooling Device Status=Non-Critical
</pre>
</p><p>
To simulate a critical error, let's modify the Power Supply OID to reply
with a 5:


<pre     class="programlisting">
.1.3.6.1.4.1.674.10892.1.200.10.1.9.1)
  echo "integer"; echo "5"; exit 0 ;;


# ./check_dell_openmanager.pl -H 127.0.0.1 -C public -T pe2950
CRITICAL:Cooling Device Status=Non-Critical, \
                 Power Supply Status=Critical
</pre>
</p><p>
To test the script on the live production systems, we added the
check_dell_openmanager.pl command to a working Nagios server.
We opened the case cover on a live system to generate a Chassis Intrusion
Status error to test the plugin. Within a few seconds, we had an SMS
message on the IT administrator's phone letting us know that there
was a problem with the chassis subsystem on the server we just opened.

Moving Forward</h2></div></div><p>
After writing this plugin, I uploaded it to a Web site that hosts
third-party addons for Nagios named Nagios Exchange. In short order, I was
getting e-mail messages from all over the world concerning the Nagios plugin
I had written. Some were suggestions, and some were from people in
need of help. It was not an overwhelming number of messages. At most,
two a week and sometimes none. It was just enough to let me know
that people other than me actually were using this thing.
</p><p>
I would like to make a few improvements to the module. For
one, I think there may be a way to reduce the SNMP queries to only one
query to obtain the overall global status of the machine. Then, only
if the state is not &ldquo;ok(3)&rdquo;, move to query the other OIDs so that a more
specific error can be reported.
</p><p>
It also would be nice to be able to evaluate the existence of the various
subsystems, that way, for example, if a machine has a RAID array, it is
monitored, and if not, the script skips it.
</p><p>
One of the most common e-mail messages I get is about missing the Net::SNMP Perl module.
I would like to test for these common-case scenarios. If the test
fails, I would like to print the problem with a solution. In the case
of &ldquo;Net::SNMP&rdquo;, it should print:

<pre     class="programlisting">
You are missing the Net::SNMP perl module.
Please install it using:
  perl -MCPAN -e shell
  cpan&gt; install "Net::SNMP"
</pre>
</p><p>
This would improve end-user experience significantly, especially
for users new to Linux.
