Integrate HTML validation into your test suite for better HTML from the
get-go.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xda5580.0xe9d358"></a></h2></div></div><p>
We say that Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web, and that's
certainly true. But, we can boil the Web down to three specific
technologies: URLs (for uniquely identifying resources on the
Internet), HTTP (a stateless protocol for transmitting documents) and
HTML (a markup language). Each of these inventions was simple to
understand, as well as simple to implement. And, it is this
combination of simplicity and elegance that has made the Web the
success that it is.
</p><p>
All three of these technologies have evolved over the years,
reflecting new uses and needs. For example, HTTP now supports a
system of &ldquo;headers&rdquo; in both the request and response, which can do
everything from indicate the content type of the response body to
provide hints regarding how long the data should be cached.
</p><p>
HTML has grown up quite a bit as well, evolving to become a truly
semantic markup language (with styling information moved to external
CSS documents) with a more rigorous and standardized
definition. Standardization has made HTML slightly harder to write, in
that you need to be more careful about items, such as tag names
(keeping them lowercase), attributes (because not all are valid in all
contexts) and closing tags. One advantage to such standardization is
that we now can predict to a much greater degree what pages will look
like across different browsers. Sloppy HTML means that the browser has
to decide what you meant, which can have consequences that vary widely
in their influence on the way the page looks.
</p><p>
More significant, the rise of AJAX as a paradigm for Web development
has made it increasingly important that HTML be well formed. Many
AJAX-related routines need to modify a particular element on the page
in some way. The easiest way to do this typically is to grab the
element via its id attribute, which is guaranteed to be unique. (If
you want more than one element to use an ID, you really should use a
class instead.) In the last few months, I have worked on a number
of pages that had duplicate ID attributes. Sometimes this was the
result of a simple mistake, and sometimes it resulted from ignorance
on the part of a Web designer. But in all cases, this meant that my
JavaScript performed differently from what I expected.
</p><p>
Although HTML validation might seem boring, it's actually an essential
part of getting AJAX-powered, latest-paradigm, super-fancy Web
sites to work. This month, I review a few tools I use
to make sure the HTML I create is as standards-compliant
as usual. I begin with some simple, manual tests that can run
on individual pages. Then, I show some automated tools I
use when developing applications in Ruby on Rails, allowing me to
check the HTML of all of my pages en masse, including those that
require password protection to access.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xda5580.0xe9d720"></a>
HTML Standardization</h2></div></div><p>
Before continuing, it's important to realize that HTML is a
catchall term for many different, related markup languages. And, when
I say markup, I mean that HTML is a language used to describe a
text, identifying its different parts. For instance, a newspaper article will 
have a headline, one or more authors, one or more paragraphs of text,
zero or more photographs, and one or more captions per photograph. A
markup language doesn't add content to a document, but rather
describes the individual parts of the document, so that they can be
laid out and displayed in an appropriate way. In this sense, HTML is
a direct descendant of SGML, a markup language that was developed many
years previously, but which was far more difficult to work with.
</p><p>
Although there have been several versions of HTML over the years, let's
focus on the ones that are most widely used today. Perhaps the most
common version of HTML is an unstructured, unversioned, nonstandard
document. I'm certainly guilty of creating many such documents, which
look like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;This is the title&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;This is the headline&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is another paragraph&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
Nothing is wrong, per se, with the above document. But, because it
fails to indicate which version of HTML it is using, browsers must
make a variety of assumptions. These assumptions can make it hard to
predict how different browsers will operate, using something known as
quirks mode.
</p><p>
Fortunately, we can choose a standard implementation and indicate
that to a browser by adding a DOCTYPE declaration at the top of the
document. When assigning the value of DOCTYPE, you need to decide
whether you will use HTML or XHTML (that is, an XML-compliant version of
HTML), and whether you want the strict, transitional or frameset
variety of that markup language.
</p><p>
The strict version of each markup language is the ideal version that
allows no styling elements. On a modern site, such styling should be
defined in CSS, not in HTML. However, it may be difficult for some
sites to comply with the strict definition, either because their
authoring tools use tags that aren't allowed in the strict definition,
or because the site's authors want to use forbidden elements, such as
those for embedded Flash. To make the transition to strict HTML
easier, the standards allow for transitional HTML, which provides a
larger number of tags.
</p><p>
Let's define our tiny document as follows:


<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN"&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;This is the title&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;This is the headline&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is another paragraph&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
The &lt;!DOCTYPE&gt; declaration at the top of the page
tells browsers (and any other programs that might try to parse the
page) that we want to follow the standards, but that we'll do so using
the transitional declaration.
</p><p>
Once we have indicated our willingness to apply the transitional
standard, we may discover that our documents are no longer valid.
For example, if I include an image in my HTML document:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;img src="/images/foo.jpeg"&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
With the above line inserted into my document, it is no longer valid,
because it is missing an alt attribute. Once I add that attribute,
the document is valid:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;img src="/images/foo.jpeg" alt="foo"&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
However, we can get even better results if we enforce XML
considerations and declare our document to be XHTML transitional. To
do that, we modify not only the !DOCTYPE declaration, but also the
&lt;html&gt; tag:


<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;!DOCTYPE html
          PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN"
          "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"&gt;

&lt;html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xml:lang="en" lang="en"&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;This is the title&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;This is the headline&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is another paragraph&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;img src="/images/foo.jpeg" alt="foo"&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
Suddenly, our document is invalid again. Because we have declared it
to be XHTML transitional, we need to follow XML rules. We need to
close our &lt;img&gt; tag, most easily accomplished by using the
self-closing syntax:


<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;!DOCTYPE html
          PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN"
          "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"&gt;

&lt;html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xml:lang="en" lang="en"&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;This is the title&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;This is the headline&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is another paragraph&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;img src="/images/foo.jpeg" alt="foo" /&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
With that in place, our document is now valid. As you can imagine,
finding all the problems that might occur in a document can be
difficult, even for someone who is trained and experienced. Trying to
check all the pages on a site, particularly one that contains
hundreds or thousands of pages, clearly would be impossible.
</p><p>
The solution, then, is to have a program check the pages' validity
automatically, preferably as part of your automated tests. This way,
you can discover when you have problems quickly and easily.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xda5580.0xe9e010"></a>
W3C Validator</h2></div></div><p>
One of the best tools for checking the validity of a
page's markup is the World Wide Web Consortium's validator, available
at <a href="http://validator.w3.org" target="_self">validator.w3.org</a>. I use the validator
almost exclusively from within Firefox, into which I have installed
the Web Developer plugin. This plugin lets you validate the HTML of
any page, simply by selecting Validate HTML from the browser. The
browser submits the page's URL to the W3C validator, which then gives
a line-by-line indication of what problems (if any) the page
contains.
</p><p>
The W3C validator has at least two problems, however.
First, it requires that you submit each page, one at a time, to
the validator program. This means a great deal of time and effort,
just to check your pages. A second consideration is more practical;
the validator works only with pages that are accessible via the
Internet, without password protection. If your site is being
developed on your local computer, and if you have a firewall
protecting your business from the outside world, you 
probably will be unable to use the validator via the Web.
</p><p>
One solution to this problem is to install the W3C validator on your
local computer. You can get the source code from
<a href="http://validator.w3.org/source" target="_self">validator.w3.org/source</a>, which comes in the form of a Perl
program. On modern Debian and Ubuntu machines, you can install
w3c-markup-validator, which makes it available via your local Web
server, ready to be invoked.
</p><p>
If you end up installing the validator manually, it requires a number
of modules, which you might need to download from CPAN 
(Comprehensive Perl Archive Network), a large number of mirrors
containing open-source Perl modules. It might take some trial and
error to figure out which modules are necessary, although if you are an
experienced user of the CPAN.pm installer, this shouldn't be too much
trouble. Note that the SGML::Parser::OpenSP module requires the OpenSP
parser, which you can get from SourceForge at <a href="http://openjade.sf.net" target="_self">openjade.sf.net</a>.
</p><p>
As you might be able to tell, a number of these modules are required
in order to handle alternate encoding schemes, particularly those for
Asian languages. Even if you aren't planning to handle such
languages, the modules are mandatory and must be installed.
</p><p>
The validator program, called check, should be put in a directory
for CGI programs or in a directory handled by mod_perl, the Apache
plugin that lets you run Perl programs at a higher speed, among other
things. You also will need to install a configuration file, typically
placed in the directory /etc/w3c, but which you can relocate by
setting the W3C_VALIDATOR_CFG environment variable.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xda5580.0xe9e3d8"></a>
Validating Rails Templates</h2></div></div><p>
Now that you have the W3C checker installed on your own server, you
can feed it URLs that aren't open to the public. But, if you are
developing an application in Ruby on Rails, you can go one step better
than this, integrating the W3C validator into your automated testing.
</p><p>
In order to do this, you need to install the html_test plugin for
Rails. Go into your Rails application's root directory, and type:

<pre     class="programlisting">
script/plugin install 
 &#8618;http://htmltest.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/html_test
</pre>
</p><p>
With this plugin in place, you now can use three new assertions in your
functional and integration tests: assert_w3c returns true if the W3C
validator approves of your HTML; assert_tidy returns true if you're
using the HTML Tidy library, described below; and, assert_validates
calls both of these.
</p><p>
So, if you have a FAQ page you want to check with an integration test,
you can write something like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
def test_faq
 get '/faq'
 assert_response :success
 assert_w3c
end
</pre>
</p><p>
If the HTML for this page is approved by the W3C validator,
everything is fine. If this page is not valid, you will get
quite a bit of output, which you should redirect to a file. This file
will contain not only the results of your tests, but also the same
HTML output that you would have gotten from the public, Web-based W3C
validator. This means you'll get a complete and easy-to-read
description of what you did wrong.
</p><p>
You'll often discover that a large number of validation errors can be
fixed with a small number of corrections. For example, when I ran
this test against a sloppy FAQ page, I got six validation errors. I
was able to fix all of them by indicating the appropriate namespace in
my &lt;html&gt; tag and removing an extraneous &lt;/p&gt; from the end of the
file.
</p><p>
Checking HTML validity in this way is nice and easy. (It can be
time consuming, however, to invoke the validator on every single page;
I think the trade-off is worthwhile, but you might disagree.) If
you always want to check HTML validity, you can change your test
environment's configuration somewhat, so that it'll happen
automatically, without having to invoke assert_w3c each time.
</p><p>
To do this, you need to modify test_helper.rb, which sits at the top
of the test directory, and which is included into every test
program. All you have to do is add:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ApplicationController.validate_all = true
ApplicationController.validators = [:w3c]
</pre>
</p><p>
You also can check the validity of URLs and redirects; although these
aren't checking HTML validity per se, they do come with the html_test
plugin and are quite useful:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ApplicationController.check_urls = true
ApplicationController.check_redirects = true
</pre>
</p><p>
With these four lines in your test_helper.rb, you can run
your integration tests once again. If any of the validation tests fail, you can
look at /tmp/w3c_last_response.html, which will contain the complete
output of that failure. This doesn't help very much if you have
multiple failures, however.
</p><p>
If you have designed your templates using the DRY (don't repeat
yourself) principle, fixing HTML markup problems shouldn't be
too bad. In many cases, you will need to change only one tag in the
layout to fix everything.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xda5580.0xe9e9b0"></a>
HTML Tidy</h2></div></div><p>
The W3C validator is excellent, but it doesn't always catch everything,
such as empty tags. For this, you might want to add to your arsenal,
integrating the open-source Tidy library, which identifies and fixes
badly written HTML. Tidy originally was written by Dave Raggett, one
of the best-known developers from the early days of the Web; the
project is now on SourceForge at <a href="http://tidy.sf.net" target="_self">tidy.sf.net</a>.
</p><p>
To integrate Tidy checking into your Rails application, first install
the library from SourceForge. Then, install the Ruby gem for Tidy
integration:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo gem install tidy
</pre>
</p><p>
Finally, download and install the Rails Tidy plugin:


<pre     class="programlisting">
cd vendor/plugins
wget
http://www.cosinux.org/~dam/projects/rails-tidy/rails_tidy-0.3.tar.bz2
tar -jxvf rails_tidy-0.3.tar.bz2
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, modify test_helper to read:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ApplicationController.validators = [:w3c, :tidy]
</pre>
</p><p>
With that in place, every request to your server now will be checked by
both validators, rather than just one.
</p><p>
The Rails Tidy plugin can be useful beyond checking and validating to
fix your HTML as it is sent from your server to the user's
browser.
Although I like this idea in theory, it seems fairly inefficient and slow
to parse and rewrite every bit of HTML as it is sent. Plus, I feel
that debugging Web applications (and CSS) is tough enough without
having the HTML magically rewritten behind the scenes.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xda5580.0xe95710"></a>
Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
HTML has evolved quite a bit over the years, and getting your pages to
contain valid HTML can be difficult to handle manually. For this
reason, using automated checks and integrating those checks into a
Web application's automated settings is a good way to ensure that
your site is adhering to HTML standards as closely as possible. This
not only gives you the greatest chance of having the site render
similarly on different platforms, but it also even may boost your ranking in
Google (an assertion I have seen mentioned in several places, but
for which I obviously have no proof).
</p><p>
If you are using Ruby on Rails, you can validate your HTML
easily from the start of your project. By doing so, you will make life
easier for yourself down the line. Moreover, this is far easier than
checking pages manually, and it ensures that even administrative and
other hidden pages are validated.
