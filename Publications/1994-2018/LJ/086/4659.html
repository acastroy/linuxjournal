    A feature added to the kernel with the 2.2 release, this LSF can be
    programmed to let the kernel decide to which packets access should be
    granted. Here's how.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23ef580.0x24e75b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>If you deal with network administration
or security management, or if you are merely curious about what is
passing by over your local network, grabbing some packets off the
network card can be a useful exercise. With a little bit of C
coding and a basic knowledge of networking, you will be able to
capture data even if it is not addressed to your machine. In this
article, we will refer to Ethernet networks, by far the most
widespread LAN technology. Also, for reasons that will be explained
later, we will assume that source and destination hosts belong to
the same LAN.
</p><p>First off, we will briefly recall how a common Ethernet
network card works. Those of you who are already skilled in this
field may safely skip to the next paragraph. IP packets sourced
from users' applications are encapsulated into Ethernet frames
(this is the name given to packets when sent over an Ethernet
segment), which are just bigger lower-level packets containing the
original IP packet and some information needed to carry it to its
destination (see Figure 1). In particular, the destination IP
address is mapped to a 6-byte destination Ethernet address (often
called MAC address) through a mechanism called ARP. Thus, the frame
containing the packet travels from the source host to the
destination host over the cable that connects them. It is likely
that the frame will go through network devices such as hubs and
switches, but since we assumed no LAN borders are crossed, no
routers or gateways will be involved.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4659f1.large.jpg"><img src="4659f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. IP Packets as Ethernet Frames
</p></div></div><p>No routing process happens at the Ethernet level. In other
words, the frame sent by the source host will not be headed
directly toward the destination host; instead, the frame will be
copied over all the cables that make up the LAN, and all the
network cards will see it passing (see Figure 2). Each network card
will start reading the first six bytes of the frame (which happen
to contain the above-mentioned destination MAC addresses), but only
one card will recognize its own address in the destination field
and will pick up the frame. At this point, the frame will be taken
apart by the network driver and the original IP packet will be
recovered and passed up to the receiving application through the
network protocol stack.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4659f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Sending Ethernet Frames over the LAN
</p></div></div><p>More precisely, the network driver will have a look at the
Protocol Type field inside the Ethernet frame header (see Figure 1)
and, based on that value, forward the packet to the appropriate
protocol receiving function. Most of the time the protocol will be
IP, and the receiving function will take off the IP header and pass
the payload up to the UDP- or TCP-receiving functions. These
protocols, in turn, will pass it to the socket-handling functions,
which will eventually deliver packet data to the receiving
application in userland. During this trip, the packet loses all
network information related to it, such as the source addresses (IP
and MAC) and port, IP options, TCP parameters and so on.
Furthermore, if the destination host does not have an open socket
with the correct parameters, the packet will be discarded and never
make it to the application level.</p><p>As a consequence, we have two distinct issues in sniffing
packets over the network. One is related to Ethernet addressing&mdash;we
cannot read packets that are not destined to our host; the other is
related to protocol stack processing&mdash;in order for the packet not
to be discarded, we should have a listening socket for each and
every port. Furthermore, part of the packet information is lost
during protocol stack processing.</p><p>The first issue is not fundamental, since we may not be
interested in other hosts' packets and may tend to sniff all the
packets directed to our machine. The second one, however, must be
solved. We will see how to address these issues separately,
starting with the latter.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23ef580.0x24e7be0"></a>The PF_PACKET Protocol</h2></div></div><p>When you open a socket with the standard call <b  >sock =
socket(domain, type, protocol)</b> you have to specify which
domain (or protocol family) you are going to use with that socket.
Commonly used families are PF_UNIX, for communications bounded on
the local machine, and PF_INET, for communications based on IPv4
protocols. Furthermore, you have to specify a type for your socket
and possible values depend on the family you specified. Common
values for type, when dealing with the PF_INET family, include
SOCK_STREAM (typically associated with TCP) and SOCK_DGRAM
(associated with UDP). Socket types influence how packets are
handled by the kernel before being passed up to the application.
Finally, you specify the protocol that will handle the packets
flowing through the socket (more details on this can be found on
the socket(3) man page).</p><p>In recent versions of the Linux kernel (post-2.0 releases) a
new protocol family has been introduced, named PF_PACKET. This
family allows an application to send and receive packets dealing
directly with the network card driver, thus avoiding the usual
protocol stack-handling (e.g., IP/TCP or IP/UDP processing). That
is, any packet sent through the socket will be directly passed to
the Ethernet interface, and any packet received through the
interface will be directly passed to the application.</p><p>The PF_PACKET family supports two slightly different socket
types, SOCK_DGRAM and SOCK_RAW. The former leaves to the kernel the
burden of adding and removing Ethernet level headers. The latter
gives the application complete control over the Ethernet header.
The protocol field in the socket() call must match one of the
Ethernet IDs defined in /usr/include/linux/if_ether.h, which
represents the registered protocols that can be shipped in an
Ethernet frame. Unless dealing with very specific protocols, you
typically use ETH_P_IP, which encompasses all of the IP-suite
protocols (e.g., TCP, UDP, ICMP, raw IP and so on).</p><p>Since they have pretty serious security implications (for
example, you may forge a frame with a spoofed MAC address),
PF_PACKET-family sockets may only be used by root.</p><p>The PF_PACKET family easily solves the problem associated
with protocol stack-handling of our sniffed packets. Let's see it
do so with the example in Listing 1. We open a socket belonging to
the PF_PACKET family, specifying a SOCK_RAW socket type and
IP-related protocol type. Then we start reading from the socket
and, after a few sanity checks, we print out some information
extracted from the Ethernet level and IP level headers. By
cross-checking the printed addresses with the offsets in Figure 1,
you will see how easy it is for the application to get access to
network level data.</p><p><a href="4659l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1. Protocol Stack-Handling
Sniffed Packets</a></p><p>Assuming that your machine is connected to an Ethernet LAN,
you can experiment with our short example by running it while
generating packets directed to your host from another machine (you
can <span   class="bold"><b>ping</b></span> or Telnet to your host).
You will be able to see all the packets directed to you, but you
will not see any packet headed toward other hosts.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23ef580.0x24e8000"></a>Promiscuous vs. Nonpromiscuous Mode</h2></div></div><p>The PF_PACKET family allows an application to retrieve data
packets as they are received at the network card level, but still
does not allow it to read packets that are not addressed to its
host. As we have seen before, this is due to the network card
discarding all the packets that do not contain its own MAC
address&mdash;an operation mode called nonpromiscuous, which basically
means that each network card is minding its own business and
reading only the frames directed to it. There are three exceptions
to this rule: a frame whose destination MAC address is the special
broadcast address (FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF) will be picked up by any
card; a frame whose destination MAC address is a multicast address
will be picked up by cards that have multicast reception enabled
and a card that has been set in promiscuous mode will pick up all
the packets it sees.</p><p>The last case is, of course, the most interesting one for our
purposes. To set a network card to promiscuous mode, all we have to
do is issue a particular ioctl() call to an open socket on that
card. Since this is a potentially security-threatening operation,
the call is only allowed for the root user. Supposing that &ldquo;sock&rdquo;
contains an already open socket, the following instructions will do
the trick:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
strncpy(ethreq.ifr_name,"eth0",IFNAMSIZ);
ioctl(sock, SIOCGIFFLAGS, &amp;ethreq);
ethreq.ifr_flags |= IFF_PROMISC;
ioctl(sock, SIOCSIFFLAGS, &amp;ethreq);
</pre><p>(where ethreq is an ifreq structure, defined in
/usr/include/net/if.h). The first ioctl reads the current value of
the Ethernet card flags; the flags are then ORed with IFF_PROMISC,
which enables promiscuous mode and are written back to the card
with the second ioctl.
</p><p>Let's see it in a more complete example (see Listing 2 at
<a href="../listings/086/" target="_self">ftp://ftp.linuxjournal.com/pub/lj/listings/issue86/</a>).
If you compile and run it as root on a machine connected to a LAN,
you will be able to see all the packets flowing on the cable, even
if they are not for your host. This is because your network card is
now working in promiscuous mode. You can easily check it out by
giving the <span   class="bold"><b>ifconfig</b></span> command and
observing the third line in the output.</p><p>Note that if your LAN uses Ethernet switches instead of hubs,
you will see only packets flowing in the switch's branch you belong
to. This is due to the way switches work, and there is very little
you can do about it (except for deceiving the switch with MAC
address-spoofing, which is outside the scope of this article). For
more information on hubs and switches, please have a look at the
articles cited in the Resources section.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23ef580.0x24e8370"></a>The Linux Packet Filter</h2></div></div><p>All our sniffing problems seem to be solved right now, but
there is still one important thing to consider: if you actually
tried the example in Listing 2, and if your LAN serves even a
modest amount of traffic (a couple of Windows hosts will be enough
to waste some bandwidth with a good number of NETBIOS packets), you
will have noticed our sniffer prints out too much data. As network
traffic increases, the sniffer will start losing packets since the
PC will not be able to process them quickly enough.</p><p>The solution to this problem is to filter the packets you
receive, and print out information only on those you are interested
in. One idea would be to insert an &ldquo;if statement&rdquo; in the
sniffer's source; this would help polish the output of the sniffer,
but it would not be very efficient in terms of performance. The
kernel would still pull up all the packets flowing on the network,
thus wasting processing time, and the sniffer would still examine
each packet header to decide whether to print out the related data
or not.</p><p>The optimal solution to this problem is to put the filter as
early as possible in the packet-processing chain (it starts at the
network driver level and ends at the application level, see Figure
3). The Linux kernel allows us to put a filter, called an LPF,
directly inside the PF_PACKET protocol-processing routines, which
are run shortly after the network card reception interrupt has been
served. The filter decides which packets shall be relayed to the
application and which ones should be discarded.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4659f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Packet-Processing Chain
</p></div></div><p>In order to be as flexible as possible, and not to limit the
programmer to a set of predefined conditions, the packet-filtering
engine is actually implemented as a state machine running a
user-defined program. The program is written in a specific
pseudo-machine code language called BPF (for Berkeley packet
filter), inspired by an old paper written by Steve McCanne and Van
Jacobson (see Resources). BPF actually looks like a real assembly
language with a couple of registers and a few instructions to load
and store values, perform arithmetic operations and conditionally
branch.</p><p>The filter code is run on each packet to be examined, and the
memory space into which the BPF processor operates are the bytes
containing the packet data. The result of the filter is an integer
number that specifies how many bytes of the packet (if any) the
socket should pass to the application level. This is a further
advantage, since often you are interested in just the first few
bytes of a packet, and you can spare processing time by avoiding
copying the excess ones.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23ef580.0x24e8790"></a>(Not) Programming the Filter</h2></div></div><p>Even if the BPF language is pretty simple and easy to learn,
most of us would probably be more comfortable with filters written
in human-readable expressions. So, instead of presenting the
details and instructions of the BPF language (which you can find in
the above-mentioned paper), we will discuss how to obtain the code
for a working filter starting from a logic expression.</p><p>First, you will need to install the
<span   class="bold"><b>tcpdump</b></span> program from LBL (see
Resources). But, if you are reading this article, it is likely that
you already know and use tcpdump. The first versions were written
by the same people who wrote the BPF paper and its first
implementation. In fact, tcpdump uses BPF, in the form of a library
called libpcap, to capture and filter packets. The library is an
OS-independent wrapper for the BPF engine. When used on Linux
machines, BPF functions are carried out by the Linux packet
filter.</p><p>One of the most useful functions provided by the libpcap is
pcap_compile(), which takes a string containing a logic expression
as input and outputs the BPF filter code. tcpdump uses this
function to translate the command-line expression passed by the
user into a working BPF filter. What is interesting for our
purposes is that tcpdump has a seldomly used switch, -d, which
prints the code of the filter.</p><p>For example, typing <b  >tcpdump host
192.168.9.10</b> will start sniffing and grab only those
packets whose source or destination IP address matches
192.168.9.10. Typing <b  >tcpdump -d host
192.168.9.10</b> will print the BPF code that recognizes the
filter, as shown in Listing 3.</p><p><a href="4659l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3. Tcpdump -d
Results</a></p><p>Let's briefly comment on this code; lines 0-1 and 6-7 verify
that the captured frame is actually transporting IP, ARP or RARP
protocols by comparing their protocol IDs (see
/usr/include/linux/if_ether.h) with the value found at offset 12 in
the frame (see Figure 1). If the test fails, the packet is
discarded (line 13).</p><p>Lines 2-5 and 8-11 compare the source and destination IP
addresses with 192.168.9.10. Note that, depending on the protocol,
the offsets of these addresses are different; if the protocol is
IP, they are 26 and 30, otherwise they are 28 and 38. If one of the
addresses matches, the packet is accepted by the filter, and the
first 68 bytes are passed to the application (line 12).</p><p>The filter code is not always optimized, since it is
generated for a generic BPF machine and not tailored to the
specific architecture that runs the filter engine. In the
particular case of the LPF, the filter is run by the PF_PACKET
processing routines, which may have already checked the Ethernet
protocol. This depends on the protocol field you specified in the
initial socket() call: if it is not ETH_P_ALL (which means that
every Ethernet frame shall be captured), then only frames having
the specified Ethernet protocol will arrive at the filter. For
example, in the case of an ETH_P_IP socket, we could rewrite a
faster and more compact filter as follows:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
(000) ld       [26]
(001) jeq      #0xc0a8090a      jt 4    jf 2
(002) ld       [30]
(003) jeq      #0xc0a8090a      jt 4    jf 5
(004) ret      #68
(005) ret      #0
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23ef580.0x24e8cb8"></a>Installing the Filter</h2></div></div><p>Installing an LPF is a straightforward operation: all you
have to do is create a sock_filter structure containing the filter
and attach it to an open socket.</p><p>The filter structure is easily obtained by substituting the
-d switch to tcpdump with -dd. The filter will be printed as a C
array that you can copy and paste into your code, as shown in
Listing 4. Afterward, you attach the filter to the socket by simply
issuing a setsockopt() call.</p><p><a href="4659l4.html" target="_self">Listing 4. Tcpdump with --dd
Switch</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23ef580.0x24df758"></a>A Complete Example</h2></div></div><p>We will conclude this article with a complete example (see
Listing 5 at
<a href="../listings/086/" target="_self">ftp://ftp.linuxjournal.com/pub/lj/listings/issue86/</a>).
It is exactly like the first two examples, with the addition of the
LSF code and the setsockopt() call. The filter has been configured
to select only UDP packets, having either source or destination IP
address 192.168.9.10 and source UDP port equal to 5000.</p><p>In order to test this listing, you will need a simple way to
generate arbitrary UDP packets (such as sendip or apsend, found on
<a href="http://freshmeat.net" target="_self">http://freshmeat.net/</a>).
Also, you may want to adapt the IP address to match the ones used
in your own LAN. To accomplish this, just substitute 0xc0a8090a in
the filter code with the IP address of your choice in hex
notation.</p><p>A final remark concerns the status of the Ethernet card when
you exit the program. Since we did not reset the Ethernet flags,
the card will remain in promiscuous mode. To solve this problem,
all you need to do is install a Control-C (SIGINT) signal handler
that resets the Ethernet flags to their previous value (which you
will have saved just before ORing with IFF_PROMISC) before exiting
the program.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23ef580.0x24df9c0"></a>Conclusions</h2></div></div><p>Sniffing packets over your LAN is an invaluable tool for
debugging network problems or collecting measurements. Sometimes
the commonly available tools, such as tcpdump or
<span   class="bold"><b>ethereal</b></span>, will not exactly fit
your needs and writing your own sniffer can be of great help.
Thanks to the LPF, you can do this in a simple and efficient
way.</p><p><a href="4659s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
