    Falling component prices and decreasing demand will benefit
    consumers.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x151d580.0x1615608"></a></h2></div></div><p> The downturn in the economy has eroded
demand for PCs and other high-tech gadgets. This erosion has hurt
revenues and earnings at most semiconductor companies, but their
pain will ultimately be your gain. Falling prices will spur demand
for webpads, hard-disk video recorders, digital cameras, MP3
players and similar devices, many of which use Linux.
</p><p>The chip industry has gone through several boom and bust
cycles, and the current situation is just another down cycle. The
problem is that building a new chip factory, or fab, costs upward
of $1 billion and takes about two years from site selection to
volume production.</p><p>During periods of high demand, such as last year,
semiconductor companies can't add capacity quickly enough. This
results in shortages and high component prices. With cash in hand,
the companies madly invest in new capacity, but today we see that
increasing capacity meeting falling demand.</p><p>Basic economics tells us that prices will fall. Indeed, DRAM
prices have dropped by 50% over the past six months, as have the
prices of flat-panel (LCD) displays. The prices of Flash memory and
other components are also sagging. I wouldn't be surprised if, by
the end of this year, some components cost a quarter of what they
did last year.</p><p>These lower prices will benefit many emerging products. For
example, webpads have yet to get off the ground. Only a few
companies are selling them and generally at prices in excess of
$1,000 US. The culprit is the cost of the flat-panel display, which
has been several hundred dollars.</p><p>With display prices collapsing, vendors will be able to
deploy webpads for much less than $1,000, perhaps as low as $500. I
have no doubt an early-adopter market will spring up at these
prices, and that market will grow as prices continue to drop. Most
of the webpads announced to date combine Transmeta's Crusoe chip
with Linux, delivering web compatibility without Windows.</p><p>TiVo's ground-breaking video recorder, which stores TV
programs on a hard disk instead of videotape, has received critical
acclaim but has only sold about 200,000 units. These low sales are
due in part to the high cost of the unit, $500 or more (including
the cost of the service). When TiVo launched last year, the price
of a 30GB hard drive was about $300. Today, the same hard drive
costs less than $100. The price of DRAM and other components in the
system has fallen as well. Watch for TiVo to take advantage of
these changes by dropping the price of its Linux-based recorder.
With lower prices, more people will buy the TiVo system to take
control of when they watch their favorite TV shows.</p><p>Like the TiVo system, an MP3 jukebox is primarily a simple
computer wrapped around a large hard drive. These jukeboxes connect
directly to home stereo systems and are just becoming available.
But prices, such as $799 for the AudioReQuest, have inhibited
demand. Falling component prices, however, should make these
systems more popular. SonicBlue (which produces the Rio line of MP3
systems), Kerbango and others all use Linux to power their MP3
jukeboxes.</p><p>The bulk of the cost of a portable MP3 player is its Flash
memory. The 64MB of Flash found in a $250 player cost about $120 at
last year's prices. Even that amount of memory holds only 1-2 hours
of music (depending on the quality and file type), barely enough to
be useful. With lower Flash prices, we'll see low-end players
approaching $100 and players with 128MB or more of memory selling
for less than $300.</p><p>These MP3 systems will continue to grow in popularity despite
the demise of Napster because they allow users to digitize their
music collection and take it with them wherever they go. Users can
easily find favorite songs, delete unwanted songs and create custom
playlists. Linux can play a key role in networking a user's MP3
systems to enable seamless music portability.</p><p>Unfortunately, falling chip prices won't help PC sales. At
$399, PCs are already as inexpensive as they can be without
removing key components. Therefore, PC makers will take advantage
of lower chip costs to offer faster processors, more DRAM and more
disk capacity at the same price.</p><p>Some people may be attracted to better PCs at the same price,
but a bigger problem will be convincing most PC users they need a
better system. Most current PCs are fine for e-mail, web browsing
and word processing. But the increasing popularity of digital
video, digital photos and digital audio will drive the next PC
upgrade cycle.</p><p>Despite the gloom in the industry, technology has not
suddenly become a bad idea. The Internet continues to fundamentally
change everything we do, and the trend toward digital media is
revolutionizing personal entertainment. With chip prices down 50%
to 75%, these trends will pick up speed.</p></div></div>
