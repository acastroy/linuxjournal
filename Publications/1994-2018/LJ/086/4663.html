    Reduce costs and improve productivity with easy-to-install
    diskless workstations.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcaa580.0xda2710"></a></h2></div></div><p>The Open Source movement can help many
people and institutions in Latin America by giving them access to
technologies and knowledge that are otherwise restricted to
developed countries. The lack of economic resources, proper
infrastructure and technical education for the vast majority of the
population are the main reasons why Latin America is far behind the
first world in the use of computer technology, and they have
prevented it from reaping the benefits of the information
revolution the Internet has created. For example, less than 10% of
the population of Colombia (estimated at 40 million) has ever
logged on the Internet. This is not an exception, and most
countries in the region suffer from similar problems. By using
cost-effective, easy-to-implement, open-source technology and free
software, these countries can catch up with the industrialized
world.
</p><p>There is an open-source project that could make a huge
difference in Latin America: the Linux Terminal Server Project or
LTSP
(<a href="http://www.ltsp.org" target="_self">http://www.ltsp.org/</a>).
The appeal of this project is that it provides an easy way to set
up low-cost, diskless workstations that boot from a network server
running Linux. Today, many public and private Latin American
institutions can hardly afford new computers or expensive software
license fees. By using diskless workstations and Linux, they can
save large amounts of money and become much more productive. This
technology may also be used to teach children and workers the
technical skills they require for the future.</p><p>In this article I will discuss the LTSP, describe my
experiences with it in a small institution in Colombia and examine
what is needed to implement and configure it. This article is
merely informative, and it's not intended to be an LTSP HOWTO.
Precise installation and configuration instructions can be found at
the project's web site
(<a href="http://www.ltsp.org/documentation" target="_self">http://www.ltsp.org/documentation/</a>).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcaa580.0xda2978"></a>What Is the Linux Terminal Server Project
(LTSP)?</h2></div></div><p>The goal of LTSP is to create a simplified way of setting up
diskless workstations for Linux. By definition, a diskless
workstation is a computer that boots after downloading its
operating system from a server on the local area network. The LTSP
tools accomplish this process by adding small kernel images,
XFree86 servers and several other network tools to the server that
will pass them to the workstation on request. The diskless
workstation only needs a boot ROM for its specific network card in
order to obtain the necessary software from the server. Making good
use of the open-source software from the Etherboot Project
(<a href="http://etherboot.sourceforge.net" target="_self">http://etherboot.sourceforge.net/</a>),
the LTSP has created its own boot ROMs and employs them with its
software. Understanding that building (burning) a boot ROM for a
network card may be a difficult task, a company close to the
project, Diskless Workstations
(<a href="http://www.DisklessWorkstations.com" target="_self">http://www.DisklessWorkstations.com/</a>),
offers preconfigured ones for a small price at their web site. It's
worth noticing that LTSP's boot ROMs can also be written to a
floppy disk from which the diskless workstation can boot.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcaa580.0xda2b30"></a>Our Experiences with the LTSP</h2></div></div><p>I started implementing diskless workstations based on the
LTSP tools last year, when a small association of sugar cane
industry workers needed a low-cost, easy-to-use computer and
information management solution for their headquarters. The
company, Productivos Ltda., had a very tight budget, and its office
workers were not particularly familiar with computers and software.
They had only one computer running Windows 95 with an unlicensed
version of MS Office to handle letters, accounting and payroll.
Most of the office work was still carried out manually. The new
manager of the association wanted to buy five more computers to
cope with all the work more efficiently. She also wanted a local
area network so people could share files and printers and have
access to the Internet. While looking on the Net for a low-cost
solution to their problem, I came across the LTSP. The solution was
at hand. Productivos Ltda. did not have to buy expensive,
state-of-the-art computers or pay for costly software license fees.
They were going to have an LTSP network and use StarOffice as their
productivity tool.</p><p>A test of the LTSP software was conducted before the actual
installation, using an old diskless Pentium computer and booting
from a floppy disk. After a few tweaks that included the correct
setting of the international keymaps under X, I decided this was
the perfect solution for Productivos Ltda.</p><p>The association bought four new AMD K6 class diskless
computers with 32MB RAM each (the lowest configuration available)
to act as diskless workstations and a PII 350MHz with 128MB RAM to
act as server/workstation. Even though this looks like a normal
configuration for many small offices, Productivos' budget would
have normally been able to afford fewer computers under other
circumstances (i.e., a Windows network). Just in software license
fees, Productivos Ltda. saved around $3,000 US. To avoid booting
from floppy disks, the workstations needed bootable network cards.
Four Linksys 10/100Mb bootable network cards were bought directly
from DisklessWorkstations at $34 US each. A matching 8-port Linksys
10/100Mb hub was acquired from Outpost.com
(<a href="http://outpost.com" target="_self">http://outpost.com/</a>). The
required UTP Level 5 cabling was ready in less than a week. The hub
and cabling both cost around $350 US.</p><p>Red Hat 6.2
(<a href="http://www.redhat.com" target="_self">http://www.redhat.com/</a>)
was the distribution of choice for the server because it had been
fully tested, and it's easy to configure and maintain. Since all
the diskless workstations were going to run X and StarOffice 5.2
(<a href="http://www.sun.com/staroffice" target="_self">http://www.sun.com/staroffice/</a>)
remotely, we decided to stay away from memory-intensive GUIs like
GNOME or KDE that would reduce the server's performance. We chose
to use a window manager with the basic functions only (start bar
and menus) and selected IceWM
(<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/icewm" target="_self">http://sourceforge.net/projects/icewm/</a>),
the lightest window manager around. Only a couple of entries from
IceWM's main configuration files (menu, winoptions) were added or
deleted to fit the configuration we wanted. Ten different user IDs
were created on the server, each with its own StarOffice
workstation installation. It's worth noting that StarOffice is a
memory-intensive application, another reason why we chose a light
window manager instead of GNOME or KDE. The installation of
printers was quite simple. A replacement for Red Hat's print tool
that adds an LTSP printer to the options is part of the project's
software. Now the new LTSP network was ready. The entire
installation and configuration was completed in just one
day.</p><p>The test by fire came when the users logged on the network.
They were enthusiastic about the fact that they now had computers
to help them with their work. Nevertheless, they needed some
training before actually using the computers. All the users went
through a two-week in-house training course to familiarize
themselves with the new tools available. The training included
computer basics and the uses of StarOffice. At the end of the
course they were all working without problems and using their
diskless workstations for their (previously manual) tasks.</p><p>The association's LTSP network has been running smoothly for
more than a year now, and they are even planning to add some more
diskless workstations. Productivos Ltda. became much more efficient
and, at the same time, gave its workers the chance to learn and
explore new technologies. All of this would have been difficult
without the help of the LTSP and the Open Source movement.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcaa580.0xda2f50"></a>What You Need to Make It Work</h2></div></div><p>System requirements for an LTSP network vary depending on the
number of concurrent diskless workstations accessing the server and
the applications they will be running. The two most important
things to consider here are the server's available memory and the
speed of the network. Even though a 10Mb network can handle a large
number of diskless workstations running console-based applications,
a faster (100Mb) network is required if the workstations are to run
remote X sessions and productivity applications like StarOffice.
The minimum server configuration for an LTSP network is a
Pentium-class computer with at least 64MB RAM and a 2GB hard drive.
On the workstation side, a 486 or K5 computer with 16MB RAM and a
1MB video card (for X) can get the work done.</p><p>The whole LTSP network operation depends on the good
condition of network cards, hubs and cabling to run properly and
smoothly. Please be sure to check them prior to any
installation.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcaa580.0xda30b0"></a>The Software</h2></div></div><p>LTSP tools currently run on the following Linux
distributions:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Red Hat 6.0, 6.1, 6.2 and 7.0</p></li><li><p>Mandrake 7.2</p></li><li><p>SuSE 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 7.1 and 7.2-beta</p></li><li><p>Debian 2.0, 2.1 and 2.2</p></li><li><p>Caldera eDesktop 2.3, 2.4 and eServer 2.3</p></li></ul></div><p>All the software and documentation needed to run an LTSP
network can be obtained from the download section of their web
site,
<a href="http://www.ltsp.org" target="_self">http://www.ltsp.org/</a>. The
necessary precompiled packages come in both RPM and TGZ formats.
Remember to read the documentation before attempting to install the
software and scripts.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcaa580.0xda3630"></a>Quick Installation Guide (Extracted from the
LTSP Installation Guide)</h2></div></div><p>The Quick Installation requires that your installation meets
the following criteria:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>You are installing on a Red Hat 6.0, 6.1, 6.2 or
7.0-based system or a Mandrake 7.2-based system.</p></li><li><p>The server will have an IP address of
192.168.0.254.</p></li><li><p>The workstations will have addresses in the range
of 192.168.0.1 through 192.168.0.253.</p></li><li><p>Applications will run on the server, displaying
output on the workstations.</p></li><li><p>You are using DHCP.</p></li></ul></div><p>Download the LTSP RPM packages from the LTSP download site,
<a href="http://www.ltsp.org" target="_self">http://www.ltsp.org/</a>.
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>lts_core-2.xx-xx.i386.rpm&mdash;the Core LTSP package,
which contains the root filesystem, configuration utilities and
documentation for the workstations.</p></li><li><p>lts_kernel_xxxx-2.xx-xx.i386.rpm&mdash;precompiled
kernels for diskless booting. Choose the appropriate kernel for the
network card of the diskless workstation.</p></li><li><p>lts_xxxx-2.xx-xx.i386.rpm&mdash;precompiled X servers.
Choose the appropriate X server for the video card of the diskless
workstation.</p></li></ul></div>

Install the rpm -i lts_core-2.xx-xx.i386.rpm, rpm -i
lts_kernel_xxxx-2.xx-xx.i386.rpm and rpm -i
lts_xxxx-2.xx-xx.i386.rpm packages.
</p><p>Verify that <span   class="bold"><b>dhcpd</b></span> is
installed on the server. Run the following command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
rpm -qa | grep dhcp
</pre><p>It should report a line like:
<pre     class="programlisting">
dhcp-2.0-5
</pre>


If it doesn't, then you need to load the DHCP RPM from the Red Hat
installation CD.
</p><p>Once the installation of the above packages is complete, you
need to move to the /tftpboot/lts/templates directory. Several
files there will configure the system files on your server. Each
one of these files is responsible for one system file. Take a look
at those files, and make sure you agree with what they are going to
do. They can potentially make your system vulnerable to intrusion.
You may wish to make changes to the system files manually. If you
want to do it automatically, then run the
<span   class="bold"><b>ltsp_initialize</b></span> command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cd /tftpboot/lts/templates
./ltsp_initialize
</pre><p>Copy the /etc/dhcpd.conf.example file to /etc/dhcpd.conf.
Modify the dhcpd.conf file to include the MAC address of the
network card in the workstation. Then, add the following line to
the /etc/hosts file:
<pre     class="programlisting">
192.168.0.1    ws001
</pre>


You should next edit the /tftpboot/lts/ltsroot/etc/lts.conf file to
make sure the entries are correct for the workstation. Then reboot
the server and turn on the workstation. You should get a graphical
login prompt on the workstation. You can log in using any user ID
available on the server.
</p><p>As you can see, installation of an LTSP network is
straightforward, and it can be up and running in a few minutes.
Don't forget to follow the instructions carefully, and if you have
any difficulties, read the troubleshooting section of the
documentation. The project's mailing list is also a good source for
solving problems, finding out about new software developments and
learning from other users' experiences.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcaa580.0xd9aa70"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>Some important features elevate the stature of this
open-source project: its up-to-date documentation, which guides the
user through the entire installation; configuration and
troubleshooting process; the project's contributions area where
people have added their own enhancements to the software, including
support for things such as LDAP and dynamic DNS; and its very
active mailing list, where most of the questions are swiftly
answered by the developers themselves.</p><p>The LTSP is now part of SourceForge&mdash;good news for users and
developers alike. Many new contributions and enhancements to the
software are sure to come in the near future, making LTSP the tool
of choice for many diskless workstation networks in Latin America
and the rest of the world. The recent appearance of a Red Hat-based
distribution by the K12 Project
(<a href="http://www.riverdale.k12.or.us/linux/k12ltsp.html" target="_self">www.riverdale.k12.or.us/linux/k12ltsp.html</a>)
includes software from the LTSP. That the K12 Project is aimed
mainly at schools and children is proof of the great advancement
and significance of the LTSP.</p><p>The project's documentation has been translated into Spanish
but not yet to other languages. We hope that the LTSP's affiliation
with SourceForge means many eager translators from different
countries will soon start contributing their work.</p><p>Since my first experience with the LTSP, I have had the
chance to implement its diskless workstations solution in several
environments, including public schools, internet caf&eacute;s and
small companies. To our satisfaction, all of those networks are
working smoothly today and most of the users have benefited from
the new technology. Maybe this is what the Open Source movement is
all about: helping people help themselves.</p><p>I'd like to thank Jim McQuillan (jam@McQuil.com) and his
friends for their outstanding contribution to the Open Source
movement, the development and maintenance of the Linux Terminal
Server Project.</p></div></div>
