    Robin continues to test video and audio players for Linux.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ce1580.0x1dd97c0"></a></h2></div></div><p>Last month we tried some MPEG players,
including aKtion, gmpeg, gxanim, MPlayer, plaympeg, XAnim, xine and
Xtheater. We also looked at the Be operating system in order to
compare its video capabilities with Linux.
</p><p>Our goal this month is to look at the AVI players aKtion,
Aviplay, MPlayer and XAnim. We will also capture some AVI files
using Video4Linux and XawTV or QtVidcap.</p><p>AVI (audio video interleave) is one of the most common
formats for video files on PCs. The AVI file format and the RIFF
format (resource interchange file format) generally, were defined
by Microsoft and IBM back when they were still friends. The
Microsoft audio WAV format is another variant of a RIFF file. The
RIFF format was based upon IFF, a format standard on the Amiga.
When seeking information about the AVI format, a good place to
start is John McGowan's &ldquo;AVI Overview&rdquo;, available at
<a href="http://www.jmcgowan.com/avi.html" target="_self">www.jmcgowan.com/avi.html</a>
or
<a href="http://www.faqs.org" target="_self">www.faqs.org</a>.</p><p>Internally, video files are chunks of interleaved pictures
and audio. To play a video, those chunks are read sequentially one
after the other by a video player and mixed together in a way that
makes them appear seamless. Typically, audio playback is the
reference and the video picture is synchronized to it. Variations
in audio playback rate would be discernible as wow and flutter, but
slight variations in video playback framerate are not
apparent.</p><p>Video file formats rely upon two easily confused concepts:
transports and codecs. A transport is the structure that describes
the chunks of audio and video that follow. AVI, MPEG and QuickTime
are all examples of transports. Within the transport, each
compressed chunk of video or audio must be read using a codec that
understands the particular scheme of that chunk. Examples of video
codecs include Cinepak and Indeo. AVI sound codecs may be PCM,
ADPCM, GSM or many others. If you have what seems to be a perfectly
good video file, but your video player only plays the video or
audio part, it is probably because you are missing a codec. Players
are designed to skip over things in the transport they don't
understand.</p><p>WMP (Windows Media Player) is the movie player included with
Windows. It uses installable codecs that work as plugins, called
dlls (dynamic link libraries). If you develop a new Windows codec,
your video or audio can play back in WMP. For Linux codec
developers, this means it is feasible to port your code to Windows
as a plugin, so that files created with open formats in Linux can
be viewed in the proprietary Windows player. Conversely, some Linux
video players are able to use Windows plugins and will play
proprietary Windows formats in otherwise open Linux players. It is
therefore possible to deliver a single plugin that will work for
both Linux and Windows, at least on Intel.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4698f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
The Windows Media Player
</p></div></div><p>AVI files identify their embedded codecs using a magic number
called a FOURCC code. This four-byte id is how the AVI transport
knows what codec to load in order to play a stream. To guarantee
uniqueness, the FOURCC must be registered with Microsoft. The
unofficial but &ldquo;Almost Definitive&rdquo; FOURCC Definition list is kept
at
<a href="http://www.webartz.com/fourcc" target="_self">http://www.webartz.com/fourcc/</a>
and provides a lot of good information.</p><p>It is widely believed that AVI files can't be larger than 2GB
or used for professional video applications, but that's not really
true. The main reason for the file-size limitation is that a RIFF
block uses a 32-bit integer to describe its size. You may hear this
alternately referred to as a 1GB limit because a bug in the early
Microsoft Video for Windows code made that (huge at the time) the
limit. Because an unsigned 32-bit integer can also contain 4GB, you
may see that number suggested as a maximum, too&mdash;4GB also happens
to be the limit for the FAT16 filesystem.</p><p>The original AVI file spec only permits one RIFF chunk per
file. The obvious fix to the size limit was to allow multiple RIFFs
in one file. At the urging of Matrox, that's what the Open Digital
Media (OpenDML) Consortium did when it created the OpenDML AVI file
format extensions. The spec is available from a link in McGowan's
AVI Overview. OpenDML AVI support has been reportedly contained in
Matrox's DigiSuite software and in Microsoft WMP since version
5.1.</p><p>Recently, AVI is losing steam to new formats available from
Microsoft; advanced streaming format (ASF) and later Windows Media
Format (WMF) were added in WMP 7. Microsoft has tested WMF files as
large as 30GB, but they can theoretically hold 17 million
terabytes. For audio files, the file extension is wma, for video,
wmv.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ce1580.0x1dd9ea0"></a>Some Video Players for Linux</h2></div></div><p>XawTV is a popular application for watching video on
Video4Linux devices. Video4Linux (V4L) enables many different video
capture cards to be used interchangeably in applications. Hauppauge
WinTV is one of the most popular inexpensive TV cards (less than
$70 US). Other comparable cards are based on the same Conexant
chipset (formerly Rockwell Brooktree).</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4698f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
The XawTV Video Player
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4698f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
The XawTV Config Screen
</p></div></div><p>Ralph and Marcus Metzler created the first bttv Linux driver
code to work with Brooktree BT848-based TV cards. Gerd Knorr
eventually took over development, creating the bttv-0.7.x series
drivers. He also created and continues to maintain XawTV. Alan Cox
developed a generic video architecture called Video4Linux that was
influenced by ideas in the OSS sound drivers. He developed V4L
around the bttv driver and brought it into the Linux kernel. The
original bttv driver is no longer supported and has been replaced
with the V4L version maintained by Justin Schoeman.</p><p>V4L2 is a substantial rewrite of the bttv driver for Linux.
According to Justin Schoeman's web page
(<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/bttv-v4l2" target="_self">http://sourceforge.net/projects/bttv-v4l2/</a>),
the aim of bttv-v4l2 is to support high performance video capture
on Bt848/878-based video capture cards. Bill Dirks is responsible
for the current development of the V4L version 2 architecture
(V4L2). He developed the capture API and made architectural changes
to better accommodate a variety of hardware devices. His web page,
<a href="http://www.thedirks.org/v4l2" target="_self">http://www.thedirks.org/v4l2/</a>,
has more information.</p><p>When building and installing the bttv driver (as we did in
this column in the April 2001 issue of <i  >LJ</i>), we
encountered something called the i2c driver. This perplexed us at
the time because we couldn't get it to work, and none of the V4L
web pages say what it does. Looking more closely at Gerd Knorr's
web site, we noticed that we needed a 2.3 or newer kernel for i2c
and therefore had to do a minor patch to Debian Potato's 2.2
kernel. We had the fix but didn't understand it.</p><p>Talking with Bill Dirks finally solved the mystery for us of
what the i2c driver does. TV cards have tuners, and they have their
own communications bus called i2c (or iic), defined by manufacturer
Phillips. It is a three-wire synchronous serial bus (clock, data,
ground) that communicates between the tuner and other components on
the card. It is the PCI bus that talks to the i2c. Another place an
i2c bus is used is on the PC motherboard so it can talk to the
temperature sensor for the CPU.</p><p>Although it is still experimental, Bill Dirks recommends
using V4L2 unless doing so causes a problem. V4L is more
bttv-centric, but apps may use either Video4Linux version
transparently. The videodev driver loads the device specific driver
in V4L. In V4L2, the driver loader may be videodev or videodevx.
The V4L2 videodev package works only with 2.2.x kernels and
supports only V4L2 drivers. The new V4L2 videodevx driver works
with 2.2.x and 2.4.x kernels and supports both V4L2 and V4L device
drivers.</p><p>V4L is included with the kernel. To get V4L2, you need to
install something extra. Because the version of V4L with Potato is
so old, we did that anyway. However, we finally went with V4L
because we were scared off by the newness of V4L2. We haven't
followed Bill's advice yet to switch to V4L2, which may have
something to do with some difficulties we had testing video
capture.</p><p>We built the AVI players from source, either because we
wanted the latest version or because no deb package was available.
The procedure is to search on freshmeat.net for the project, use
<b  >tar xvfz</b> or <b  >xvfI</b> to unpack it
(depending on whether the file is gzipped or bzipped), then build
it. Building is typically done the GNU way:
<b  >./configure</b>, then <b  >make</b> and
<b  >make install</b>.</p><p>MPlayer was deemed the most stable MPEG player in our
evaluation last month, although the 0.11 version we had wouldn't
play AVI files. The new version does. It does a pretty good job,
but it is obvious that AVI support isn't as mature. Some files
didn't play, some had no video and one even played upside
down.</p><p>In theory, MPlayer can play any video that Microsoft WMP can
because it tries to use WMP codec plugins copied into the Linux
/usr/lib/win32 directory. However, tricking the WMP plugins to work
in Linux isn't entirely perfected yet, and MPlayer continues to
suffer from a spartan command-line control interface.</p><p>You can't resize the player window, which will annoy most
people accustomed to viewing small videos at double size. You also
can't get a video to repeat, and quitting doesn't seem to respond
very fast.</p><p>There is no version number for MPlayer anymore; you can only
download a daily CVS snapshot. We had serious trouble getting that
to build due to a problem with our gcc compiler. We received a
somewhat cryptic message from gcc about an install problem, and it
couldn't execute cc1plus, the g++ front end. However, g++ seemed to
be installed correctly. The problem went away when we installed a
newer version of gcc (2.95.3-5).</p><p>XAnim is popular for viewing both MPEGs and AVIs. It uses
plugins but not the Win32 dll ones. It offers its own
cross-platform plugins for H.261, H.263, Indeo and Cinepak.
Although not many are offered, the docs say the plugins run on
Intel, Alpha, PowerPC, Sun and SGI hardware. According to the XAnim
web page, the plugins are proprietary, developed under NDA.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4698f4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
The XAnim Player
</p></div></div><p>XAnim worked okay but couldn't play as many AVIs as MPlayer.
However, the user interface in XAnim is better. We wanted to try
the latest version of XAnim, but we had trouble building it.
Building XAnim requires first installing the Imake generator
<span   class="bold"><b>xmkmf</b></span>. It's supposed to be
included with the X Window System development libraries, but we
couldn't find that. Later we noticed that the MPlayer web page says
those libraries are called lib6g-dev in Debian.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4698f5.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
The XAnim User Interface
</p></div></div><p>Two other players we didn't get built are aKtion and Kmpg. We
are running an older version of aKtion, but it has some problems
playing AVI files. We couldn't build Kmpg 0.5.4 because it didn't
like our system's too-new version of libqt (2.2.4 instead of 1.x).
Not having KDE headers was the build error reported by aKtion
0.4.1. Xtheater 0.9.1 built but wouldn't play any AVIs.</p><p>Avifile 0.53.5 is a library for playing AVI files. It comes
with two sample applications, Aviplay and QtVidcap. Using Aviplay
offers a somewhat different interface than XAnim but is a similar
experience. XAnim doesn't seem to use Avifile. MPlayer doesn't use
Avifile but they do have the Win32 DLL loader in common. Both seem
a bit more reliable than Aviplay.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4698f6.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Aviplay
</p></div></div><p>The QtVidcap capture program looks enticing, but we couldn't
get it to work. When it started to capture a file it would fail. We
hope it will do better after we install XFree86 4.x and
V4L2.</p><p>XawTV succeeded in capturing AVI files, but its power seemed
feeble compared to the same task in Windows with Windows Media
Encoder. XawTV only encodes 15-bit and 24-bit RGB or MJPEG codecs.
XAnim was the only player that could play all three XawTV formats.
The other players tended to balk, except for MJPEG. Aviplay didn't
like any of them. We had trouble playing the files in Windows and
wondered if the fault was in the capture. The Linux players did
better with Windows-captured video, provided that the codec wasn't
too new.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4698f7.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4698f9.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
The XawTV Options Window
</p></div></div><p>Two things puzzled us when operating XawTV: adjusting picture
size and sound. You must size the window to the size you want to
capture videos. Anything larger than 320 x 240 pixels at 15fps gave
us problems. We had no sound until it dawned on us to select &ldquo;line
input for record&rdquo; in gmixer.</p><p>Next month we will upgrade our Debian Linux installation from
Potato to Woody, giving us the more multimedia capable 2.4 kernel
and XFree86 4.0 GUI. We will also upgrade our device drivers to
V4L2.</p></div></div>
