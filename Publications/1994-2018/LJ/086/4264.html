    What has surprised me somewhat more is something I've discovered
    since beginning to work for <i  >Linux Journal</i>&mdash;the impact Linux has had
    in other corners of the globe, in fact in every corner of the globe.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2727580.0x281f240"></a></h2></div></div><p>Having recently returned from CeBIT in
Hannover, Germany, where Jon &ldquo;maddog&rdquo; Hall of Linux International
took excellent advantage of his precious opportunities to explain
what Linux offers to key German cabinet members, I have a better
understanding of the enthusiasm Western Europe reserves for Linux.
Attendees who stopped by the <i  >Linux Journal</i>
booth to express their fervor included Dutch, German, English,
French, Spanish, Portuguese and Belgian. But this is to be
expected. What Linux enthusiast is unfamiliar with SuSE and
Mandrake? Linux is, after all, the offspring of a European mind.
</p><p>What has surprised me somewhat more is something I've
discovered since beginning to work for <i  >Linux Journal</i>--the impact Linux has had in other corners of
the globe, in fact in every corner of the globe. For instance, what
I found to be the most impressive Linux product displayed at CeBIT
was neither European nor American, but the Mobile Multimedia
Communicator offered by Galleo, an Israeli company. Of course I
shouldn't have been surprised as Linux started as an international
endeavor, a child of the Internet with little regard for
geographical boundaries, and cost (except as it relates to internet
connectivity) doesn't really constitute a barrier. As I'm sure our
readers have noticed, our contributors reside in diverse parts of
the world and face diverse computing challenges. Their solutions
demonstrate the scalability and flexibity Linux offers.</p><p>In these pages Michael Stafford reviews <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Hacker
Ethic</em></span> in which Linus Torvalds explains the entertainment
value of hacking, the pleasure derived from computer creation.
Perhaps this pleasure that so easily transcends national boundaries
has something to do with the worldwide success of Linux. Linux, by
nature of its flexibility and learning curve, encourages enthusiasm
for hacking&mdash;something those who employ the more &ldquo;user-friendly&rdquo;
OSes miss out on.</p><p>However, it's not all peace, love and Linux warm fuzzies as
Wayne Marshall, in his article &ldquo;Algorithms in Africa&rdquo; on page 72
points out. Linux is perhaps best known for powering the Internet,
and internet connectivity is behind the hopes to bridge the Digital
Divide said to exist between developed nations and those termed
Third World. Wayne, a favorite regular contributor who has been
living in Guinea for some time, highlights the fact that the divide
is less than digital, though still informational&mdash;and the Western
world may be on the ignorant side.</p><p>John Biggs recently spent two years in Poland and in his
article &ldquo;Linux in Poland&rdquo;, on page 80, discusses to what point
Linux has been embraced there and what obstacles remain.</p><p>Finally, Jorge Eduardo Nieto Lema reminds us of the potential
advantages open-source software presents to nations having more
important things to worry about than licensing fees. On page 82 he
explains the Linux Terminal Server Project that allows setting up
diskless workstations that boot from a Linux network server, a real
boon to companies on a tight budget. Jorge tells of his experiences
setting up the LTSP for a Colombian company and explains the
installation.</p><p>&mdash;Richard Vernon, Editor in Chief</p></div></div>
