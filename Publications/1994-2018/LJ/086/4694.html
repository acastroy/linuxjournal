On page 33 of the March 5, 2001 issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>eWeek</em></span>
magazine is a full-page story by Grant DuBois and Roberta Holland
with a rather wordy title:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Emerging Tech // Peer to PeerLooking before they
leapIT taking a wait-and-see stance on Jxta and .Net.</p></blockquote></div><p>At the center of the page, just over the headline block, a
large photograph bears the caption, &ldquo;Brian Moura in San Carlos,
California, questions the usefulness of P2P.&rdquo; Here's how the piece
opens:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Brian Moura needs to hear better arguments in
favor of peer-to-peer networking technology before he gives it any
consideration.
</p><p>&ldquo;Peer-to-peer is not on our radar screen&rdquo;, said Moura,
assistant city manager in San Carlos, Calif. &ldquo;If we already have
application servers and file servers, what's the advantage or
value-add of letting each person's PC be a server?&rdquo;</p></blockquote></div><p>The whole piece is impelled by Moura's skepticism, which
would be fine if Moura legitimately exemplified all of IT&mdash;or at
least a significant wedge of the profession&mdash;but he doesn't.</p><p>Type &ldquo;Brian Moura&rdquo; into Google and hit the &ldquo;I'm Feeling
Lucky&rdquo; button, and you'll go straight to Moura's home page. The
top link there takes you to the San Carlos home page, for which
Moura is webmaster. The San Carlos site
(<a href="http://www.ci.san-carlos.ca.us" target="_self">http://www.ci.san-carlos.ca.us/</a>)
has barely changed since Magellan (long since absorbed into Excite)
gave it three stars in 1996. The site brags about this distinction,
along with its &ldquo;Best of the Web&rdquo; award, also issued, fossil
records show, near the dawn of Internet time. To be fair, the site
itself is useful, as municipal sites go. The update page shows that
somebody's trying to keep it fresh.</p><p>It's pretty clear from both the site and the quote above that
Moura's main purpose in the piece is to substantiate a negative
spin about P2P, an acronym the writers peg on Napster, Microsoft's
.NET and Sun's Jxta. Ironically, the most widespread P2P
phenomenon&mdash;the one where most of the action is taking place&mdash;is
the web log movement. At their most institutional, &ldquo;blogs&rdquo;
include downtown hacker hangouts like Slashdot, Kuro5hin and
Advogato. At their most individualistic, they include dozens of
thousands of public journals, most of which are hosted by Blogger,
Userland or Pitas.</p><p>As Glenn Fleischmann put it in the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Seattle
Times</em></span> recently, &ldquo;Some blogs are closer to public
diaries; others, the idiosyncratic or authoritative musings of
experts and cranks.&rdquo; Together they constitute a vast peer-to-peer
network that performs a constant story-finding and fact-correcting
mission for both their own readers and mainstream journalists who
don't want to be caught fluffing nothing into something.</p><p>Thanks in large measure to blogs, the journalism of the
future will be fed mostly by a peer-to-peerage of linked and
syndicated writers and sources who endlessly report facts, stories
and informed speculation. The nature of peer-review journalism is
very much like the nature of peer-review software and, naturally,
includes many of the same people. News, ideas, facts, jokes,
interesting links and other items are constantly vetted, checked,
challenged, credited, linked and spread. Underlying all of it, the
main purpose is no less social than open-source code development:
to share what we know and what we think. The goal is not to attract
interest with bogus stories or to attract readers to
advertisers&mdash;two common hidden agendas of traditional journalism,
especially trade publications.</p><p>More and more journalists have blogs and use them as
instruments of their professional work. This is the case with Glenn
(who writes for many publications), with Dan Gillmor of the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>San Jose Mercury News</em></span>, with Deborah Branscum
of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Newsweek</em></span> and <span   class="emphasis"><em>Fortune</em></span>
and with a certain senior editor for <i  >Linux Journal</i>. In some cases, we even vet nascent stories or
hunches that might become stories, inviting responses that help
inform those stories. That's what I did recently when Eric Schmidt
ceased presiding over Novell's ongoing failure and became
&ldquo;part-time&rdquo; president and CEO of Google. Glenn's account of what
followed became part of his <span   class="emphasis"><em>Seattle Times</em></span>
piece:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>One experience I had recently illustrates how a
blog works. Doc Searls recently posted musings
(<a href="http://doc.weblogs.com/2001/03/27" target="_self">doc.weblogs.com/2001/03/27</a>)
about whether Google's
(<a href="http://www.google.com" target="_self">http://www.google.com/</a>)
hiring Eric Schmidt as chairman might result in the purchase of the
search engine by Sun Microsystems, a company Schmidt helped found.
I sent Searls some pithy comments and a number of others did the
same. Searls posted an update the next day with our responses
(<a href="http://doc.weblogs.com/2001/03/28" target="_self">doc.weblogs.com/2001/03/28</a>).
He also linked to an on-line-only column by Branscum at
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Fortune</em></span> magazine's site about Google's success
working with on-line advertisers.
</p><p>This kind of mild dust-up happens all the time, with a mix of
journalists, ordinary readers and subject experts responding to
their colleagues with no intermediation and little compunction.
These responses are incorporated into blogs, resulting in more
cross-links and a richer vein of detail.</p></blockquote></div><p>The responses are also incorporated into the writer's stories
and editorials, as Glenn and I both illustrate. Today I understand
a lot more about Google, thanks to responsive blog readers that
include a number of company insiders who are not my usual PR
sources. So when I do write something, I'll have a lot more sources
to call upon and information to work with.</p><p>Note that this doesn't change the nature of mainstream
journalism one bit, except to make it more resourceful. The growing
difference here, as with the Open Source movement that both
surrounds and populates the software industry, is in the
involvement of many more people in a web of trust and respect. It
also resembles, in a raucous and noisy way, the traditional
marketplace we call a bazaar.</p><p>I was delivered this realization recently when I sat in a
plane next to an amazing gentleman from Nigeria named Sayo Ajiboye.
A deeply thoughtful religious scholar who took eight years to
translate the highly annotated <span   class="emphasis"><em>Thompson Bible</em></span>
into his native language of Yoruba, he compared what I told him
about both Linux and blogs to traditional marketplaces in his
country. &ldquo;Markets are not just about business&rdquo;, he said. &ldquo;They
are about relationships.&rdquo; In fact, he went on to say, they are
constituted by relationships, motivated at least as much by the
desire for relationships as by the desire to sell and buy.</p><p>Old media never go away, they just obtain larger contexts.
Mainstream journalism will always involve publishing. But
surrounding that mainstream will be a watershed of other
people&mdash;journalists in the literal sense and their readers. The
whole watershed becomes a marketplace; not just for shared
passions, but for trust and authority.</p><p>A case in point. In February, Dan Gillmor made the mistake of
quoting something Richard Stallman was drafting and sharing with a
few other folks by e-mail, including Dan. When Richard and other
peers caught the mistake, they called him on it. It wasn't a big
deal, but Dan quickly admitted it, removed the web copy of the
offending piece, and everybody moved on. In the course of the
matter, Dan's authority increased.</p><p>The growth of highly cross-sourced journalism by folks like
Glenn and Dan is moving toward the norm for journalism both in
print and on the Web. It makes traditional newswire-fed journalism
seem increasingly anachronistic, as well as unreliable. CNET, for
example, is a source of many good stories but some provocative
clunkers too. That's what we had in February when CNET ran a poorly
sourced and credited <span   class="emphasis"><em>Bloomberg News</em></span> story in
which Microsoft's Jim Allchin said some unkind things about
open-source development and licensing. The story stirred up a huge
fuss, but it lacked both context and authority in the literal
sense. Who exactly spoke to Allchin? Where? About what? None of
this was clear.</p><p>It's not just a coincidence that CNET leads the way in
deploying huge new reader-averse, 240 x 400 &ldquo;interactive marketing
units&rdquo; (yet another buzz phrase for advertising). Nor is it a
coincidence that a current <span   class="emphasis"><em>eWeek</em></span> news piece
about these huge new ads fails to include a single source from the
opposition. The headline in the magazine reads &ldquo;Online
Advertising: Bigger Is Better&rdquo;. But the headline on the Web in
ZDnet reads &ldquo;Online Advertising: Will Bigger Be Better?&rdquo;
Interesting difference, no? The last words in the piece are given
to Beth Eason, VP and GM of DoubleClick. &ldquo;Somebody needs to pay
for the Internet&rdquo;, she says. &ldquo;Advertising needs to be the
economic engine that drives it.&rdquo;</p><p>The Internet she's talking about is what remains of a massive
investment project proving to be little more than a fantasy. The
Internet that existed before that project showed up persists
uncorrupted. Its current conversational manifestation is P2P, which
has nothing to do with advertising and is not driven by Microsoft,
Sun or other large potential advertisers.</p><p>This kind of journalism will die of exposure, right along
with the advertising projects its publishers continue to fund under
the illusion that its constituency is an audience, rather than a
bazaar filled with sources and fact checkers.</p><p>Also due for a change are stories about conflict for its own
sake. Of course, conflict is what makes stories interesting.
Without it you don't have a story. After all, stories never start
with &ldquo;Happily ever after&rdquo; (if they did they'd be press releases).
Conflict is what journalists naturally like to find and cover. Too
often, though, it gets invented. That's what Stephen Shankland did
recently in a CNET story about Maxtor dropping open-source products
in favor of Windows. It's also what DuBois and Holland did in their
P2P piece in <span   class="emphasis"><em>eWeek</em></span> and ZDnet.</p><p>The purpose of both stories was less to report than to
conjure. The CNET piece conjured the illusion that there's a big
fight between open source and Windows in the embedded applications
market. The <span   class="emphasis"><em>eWeek</em></span>/ZDnet piece conjured the
illusion that IT managers have some kind of problem with
P2P.</p><p>The author Peter Rengel (who writes about sex and intimate
relationships) once told me, &ldquo;we choose the levels of truth at
which we are willing to live,&rdquo; and &ldquo;the challenge is always to go
to the deeper level.&rdquo; He added, &ldquo;there's always a deeper
level.&rdquo;</p><p>Journalism-as-usual lived at a certain level in a world
without the Web. In that world, there wasn't a peerage of highly
open sources. To live in the new world, it has to work at a deeper
level, or it won't survive.</p></div></div>
