I love the Cool Projects issue. Don't get me wrong, most issues of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span> are full of cool things to do, but this month, we do it just
because of the cool factor. As you can imagine, no Cool Projects issue is
complete without a Raspberry Pi article, and this one is particularly
awesome. But let me start off with a bit about our columns.
</p><p>
Reuven M. Lerner continues his series on Django, and this month, he covers 
migrations and updating databases. If you're a developer looking for a
framework to start with, or if you're already using Django and want to learn
more, Reuven's series is a great way to begin. Dave Taylor follows Reuven
with a new topic this month (you might remember Dave was working on a
word search project in his last column). In this issue, he takes on the topic of how to make your shell scripts send text messages. It's a
great way to get instant notifications to users, which isn't usually
possible from inside a script.
</p><p>
I describe a couple cool programs in this month's upfront section, starting with Budgie.
If you like the simplicity of the Chrome desktop interface, but prefer a
full-blown Linux system underneath, Budgie is perfect. I also talk about
the intricacies of the Linux permissions system and even a few Bitcoin
clients. It's hard to beat the cool factor of Kyle Rankin's column this
month, however, as he continues his series on Libreboot. People have been
installing open source on hard drives for years, but with Kyle's
assistance, 
you will learn to install the open-source BIOS replacement as well!
</p><p>
Be sure to check out Bharath Bhushan Lohray's article for an incredible home automation
project. Starting from scratch with a Raspberry Pi, some relays and some
wiring, Bharath walks through the steps of using the GPIO pins to manage multiple
systems. Although it's certainly possible to buy one of the many embedded home
automation kits available, starting from scratch allows for some serious
customization and infinite programability. If you've been struggling to
choose a brand of home automation systems to try, perhaps after reading
this article, that
question will become moot!
</p><p>
Rick Brown describes another awesome project, but this time it integrates
with existing systems. Specifically, he explains how he connected a Linux
system to a vehicle to get real-time operation data. Rick also shows how
to design a display for the information, so that you're not grepping log
files while driving!
</p><p>
In past issues, you have learned how to do basic encryption with Linux tools in
order to keep your sensitive data safe. This month, Adam Kosmin goes much
further and describes his complete system for keeping data secure. Using
freely available tools and a handful of scripts and methods, he shows how
to integrate secure encryption into your daily routine. If you want to
encrypt your data, but find it complex and frustrating, be sure to read
Adam's article.
</p><p>
The Cool Projects issue is a favorite of mine year after year. Not only is
it a chance to start working on those ideas you've been putting off for
months, but it's also a great way to learn while playing. I learned more
about how keyboards function while making my MAME cabinet than ever before
or since. As a kid who took apart everything I got my hands on, the Cool
Projects issue is an awesome way to learn how to put a few things back
together! Whether you love projects or just want some tech tips,
product announcements and programming lessons, this issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span> should provide lots of entertainment and education.

Shawn Powers is the Associate Editor for <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span>. He's also the
Gadget Guy for LinuxJournal.com, and he has an interesting collection
of vintage Garfield coffee mugs. Don't let his silly hairdo fool you,
he's a pretty ordinary guy and can be reached via e-mail at
<a href="mailto:info@linuxjournal.com">info@linuxjournal.com</a>. Or, swing by the #linuxjournal IRC
channel on Freenode.net.
