How to use a standard Linux distribution platform to make a user
interface embedded into a vehicle monitoring and control system.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2018580.0x21101f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The target vehicle for this project is a vintage intercity transport bus (think
Greyhound) whose instrument panel was sparse and mostly nonfunctional.
The speedometer cable was twisted off some place back in 40 feet of
cable,
and the fuel sensor had sunk long ago. What I wanted was an instrument
panel more in line with modern practice.
</p><p>
To bridge the gap, I used a laptop computer running the Fedora 20-KDE
distribution of Linux as a host, three digital signal processor boards
as hardware interface processors (HIPs), a USB/RS422 converter that
connects to an RS422 loop linking the HIPs together and some software
that I call the Vehicle Monitoring and Control application.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2018580.0x2110408"></a>
System Architecture</h2></div></div><p>
The HIPs are based on a signal processor chip, programmed in C and with
no user interface except a heartbeat LED to show that the processor is
working to some degree. The HIPs provide signal conditioning circuitry
for analog input scaling and optical isolation for control signals plus a
few specials like thermocouple converters and a pressure transducer chip.
There also are two RS422 receiver/transmitter pairs. One pair connects
up-network (toward the host) and the other down-network (toward the
other HIPs). 
</p><p>
The way this application works is that a message is originated
by the host processor and transmitted down-loop to the first HIP. There
it may be modified under HIP program control and relayed on down-loop
to the next HIP. The last HIP in the &ldquo;loop&rdquo; transmits its message up-loop
under physical jumper control. Processors closer to the Host simply pass
on up what is coming from below in the &ldquo;loop&rdquo;. The Host is the ultimate
receiver of the messages it originates.
</p><p>
A message consists of an SOM byte, an address byte with acknowledge bit,
a command byte, four data bytes and two CRC bytes. Going down loop, the HIPs
relay a message on a character-by-character basis with a one-character
delay per HIP. The addressee of a message sets the acknowledge bit and
inserts or extracts data on the fly. So in a short loop like the one
here,
the host begins receiving the response from the network before it has
finished sending the original message. For this loop, the communication
rate was selected, arbitrarily, as 57,600 baud, so the loop message time is
(9 + 3)/57600 or 208 microseconds. The left portion of Figure 1 depicts
the loop topology.

Figure 1. System Architecture
</p></div></div><p>
The Vehicle Monitoring and Control (VMC) application will originate
messages like &ldquo;HIP1 set or get register whatever&rdquo;.
First, I show how
to set up a development environment on a Linux box, and then I talk
about how to use the tools made available there to weave together a Linux
real-time application that performs the VMC application.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2018580.0x21108d8"></a>
Set Up the Development Environment</h2></div></div><p>
My choice for a development environment is KDevelop from KDE, and for a
toolkit, it is Qt from the Qt Project. The first step is to get the development
environment and then build a &ldquo;Hello World&rdquo; application. So, here it
is in the Fedora world: 

<pre     class="programlisting">
yum install kdevelop 
yum install qt 
yum install gcc 
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2018580.0x2110a90"></a></h2></div></div><p>
...and lots of other stuff. Expect to spend some time if you are not
already up and running with Qt.
</p><p>
When you get KDevelop to load, click Session&rarr;Start New
Session&rarr;New Project. This will be &ldquo;Qt&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Graphical&rdquo;. Make up a name
(VMC for example), accept the defaults, and soon you will be presented
the opportunity to &ldquo;Build&rdquo; and then
&ldquo;Execute&rdquo;. On &ldquo;Execute&rdquo;, a Launch
Configurations dialog box will enable you to select your project name,
&ldquo;Add New&rdquo;, and your project. A click or two later, and you should see a basic
&ldquo;Hello World&rdquo; window appear on your screen. This you may expand into
your real-time application.
</p><p>
The &ldquo;Hello World&rdquo; you see is a Qt application. Qt is an
excellent toolkit that is robust and well documented&mdash;except for a few
quirks. The
new project build process creates a directory structure that includes
~/projects/VMC/build. To minimize hard-to-diagnose Qt build errors, keep
all of your source and header files in ~/projects/VMC until you know
how to do otherwise. The ~/projects/VMC/build directory is the execute
directory for the purposes of KDevelop. It is here that run directory
files should reside. As you add source files and libraries, you must keep
~/projects/VMC/CmakeLists.txt current.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2018580.0x2110f60"></a>
Build the Application</h2></div></div><p>
Here is how to use tools available in the Linux environment to create
the VMC application. First up is communications. To your application,
the communication loop looks like a file stream created like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
int hNet = open("/dev/ttyUSB0", O_RDWR);
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2018580.0x21110c0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
or /dev/ttyUSBwhatever, depending upon what else is going on
in your system.
</p><p>
Now you can <tt  >read()</tt> and
<tt  >write()</tt> hNet and the USB&lt;-&gt;RS422 converter
will connect you to the loop. Writing is no issue up to loop speed (in
this case 57600/9 = 6400 messages/second), so that is your write
(hNet,...) speed limit. Reading is a different deal as read(hNet,...)
is a blocking operation. A process that makes that call remains stuck
there until some data arrives. Thus, you want to make your
read(hNet,...) calls from a process (thread) whose only task is to
catch characters as they come in and then make them available in a
buffer to other processes as they need them&mdash;most briefly, in
abbreviated code:

<pre     class="programlisting">

//A thread to perform the read(hNet,...) function
class COMthread : public Qthread
{
Q_OBJECT    //Notice use of the Qt tools
protected:
     //Start point when myThread-&gt;start(); is called
void run() 
{
while (1)
{
pthread_mutex_t mutex1\
         = PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER;
//Lock out other processes while working
pthread_mutex_lock( &amp;mutex1 );
          -manipulate shared variables here-
//unlock for other processes during read(hNet,...
pthread_mutex_unlock( &amp;mutex1 );

//This is where this thread spends
read(hNet, Buf, BUF_SIZE);/////////
//99.99 (+/-) percent of its time

//Now lock while updating for new data
pthread_mutex_lock( &amp;mutex1 );
         -buffer data and update pointers-
pthread_mutex_unlock( &amp;mutex1 );
}
}
};

</pre>
</p><p>
To activate that code, your statements in the VMC constructor are:
    
<pre     class="programlisting">
COMthread   *gCOMgo = new COMthread;
gCOMgo-&gt;start();
</pre>
</p><p>
The complement to that loop data fetch is a character fetch routine
running under some other process. That routine, using its own
mutexes, extracts data from the buffer sourced by the thread above.
</p><p>
Now that you can send and receive data via the loop, let's look at how
the application may interact with the hardware.
</p><p>
Figure 2 shows the Instrument Panel display as seen on a video
display mounted in the driver's view.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11855f2.large.jpg"><img src="11855f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Instrument Panel Display
</p></div></div><p>
The Tach and Speed display data are sourced from timer registers in an HIP
that is timing the period between shaft rotations. The five indicators
below are sourced by A/D registers in various HIPs. These seven data items
are collected by sending seven nine-character data request messages to
the loop and decoding the returned 63 characters (7X9). Below that is
a representation of a partially populated map of a 4X4 keypad that is
serviced by one of the HIPs. Each of the represented keys on that
map issues a query for the HIP responsible for the physical keypad to see
if its key was the last pressed. It gets back yes or no.
</p><p>
When you use KDevelop to create a VMC project, some files of interest
to you now were created. Look in directory ~/projects/VMC, and there you
will find main.cpp and VMC.cpp. File main.cpp is fine as is. It simply
declares and runs the application described by the code in VMC.cpp. None
of the sample code in VMC.cpp within the curly braces is useful for you, so
let's replace it with the constructor for the VMC application. As I
mentioned previously, this application relies upon Qt, so an important resource
for you is <a href="http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-4.8/classes.html" target="_self">qt-project.org/doc/qt-4.8/classes.html</a>.
</p><p>
Your VMC class will inherit from QmainWindow, so your constructor will
be defined in VMC.cpp as shown here:

<pre     class="programlisting">
 VMC::VMC() : QMainWindow()
 {
 //declare a central widget to host our screen:
 QWidget* gCentralWidget = new QWidget(this);
 setCentralWidget(gCentralWidget);
//Set fonts, colors, geometry, etc
       - - - -
//Declare an object to hold the screen features:
ScreenC cScreenLayout = new ScreenC(); 
//Lastly, breathe life into the application
cHeartBeat = new QTimer (this);
connect(cHeartBeat, SIGNAL(timeout()), this,\
                          SLOT(slotPaintScreen()));
cHeartBeat-&gt;setSingleShot(false);
cHeartBeat-&gt;start(50); //milliseconds/20Hz
}
</pre>
</p><p>
That is an abridged view of the constructor, but the actual code isn't
much longer. The connected routine <tt  >slotPaintScreen()</tt> will be activated
on a 50 millisecond interval by the timer overflow. It too is brief:

<pre     class="programlisting">
//Fetch loop characters gathered by COMthread
SensorLoopService(); 
//Update the display
cScreenLayout-&gt;Update(); 
//Redraw the screen
update();
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2018580.0x2111958"></a></h2></div></div><p>
(Again abridged because this is a story about how to do it rather than
how to code it.)
</p><p>
The central portion of Figure 1 shows the cascade of object creation
that will embody the VMC application. Notice the declaration of a
ScreenC object by the VMC constructor and the update of that object
at a 20Hz rate.
</p><p>
The ScreenC class constructor simply declares a ScreenItemC object
for each entity that appears on the screen. A typical declaration is:

<pre     class="programlisting">
pF[i] = new ScreenItemC(xOff,yOff,xSiz,ySiz,\
                  MEAS_TACHOMETER, 0, "Tach");
</pre>
</p><p>
Here you define the location and size and name the object type of each
on-screen object. At update time &ldquo;update&rdquo; is simply relayed to its
children like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">

//Update screen features
for (i=0; i&lt;cNumberFeatures; i++)
{
 pF[i]-&gt;Update();
}

</pre>
</p><p>
The ScreenItemC class constructor is responsible for the look of items
on the screen. In this application, a ScreenItemC item consists of two
QLabel objects placed one above the other so as to appear to be a single
instrument. The form of a QLabel declaration is:

<pre     class="programlisting">
QLabel cReading = new QLabel(gCentralWidget, Qt::FramelessWindowHint);
</pre>
</p><p>
The instrument displays of Figure 2 are pretty &ldquo;plain Jane&rdquo;.
It is here
in the ScreenItemC class code where you can fancy it up. The
ScreenItemC constructor also declares a MeasureC object. That
object's update routine returns the data that the ScreenItemC object
places on the screen:

<pre     class="programlisting">
MeasureC cMeasure = new MeasureC(MEAS_TACHOMETER);
</pre>
</p><p>
The MeasureC class is where the hardware interface is described. HIP
address, register numbers and scale factors are defined. For example:

<pre     class="programlisting">
case MEAS_TACHOMETER:
{
fScale = 27648000.0;  //29.75Hz -&gt; 1788rpm
      // RPM = fScale / binary from loop + fOffset
fOffset = 0;
rule = MEAS_RULE_RECIPROCAL_TACHO;
DeviceId = NODE_E;                  //Loop device id
DevicePort = P_IC_PERIOD_2;  //Sensor on device
//Create a sensor for the measurement
pSens = new SensorC(MEAS_TACHOMETER,\
    DeviceId, DevicePort, fScale, Offset, rule);
break;
}
</pre>
</p><p>
Notice the declaration above of a SensorC object. At update time, that
SensorC object will fetch its most recent raw reading from the loop
buffer, scale that and return the result to its MeasureC parent,
which will relay that back to its ScreenItemC parent, which will
display that result on the screen. The MeasureC items that represent
a keypad key will declare a ContrtolC object here. The ControlC
object will use its own SensorC object to inquire of the loop if its
key is the most recently pressed. ControlC objects also run device-specific code (like timing a blinker, for example). The ControlC
object may place commands on the loop as necessary. The ControlC
update routine will return 1 or 0 depending on whether its control target has
changed state or not. That return flows back up the cascade to its
grandparent ScreenItemC object and then is reflected on the display.
</p><p>
This cascade of object creation ends with SensorC objects that return
the result of their previous request to the loop and issue a new data
request at each update time. As ControlC objects may place commands
on the loop at their whim, the loop will have a mixture of independent
commands circulating that must be resolved back to their originator.
When a command is issued to the loop, the issuer of that command also
inserts into a class visible circular buffer a pointer to itself.
</p><p>
As mentioned above, slotPaintScreen() will call SensorLoopService()
at each update time. SensorLoopService() extracts characters that
have been placed into the loop receive buffer by the gCOMgo thread.
Mutexes are used here to prevent interference by other threads.
SensorLoopService() parses the characters as it fetches data from the
buffer, and when it has detected a complete valid message, it places
the four data bytes into a location pointed to by the pointer
mentioned above. This data will be returned up the cascade at the
next update time.
</p><p>
Here it is in fewer words: the update event cascades down from the ScreenC
object to multiple SensorC objects that bounce parameter states back
up to ScreenItemC objects that paint those states on the screen. The
left panel of Figure 1 depicts this.

Linux Environment Considerations</h2></div></div><p>
Some kinks that Linux throws in include the screen saver that
defaults active, but is bad news in a monitoring application. To turn
it off, go to System Settings&rarr;Power Management and disable all
Screen Energy Saving options. Another issue is automatic software
updates. It is my consideration that if something works, don't screw
around with the operating environment, as software updates do. The
safest way to suppress updating is by staying off the Internet while
your application is active. Another way is to disable updates by
software control. To do so, go to the Application Launcher (lower left
on the desktop), and start the System Settings from Favorites, 
go to Software Management and left-click the wrench icon at the
upper-right edge. Select Settings from its menu. In the General
Settings page, set the Check for updates menu to Never, and
&ldquo;Apply&rdquo;
that. Also, go to /etc/yum/pluginconf.d/refresh-packagekit.conf and
set enabled to 0 (disable update). For me it was
just too easy to switch off the Wi-Fi when I wanted a stable
environment, so I can't give you other advice here.
</p><p>
To claim credit as being an &ldquo;embedded&rdquo; application, this system should
come up with the power&mdash;that is, without login or any other user
input required to make it go. To kill the login, go to
/etc/kde/kdm/kdmrc and set <tt  >AutoLoginAgain=true</tt> and
<tt  >AutoLoginUser=YourUserName</tt>. To bring up your application with system
start up, go to ~/.kde/Autostart and place an executable script there
like this:
  
<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/bash
cd /home/YourUserName/projects/VMC/build
./VMC
</pre>
</p><p>
Serendipitously, this will not bring up multiple instances of the
application if it was active when you last powered down, and you have
your system set to restore the previous session at power up.
</p><p>
With a man in the loop, the VMC application is not time-critical at
all and may take its share of CPU time whenever it is offered. There
is a lot of other stuff in a Linux system that also wants CPU time
(look at <tt  >ps -A</tt>). If your application is time-critical with
predetermined response times at close tolerances between events, 
this scheme will not work for you. However, if you have a few
milliseconds here and there to spare, Linux will host your
monitoring and control applications with a reasonably small level of
effort and good reliability.
