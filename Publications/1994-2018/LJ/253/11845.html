The Raspberry Pi has been very popular among hobbyists and educators
ever since its launch in 2011. The Raspberry Pi is a credit-card-sized
single-board computer with a Broadcom BCM 2835 SoC, 256MB to 512MB of RAM,
USB ports, GPIO pins, Ethernet, HDMI out, camera header and an SD card
slot. The most attractive aspects of the Raspberry Pi are its low cost of
$35 and large user community following. 
</p><p>
The Pi has several pre-built
images for various applications (<a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads" target="_self">www.raspberrypi.org/downloads</a>), such as the Debian-based
Raspbian, XBMC-based (now known as Kodi) RASPBMC, OpenELEC-based Plex
Player, Ubuntu Core, RISC OS and more. The NOOBS (New Out Of the Box
Setup) image presents a user-friendly menu to select and install any
of the several distributions and subsequently boot into any of the
installed OSes. The Raspbian image comes with the Wolfram language as 
part of the setup.
</p><p>
Since its initial launch in February 2011, the Raspberry Pi has been
revised four times, each time receiving upgrades but maintaining the steady
price of $35. The newest release of the Pi (the Raspberry Pi 2) boasts
a 900MHz quad core cortex A7 and 1GB of RAM. Moreover, Microsoft announced
Windows 10 for the Raspberry Pi 2 through its IoT developer program for
no charge (<a href="https://dev.windows.com/en-us/featured/raspberrypi2support" target="_self">https://dev.windows.com/en-us/featured/raspberrypi2support</a>). This, in
addition to its versatile features, has caused fans
like me to upgrade to the Raspberry Pi 2. With a few new Raspberry Pi
2 boards in hand, I set out to find some useful ways to employ my older
Pi boards.
</p><p>
In this article, I briefly describe the requirements of the project
that I outlined, and I explain the various tools I decided
to use to build it. I then cover the hardware I chose and
the way to assemble the parts to realize the system. Next, I continue
setting up the development environment on the Raspbian image, and
I walk through the code and bring everything together to form the
complete system. Finally, I conclude with possible improvements
and hacks that would extend the usefulness of a Pi home automation system.

The Internet of Things</h2></div></div><p>
An ongoing trend in embedded devices is to have all embedded devices
connected to the Internet. The Internet was developed as a fail-safe
network that could survive the destruction of several nodes. The Internet
of Things (IoT) leverages the same redundancy. With the move to migrate to
IPv6, the IP address space would be large enough for several trillion
devices to stay connected. A connected device also makes it very convenient
to control it from anywhere, receive inputs from various sensors and
respond to events. A multitude of IoT-connected devices in a home has the
potential to act as a living entity that exhibits response to
stimuli.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d3b580.0x1e33720"></a>
Raspberry Pi Home Automation</h2></div></div><p>
Inspired by the idea of having a home that has a life of its own,
I settled on a home automation project to control the lights in my
living room. The goal of my project was to be able to time the lights
in my living room and control them remotely over the Internet using
a Web browser. I also wanted to expose an API that could be used to
control the device from other devices programatically. 
</p><p>
The interesting
part of this project is not the hardware, which is fairly simple and
easy to construct, but the UI. The UI that I had in mind would support
multiple users logged in to the same Pi server. The UI state had to
keep up with the actual state of the system in real time indicating
which lights actually were on when multiple users operated the system
simultaneously. Apart from this, the lights may toggle on or off when triggered
by the timer. A UI running on a device, such as a phone or a tablet, may
be subject to random connection drops. The UI is expected to handle this
and attempt to reconnect to the Pi server.

system, and Figure 1 shows a block diagram of the hardware system.

Figure 1. Block Diagram of the Hardware System
</p></div></div><p>
Wiring this is time-consuming but easy. First, wire the SMPS to the wall
outlet by cutting off an extension cord at the socket end. Strip the
wires and screw them into the screw terminals of the SMPS. Next, wire
the Raspberry Pi to the SMPS by cutting off the type A end of the USB
cable and wiring it to the wire ends of the SMPS and the micro B end to
the RPi. Strip out two strands of wires from the ribbon cable, and wire the
appropriate terminals to GND and JDVcc. Remove the jumper that connects
the JDVcc and Vcc. Not removing this jumper will feed back 5v to the 3.3v
pins of the Pi and damage it. 
</p><p>
Now that all the terminals are wired for
power, connect the IN1-IN8 lines of the relay module to the appropriate
GPIO pins of the RPi using more of the ribbon cable as shown in
Figure 2. The code I present here is written for the case where I wire
IN1-IN8 to GPIO1-GPIO7. Should
you decide to wire them differently, you will need to modify your code
accordingly. 
</p><p>
The RPi's GPIO pins are shown in Figure 2. The RPi's
IO ports operate at 3.3v, and the relay module
works at 5v. However, the relays are isolated from the RPi's GPIO pins 
using optocouplers. The optocouplers may be supplied 3.3v over the Vcc
pin. The Vcc pin of the relay module may be supplied 3.3v from the GPIO
header of the Pi. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Make sure you have removed the jumper
that bridges the Vcc and JDVcc on the relay module board.</em></span> The
JDVcc pin should be supplied 5v for proper operation of the relay. The
relay module is designed to be active low. This means that you have to
ground the terminals IN1-IN8 to switch on a relay.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11845f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Warning: handle all wiring with caution. Getting a shock from the line
can be fatal!</em></span>
</p><p>
Cut the remaining extension cables at the plug end, and screw in the wire
end to the relay. Also daisy-chain the live wire from
the wall outlet to the relay terminals. The entire setup can be housed
in a pencil box or something similar. Plan this out in advance to avoid
having to unwire and rewire the terminals. Additionally, I added a few
screw cable clamps to the holes I made in my housing to act as a strain
relief (Figure 3).

Environment</h2></div></div><p>
I built my environment starting with a fresh install of Raspbian. For
the initial installation, you need an HDMI-capable display,
a USB keyboard, mouse and a wired Ethernet connection. You also
optionally may connect a Wi-Fi adapter. Build the SD card for the first boot
by following the instructions given at <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-image" target="_self">www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-image</a>. During the first
boot, the installer sets up the OS and expands the image to fill the
entire card. After the first boot, you should be able to log in using
the default credentials(user &ldquo;pi&rdquo; and password
&ldquo;raspberry&rdquo;).
</p><p>
Once you successfully log in, it's good practice to update the
OS. The Raspbian image is based on Debian and uses the aptitude
package manager. You also will need <tt  >python</tt>,
<tt  >pip</tt> and <tt  >git</tt>. I also recommend
installing Webmin to ease administration processes.
Instructions for installing Webmin are at 
<a href="http://www.webmin.com/deb.html" target="_self">www.webmin.com/deb.html</a> (follow the directions in the &ldquo;Using the Webmin APT
repository&rdquo; section):

<pre     class="programlisting">

sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
sudo apt-get install python python-pip git git-core

</pre>
</p><p>
Next, you need to set up the Wi-Fi connection. You can find detailed instructions
for this at <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/wireless" target="_self">www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/wireless</a>. I recommend the
<tt  >wicd-curses</tt> option. At this point, you can make
changes to the RPi setup using the <tt  >sudo
raspi-config</tt> command. This will bring up a GUI that lets you choose
options like the amount of RAM you share with the GPU, overclocking,
GUI Boot and so on. 
</p><p>
Another useful tool is the Cloud
9 IDE (<a href="https://github.com/c9/core" target="_self">https://github.com/c9/core</a>). The Cloud9 IDE allows you
to edit your code on the RPi using a Web browser. It also gives
you a shell interface in the browser. You can develop and execute all
your code without leaving the Web browser. The Cloud 9 IDE requires a specific
version of NodeJS. Using the wrong version will cause
frequent crashes of the Cloud 9 server, resulting in constant
frustration. Instructions for installing NodeJS on the
Raspberry Pi are outlined at <a href="http://weworkweplay.com/play/raspberry-pi-nodejs" target="_self">weworkweplay.com/play/raspberry-pi-nodejs</a>.

Software</h2></div></div><p>
I decided to build my front-end UI using HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. The
combination of these three form a powerful tool for building UIs. JavaScript
provides easy communication APIs to servers. There also are a lot of
JavaScript libraries like JQuery, Bootstrap and so on from which to choose. HTML5
supports the WebSocket API that allows the browser to keep a connection
alive and receive communication over this connection. This makes
WebSocket useful for implementing live and streaming apps, such as for games and
chat interfaces. CSS is useful for styling the various HTML elements. When
used properly, it lets one build dynamic UIs by switching the styles
on an element in response to events. For this project, I chose JQuery
to handle events, Bootstrap CSS (<a href="http://getbootstrap.com/css" target="_self">getbootstrap.com/css</a>) to lay out the buttons in
a grid form and pure JavaScript to handle WebSocket communications.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d3b580.0x1e2cec8"></a>
Libraries</h2></div></div><p>
The back-end server on the Raspberry Pi needs to control the GPIO pins on
the Raspberry Pi board. It also needs an HTTP interface to serve the
UI and a WebSocket interface to pass command and status messages. Such a
specific server did not exist for off-the-shelf deployment, so I decided
to write my own using Python. Python has prebuilt modules for
the Raspberry Pi GPIO, HTTP server and WebSockets. Since these modules are
specialized, minimum coding was required on my part.
</p><p>
However, these modules are not a part of Python and need to be installed
separately. First, you need to be able to control the RPi's GPIO pins.
The easiest way to do this from Python is by using the
RPi.GPIO library from <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/RPi.GPIO" target="_self">https://pypi.python.org/pypi/RPi.GPIO</a>. Install
this module with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo pip install RPi.GPIO
</pre>
</p><p>
Using the RPi.GPIO module is very simple. You can find examples of its usage at
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/raspberry-gpio-python/wiki/Examples" target="_self">sourceforge.net/p/raspberry-gpio-python/wiki/Examples</a>. The first step in using the module is to import
it into the code. Next, you need to select the mode. The mode can be either
GPIO.BOARD or GPIO.BCM. The mode decides whether the pin number references
in the subsequent commands will be based on the BCM chip or the
IO pins on the board. This is followed by setting pins as either input
or output. Now you can use the IO pins as required. Finally, you need
to clean up to release the GPIO pins. Listing 1 shows examples of
using the RPi.GPIO module.

CherryPy is a Web framework module for Python (<a href="http://www.cherrypy.org" target="_self">www.cherrypy.org</a>). It is easily
extendible to support WebSocket using the ws4py module (<a href="https://github.com/Lawouach/WebSocket-for-Python" target="_self">https://github.com/Lawouach/WebSocket-for-Python</a>). CherryPy
and ws4py also can be installed using <tt  >pip</tt>:

<pre     class="programlisting">
pip install cherrypy
pip install ws4py
</pre>
</p><p>
Examples of using the CherryPy framework and the ws4py plugin can
be found in the CherryPy docs (<a href="https://cherrypy.readthedocs.org/en/latest" target="_self">https://cherrypy.readthedocs.org/en/latest</a>) and the ws4py docs
(<a href="http://ws4py.readthedocs.org/en/latest" target="_self">ws4py.readthedocs.org/en/latest</a>). 
A basic CherryPy server can be spawned
using the code shown in Listing 2.

To add WebSocket support to the CherryPy server, modify the
code as shown in Listing 4. The WebSocket handler class needs to implement
three methods: <tt  >opened</tt>, <tt  >closed</tt>
and <tt  >received_message</tt>. Listing 4 is a basic WebSocket
server that has been kept small for the purpose of explaining the major
functional parts of the code; hence, it does not actually do anything.

On the client side, the HTML needs to implement a function to
connect to a WebSocket and handle incoming messages. Listing 5 shows simple
HTML that would do that. This code uses
the <tt  >jQuery.ready()</tt> event to start connecting to the WebSocket
server. The code in this Listing implements methods to handle all events:
<tt  >onopen()</tt>, <tt  >onclose()</tt>,

Pi Home Automation</h2></div></div><p>
Now that you've seen the basics of WebSockets, CherryPy and the HTML
front end, let's get to the actual code. You can get the code 
from the Git repository at <a href="https://bitbucket.org/lordloh/pi-home-automation" target="_self">https://bitbucket.org/lordloh/pi-home-automation</a>. You can clone this repository
locally on your RPi, and execute it out of the box using the
command:

<pre     class="programlisting">

git clone https://bitbucket.org/lordloh/pi-home-automation.git
git fetch &amp;&amp; git checkout LinuxJournal2015May
cd pi-home-automation
python relay.py

</pre>
</p><p>
The relayLabel.json file holds the required
configuration, such as labels for relays, times for lights to go on and
off and so on. Listing 6 shows the basic schema of the configuration. Repeat
this pattern for each relay. The <tt  >dow</tt> property is formed
by using one bit for each day of the week starting from Monday for the
LSB to Sunday for the MSB.

Figure 4 shows the block diagram of the
system displaying the major functional parts. 
Table 2
enumerates all the commands the client may send to the server and the
action that the server is expected to take. These commands are sent from
the browser to the server in JSON format. The command schema is as follows:

<pre     class="programlisting">

{
    "c":"&lt;command form TABLE 2&gt;",
    "r":&lt;relay Number&gt;
}

</pre>
</p><p>
The <tt  >update</tt> and <tt  >updateLabels</tt> commands
do not take a relay number. Apart from relay.py
and relayLabel.json, the only other file required
is index.html. The relay.py
script reads this file and serves it in response to HTTP requests. The
index.html file contains the HTML, CSS and JavaScript
to render the UI.

Once the system is up and running, you'll want to access it from
over the Internet. To do this, you need to set a permanent MAC address
and reserved IP address for the Raspberry Pi on your local network, and set up
port forwarding on your router. The process for doing this varies according to 
router, and your router manual is the best reference for it. Additionally,
you can use a dynamic domain name service so that you do not need to
type your IP address to access your Pi every time. Some routers include
support for certain dynamic DNS services.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
I hope this article helps you to build this or other similar
projects. This project can be extended to add new features, such as
detecting your phone connected to your Wi-Fi and switching on lights. You
also could integrate this with applications, such as OnX and Android
Tasker. Adding password protection for out-of-network access is
beneficial. Feel free to mention any issues, bugs and feature requests at <a href="http://code.lohray.com/pi-home-automation/issues" target="_self">code.lohray.com/pi-home-automation/issues</a>.
