<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #253, May 2015</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
One ongoing question kernel developers face is the best way to delete data so no one else can
recover it. Typically there are simple tools to undelete files that are deleted
accidentally, although some filesystems make this easier than others.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Alexander Holler</b></span> wanted to make it much harder for anyone to recover deleted data.
He didn't necessarily want to outwit the limitless resources of our governmental
overlords, but he wanted to make data recovery harder for the average hostile
attacker. The problem as he saw it was that filesystems often would not actually bother to
delete data, so much as they would just decouple the data from the file
and make that part of the disk available for use by other files. But the data would
still be there, at least for a while, for anyone to recouple into a file again.
</p><p>
Alexander posted some patches to implement a new system call that first
would overwrite all the data associated with a given file before making that disk space
available for use by other files. Since the filesystem knew which blocks on the
disk were associated with which files, he reasoned, zeroing out all relevant data
would be a trivial operation.
</p><p>
There were various objections. <span   class="bold"><b>Alan Cox</b></span> pointed out that hard drives have become so
smart these days that it's hard to know exactly what they're doing in response to
a given command. As he put it, &ldquo;If you zero a sector [the disk is] perfectly
entitled to set a bit in a master index of zeroed sectors, and not bother actually
zeroing the data at all.&rdquo; Alan said that the disk simply had to accept user inputs and return the correct outputs, and everything happening behind the curtain was
entirely up to the hardware manufacturer.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Russ Dill</b></span> pointed out that a lot of user programs also made it more difficult
to know exactly where a file's data was on disk. The <span   class="bold"><b>vim</b></span> program, for example,
created temporary backup files, as did many other programs.
</p><p>
There was not much support for Alexander's patch. But I imagine the ability
to delete files permanently will come up again at some point. For kernel features
though, the goal always tends to be doing a thorough job that, in this case at
least, would indeed outwit the government overlords' efforts to recover the data.
</p><p>
There's an ongoing debate about <span   class="bold"><b>cgroups</b></span>, between the group of people who want to
implement cool features and the group of people who want to ensure security. The
security people always win, but the debate is rarely simple, and sometimes a cool
feature just needs to be rotated a little in order to match the security
requirements.
</p><p>
For example, <span   class="bold"><b>Aleksa Sarai</b></span> wanted to add a cool and useful feature limiting the
number of open processes allowed in a given virtual machine. This would prevent
certain types of denial-of-service attacks. The problem, as pointed out by
<span   class="bold"><b>Tejun
Heo</b></span>, was that an open process limit doesn't correspond to any actual limit on a
real system. And, there's a strong reluctance to put limits on anything that's not a
true resource, like RAM, disk space, number of CPUs and so on.
</p><p>
On the other hand, as <span   class="bold"><b>Austin Hemmelgarn</b></span> said, process IDs (PIDs) were an actual
limit on a real system, and Tejun agreed it might make sense to allow them to be
limited within a cgroup. And because that could be used to limit the number of open
processes, everyone could end up happy. But the feature had to be presented as
limiting an actual system resource, rather than limiting a relatively arbitrary
characteristic of a system.
</p><p>
The <span   class="bold"><b>tracing system</b></span> has been showing signs of outgrowing its infrastructure lately,
and <span   class="bold"><b>Steven Rostedt</b></span> recently posted some patches to fix that. Up until now, the
tracing directory used <span   class="bold"><b>DebugFS</b></span>. But as Steven said, tracing needed to create and
remove directories, and DebugFS didn't support that. So, tracing had been using
various hacks to get around it. Steven's solution was to create a new filesystem
called <span   class="bold"><b>TraceFS</b></span>,
specifically for the tracing system.
</p><p>
There were no major objections, but there were some technical obstacles to get
past. In particular, Steven discovered that the <span   class="bold"><b>perf
system</b></span> was hard-coded to
assume that the tracing system used DebugFS, so that had to be fixed before TraceFS
could go into the kernel.
</p><p>
Other issues came up; for example, <span   class="bold"><b>Greg
Kroah-Hartman</b></span> suggested basing TraceFS on
<span   class="bold"><b>KernFS</b></span>, and Steven considered that for a while. But it turned out that KernFS had a
lot of cgroup-related complexity that TraceFS didn't need, and <span   class="bold"><b>Al Viro</b></span> remarked,
&ldquo;It's not a good model for anything, other than an anti-hard-drugs poster ('don't
shoot that shit, or you might end up hallucinating
<span   class="emphasis"><em>this</em></span>').&rdquo; Ultimately, Steven
decided against KernFS.

I've touted the awesomeness of Calibre in the
past (<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/calibre-cloud" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/content/calibre-cloud</a>).
And although the
Web-based calibre2opds still is an awesome way to access your eBook
library, using a native Android app is even smoother. If you have your
Calibre library on your local network, using Calibre Companion ($3.99
in the Google Play Store), your Android device connects to your library
like a device connected via USB. It's possible to load books directly
onto your device without syncing your entire collection into the cloud!

</p></div></div><p>
I admittedly still use calibre2opds in combination with
Dropbox to make my library accessible remotely. But, if
you're concerned about your books being on the Web, Calibre
Companion is a local network solution. Check it out today at

I personally like Google's Chrome interface. It's simple, fast, elegant
and did I mention fast? Unfortunately, I don't like how locked down the
Chrome OS is on a Chromebook, nor do I like its total dependence on Google. I
also don't like the lack of ability to install Chrome easily on generic
hardware. Thankfully, Budgie is here to help.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11850budgief1.large.jpg"><img src="11850budgief1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
If you like the simplicity and speed of the Chrome interface, but
want a full-blown system underneath that deceptively simple GUI, I
urge you to give Budgie a try. You either can download the Evolve-OS
(<a href="http://evolve-os.com" target="_self">evolve-os.com</a>), or just install the PPA into a standard Ubuntu
system. I simply typed:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo apt-add-repository ppa:evolve-os/ppa
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install budgie-desktop
</pre>
</p><p>
Then log out, and when logging in, choose the Budgie desktop instead
of Unity. You'll find a very Chrome-like interface but on top of a
full-blown Linux system instead of Chrome! The preferences are fairly
simplistic, but the entire interface is designed to get out of the way
and let you work. Due to its blazing-fast speed and ease of use,
the Budgie Desktop is this month's Editors' Choice. Give it a try today!

I love Bitcoin. Ever since I first discovered it in 2010 and mined
thousands of them, I've been hooked on the technology, the concept and
even the software. (Sadly, I sold most of those thousands of Bitcoin
when they were less than a dollar. I'm still kicking myself.) One of
the frustrations with using Bitcoin, however, is that the blockchain
has gotten so large. It currently weighs in at a little less than 20GB,
and it takes about a week to download the first time you do so. There are
ways to jumpstart the download with a bootstrap file, but still, it's
a huge undertaking to run the standard Bitcoin client.
</p><p>
Enter MultiBit.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11850fossf1.large.jpg"><img src="11850fossf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
Although it doesn't have the entire blockchain, MultiBit does have all of
the security and encryption the standard Bitcoin client does. Because it
reads the Bitcoin network in real time, it takes seconds to sync up as
opposed to days. Sending and receiving Bitcoin with MultiBit is fast,
efficient and secure. Oh, and it's open-source, multiplatform and
under constant development! If you want to run a local Bitcoin client,
but don't want to download the entire blockchain, check out MultiBit at
<a href="http://multibit.org" target="_self">multibit.org</a>. (Also check out Electrum, a Python-based alternative
at <a href="http://electrum.org" target="_self">electrum.org</a>.)

I currently have the flu. Not the &ldquo;sorta queasy&rdquo; stomach flu, but the full
out Influenza with fever, aches and delirium-ridden nightmares. Bouts
of crippling illness tend to be my only chance to play games. Thankfully,
since I'm such a terrible gamer, being sick doesn't really hurt my skills
very much!
</p><p>
Today I was playing <span   class="emphasis"><em>Torchlight II</em></span> from Runic Games. I realized it was
just as simple for me to run this new, awesome game on Linux using
Steam as it is for any Windows user. Thanks to the Humble Bundle sales,
I have dozens and dozens of games that aren't cheesy knockoffs, but are
actual versions of real games. I think Steam plays a big part in getting
more and more games released for Linux, but whatever the reason, it's
a great time to be a gamer in an open-source operating system!

The screenshot here is just a section of my past Humble Bundle game
purchases. The Humble Bundle (which I've mentioned before) is a great
way to get inexpensive games. When you add Steam, you have yet another
way to play and buy games that work natively on your Linux system. If
you're a gamer, or just have the flu, go download some games:

<h2 class="title">It's Easier to Ask Forgiveness...</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #253, May 2015</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
...than to understand Linux permissions! Honestly though, that's
not really true. Linux permissions are simple and elegant, and once you
understand them, they're easy to work with. Octal notation gets a little funky,
but even that makes sense once you understand why it exists.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Users and Groups:</b></span>
</p><p>
First I need to address that Linux does have ACL support for file and
folder permissions. It's not how things work by default, however, and ACLs
were added to address the fine controls needed for some situations. Most
Linux systems rely on standard POSIX permissions. That's what I'm 
covering here. 
</p><p>
Every file has an owner and a group membership. If you type <tt  >ls
-l</tt>,
you'll see the owner and group on all the files and folders in your
current directory. POSIX permissions allow you to control read, write
and execute abilities for the user, group and a third set of users,
&ldquo;other&rdquo;. Using those three aspects on three different sets of users allows for
some fairly complex &ldquo;who can do what&rdquo; on a filesystem.
</p><p>
Figure 1 shows an example of what a file listing looks like. I've
separated the different sections showing which fields are which. Note
the first field is usually either a &ldquo;d&rdquo; or a &ldquo;-&rdquo;;
the former appears on
directories, and the latter appears on regular files. For files, the permissions
make straightforward sense. If the &ldquo;read&rdquo; bit is turned on, it means that
user (user, group or other) can read the contents of the file. If the
&ldquo;write&rdquo; bit is set, it can be written to, and if the
&ldquo;execute&rdquo; bit is
set, the file can be executed. Execute bits are usually set on binary
files or on scripts you want to run directly.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11850permf1.large.jpg"><img src="11850permf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Example File Listing
</p></div></div><p>
On folders, the permissions work almost the same: read means the ability
to see what files are in the folder, and write is the ability to save a
file into the folder. Execute is a little less obvious. When the
&ldquo;execute&rdquo;
bit is set, it means the user or group can change into the directory. So
the <tt  >cd</tt> command will work as long as you have execute access to a folder.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Changing Permissions:</b></span>
</p><p>
Although Linux systems usually come with fairly sane standards for what
permissions files are created with, it's often necessary to change
them. For that, you use the <tt  >chmod</tt> tool. The format is to use:

<pre     class="programlisting">
chmod u+rw,g-r,o+rwx file.txt
</pre>
</p><p>
Granted, that's a fairly complex example, but let's break it down. The
letters before the + or - are u for user, g for group and o for
other. Then you either add or take away (+ or -) whichever aspects you
desire. It's not required to specify all three user definitions, and they
can be lumped together like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
chmod ugo+rw file.txt
</pre>
</p><p>
It's also possible to leave &ldquo;ugo&rdquo; off if you want to change user, group and other at the same time. So the following examples all do the same
thing:

<pre     class="programlisting">
chmod ugo-rw file.txt
chmod -rw file.txt
chmod u-rw,g-rw,o-rw file.txt
</pre>
</p><p>
Although the &ldquo;ugo&rdquo; format is fairly robust, it's sometimes very complicated
to craft the string of pluses and minuses to get the exact permissions
string you want. That's where octal notation comes into play. It's a
little more confusing, but far more convenient once understood.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Octal Notation:</b></span>
</p><p>
In Figure 2, you can see I've shown the numeric value of each permission
bit. By simply adding the numbers, it's possible to create any possibility
of permissions with three numbers. Figure 3 shows a few examples of how
those can be figured out.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11850permf2.large.jpg"><img src="11850permf2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Numeric Value of Each Permission Bit
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11850permf3.large.jpg"><img src="11850permf3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Creating Permissions
</p></div></div><p>
So with octal notation, the following two chmod statements are
functionally the same:

<pre     class="programlisting">
chmod ug+rw,ug-x,o+r,o-wx file.txt
chmod 662 file.txt
</pre>
</p><p>
Although it's not a requirement to use octal notation for setting
permissions, it's usually the way it's done.
</p><p>
I urge you
to play with <tt  >chmod</tt> a bit until you get the results you expect when using
octal notation. Then, just for fun, see if you can string together a
bunch of pluses and minuses to get the same results!
</p><p>
Linux permissions are simple, elegant and allow for some very flexible
file-sharing options on a filesystem. We use them most often when
installing Web applications, because the Web server runs as a particular
user, and that user (or group) needs to have access to the files it's
attempting to serve.
