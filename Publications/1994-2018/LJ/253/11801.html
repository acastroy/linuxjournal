By combining simple tools, you can build an effective safe to store your
sensitive data.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe07580.0xeff1f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Through the years, I have settled on maintaining my sensitive data in
plain-text
files that I then encrypt asymmetrically. Although I take care to harden my
system and encrypt partitions with LUKS wherever possible, I want to secure my
most important data using higher-level tools, thereby lessening dependence on
the underlying system configuration. Many powerful tools and utilities exist in
this space, but some introduce unacceptable levels of &ldquo;bloat&rdquo; in one way or
another. Being a minimalist, I have little interest in dealing with GUI
applications that slow down my work flow or application-specific solutions
(such as browser password vaults) that are applicable only toward a subset of my
sensitive data. Working with text files affords greater flexibility over how my
data is structured and provides the ability to leverage standard tools I can
expect to find most anywhere.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe07580.0xeff408"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Asymmetric Encryption</b></p><p>
Asymmetric encryption, or public-key cryptography, relies on the use of two
keys: one of which is held private, while the other is published freely.
This
model offers greater security over the symmetric approach, which is based on
a
single key that must be shared between the sender and receiver. GnuPG is a
free
software implementation of the OpenPGP standard as defined by RFC4880.
GnuPG
supports both asymmetric and symmetric algorithms. Refer to
https://gnupg.org
for additional information.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe07580.0xeff618"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>GPG</b></p><p>
This article makes extensive use of GPG to interact with files stored in
your
safe. Many tutorials and HOWTOs exist that will walk you through how to
set up and manage your keys properly (<a href="https://www.gnupg.org/documentation/index.html" target="_self">https://www.gnupg.org/documentation/index.html</a>). It is highly recommended to configure
gpg-agent in order to avoid having to type your passphrase each time you
interact with your private key. One popular approach used for this job is
Keychain (<a href="http://www.funtoo.org/Keychain" target="_self">www.funtoo.org/Keychain</a>), because it also is capable of managing ssh-agent.
</p></div><p>
Let's take the classic example of managing credentials. This is a necessary
evil and while both pass (<a href="http://www.passwordstore.org" target="_self">www.passwordstore.org</a>) and
KeePassC (<a href="http://raymontag.github.io/keepassc" target="_self">raymontag.github.io/keepassc</a>) look interesting, I am not yet
convinced they would fit into my work flow. Also, I am definitely not lulled by
any &ldquo;copy to clipboard&rdquo; feature. You've all seen the inevitable clipboard spills
on IRC and such&mdash;no thanks! For the time being, let's fold
this job into a
&ldquo;safe&rdquo; concept by managing this data in a file. Each line in the file will
conform to a simple format of:

<pre     class="programlisting">
resource:userid:password
</pre>
</p><p>
Where &ldquo;resource&rdquo; is something mnemonic, such as an FQDN or even a hardware device
like a router that is limited to providing telnet access. Both
<tt  >userid</tt> and
<tt  >password</tt> fields are represented as hints. This hinting approach works nicely
given my conscious effort to limit the number of user IDs and passwords I
routinely use. This means a hint is all that is needed for muscle memory to
kick in. If a particular resource uses some exotic complexity rules, I 
quickly can understand the slight variation by modifying the hint accordingly. For
example, a hint of &ldquo;fo&rdquo; might end up as &ldquo;!fo&rdquo; or
&ldquo;fO&rdquo;. Another example of
achieving this balance between security and usability comes up when you need to
use an especially long password. One practical solution would be to combine
familiar passwords and document the hint accordingly. For example, a hint
representing a combination of &ldquo;fo&rdquo; and &ldquo;ba&rdquo; could
be represented as &ldquo;fo..ba&rdquo;.
Finally, the hinting approach provides reasonable fall-back protection since
the limited information would be of little use to an intruder.
</p><p>
Despite the obscurity, leaving this data in the clear would be silly and
irresponsible. Having GnuPG configured provides an opportunity to encrypt the
data using your private key. After creating the file, my work flow was looking
something like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">

$ gpg --ear &lt;my key id&gt; &lt;file&gt;
$ shred -u &lt;file&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
Updating the file would involve decrypting, editing and repeating the steps
above. This was tolerable for a while since, practically speaking, I'm not
establishing credentials on a daily basis. However, I knew the day would
eventually come when the tedious routine would become too much of a burden.
As expected, that day came when I found myself keeping insurance-related notes
that I then considered encrypting using the same technique. Now, I am talking
about managing multiple files&mdash;a clear sign that it is time to write a script
to act as a wrapper. My requirements were simple:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Leverage common tools, such as GPG, shred and bash built-ins.
</p></li><li><p>
Reduce typing for common operations (encrypt, decrypt and so on).
</p></li><li><p>
Keep things clean and readable in order to accommodate future growth.
</p></li><li><p>
Accommodate plain-text files but avoid having to micro-manage them.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
Interestingly, the vim-gnupg Vim plugin (<a href="https://github.com/jamessan/vim-gnupg" target="_self">https://github.com/jamessan/vim-gnupg</a>) easily can handle these
requirements,
because it integrates seamlessly with files ending in .asc, .gpg or .pgp
extensions. Despite its abilities, I wanted to avoid having to manage multiple
encrypted files and instead work with a higher-level &ldquo;vault&rdquo; of sorts. With
that goal in mind, the initial scaffolding was cobbled together:

<pre     class="programlisting">

#!/bin/bash

CONF=${HOME}/.saferc
[ -f $CONF ] &amp;&amp; . $CONF
[ -z "$SOURCE_DIR" ] &amp;&amp; SOURCE_DIR=${HOME}/safe
SOURCE_BASE=$(basename $SOURCE_DIR)
TAR_ENC=$HOME/${SOURCE_BASE}.tar.gz.asc
TAR="tar -C $(dirname $SOURCE_DIR)"

usage() {
cat &lt;&lt;EOF
Usage: $(basename $0) OPTION
Options:
-c    create the safe
-x    extract contents
EOF
}

create_safe() {
}

extract_safe() {
}

[ $# -ge 1 ] || { usage; exit 1; }

while getopts "cx" opt; do
  case $opt in
    c)
      create_safe
      ;;
    x)
      extract_safe
      ;;
    *)
      usage
      exit 1
      ;;
  esac
done

</pre>
</p><p>
This framework is simple enough to build from and establishes some ground
rules. For starters, you're going to avoid micro-managing files by maintaining
them in a single tar archive. The <tt  >$SOURCE_DIR</tt> variable will fall back to
$HOME/safe unless it is defined in ~/.saferc. Thinking ahead, this will allow
people to collaborate on this project without clobbering the variable over and
over. Either way, the value of <tt  >$SOURCE_DIR</tt> is used as a base for the
<tt  >$SOURCE_BASE</tt>, <tt  >$TAR_ENC</tt> and
<tt  >$TAR</tt> variables. If my ~/.saferc were to define
<tt  >$SOURCE_DIR</tt> as $HOME/foo, my safe will be maintained as $HOME/foo.tar.gz.asc.
If I choose not to maintain a ~/.saferc file, my safe will reside in
$HOME/safe.tar.gz.asc. 
</p><p>
Back to this primitive script, let's limit the focus
simply to being able to open and close the safe. Let's work on the
<tt  >create_safe()</tt> function first so you have something
to extract later: 

<pre     class="programlisting">
create_safe() {
  [ -d $SOURCE_DIR ] || { "Missing directory: $SOURCE_DIR"; exit 1; }
  $TAR -cz $SOURCE_BASE | gpg -ear $(whoami) --yes -o $TAR_ENC
  find $SOURCE_DIR -type f | xargs shred -u
  rm -fr $SOURCE_DIR
}
</pre>
</p><p>
The <tt  >create_safe()</tt> function is looking pretty good at
this point, since it
automates a number of tedious steps. First, you ensure that the archive's base
directory exists. If so, you compress the directory into a tar archive and pipe
the output straight into GPG in order to encrypt the end result. Notice how
the result of <tt  >whoami</tt> is used for GPG's
<tt  >-r</tt> option. This assumes the private
GPG key can be referenced using the same ID that is logged in to the system.
This is strictly a convenience, as I have taken care to keep these elements in
sync, but it will need to be modified if your setup is different. In fact, I
could see eventually supporting an override of sorts with the ~/.saferc
approach. For now though, let's put that idea on the back burner. Finally, the
function calls the shred binary on all files within the base directory. This
solves the annoying &ldquo;Do I have a plain-text version laying
around?&rdquo; dilemma by
automating the cleanup.
</p><p>
Now you should be able to create the safe. Assuming no ~/.saferc exists and the
$PATH environment variable contains the directory containing safe.sh, you can
begin to test this script:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ cd
$ mkdir safe
$ for i in $(seq 5); do echo "this is secret #$i" &gt; 
 &#8618;safe/file${i}.txt; done
$ safe.sh -c
</pre>
</p><p>
You now should have a file named safe.tar.gz.asc in your home directory. This
is an encrypted tarball containing the five files previously written to the ~/safe
directory. You then cleaned things up by shredding each file and finally
removing the ~/safe directory. This is probably a good time to recognize
you are
basing the design around an expectation to manage a single directory of files.
For my purposes, this is acceptable. If subdirectories are needed, the code
would need to be refactored accordingly.
</p><p>
Now that you are able to create your safe, let's focus on
being able to open it. The following <tt  >extract_safe()</tt> function will do the trick
nicely:

<pre     class="programlisting">
extract_safe() {
  [ -f $TAR_ENC ] || { "Missing file: $TAR_ENC"; exit 1; }
  gpg --batch -q -d $TAR_ENC | $TAR -zx
}
</pre>
</p><p>
Essentially, you are just using GPG and tar in the opposite order. After opening
the safe by running the script with <tt  >-x</tt>, you should see the ~/safe directory.
</p><p>
Things seem to be moving along, but you easily can see the need to list the
contents of your safe, because you do not want to have to open it each time in order
to know what is inside. Let's add a <tt  >list_safe()</tt> function:

<pre     class="programlisting">
list_safe() {
  [ -f $TAR_ENC ] || { "Missing file: $TAR_ENC"; exit 1; }
  gpg --batch -q -d $TAR_ENC | tar -zt
}
</pre>
</p><p>
No big deal there, as you are just using tar's ability to list contents rather
than extract them. While you are here, you can start DRYing this up a bit by
consolidating all the file and directory tests into a single function. You 
even can add a handy little backup feature to <tt  >scp</tt> your archive to a remote
host. Listing 1 is an updated version of the script up to this point.

done

</pre></div><p>
The new <tt  >-b</tt> option requires a hostname passed as an argument. When used, the
archive will be <tt  >scp</tt>'d accordingly. As a bonus, you
can use the <tt  >-b</tt> option
multiple times in order to back up to multiple hosts. This means you have the
option to configure a routine cron job to automate your backups while still
being able to run a &ldquo;one off&rdquo; at any point. Of course, you will want to manage
your SSH keys and configure ssh-agent if you plan to automate your backups.
Recently, I have converted over to pam_ssh (<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/SSH_keys#pam_ssh" target="_self">https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/SSH_keys#pam_ssh</a>) in order to fire up my
ssh-agent,
but that's a different discussion. 
</p><p>
Back to the code, there is
a small <tt  >is_or_die()</tt> function that accepts an argument but falls
back to the archive specified in <tt  >$TAR_ENC</tt>. This will help keep the script lean
and mean since, depending on the option(s) used, you know you are going to want
to check for one or more files and/or directories before taking action.
</p><p>
For the remainder of this article, I'm going to avoid writing out the updated script
in its entirety. Instead, I simply provide small snippets as new
functionality is added. 
</p><p>
For starters, how about adding the ability to output
the contents of a single file being stored in your safe? All you would need to do
is check for the file's presence and modify your tar options appropriately. In
fact, you have an opportunity to avoid re-inventing the wheel by simply
refactoring your <tt  >extract_safe()</tt> function. The updated function will operate on a
single file if called accordingly. Otherwise, it will operate on the entire
archive. Worth noting is the extra step to provide a bit of
user-friendliness. Using the default <tt  >$SOURCE_DIR</tt> of ~/safe, the user can pass
either safe/my_file or just my_file to the -o option:

<pre     class="programlisting">

list_safe() {
  is_or_die
  gpg --batch -q -d $TAR_ENC | tar -zt | sort
}

search_safe() {
  is_or_die
  FILE=${1#*/}
  for f in $(list_safe); do
    ARCHIVE_FILE=${f#$SOURCE_BASE/}
    [ "$ARCHIVE_FILE" == "$FILE" ] &amp;&amp; return
  done
  false
}

extract_safe() {
  is_or_die
  OPTS=" -zx"
  [ $# -eq 1 ] &amp;&amp; OPTS+=" $SOURCE_BASE/${1#*/} -O"
  gpg --batch -q -d $TAR_ENC | $TAR $OPTS
}

</pre>
</p><p>
The final version of safe.sh is maintained at
<a href="https://github.com/windowsrefund/safe" target="_self">https://github.com/windowsrefund/safe</a>. It supports a few
more use cases, such as
the ability to add and remove files. When adding these features, I tried to
avoid actually having to extract the archive to disk as a precursor to
modifying its contents. I was unsuccessful due to GNU tar's refusal to read
from STDIN when <tt  >-r</tt> is used. A nice alternative to connecting GPG with tar via
pipes might exist in GnuPG's gpg-zip binary. However, the Arch package
maintainer appears to have included only the gpg-zip man page. In short, I
prefer the &ldquo;keep things as simple as possible; but no simpler&rdquo; approach. If
anyone is interested in improving the methods used to add and remove files,
feel free to submit your pull requests. This also applies to the
<tt  >edit_safe()</tt>
function, although I foresee refactoring that at some point given some recent
activity with the vim-gnupg plugin (<a href="https://github.com/jamessan/vim-gnupg/issues/24" target="_self">https://github.com/jamessan/vim-gnupg/issues/24</a>).

Integrating with Mutt</h2></div></div><p>
My MUA of choice is mutt. Like many people, I have configured my mail client to
interact with multiple IMAP accounts, each requiring authentication.
In
general, these credentials simply could be hard-coded in one or more
configuration files but that would lead to shame, regret and terrible
things.
Instead, let's use a slight variation of Aaron Toponce's clever approach
(<a href="https://pthree.org/2012/01/07/encrypted-mutt-imap-smtp-passwords" target="_self">https://pthree.org/2012/01/07/encrypted-mutt-imap-smtp-passwords</a>)
that empowers mutt with the ability to decrypt and source sensitive
data:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ echo "set my_pass_imap = l@mepassw0rd" &gt; /tmp/pass_mail
$ safe.sh -a /tmp/pass_mail
</pre>
</p><p>
Now that your safe contains the pass_mail file; you have mutt read it with this
line in your ~/.muttrc:


<pre     class="programlisting">
source "safe.sh -o pass_mail |"
</pre>
</p><p>
By reading the file, mutt initializes a variable you have named
<tt  >my_pass_imap</tt>.
That variable can be used in other areas of mutt's configuration. For example,
another area of your mutt configuration can use these lines:

<pre     class="programlisting">
set imap_user = "my_user_id"
set imap_pass = $my_pass_imap
set folder = "imaps://example.com"
set smtp_url = smtp://$imap_user:$imap_pass@example.com
</pre>
</p><p>
By combining appropriately named variables with mutt's ability to support
multiple accounts, it is possible to use this technique to manage all
of your mail-related credentials securely while never needing to store plain-text copies
on your hard drive.
