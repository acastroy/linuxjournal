Django's migrations make it easy to define and update your database schema.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2607580.0x26ff358"></a></h2></div></div><p>
In my last two articles, I looked at the Django Web application
framework, written in Python. Django's documentation describes it as
an MTV framework, in which the acronym stands for model, template
and views.
</p><p>
When a request comes in to a Django application, the application's URL
patterns determine which view method will be invoked. The view method
can then, as I mentioned in previous articles, directly return
content to the user or send the contents of a template. The template
typically contains not only HTML, but also directives, unique to
Django, which allow you to pass along variable values, execute loops
and display text conditionally.
</p><p>
You can create lots of interesting Web applications with just views
and templates. However, most Web applications also use a database, and
in many cases, that means a relational database. Indeed, it's a rare
Web application that doesn't use a database of some sort.
</p><p>
For many years, Web applications typically spoke directly with the
database, sending SQL via text strings. Thus, you would say something
like:

<pre     class="programlisting">
s = "SELECT first_name, last_name FROM Users where id = 1"
</pre>
</p><p>
You then would send that SQL to the server via a database client
library and retrieve the results using that library. Although this
approach does allow you to harness the power of SQL directly, it means
that your application code now contains text strings with another
language. This mix of (for example) Python and SQL can become
difficult to maintain and work with. Besides, in Python, you're used to
working with objects, attributes and methods. Why can't you access
the database that way?
</p><p>
The answer, of course, is that you can't, because relational databases
eventually do need to receive SQL in order to function
correctly. Thus, many programs use an ORM (object-relational
mapper), which translates method calls and object attributes into
SQL. There is a well established ORM in the Python world known as
SQLAlchemy. However, Django has opted to use its own ORM, with which
you define your database tables, as well as insert, update and retrieve
information in those tables.
</p><p>
So in this article, I cover how you create models in Django, how you can
create and apply migrations based on those model definitions, and how
you can interact with your models from within a Django application.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2607580.0x26ff778"></a>
Models</h2></div></div><p>
A &ldquo;model&rdquo; in the Django world is a Python class that represents a
table in the database. If you are creating an appointment calendar,
your database likely will have at least two different tables:
People and Appointments. To represent these in Django, you create two
Python classes: Person and Appointment. Each of these models is defined
in the models.py file inside your application.
</p><p>
This is a good place to point out that models are specific to a
particular Django application. Each Django project contains one or
more applications, and it is assumed that you can and will reuse
applications within different projects.
</p><p>
In the Django project I have created for this article
(&ldquo;atfproject&rdquo;), I
have a single application (&ldquo;atfapp&rdquo;). Thus, I can define my model
classes in atfproject/atfapp/models.py. That file, by default,
contains a single line:

<pre     class="programlisting">
from django.db import models
</pre>
</p><p>
Given the example of creating an appointment calendar, let's start by
defining your Appointment model:

<pre     class="programlisting">
from django.db import models

class Appointment(models.Model):
starts_at = models.DateTimeField()
ends_at = models.DateTimeField()
meeting_with = models.TextField()
notes = models.TextField()
def __str__(self):
    return "{} - {}: Meeting with {} ({})".format(self.starts_at,
                          self.ends_at,
                          self.meeting_with,
                          self.notes)
</pre>
</p><p>
Notice that in Django models, you define the columns as class
attributes, using a Python object known as a descriptor. Descriptors
allow you to work with attributes (such as appointment.starts_at), but
for methods to be fired in the back. In the case of database
models, Django uses the descriptors to retrieve, save, update and
delete your data in the database.
</p><p>
The one actual instance method in the above code is __str__, which
every Python object can use to define how it gets turned into a
string. Django uses the __str__ method to present your models.
</p><p>
Django provides a large number of field types that you can use in your
models, matching (to a large degree) the column types available in
most popular databases. For example, the above model uses two
DateTimeFields and two TextFields. As you can imagine, these are
mapped to the DATETIME and TEXT columns in SQL. These field definitions
not only determine what type of column is defined in the database, but
also the way in which Django's admin interface and forms allow users
to enter data. In addition to TextField, you can have BooleanFields,
EmailFields (for e-mail addresses), FileFields (for uploading files)
and even GenericIPAddressField, among others.
</p><p>
Beyond choosing a field type that's appropriate for your data, you
also can pass one or more options that modify how the field
behaves. For example, DateField and DateTimeField allow you to pass an
&ldquo;auto_now&rdquo; keyword argument. If passed and set to True, Django 
automatically will set the field to the current time when a new record is
stored. This isn't necessarily behavior that you always will want, but
it is needed frequently enough that Django provides it. That's
true for the other fields, as well&mdash;they provide options that you
might not always need, but that really can come in handy.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2607580.0x26ffd50"></a>
Migrations</h2></div></div><p>
So, now you have a model! How can you start to use it? Well, first
you somehow need to translate your model into SQL that your database can
use. This means, before continuing any further, you need to tell
Django what database you're using. This is done in your project's
configuration file; in my case, that would be
atfproject/atfproject/settings.py. That file defines a number of
variables that are used throughout Django. One of them is DATABASES,
a dictionary that defines the databases used in your project. (Yes,
it is possible to use more than one, although I'm not sure if that's
normally such a good idea.)
</p><p>
By default, the definition of DATABASES is:

<pre     class="programlisting">
DATABASES = {
'default': {
    'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
    'NAME': os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'db.sqlite3'),
}
}
</pre>
</p><p>
In other words, Django comes, out of the box, defined to use
SQLite. SQLite is a wonderful database for most purposes, but it is
woefully underpowered for a real, production-ready database
application that will be serving the general public. For such cases,
you'll want something more powerful, such as my favorite database,
PostgreSQL. Nevertheless, for the purposes of this little experiment
here, you can use SQLite.
</p><p>
One of the many advantages of SQLite is that it uses one file for each
database; if the file exists, SQLite reads the data from there.
And if the file doesn't yet exist, it is created upon first use. Thus,
by using SQLite, you're able to avoid any configuration.
</p><p>
However, you still somehow need to convert your Python code to SQL
definitions that SQLite can use. This is done with
&ldquo;migrations&rdquo;.
</p><p>
Now, if you're coming from the world of Ruby on Rails, you are
familiar with the idea of migrations&mdash;they describe the changes
made to the database, such that you easily can move from an older
version of the database to a newer one. I remember the days before
migrations, and they were significantly less enjoyable&mdash;their
invention really has made Web development easier.
</p><p>
Migrations are latecomers to the world of Django. There
long have been external libraries, such as South, but migrations in
Django itself are relatively new. Rails users might be surprised to
find that in Django, developers don't create migrations
directly.
Rather, you tell Django to examine your model definitions, to compare
those definitions with the current state of the database and then to
generate an appropriate migration.
</p><p>
Given that I just created a model, I go back into the project's root
directory, and I execute:

<pre     class="programlisting">
django-admin.py makemigrations
</pre>
</p><p>
This command, which you execute in the project's root directory, tells
Django to look at the &ldquo;atfapp&rdquo; application, to compare its models with
the database and then to generate migrations.
</p><p>
Now, if you encounter an error at this point (and I often do!), you
should double-check to make sure your application has been added
to the project. It's not sufficient to have your app in the Django
project's directory. You also must add it to INSTALLED_APPS, a tuple
in the project's settings.py. For example, in my case, the
definition looks like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
INSTALLED_APPS = (
'django.contrib.admin',
'django.contrib.auth',
'django.contrib.contenttypes',
'django.contrib.sessions',
'django.contrib.messages',
'django.contrib.staticfiles',
'atfapp'
)
</pre>
</p><p>
The output of <tt  >makemigrations</tt> on my system looks like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Migrations for 'atfapp':
  0001_initial.py:
- Create model Appointment
</pre>
</p><p>
In other words, Django now has described the difference between the
current state of the database (in which &ldquo;Appointment&rdquo; doesn't exist)
and the final state, in which there will be an &ldquo;Appointment&rdquo; table.
If you're curious to see what this migration looks like, you can
always look in the atfapp/migrations directory, in which you'll see
Python code.
</p><p>
Didn't I say that the migration will describe the needed database
updates in SQL? Yes, but the description originally is written in
Python. This allows you, at least in theory, to migrate to a
different database server, if and when you want to do so.
</p><p>
Now that you have the migrations, it's time to apply them. In the
project's root directory, I now write:

<pre     class="programlisting">
django-admin.py migrate
</pre>
</p><p>
And then see:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Operations to perform:
  Apply all migrations: admin, contenttypes, auth, atfapp, sessions
Running migrations:
  Applying contenttypes.0001_initial... OK
  Applying auth.0001_initial... OK
  Applying admin.0001_initial... OK
  Applying atfapp.0001_initial... OK
  Applying sessions.0001_initial... OK
</pre>
</p><p>
The above shows that the &ldquo;atfapp&rdquo; initial migration was run. But where
did all of these other migrations come from? The answer is simple.
Django's user model and other built-in models also are described using
migrations and, thus, are applied along with mine, if that hasn't yet
happened in my Django project.
</p><p>
You might have noticed that each migration is given a number. This
allows Django to keep track of the history of the migrations and also
to apply more than one, if necessary. You can create a migration,
then create a new migration and then apply both of them together, if
you want to keep the changes separate.
</p><p>
Or, perhaps more practically, you can work with other people on a
project, each of whom is updating the database. Each of them can
create their own migrations and commit them into the shared Git
repository. If and when you retrieve the latest changes from Git,
you'll get all of the migrations from your coworkers and then
can apply them to your app.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2607580.0x2700900"></a>
Migrating Further</h2></div></div><p>
Let's say that you modify your model. How do you create and apply a new
migration? The answer actually is fairly straightforward. Modify the
model and ask Django to create an appropriate migration. Then you can
run the newly created migration.
</p><p>
So, let's add a new field to the Appointment model, &ldquo;minutes&rdquo;, to keep
track of what happened during the meeting. I add a single line to the
model, such that the file now looks like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
from django.db import models

class Appointment(models.Model):
starts_at = models.DateTimeField()
ends_at = models.DateTimeField()
meeting_with = models.TextField()
notes = models.TextField()
minutes = models.TextField()    # New line here!
def __str__(self):
    return "{} - {}: Meeting with {} ({})".format(self.starts_at,
                          self.ends_at,
                          self.meeting_with,
                          self.notes)
</pre>
</p><p>
Now I once again run <tt  >makemigrations</tt>, but this time, Django is
comparing the current definition of the model with the current state
of the database. It seems like a no-brainer for Django to deal with,
and it should be, except for one thing: Django defines columns, by
default, to forbid NULL values. If I add the &ldquo;minutes&rdquo; column, which
doesn't allow NULL values, I'll be in trouble for existing
rows. Django thus asks me whether I want to choose a default value to
put in this field or if I'd prefer to stop the migration before it
begins and to adjust my definitions.
</p><p>
One of the things I love about migrations is that they help you 
avoid stupid mistakes like this one. I'm going to choose the first
option, indicating that &ldquo;whatever&rdquo; is the (oh-so-helpful) default
value. Once I have done that, Django finishes with the migration's
definition and writes it to disk. Now I can, once again, apply the
pending migrations:

<pre     class="programlisting">
django-admin.py migrate
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2607580.0x2af8f70"></a></h2></div></div><p>
And I see:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Operations to perform:
  Apply all migrations: admin, contenttypes, auth, atfapp, sessions
Running migrations:
  Applying atfapp.0002_appointment_minutes... OK
</pre>
</p><p>
Sure enough, the new migration has been applied!
</p><p>
Of course, Django could have guessed as to my intentions. However, in
this case and in most others, Django follows the Python rule of thumb
in that it's better to be explicit than implicit and to avoid
guessing.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2607580.0x2af91d8"></a>
Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Django's models allow you to create a variety of different fields in a
database-independent way. Moreover, Django creates migrations between
different versions of your database, making it easy to iterate database
definitions as a project moves forward, even if there are multiple
developers working on it.
</p><p>
In my next article, I plan to look at how you can use models that you have defined
from within your Django application.
