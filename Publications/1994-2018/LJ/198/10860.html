Last month, I explored exit codes and how decent error correction in
your shell scripts always should include testing the value of $? after
each meaningful command. Writing bulletproof shell scripts also involves
generous use of the test command too, a typical sequence being
something like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
if [ ! -d $DIRECTORY ] ; then
  echo "Error: Directory $DIRECTORY doesn't exist."
  exit 1
fi

date &gt; $DIRECTORY/$file
if [ $? -ne 0 ] ; then
  echo "Error: failed with error $? trying to create $file"
  exit 1
fi
</pre>
</p><p>
That reminds me, I talk about the test command, but you don't
see me actually using it above. Actually, you do. It turns out, for reasons
of coding clarity, there's a file called [ in your filesystem
that's a link (a hard link) to the test command:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ls -l /bin/{[,test}
-r-xr-xr-x  2 root  wheel  63184 May 18  2009 /bin/[
-r-xr-xr-x  2 root  wheel  63184 May 18  2009 /bin/test
</pre>
</p><p>
Old-school script authors use <tt  >if test
&lt;condition&gt;</tt>,
and you'll
sometimes see that show up, but it's rare nowadays.
</p><p>
This month, I want to finish this discussion by exploring how the
return command within your shell scripts allows you to send
information back from functions within the script itself.

Figuring Out Daylight Hours</h2></div></div><p>
Let's say you're busy programming some sort of game and find that you
want to be able to ascertain whether it's daytime or nighttime when the
program runs. Perhaps you have a graphical background that changes, just as
Gmail has some themes that change based on your local weather.
</p><p>
&ldquo;Aha!&rdquo; I can already hear you saying, &ldquo;figuring out daytime is
trickier than you think, Dave!&rdquo; You're right, of course, but I'll
get to that in phase two. In the first phase of this function, let's create
a stub that dumbly assumes that 8:00am&ndash;6:00pm is daytime, and the rest of
the day is nighttime.
</p><p>
This can be implemented easily enough:

<pre     class="programlisting">
hour=$(date +%H)
if [ $hour -ge 8 -a $hour -le 18 ] ; then
  yes, it's daytime
else
  no, it's nighttime
fi
</pre>
</p><p>
That's fine, but how do you communicate that with the rest of your script
without having the entire script live within some big, ugly, if-then-else
statement? More important, what about when you want to make the test far
more sophisticated, where it's getting sunrise/sunset times from the
Internet for the current date and location?
</p><p>
Let's write a function that returns true if it's daytime and false
otherwise. Something like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
function isdaytime
{
  hour=$(date +%H)
  if [ $hour -ge 8 -a $hour -le 18 ] ; then
    return 1
  else
    return 0
  fi
}
</pre>
</p><p>
You can reference this in your script within an if statement, as follows:

<pre     class="programlisting">
if isdaytime ; then
</pre>
</p><p>
One of the glitches with this is that you need to use the counter-intuitive return code
of 1 for failure and 0 for success. This is similar to using the
exit command: you exit with 0 for success and anything else for failure.
Another glitch you may recall from last month is that if you are going to
be testing the return code, you easily can get messed up if there are any other
commands between the invocation and the test&mdash;including a friendly debugging
echo statement&mdash;because the $? will be the exit code of the most recently
invoked function or program.
</p><p>
Assuming you want to save the return code for later use, you could
invoke the function like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
isdaytime ; daytime=$?
</pre>
</p><p>
At this point you may think, &ldquo;Wait, why not do it like this?&rdquo;

<pre     class="programlisting">
function isdaytime
{
  hour=$(date +%H)
  if [ $hour -ge 8 -a $hour -le 18 ] ; then
    daytime=1
  else
    daytime=0
  fi
}
</pre>
</p><p>
Any serious programmer will know the answer. It's bad form to have
subroutines or functions set or alter global variables. Why? Because
debugging becomes impossible when variables are set or altered anywhere in
the script.
</p><p>
Let's seek to be reasonably elegant with our scripting because: a)
it's good form, and b) it leads to more easily understood scripts, which
is the point of this column, right?
So, get serious, and just change the function to return 0 on success and 1 on failure.
</p><p>
Now that you have a function you can expand later and have a way to
return a true/false value to the calling script, how might it be utilized?
</p><p>
Here's one way:

<pre     class="programlisting">
if isdaytime ; then
  echo it is daytime
else
  echo it is nighttime
fi
</pre>
</p><p>
Pretty trivial, but armed with this basic skeleton, let's have another
look at the function itself.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1230580.0x1329118"></a>
Sunrise, Sunset</h2></div></div><p>
Don't worry, I won't burst into a song from <span   class="emphasis"><em>Fiddler on the Roof</em></span>, but
sunrise and sunset times are very dependent on not only the time of year but
also on your location.
</p><p>
After digging around quite a bit, it seems like Almanac.com is one of the
easiest sites to work with, so that's what I'll use. A sunrise/sunset query
to Almanac.com ends up with a URL of this form:
http://www.almanac.com/astronomy/rise/zipcode/80302/2010-08-01.
</p><p>
You'll have to use <tt  >date</tt> to calculate the current date in the
proper format and hard-code the local zipcode into the function.
</p><p>
As with most sites, the HTML generated by the Almanac.com result is not
parse-friendly, so I had to dig around for a while to figure out how to
proceed. Here's what I came up with:


<pre     class="programlisting">

yourzip="80302"      # set this to your local zip code

request="http://www.almanac.com/astronomy/rise/zipcode"

thedate="$(date +%Y-%m-%d)"
url="$request/$yourzip/$thedate"
curl --silent "$url" | grep rise_nextprev | \
  cut -d\&lt; -f28-30

</pre>
</p><p>
You can see that the zipcode is indeed hard-coded, and notice how I use the $()
notation to grab the date in YYYY-MM-DD format. Curl gives you the resultant
HTML page, grep finds the one line you're interested in, and then
cut chops out the following snippet:

<pre     class="programlisting">

td&gt; 5:38 A.M.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; 8:34 P.M.

</pre>
</p><p>
There are a few more hoops to jump through, so you can pull out the hour and minute of
sunrise and sunset separately (as you'll have to test that way).
Here's the code I came up with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
raw="$(/usr/bin/curl --silent "$url" | \
  grep rise_nextprev | cut -d\&lt;-f28-30)"
sunrise="$(echo $raw | cut -d\  -f2)"
sunset="$(echo $raw | cut -d\  -f4)"
srh=$(echo $sunrise | cut -d: -f1)
srm=$(echo $sunrise | cut -d: -f2)
ssh=$(echo $sunset | cut -d: -f1)
ssm=$(echo $sunset | cut -d: -f2)
</pre>
</p><p>
You could make it a bit faster by avoiding the intermediate calculations of
sunrise and sunset, but on modern Linux systems, it should
be a matter of milliseconds, so let's leave it just like that.
</p><p>
There's one more important tweak: sunset hour (ssh) needs to be on a
24-hour clock, as that's what you're getting from the date
invocation shown earlier. It turns out that you can drop the cut
subshell invocation into a calculation:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ssh=$(( $(echo $sunset | cut -d: -f1) + 12 ))
</pre>
</p><p>
Yes, it works. It looks like I'm moving into LISP territory, but
fortunately not!
</p><p>
To work properly, the script needs to do three tests:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Whether it's sunrise hour and greater than sunrise minute.
</p></li><li><p>
Whether it's greater than sunrise hour but less than sunset hour.
</p></li><li><p>
Whether it's sunset hour but less than sunset minute.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Here's how that looks as script:

<pre     class="programlisting">
if [ $hour -eq $srh -a $min -ge $srm ] ; then
  return 0    # special case of sunrise hour
fi

if [ $hour -gt $srh -a $hour -lt $ssh ] ; then
  return 0    # easy: after sunrise, before sunset
fi

if [ $hour -eq $ssh -a $min -le $ssm ] ; then
  return 0    # special case: sunset hour
fi
</pre>
