Linux <span   class="bold"><b>hibernation</b></span> may be getting faster soon, or maybe just
eventually. <span   class="bold"><b>Nigel Cunningham</b></span> came up with an entirely new approach to
how to shut down each part of the system, such that it all could be
stored on disk and brought back up again quickly. Unfortunately, <span   class="bold"><b>Pavel
Machek</b></span> and <span   class="bold"><b>Rafael J. Wysocki</b></span>, the two co-maintainers of the current
hibernation code, found his approach to be overly complex and so
difficult to implement, that it really never could be accomplished.
Nigel had more faith in his idea though. He felt that exactly those
places that Pavel and Rafael had found to be overly complex actually were 
the relatively simpler portions to do. There was no agreement during
the thread of discussion, so it's not clear whether Nigel will go
ahead with his idea.
</p><p>
Some filesystems, notably <span   class="bold"><b>FAT</b></span>, have trouble slicing and dicing files
into smaller pieces without having a lot of extra room available on
the disk to copy the data. But logically, it shouldn't be necessary
to copy any data, if the data isn't changing. <span   class="bold"><b>Nikanth
Karthikesan</b></span>
wanted to split up files even when the disk was virtually full, so he
wrote a few system calls, <span   class="bold"><b>sys_split()</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>sys_join()</b></span>, to alert the
system to the fact that no copying would be necessary. There was some
debate over the quality of Nikanth's code, but <span   class="bold"><b>David
Pottage</b></span> also
pointed out that this type of feature could turn video editing from a
many-hour task to a many-minute task, in certain key cases. He
remarked, &ldquo;Video files are very big, so a simple edit of removing a
few minutes here and there in an hour-long HD recoding will involve
copying many gigabytes from one file to another.&rdquo; In general,
developers need a pretty strong reason to add new system calls, so
it's not yet clear whether Nikanth's code will be included, even if he
addresses the various technical issues that were raised in the
discussion.
</p><p>
One thing that can happen on any running system is that RAM bits can
flip as the result of high-energy particles passing through the chip.
This happens in space, but also on the ground. <span   class="bold"><b>Brian
Gordon</b></span> recently
asked about ways of fixing those <span   class="bold"><b>Single Event
Upsets</b></span> (SEUs). <span   class="bold"><b>Andi
Kleen</b></span> and others suggested using <span   class="bold"><b>ECC</b></span> (Error Correction Codes) RAM,
which could compensate for a single bit flip and could detect more
than one bit flip. But Brian was interested in regular systems that
were built on a budget and didn't have access to high-priced
error-correcting RAM. Unfortunately, Andi said that this would be a
very difficult feature to implement. Brian had talked about some kind
of system that would use checksums and redundancy to maintain memory
integrity, but Andi felt that even if that could be implemented in the
kernel, it probably would require the user-space application to be
aware of the situation as well. So that wouldn't be a very
general-purpose solution after all. Brian may keep researching this,
but it seemed like he really wanted to find a general solution that
wouldn't require rewriting any user applications.

<h2 class="title">Controlling Your Processes</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Joey Bernard</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #198, October 2010</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
To use a stage metaphor, all the processes
you want to run on your machine are like actors, and you are the director.
You control when and how they run. But, how can you do this? Well,
let's look at the possibilities.
</p><p>
The first step is to run the executable. Normally, when you run a program,
all the input and output is connected to the console. You see the
output from the program and can type in input at the keyboard. If you add
an &amp; to the end of a program, this connection to the console is
severed. Your program now runs in the background, and you can continue
working on the command line. When you run an executable, the shell actually
creates a child process and runs your executable in that structure.
Sometimes, however, you don't want to do that. Let's say you've decided no
shell out there is good enough, so you're going to write your own.
When you're doing testing, you want to run it as your shell, but you
probably don't want to have it as your login shell until you've hammered out
all the bugs. You can run your new shell from the command line
with the exec function:

<pre     class="programlisting">
exec myshell
</pre>
</p><p>
This tells the shell to replace itself with your new shell
program. To your new shell, it will look like it's your login
shell&mdash;very
cool. You also can use this to load menu programs in restricted systems.
That way, if your users kill off the menu program, they will be logged out,
just like killing off your login shell. This might be useful in some cases.
</p><p>
Now that your program is running, what can you do with it? If you need
to pause your program temporarily (maybe to look up some other
information or run some other program), you can do so by typing Ctrl-z
(Ctrl and z at the same time). This pauses your program and places it in
the background. You can do this over and over again, collecting a list of
paused and &ldquo;backgrounded&rdquo; jobs. To find out what jobs are sitting in the
background, use the <tt  >jobs</tt> shell function. This prints out a
list of all background jobs, with output that looks like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
[1]+  Stopped             man bash
</pre>
</p><p>
If you also want to get the process IDs for those jobs, use the
<tt  >-l</tt> option:

<pre     class="programlisting">
[1]+  26711  Stopped      man bash
</pre>
</p><p>
By default, <tt  >jobs</tt> gives you both paused and running background
processes. If you want to see only the paused jobs, use the 
<tt  >-s</tt> option. If
you want to see only the running background jobs, use the
<tt  >-r</tt> option. Once
you've finished your sidebar of work, how do you get back to your paused and
backgrounded program? The shell has a function called
<tt  >fg</tt> that lets you
put a program back into the foreground. If you simply execute
<tt  >fg</tt>, the
last process backgrounded is pulled into the foreground. If you want
to pick a particular job to put in the foreground, use the
<tt  >%</tt> option. So if
you want to foreground job number 1, execute <tt  >fg %1</tt>. What if
you want your backgrounded jobs to continue working? When you use Ctrl-z
to put a job in the background, it also is paused. To get it to continue
running in the background, use the <tt  >bg</tt> shell
function (on a job that already has been paused). This is
equivalent to running your program with an &amp; at the end of it. It will
stay disconnected from the console but continue running while in the
background.
</p><p>
Once a program is backgrounded and continues running, is there any way to
communicate with it? Yes, there is&mdash;the signal system. You can send signals
to your program with the <tt  >kill procid</tt> command, where procid is the process
ID of the program to which you are sending the signal. Your program can be
written to intercept these signals and do things, depending on what signals
have been sent. You can send a signal either by giving the signal number or
a symbolic number. Some of the signals available are:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
1: SIGHUP &mdash; terminal line hangup
</p></li><li><p>
3: SIGQUIT &mdash; quit program
</p></li><li><p>
9: SIGKILL &mdash; kill program
</p></li><li><p>
15: SIGTERM &mdash; software termination signal
</p></li><li><p>
30: SIGUSR1 &mdash; user-defined signal 1
</p></li><li><p>
31: SIGUSR2 &mdash; user-defined signal 2
</p></li></ul></div><p>
If you simply execute <tt  >kill</tt>, the default signal sent is a SIGTERM. This
signal tells the program to shut down, as if you had quit the program.
Sometimes your program may not want to quit, and sometimes programs
simply will not go away. In those cases, use <tt  >kill -9
procid</tt>
or <tt  >kill -s SIGKILL procid</tt> to send a kill signal.
This usually kills the offending process (with extreme prejudice).
</p><p>
Now that you can control when and where your program runs, what's next? You
may want to control the use of resources by your program. The shell has a
function called <tt  >ulimit</tt> that can be used to do this. This function
changes the limits on certain resources available to the shell, as well as
any programs started from the shell. The command <tt  >ulimit
-a</tt> prints out
all the resources and their current limits. The resource limits you
can change depend on your particular system. As an example (this
crops up when trying to run larger Java programs), say you need to
increase the stack size for your program to 10000KB. You would do this with
the command <tt  >ulimit -s 10000</tt>. You also can set limits for other resources
like the amount of CPU time in seconds (-t), maximum amount of virtual
memory in KB (-v), or the maximum size of a core file in 512-byte blocks
(-c).
</p><p>
The last resource you may want to control is what proportion of the
system your program uses. By default, all your programs are treated
equally when it comes to deciding how often your programs are scheduled
to run on the CPU. You can change this with the <tt  >nice</tt> command. Regular
users can use nice to alter the priority of their programs down from 0 to 19.
So, if you're going to run some process in the background but don't
want it to interfere with what you're running in the foreground, 
run it by executing the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
nice -n 10 my_program
</pre>
</p><p>
This runs your program with a priority of 10, rather than the
default of 0. You also can change the priority of an already-running
process with the <tt  >renice</tt> program. If you have a background process that
seems to be taking a lot of your CPU, you can change it with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
renice -n 19 -p 27666
</pre>
</p><p>
This lowers the priority of process 27666 all the way down to 19.
Regular users can use nice or renice only to lower the priority of
processes. The root user can increase the priority, all the way up to &ndash;20.
This is handy when you have processes that really need as much CPU time as
possible. If you look at the output from <tt  >top</tt>, you can see that something
like pulseaudio might have a negative niceness value. You don't want your
audio skipping when watching movies.
</p><p>
The other part of the system that needs to be scheduled is access to IO,
especially the hard drives. You can do this with the
<tt  >ionice</tt> command. By
default, programs are scheduled using the best-effort scheduling algorithm,
with a priority equal to (niceness + 20) / 5. This priority for the best
effort is a value between 0 and 7. If you are running some program in the
background and don't want it to interfere with your foreground programs,
set the scheduling algorithm to &ldquo;idle&rdquo; with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ionice -c 3 my_program
</pre>
</p><p>
If you want to change the IO niceness for a program that already
is running, simply use the <tt  >-p procid</tt> option. The highest
possible priority is called real time, and it can be between 0 and 7. So if you
have a process that needs to have first dibs on IO, run it with the
command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ionice -c 1 -n 0 my_command
</pre>
</p><p>
Just like the negative values for the nice command, using this real-time
scheduling algorithm is available only to the root user. The best a regular
user can do is:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ionice -c 2 -n 0 my_command
</pre>
</p><p>
That is the best-effort scheduling algorithm with a priority of 0.
</p><p>
Now that you know how to control how your programs use the resources on
your machine, you can change how interactive your system feels.

<h2 class="title">Drobo FS: the Good, the Bad and the Ugly</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #198, October 2010</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Those of us familiar with the original Drobo, which was an external RAID
device that housed standard SATA drives, always were disappointed with the
speed and lack of network connectivity the awesome-named device sported.
When Data Robotics announced the Drobo FS, a faster and network-connected
big brother to the original Drobo, I decided it was time to get the
little beastie in order to replace the full-size Linux tower in my
house that was running software RAID on a handful of internal drives.
The Drobo FS offers some great features:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
NAS functionality at gigabit speeds, with support for SMB and other protocols.
</p></li><li><p>
Apple Time Machine compatibility, for seamless backups for any Apple computers
on your network.
</p></li><li><p>
DroboApps, which are plugins that run on the embedded Linux operating system.
These vary from a BitTorrent client to an NFS server.
</p></li><li><p>
Simple expandability by hot swapping a smaller hard drive with a bigger
one.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
The good news is that the Drobo FS (I got mine with five 2TB hard drives)
was easy to set up, and it proved to be decently fast on the network.
Although the speeds I saw on my home network weren't something I'd expect
from an enterprise-class device, I really didn't consider the Drobo FS an
enterprise-level device, so I was happy with the 20MB/sec transfer rates.
Sure, it could be faster, but for bulk storage, it works well.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10852drobof1.large.jpg"><img src="10852drobof1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
Unfortunately, although I was excited about DroboApps, in
practice,
they're not as well integrated as I would like. Sure, they do the job,
but configuration is inconsistent, and for the most part, it's done on
config files stored in SMB shares. For many DroboApps, restarting the
unit is the only way to activate changes. Also, the Drobo Dashboard
is Windows/Mac-only, so for anything but the simplest of setups, one of
those operating systems is required for configuration.
</p><p>
Worst of all was the filesystem corruption I experienced a week after
firing up the Drobo FS. My unit lost power when a circuit breaker in my
house tripped, and upon reboot, it wouldn't work at all. To their credit,
Data Robotics' technical support responded to my problem on a Sunday
(I reported the problem on Saturday), and a quick fsck got my Drobo FS
back to working. Unfortunately, in order to start fsck, I had to use
an undocumented command inside the Windows Dashboard program.
</p><p>
Even with its downfalls, I think the Drobo FS has the potential to be a
powerful and reliable NAS for the home or small businesses. Perhaps my
filesystem corruption was the exception rather than the rule. Either
way, if you're looking for a way to store vast quantities of data in
a device that is simple to use and grow, the Drobo FS is worth a look.
I'd recommend it even considering the problems I've had during the past
few weeks. But be sure to buy a UPS with it too, in case you happen to
lose power!

<h2 class="title">Make Your Android Follow Whatever Three Laws You Decide</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #198, October 2010</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
A while back, I thought I'd write a long tutorial on how to root an Android
phone and install a custom-compiled ROM on it. This is a useful and fun
activity, because it can land you a phone running a more modern version
of Android than it officially supports. Of course, it also voids any
warranty on your device, so it's not without risk.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10852droidf1.large.jpg"><img src="10852droidf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
It turns out, writing an article for Droid-modding isn't really required.
Assuming your phone has been hacked, a quick Google search will give
you the directions to root your device (the simplest and least exciting
part of hacking an Android phone). After that, installing Rom Manager
from the Marketplace will allow you to flash a wide variety of custom
ROMs onto your phone. I could walk you through the process, but it's
really not terribly difficult. With all hacking and warranty-voiding
activities, be aware that, although unlikely, it is possible you could ruin
your phone and need to revert back to cans and string for communication.
Don't say I didn't warn you.
</p><p>
Oh, and if you're looking for an inexpensive, yet widely supported
device for hacking, the old Motorola Droid is inexpensive and most
likely still available. It's not the newest phone in the Android world,
but mine is happily running Froyo (Android 2.2) even though at the time
of this writing, it hasn't been released for the Droid. Happy hacking!

With open source, it's &ldquo;release early and release often&rdquo;, so things change.
With proprietary software, it's &ldquo;wait till their wallets have recovered
and then release&rdquo; (or something like that), so things can become a little stale feeling.
If your Windows desktop feels that way, or if it just doesn't suit you,
get yourself a new look and feel with Emerge Desktop.
</p><p>
Emerge Desktop is a replacement &ldquo;shell&rdquo; for Windows (not a shell like
bash, but a shell like KDE or GNOME&mdash;that is, the desktop environment).
On Windows, this normally is provided by Windows Explorer, which, for
convenience,
is the name of both the window manager and the file manager on Windows.
But, you don't have to use Windows Explorer. You can install an alternate
window manager, and that's what Emerge Desktop is.
</p><p>
Among other things, Emerge Desktop provides a system tray
(the place where all those little icons appear on the taskbar),
a desktop right-click menu for accessing all your programs
(which replaces the Start button), a taskbar and virtual desktops.
There's also a clock that doubles as a place to enter commands to run.
</p><p>
Emerge Desktop features are provided as individual applets (the system tray, the
taskbar and so on)
that can be enabled or disabled optionally and that also can be run independently
of the Emerge Desktop and used with another desktop shell if desired.
Applets communicate with each other via the emergeCore applet.
</p><p>
Emerge Desktop is written in C++ and uses the MinGW compiler.
It's available for both 32- and 64-bit Windows systems.
The latest release of Emerge Desktop at the time of this writing is 0.5 (released July 2010).
The source code for Emerge Desktop is licensed under the GPL.

<h2 class="title">Google TV: Are You Awesome, or Absurd?</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #198, October 2010</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Google has planted itself firmly into our lives, at times treading the
line between evil empire and freedom fanatic. Whether you search the
Internet with its Web site, call your mom from its mobile phone
OS, or share links with Google Buzz (does anyone really use Buzz?),
most likely, you use Google every day. Google wants you to use its
stuff at night as well&mdash;more specifically, when you watch television.
The new Google TV platform is a software environment, much like Android
is a platform for mobile phones. The question remains whether
Google will consolidate all the different desires users have for their
viewing experience, or merely offer &ldquo;one more thing&rdquo; we need to attach
to an HDMI port.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10852googlef1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
I've used Roku, XBMC, MythTV, Boxee, Popcorn Hour, GeeXboX, ASUS O!Play,
Freevo and probably that many again that I can't remember. Sadly, every
one of them falls short in one area or another. Whether it's an inability
to play streaming media, an incompatibility with local media on my server
or a horrible user interface, I'm always stuck with two or three devices I
need to switch between in order to fulfill my family's multimedia demands.
</p><p>
Hopefully, Google TV will fix that. Hopefully, the API is open enough
that features can be added without taking away from the user interface.
Hopefully, the software platform will be flexible enough to work on
multiple hardware platforms. Hopefully, Google TV doesn't end up being
evil. We'll be sure to keep an eye on the big G's latest infiltration
into your home, and hopefully, we'll be able to report nothing but good news.
Until then, we'll need to keep buying television sets with lots of
HDMI ports.

no practical value.

Programming today is a race between software engineers striving to build
bigger and better idiot-proof programs, and the universe trying to produce

it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies, and the other way
is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies.
