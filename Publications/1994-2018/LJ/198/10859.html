How much configurability is too much?

<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> Hey Bill, I thought you might be interested to
know that in honor
of the Command-Line issue my Hack and / column talks about
how to set up mutt for the very first time.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> Mutt, eh? That's cool...if you like a bunch of
things to configure
and stuff. I still don't get that. Mutt may be powerful, but there's this
huge barrier to getting it running&mdash;so much so, you need an entire
article on it. No one writes an article on filling out the new account
wizard in Thunderbird.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> I guess that's true, but without rehashing our
mutt vs. Thunderbird
debate, you don't need an article talking about Thunderbird options,
because there are just so few options you <span   class="emphasis"><em>can</em></span> configure.
Although it's true
that mutt has a lot of options, that's a <span   class="emphasis"><em>feature</em></span> for me, not a
bug.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> Exactly. I guess it comes down to what our
Point/Counterpoint is
this month: sane defaults vs. configurability.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> So at SCaLE this past year, I actually met the
creator of mutt
(I know, right? I was speechless). After the fanboy in me went away and
I was able to talk again, I found out that his .muttrc file actually
is pretty small. You know why? Because he wrote mutt's default for what he
wanted. The fact that there are so many complicated .muttrc files out
there tells me that what were sane defaults for him, obviously weren't
sane for everyone else.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> I remember that. You were nearly apoplectic. It
was amazing to
see the fanboy in action.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> So, I'm not even sure there is such a
thing as
 sane defaults. I think
no matter what, you are going to pick a default someone hates. That's
why, to me, being able to configure as much as possible is a huge benefit.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> I don't know, the GNOME folks seem to do a
pretty good job of
finding that middle ground. I don't mind configurability, but I think you
should have the defaults ready to go. A piece of software shouldn't be
a blank slate without you digging in a configuration file; it should
come up and mostly work right out of the box.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> I think that middle ground shifted
recently when Ubuntu decided the
sane default button placement was on the left. As bad as the flame wars
over that were, imagine if that weren't a configurable option!
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> I didn't mind the button placement on 
the left, coincidentally. I
wonder why that is....But yeah, things like that <span   class="emphasis"><em>should</em></span> be
configurable. Sane defaults mean exactly that, things that make sense&mdash;or
perhaps failing sane defaults, maybe a startup wizard of some kind.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> Okay, I do agree with you to a point
there. An application should
try to start up in as usable a state as it can. My problem is less what
defaults an application chooses and more whether developers think their
defaults are the gold standard and don't let you change them. Honestly, I
don't care where the window buttons are either; I usually have keybindings
do those actions.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> It all depends on the application, I imagine. I
can see why
there are good reasons for not changing things on an Android phone,
for instance.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> I don't know though, when you look at all the
custom cases,
plastic covers, stickers and so on that people put on their computers and
phones, it tells <span   class="emphasis"><em>me</em></span> that people like to customize their things.
While
trying to please everyone, some applications choose defaults that please
no one, and what's worse, they don't allow you to change them. I guess
I'm just weird enough that what does end up pleasing the majority of
users ends up not working for me, so it's very important that if it
doesn't work for me, I can change it.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> I agree, you are weird. But I don't advocate
just configurability
in lieu of sane defaults. Sane defaults by definition mean they should
please the majority of users. You can't just offer all these configurable
knobs and dials and then not have them set to something that makes sense
out of the box.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> Well, these days, &ldquo;sane
defaults&rdquo; often mean they are aimed at some
non-existent &ldquo;Joe User&rdquo; beginner that the developer made up, so what we
end up with are lowest-common-denominator design decisions and defaults
that usually leave &ldquo;power users&rdquo; out in the cold.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> The thinking is that power users can tweak
the knobs themselves,
right?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> If the developer creates the knobs to begin
with. I think this
month we are actually closer to an agreement than in past months.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> Say it isn't so! I think we're losing our
touch.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> It seems the real contention is not so much
that applications
should allow the user to tweak settings (I think we more or less agree
that's a good thing). The real contention seems to be about sane
defaults themselves. I'm not so sure there <span   class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> such a thing as a
sane
default. While there are definitely some options you can set for
the majority of users, I'd argue there are many options that no matter
what you set them to, they won't please even a majority of users.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> I'd argue that they don't need to please the
majority, but they
should <span   class="emphasis"><em>work</em></span>. The application should be reachable to the newbie
while
allowing power users to do their thing.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> Unfortunately, that is such a difficult balance
to make, most
programs just go to one or the other extreme. Either they strip out all
the options in the name of simplicity and some enlightened design,
when it's really that they don't want to code in the configurability,
or the program assumes you are a power user to begin with and waits for
you to climb the learning curve. At least, in my experience, the latter
programs tend to reward you if you do climb up the curve.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> GIMP developers finally got that through their
heads, I think. However,
Blender (the 3-D modeling program) is just plain obtuse and hard to use,
though configurable and powerful it may be.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> Whoa, did you just channel Yoda in that last
comment?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> I think I did.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> Configurable and powerful Blender is. Yes.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> Use the Source, you must.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> See, Yoda is a good example. Skywalker was like
a user who just
wants sane defaults for everything and doesn't want to complete his
training and look what happened to him.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> Or, you could say Vader was trying to enforce
his idea of sane
defaults by backing the Emperor's version of &ldquo;order&rdquo;....But down that
way of reasoning lies madness.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> Yeah, before you know it we'll equate some
program to Jar Jar
Binks and get all sorts of hate mail.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> Would you rather have a car analogy? I'm good
at those.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> No! I hate car analogies, but at least in
your case, you know about cars.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> Thank you for acknowledging in this column that
I know about
<span   class="emphasis"><em>something</em></span>, at least.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> I'm feeling generous today. Either that or I
feel bad about all
the times I've dinged you on the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> Insider
podcast.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> Maybe both. Perhaps you're developing a
conscience.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> Over years and years of tweaking and tuning,
yes, perhaps I am.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> See, my conscience mostly worked out of the
box.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> Really the bottom line for me is that while I
want programs to work
well, I don't expect my preferences to match either the preferences of
the majority of users or of the developer. I want programs that allow
me to tweak and tune the settings until the application fits me like a
finely tailored suit.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> And for me, I expect to fire up a program and
have it work with at
least 75% functionality almost right away. I don't want to have to read
a bunch of man pages, or worse, have to read an article that someone's
written on something like a mail client.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> First, open-source software, then
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Star Wars</em></span>, now we are venturing
into Philosophy. I can't wait for the e-mail to pour in.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> Whatever works.
