<h1 class="title">Everything You Need to Know about Linux Containers, Part I: Linux
Control Groups and Process Isolation</h1>

<h2 class="sigil_not_in_toc">Everyone's heard the term, but what exactly are containers? By Petros
Koutoupis</h2>

<p>
The software enabling this
technology comes in many forms, with Docker as the most popular. The
recent rise in popularity of container technology within the data center is a direct result of its
portability and ability to isolate working environments, thus limiting
its impact and overall footprint to the underlying computing system. 
To understand the technology completely, you first
need to understand the many pieces that make it all
possible.
</p>

<p>
<em>Sidenote: people often ask about the difference between containers and
virtual machines. Both have a specific purpose and place with very little
overlap, and one doesn't obsolete the other. A container is meant to be a
lightweight environment that you spin up to host one to a few isolated
applications at bare-metal performance. You should opt for virtual machines
when you want to host an entire operating system or ecosystem or maybe to run
applications incompatible with the underlying environment.</em></p>

<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">
Linux Control Groups</h3>

<p>
Truth be told, certain software applications in the wild 
may need to be controlled or limited—at least for the sake of stability
and, to some degree, security. Far too often, a bug or just bad code can disrupt
an entire machine and potentially cripple an entire ecosystem. Fortunately,
a way exists to keep those same applications in check. Control groups
(cgroups) is a kernel feature that limits, accounts for and isolates the CPU,
memory, disk I/O and network's usage of one or more processes.
</p>

<p>
Originally developed by Google, the cgroups technology eventually would find
its way to the Linux kernel mainline in version 2.6.24 (January 2008). A
redesign of this technology—that is, the addition of kernfs (to split some
of the sysfs logic)—would be merged into both the 3.15 and 3.16 kernels.
</p>

<p>
The primary design goal for cgroups was to provide a unified interface to
manage processes or whole operating-system-level virtualization, including
Linux Containers, or LXC (a topic I plan to revisit in more detail in a
follow-up article). The cgroups framework provides the following:
</p>

<ul><li>
<strong>Resource limiting:</strong>
a group can be configured not to exceed a specified memory limit or use more
than the desired amount of processors or be limited to specific peripheral
devices.
</li>

<li>
<strong>Prioritization:</strong>
one or more groups may be configured to utilize fewer or more CPUs or disk
I/O throughput.
</li>

<li>
<strong>Accounting:</strong>
a group's resource usage is monitored and measured.
</li>

<li>
<strong>Control:</strong>
groups of processes can be frozen or stopped and restarted.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
A cgroup can consist of one or more processes that are all bound to the same
set of limits. These groups also can be hierarchical, which means that a
subgroup inherits the limits administered to its parent group.
</p>

<p>
The Linux kernel provides access to a series of controllers or subsystems for
the cgroup technology. The controller is responsible for distributing a
specific type of system resources to a set of one or more processes. For
instance, the <code>memory</code> controller is what limits memory
usage while the <code>cpuacct</code> controller monitors CPU usage.
</p>

<p>
You can access and manage cgroups both directly and indirectly (with LXC,
libvirt or Docker), the first of which I cover here via sysfs and the
<code>libcgroups</code> library. To follow along with the examples here, you
first need to
install the necessary packages. On Red Hat Enterprise Linux or CentOS,
type the following on the command line:

</p>
<pre><code>
$ sudo yum install libcgroup libcgroup-tools
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
On Ubuntu or Debian, type:

</p>
<pre><code>
$ sudo apt-get install libcgroup1 cgroup-tools
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
For the example application, I'm using a simple shell script file called
test.sh, and it'll be running the following two commands in an infinite
<code>while</code> loop:

</p>
<pre><code>
$ cat test.sh 
#!/bin/sh

while [ 1 ]; do
	echo "hello world"
	sleep 60
done
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">
The Manual Approach</h3>

<p>
With the proper packages installed, you can configure your
cgroups directly via the sysfs hierarchy. For instance, to create a cgroup named
<code>foo</code> under the <code>memory</code> subsystem, create
a directory named foo in /sys/fs/cgroup/memory:

</p>
<pre><code>
$ sudo mkdir /sys/fs/cgroup/memory/foo
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
By default, every newly created cgroup will inherit access to the
system's entire pool of memory. For some applications, primarily those
that continue to allocate more memory but refuse to free what already
has been allocated, that may not be such a great idea. To limit an application to
a reasonable limit, you'll need to update the
<code>memory.limit_in_bytes</code> file.
</p>

<p>
Limit the memory for anything running under the cgroup <code>foo</code> to 50MB:

</p>
<pre><code>
$ echo 50000000 | sudo tee 
 ↪/sys/fs/cgroup/memory/foo/memory.limit_in_bytes
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
Verify the setting:

</p>
<pre><code>
$ sudo cat memory.limit_in_bytes 
50003968
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
Note that the value read back always will be a multiple of the kernel's
page size (that is, 4096 bytes or 4KB). This value is the smallest
allocatable size of memory.
</p>

<p>
Launch the application:

</p>
<pre><code>
$ sh ~/test.sh &amp;
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
Using its Process ID (PID), move the application to cgroup <code>foo</code> under the
<code>memory</code> controller:

</p>
<pre><code>
$ echo 2845 &gt; /sys/fs/cgroup/memory/foo/cgroup.procs
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
Using the same PID number, list the running process and verify that it's
running within the desired cgroup:

</p>
<pre><code>
$ ps -o cgroup 2845
CGROUP
8:memory:/foo,1:name=systemd:/user.slice/user-0.slice/
↪session-4.scope
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
You also can monitor what's currently being used by that cgroup by reading
the desired files. In this case, you'll want to see the amount of memory
allocated by your process (and spawned subprocesses):

</p>
<pre><code>
$ cat /sys/fs/cgroup/memory/foo/memory.usage_in_bytes
253952
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">
When a Process Goes Astray</h3>

<p>
Now let's re-create the same scenario, but instead of limiting the cgroup
<code>foo</code> to
50MB of memory, you'll limit it to 500 bytes:

</p>
<pre><code>
$ echo 500 | sudo tee /sys/fs/cgroup/memory/foo/
↪memory.limit_in_bytes
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
<em>Note: if a task exceeds its defined limits, the kernel will intervene
and, in some
cases, kill that task.</em>
</p>

<p>
Again, when you read the value back, it always will be a multiple of the
kernel page size. So, although you set it to 500 bytes, it's really set to 4
KB:

</p>
<pre><code>
$ cat /sys/fs/cgroup/memory/foo/memory.limit_in_bytes 
4096
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
Launch the application, move it into the cgroup and monitor the system logs:

</p>
<pre><code>

</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
Notice that the kernel's Out-Of-Memory Killer (or oom-killer) stepped in as
soon as the application hit that 4KB limit. It killed the application, and
it's no longer running. You can verify this by typing:

</p>
<pre><code>
$ ps -o cgroup 2687
CGROUP
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">
Using libcgroup</h3>

<p>
Many of the earlier steps described here are simplified by the administration utilities
provided in the <code>libcgroup</code> package. For example, a single command
invocation using the <code>cgcreate</code> binary takes care of the process of creating the
sysfs entries and files.
</p>

<p>
To create the group named <code>foo</code> under the <code>memory</code>
subsystem, type the following:

</p>
<pre><code>
$ sudo cgcreate -g memory:foo
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>



<p><em>Note: libcgroup provides a mechanism for managing tasks in control
groups.</em></p>

<p>
Using the same methods as before, you can begin to set thresholds:

</p>
<pre><code>
$ echo 50000000 | sudo tee 
 ↪/sys/fs/cgroup/memory/foo/memory.limit_in_bytes
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
Verify the newly configured setting:

</p>
<pre><code>
$ sudo cat memory.limit_in_bytes 
50003968
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
Run the application in the cgroup <code>foo</code> using the
<code>cgexec</code> binary:

</p>
<pre><code>
$ sudo cgexec -g memory:foo ~/test.sh
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
Using its PID number, verify that the application is running in the cgroup
and under defined subsystem (<code>memory</code>):

</p>
<pre><code>
$  ps -o cgroup 2945
CGROUP
6:memory:/foo,1:name=systemd:/user.slice/user-0.slice/
↪session-1.scope
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
If your application is no longer running and you want to clean up and remove
the cgroup, you would do that by using the <code>cgdelete</code> binary. To
remove group <code>foo</code>
from under the <code>memory</code> controller, type:

</p>
<pre><code>
$ sudo cgdelete memory:foo
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">
Persistent Groups</h3>

<p>
You also can accomplish all of the above from a simple configuration
file and the starting of a service. You can define all of your cgroup names
and attributes in the /etc/cgconfig.conf file. The following appends a few
attributes for the group <code>foo</code>:

</p>
<pre><code>
$ cat /etc/cgconfig.conf

# groups on system boot using this file.

group foo {
  cpu {
    cpu.shares = 100;
  }
  memory {
    memory.limit_in_bytes = 5000000;
  }
}
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
The <code>cpu.shares</code> options defines the CPU priority of the group. By default, all
groups inherit 1,024 shares or 100% of CPU time. By bringing this value down
to something a bit more conservative, like 100, the group will be limited to
approximately 10% of the CPU time.
</p>

<p>
As discussed earlier, a process running within a cgroup also can be limited
to the amount of CPUs (cores) it can access. Add the following section
to the same cgconfig.conf file and under the desired group name:

</p>
<pre><code>
cpuset {
  cpuset.cpus="0-5";
}
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
With this limit, this cgroup will bind the application to cores 0 to 5—that
is, it will see only the first six CPU cores on the system.
</p>

<p>
Next, you need to load this configuration using the <code>cgconfig</code> service. First,
enable <code>cgconfig</code> to load the above configuration on system boot up:

</p>
<pre><code>
$ sudo systemctl enable cgconfig
Create symlink from /etc/systemd/system/sysinit.target.wants/
↪cgconfig.service
to /usr/lib/systemd/system/cgconfig.service.
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
Now, start the <code>cgconfig</code> service and load the same configuration file manually
(or you can skip this step and reboot the system):

</p>
<pre><code>
$ sudo systemctl start cgconfig
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
Launch the application into the cgroup <code>foo</code> and bind it to your
<code>memory</code> and <code>cpu</code>
limits:

</p>
<pre><code>
$ sudo cgexec -g memory,cpu,cpuset:foo ~/test.sh &amp;
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
With the exception of launching the application into the predefined cgroup,
all the rest will persist across system reboots. However, you can automate
that process by defining a startup init script dependent on the
<code>cgconfig</code>
service to launch that same application.
</p>

<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">
Summary</h3>

<p>
Often it becomes necessary to limit one or more tasks on a machine. Control
groups provide that functionality, and by leveraging it, you can 
enforce strict hardware and software limitations to some of your most vital
or uncontrollable applications. If one application does not set an upper
threshold or limit the amount of memory it can consume on a system, cgroups
can address that. If another application tends to be a bit of a CPU hog,
again, cgroups has got you covered. You can accomplish so much with
cgroups, and with a little time invested, you'll
restore stability, security and sanity back into your operating environment.
</p>

<p>
In Part II of this series, I move beyond Linux control groups and shift 
focus to how technologies like Linux Containers make use of them.
