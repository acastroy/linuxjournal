<h1 class="title">At the Forge: Python and Its Community Enter a New Phase</h1>

<h2 class="sigil_not_in_toc">On Python's BDFL Guido van Rossum, his dedication to the Python
community, PEP 572 and hope for a healthy outcome for the language, open
source and the computing world in general. By Reuven M. Lerner</h2>

<p>
Python is an amazing programming language, there's no doubt about it.
From humble beginnings in 1991, it's now just about
everywhere. Whether you're doing web development, system
administration, test automation, devops or data science, odds are
good that Python is playing a role in your work.
</p>

<p>
Even if you're not using Python directly, odds are good that it
is being used behind the scenes. Using OpenStack? Python plays an
integral role in its development and configuration. Using Dropbox on
your computer? Then you've got a copy of Python running on your
computer. Using Linux? When I purchased Red Hat Linux back in 1995,
the configuration was a breeze—thanks to visual tools developed in
Python.
</p>

<p>
And, of course, there are numerous schools and educational programs
that are now teaching Python. MIT's intro computer science course switched
several years ago from Scheme to Python, and thousands of universities
all over the world made a similar switch in its wake. My 15-year-old daughter
participates in a program for technology and entrepreneurship—and
she's learning Python.
</p>

<p>
There currently is an almost insatiable demand for Python
developers. Indeed, Stack Overflow reported last year that Python is
not only the most popular language on its site, but it's also the
fastest-growing language. I can attest to this popularity in my own
job as a freelance Python trainer. Some of the largest computer
companies in the world are now using Python on a regular basis, and
their use of the language is growing, not shrinking.
</p>

<p>
Normally, a technology with this much impact would require a large and
active marketing department. But Python is (of course) open-source
software, and its success is the result of a large number of
contributors—to the core language, to its documentation, to
libraries and to the numerous blogs, tutorials, articles and videos
available online. I often remind my students that people often think
of "open source" as a synonym for "free of charge", but that they
should instead think of it as a synonym for "powered by the
community"—and there's no doubt that the Python community is strong.
</p>

<p>
Such a strong community doesn't come from nowhere. And there's no
doubt that Guido van Rossum, who created Python and has led its
development ever since, has been a supremely effective community
organizer and leader.
</p>

<p>
Programmers often think about code more than people and efficiency
more than empathy. We tend to be hot-headed, jumping headlong into
debates over obscure technical points. Guido (as he is universally
known among Python developers) struck a different tone in his
management of Python. From the beginning, he thought about who would
use the language and what mistakes they were apt to make—and how
the language could best serve such people. He did debate other
developers over features, bugs and the language's direction, but he
generally did so through respect and reasoned argument, rather than
with dismissive, expletive-filled tirades that are so common in the
Open Source world.
</p>

<p>
In this way, Guido managed to build not only a great language, but
also a culture of giving, sharing and helping. We shouldn't take
this for granted. Although programming can be hard, managing other
people and taking their varying perspectives into account is even
harder.
</p>

<p>
Over time, this culture led to many people participating in the Python
language and ecosystem. When I was at PyCon in Cleveland this year,
it was hard not to be amazed by the large number of people, from
all over the world, using Python for a wide variety of tasks. Guido
himself didn't even speak at the conference. I hope that he was
satisfied to walk around, taking in the awesome sight of thousands of
people passionate about the language that he had created.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps even more impressive to me was the fact that hundreds of
people remained for the open-source sprint days following
PyCon. Almost all of those people were volunteering their time to
improve some part of the Python language they used every day. This
dedication, coupled with an interest in contributing and helping
others, is a hallmark of open source in general, and of Python in
particular.
</p>

<p>
Today, Python has not only a strong community, but a robust
organizational structure as well. The Python Software Foundation
manages funds that can help developers to contribute to the
language. The core developers are impressively organized, coordinating
releases large and small, and providing stability and clarity that
easily rivals commercial software houses.
</p>

<p>
But while Python's bureaucracy and ecosystem have grown over time, one
man has still stood at the center of it all: Guido van Rossum, who was
dubbed the BDFL, or Benevolent Dictator For Life. Although this
means that Guido has (deservedly) received a great deal of praise, it
means he was the target of numerous slings and arrows as
well.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps the biggest dispute in the Python world was the transition
from version 2 to version 3. Actually, I shouldn't even say "was"
here, since many of my clients are still making that change. It's
easy to say that this incompatible upgrade was handled poorly. And you
can be sure that the Python community has learned its lesson and will
never make such a break again. However, the end result—Python 3—is definitely better than Python 2. Should Guido and the core
developers have handled it differently? Perhaps, but it's easy to say
that in retrospect. The number of blog posts calling Python 3 a
colossal mistake must have hurt Guido. But part of being a manager is
having the ability to accept, filter and even ignore criticism, and
he did it with aplomb.
</p>

<p>
Decisions regarding changes to Python have long been made via PEPs
(Python Enhancement Proposals)—documents in which new ideas are
proposed, kicked around, modified and finally approved or
rejected. As the BDFL, Guido's input and approval always were needed
for a PEP to be considered "approved".
</p>

<p>
Through the years, I've learned to trust Guido's judgment. There were
numerous cases when I would read a PEP, roll my eyes, and think,
"Really? Isn't there a better way to do this?" But over time, I
would generally say, "Hmm, maybe he was right." Guido was not
only a talented developer and manager, but also someone with taste and
vision, whose experience allowed him to sense better than many others
in the community what was the right direction for the language.
</p>

<p>
And, then we got PEP 572, for "assignment expressions". Python
distinguishes between statements (which perform an action) and
expressions (which return values). An "if" statement must contain an
expression, and an assignment is a statement, which means that you cannot
say:

</p>
<pre><code>
x = 5
while x = x - 1:
    print(f"x is {x}")
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
The above, as a statement, would be flagged as an error by Python
before it was even executed.
</p>

<p>
PEP 572 introduced a new syntax, the "assignment expression", which
would allow the above to work. That PEP recently was approved by
Guido and will be a part of Python 5.8. It'll look like this:

</p>
<pre><code>
x = 5
while x := x - 1:
    print(f"x is {x}")
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
It turns out that a huge number of Python developers, including some
of the core developers, disliked this. In fact, they disliked this <em>a
lot</em>. I must say, I'm still not enamored of it, but I'm applying my
usual "defer-to-Guido" thinking here, believing that within a few
years, I'll agree that assignment expressions are a good and useful
thing to have in Python. After all, I've already changed my tune on
str.format, enums and type annotations; perhaps over time, I'll
agree with this one as well.
</p>

<p>
A large number of Python developers decided not to hold off on their
judgment and attacked PEP 572 as completely out of line, or even
"un-Pythonic", a strong phrase to be leveled at the guy who has
dictated Python's development and direction for nearly three decades.
</p>

<p>
These accusations have taken their toll. July 12, 2018, Guido sent a
message to the python-committers e-mail list, saying that he's taking
a "permanent vacation from being BDFL". He further says, "You will
all be on your own."
</p>

<p>
On the one hand, it's terribly sad that the discussion over PEP 572
become so heated, so uncharacteristically un-Pythonic in its nature,
that Guido (of all people!) found himself overwhelmed and unhappy.
His vision and input will be missed, although he does point out that
he'll continue to be a core contributor. And you can be sure that
he'll have a lot to say, and that we would be wise to listen to it.
</p>

<p>
But on the other hand, perhaps we should see this as something of an
opportunity for the Python community to mature. Guido has been running
a several-thousand-person, worldwide development effort for several
decades, in which most of his developers are volunteers. That's no
small feat, and he deserves a chance to reset, or even to retire. I
mean, how long can you expect someone to do this kind of work?
</p>

<p>
Moreover, the Python community can and should evolve beyond the BDFL
style of leadership. Guido himself is curious to see what's going to
happen, as he writes: "So what are you all going to do? Create a
democracy? Anarchy? A dictatorship? A federation?"
</p>

<p>
The fact is that while benevolent dictatorships are (by definition)
good, they aren't sustainable. And thus, the Python community will
now not have to grow, so much as evolve—becoming an institution
that can outlive any one of its individual contributors, while
continuing to have a massive impact on the world.
</p>

<p>
Guido is, in my mind, an inspiring developer, leader and
manager. What he created has affected countless people around the
world. I hope and expect that the future of the Python community will
reflect the strength and wisdom of its founder, and that it'll
continue to have the same impact as it enters this new phase. This
transition period will likely be somewhat messy, but it'll also be
healthy—and the end result will be good for Python, good for open
source, good for developers, and good for everyone who uses computers.
