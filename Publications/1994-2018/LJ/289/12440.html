<p>
In the past decade or so, we've learned to equate the ability to collaborate
with the need to be online. The advent of SaaS clearly marked the departure
from a decentralized collaboration model to a heavily centralized one. While
on the surface this is a very convenient delivery model, it simply doesn't
fit a number of scenarios well.
</p>

<p>
As somebody once said, "you can't FTP to Mars", but we don't need to go as far.
There are plenty of use cases here on Earth that are less than perfectly suited
for this "online world". Lower power chips and sensors, vessel/offshore collaboration,
disaster recovery, remote areas, sporadically reshaping groups—all these make
use of central online services a challenge.
</p>

<p>
Another challenge with centralization is somewhat less thought of—building software
that can handle a lot of concurrent users and that stores and processes a lot of 
information and never goes down is challenging and expensive, and we, as consumers,
pay dearly for that effort.
</p>

<p>
And not least important, software in the cloud removes our ability to adapt it
perfectly for use cases beyond its owner's vision, scope and profitability
considerations. Convenience isn't free, and this goes way beyond the price tag.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://sit.fyi">SIT</a> is a free, open-source project that addresses these and other concerns in software
that enables us to collaborate. It allows sporadically connected parties to continue
collaborating seamlessly, over just about any digital transport (ranging from a P2P
network to a USB drive). At its core, it's a very small tool that records every
change as an immutable, additive-only set of files and allows this information
to be displayed and operated on in a familiar way, though browser-based applications
or the command line.

<p class="caption"><em>Figure 1. SIT Issue Tracker</em></p>
</div>

<p>
Although its foundation is rather generic, its first real application is in <a href="https://github.com/sit-fyi/issue-tracking">issue
tracking</a>, and it enables a lot of
scenarios that were previously rather difficult to achieve. For example, if a SIT
repository is committed to a project repository, this allows you to see a
snapshot of all issues for any revision, making it much easier to maintain
separate versions or trace changes. Another interesting feature is its
merge request functionality, where a patch, by its nature, can contain file
changes that affect a project's issues, giving enormous flexibility in managing
dependent issues (say you developed a feature and want to attach a "to-do" list
to it as a part of the patch, so those new issues will appear only once the
patch has been merged—with SIT this is a rather trivial task).
</p>

<p>
SIT is still a young project, and there are still a lot of cases to figure out.
It's quite interesting to see how so many assumptions are being challenged
once we remove the central party from the equation.
