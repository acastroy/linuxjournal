<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #238, February 2014</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Recently, <span   class="bold"><b>Aldo Iljazi</b></span> suggested removing
the venerable <span   class="bold"><b>menuconfig</b></span>
build target, on the grounds that <span   class="bold"><b>nconfig</b></span> was an improvement, and there
didn't need to be two menu-based configuration systems in the kernel tree.
</p><p>
nconfig is actually based on the menuconfig code, and they both rely
on ncurses to present menus. But nconfig tries to look more modern
and gives the user a bit more control using the keyboard.
</p><p>
The idea went nowhere&mdash;perhaps it was just too soon, because nconfig
has a tiny user base relative to that of menuconfig. But, it was
surprising to see how much resistance there was. At one point, <span   class="bold"><b>Alexander
Holler</b></span> raised the objection that nconfig relied on the Fn keys for its
operation, which were not available on software keyboards on smartphones,
for example. But, even after <span   class="bold"><b>Randy Dunlap</b></span> pointed out that the regular
number keys worked just as well, there still was overwhelming opposition
to ditching menuconfig.
</p><p>
It's interesting that certain parts of the kernel&mdash;for example, config
targets that don't themselves bloat the compiled binary (though they may
help select features that do)&mdash;are much easier to get into the kernel
source tree than actual kernel features. And once in, they are harder
to remove. There was no particular need for nconfig, given that it
performs a similar function to menuconfig, but there it is in the
kernel source tree. These helper projects come and go fairly easily,
probably because there's not much cost to having them, and by including
them in the tree, they get the chance to show whether they really
actually may be better than the alternatives.
</p><p>
Recently, <span   class="bold"><b>Jim Lieb</b></span> tried to simplify the interface that allowed file
servers to impersonate their client user for write operations. This is
standard procedure, without which files would have the wrong owners, and
things like quotas and access controls would not be able to tell whether
a user violated a given constraint. But the existing implementation used
a combination of various system calls, including <span   class="bold"><b>setfsuid()</b></span>, <span   class="bold"><b>setfsgid()</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>setgroups()</b></span> and others to accomplish this. Jim wanted to replace the
mess with a single <span   class="bold"><b>switch_creds()</b></span> system call.
</p><p>
As it turned out, there was support for the general idea of cleaning
up the existing interface, but no agreement on exactly how it should be
done. <span   class="bold"><b>Al Viro</b></span>, for example, offered his own implementation that avoided
some of the complexities of Jim's approach. But both approaches turned
out to have significant security gaps, as <span   class="bold"><b>Eric W.
Biederman</b></span> and <span   class="bold"><b>Tetsuo
Handa</b></span> pointed out at various times during the conversation.
</p><p>
Everyone seems agreed on the fact that the current implementation is a bit
messy and could use a cleaning. But apparently the security issues are
devious and need to be gotten right. The current messy implementation
also may turn out to be the best way to deal with those issues&mdash;in
which case, it really couldn't be considered messy in the first place.
</p><p>
Recently, <span   class="bold"><b>Peter Huewe</b></span> took over as the
primary maintainer of the <span   class="bold"><b>TPM</b></span>
(Trusted Platform Module) device driver. TPM is a hardware authentication
system that allows third-party services to confirm that only a trusted
operating system and set of software is running on the device.
</p><p>
Many other maintainers were listed, several of whom had not been
responsive for a while and there was general agreement that the list
should be pruned and kept accurate.
</p><p>
A number of folks tried to contact the various maintainers to ask if they
were still interested in working on the project. Ultimately, several folks,
such as <span   class="bold"><b>Rajiv Andrade</b></span> and <span   class="bold"><b>Ashley Lai</b></span>, said they still were interested in
helping out, but they recognized Peter as the project leader. A number
of other folks asked to be removed from the maintainers list, as they
had moved on to other projects or other companies.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Jason Gunthorpe</b></span> inaugurated the new maintainer hierarchy by submitting a
set of TPM patches that had been waiting for inclusion and remarking,
&ldquo;there are still lots of patches to go before the subsystem meets the
current kernel standard.&rdquo;

<h2 class="title">Okay, Google</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #238, February 2014</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
My favorite scene in <span   class="emphasis"><em>Star Trek IV</em></span> is when Scotty tries to use the
computer in the 1980s. When he's told he must use the mouse, he responds,
&ldquo;how quaint&rdquo;, and then proceeds to try speaking into the mouse for the
computer to respond. With the advent of Siri on iOS and voice recognition
on Android, it's beginning to feel like the voice interface portrayed
in <span   class="emphasis"><em>Star Trek</em></span> isn't too far away.
</p><p>
But it's not here just yet.
</p><p>
I set up my Nexus 7 tablet with the most recent tools from
Google (technically, they're not yet available for the Nexus 7, but
I'm a nerd, so I was able to find a way). I set my now always-responsive
tablet on the window ledge in my office, just out of reach but in easy
earshot. I went through the entire day, trying to use the tablet as
often as possible without touching it. I discovered a few things:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Google is really good at giving certain types of feedback. If I asked
about the time in London, the current weather or the stock price of a
popular stock, I'd get a visual response along with a voice telling me
the answer.
</p></li><li><p>
Outside that small list of things Google is really good at answering,
it doesn't do anything more than give search results on the tablet. I
was hoping for something like, &ldquo;would you like me to read you the most
popular search result?&rdquo; But alas, it didn't even audibly tell me it
heard my question.
</p></li><li><p>
Sending texts and e-mail messages is possible, but frustrating and
scary. If you've ever tried to use voice calling with a Bluetooth headset,
you've probably had the awkward experience of your phone accidentally trying to call
an ex-boyfriend or girlfriend instead of calling the plumber. If you're
lucky, you can stop it before it rings on their end, but thanks to caller
ID, you're likely in for a very uncomfortable followup call. I found
Google's voice-based messaging more cautious than my Bluetooth headset,
but still potentially bad. This is especially true because the tablet was
across the room, making it hard to dive and press cancel.
</p></li></ul></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11626androidf1.large.jpg"><img src="11626androidf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
So, although we may not be to the point where we can ask Jarvis to order us
a pizza while we're flying around in an Ironman suit, we're definitely
taking a step in the right direction. The advent of Google Glass will
make verbal commands more and more common. Even if you hate Google
Glass, you can rejoice in the voice interface improvements it 
doubtlessly will cause.
</p><p>
Is voice interface more than a novelty for you? Do you successfully send
messages to people on a regular basis by dictating only to your smart
device? Did you think <span   class="emphasis"><em>Star Trek IV</em></span> was awesome too? I'd love to get
feedback on your thoughts concerning voice interfaces, Google Glass
and the future of interfaces in general. Send me an e-mail at
<a href="mailto:info@linuxjournal.com">info@linuxjournal.com</a>. I, for one, look forward to my
first cranial implant. (I'd like to wait for version 1.1 though&mdash;nobody
wants a buggy brain implant!)

<h2 class="title">Anubis, the God of Dead Bitcoin Miners</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #238, February 2014</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
With the recent resurgence of Bitcoin and the subsequent vitality of
other cryptocurrencies (Litecoin, for instance), I've been receiving lots
of e-mail messages asking how to mine. I've discussed cryptocurrencies in
<span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> quite a bit
during the past few years. Recently, a friend introduced me to
Anubis, so I want to mention it briefly here. 
</p><p>
Whether you're mining for Bitcoins with ASIC hardware or Litecoins
with high-end graphics cards, chances are you're using the cgminer
program to do your mining. Although cgminer provides a nice console-based
screen for monitoring your miner, there's no easy way to see how all
your miners are doing at once. Enter: Anubis.
</p><p>
Anubis is a Web-based program that interacts over the network to
all your miners. It then combines the data it collected into a simple
monitoring screen so you can check temperature, errors, efficiencies
and even change configurations on the fly. If you're running more than
one instance of cgminer in your mining farm, you likely will benefit
from Anubis. Check it out at <a href="https://github.com/pshep/ANUBIS" target="_self">https://github.com/pshep/ANUBIS</a>.

<h2 class="title">Linux Help for Neuroscientists</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Joey Bernard</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #238, February 2014</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
In past articles, I have looked at distributions that were built with
some scientific discipline in mind. In this article, I take a look
at yet another one. In this case, I cover what is provided
by NeuroDebian (<a href="http://neuro.debian.net" target="_self">neuro.debian.net</a>).
</p><p>
I probably should start by clarifying
that NeuroDebian is not strictly a Linux distribution in the classical
sense. The people behind NeuroDebian began by working on PyMVPA (<a href="http://www.pymvpa.org" target="_self">www.pymvpa.org</a>), a Python
package to do multivariate pattern analysis of neural data. To make this
package easy to deploy, NeuroDebian was created. Over time, more and
more packages were added to NeuroDebian to try to create the ultimate
integrated environment for neuroscience. All of this work is described
in a scientific paper, &ldquo;Open is not enough. Let's take the next step: an
integrated, community-driven computing platform for neuroscience&rdquo;
(<a href="http://www.frontiersin.org/Neuroinformatics/10.3389/fninf.2012.00022/full" target="_self">www.frontiersin.org/Neuroinformatics/10.3389/fninf.2012.00022/full</a>). This
paper is available at the &ldquo;frontiers in
NEUROINFORMATICS&rdquo; Web site.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11626neurof1.large.jpg"><img src="11626neurof1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. The Main Page for NeuroDebian
</p></div></div><p>
Installing NeuroDebian is a bit different from other distributions. On the
main home page, there is a section called Get NeuroDebian.
Here you can select which distribution you use as your desktop and 
the mirror from which you want to download. 
</p><p>
You then get a couple commands
that you need to run on your system. The first one is a wget command
meant to download an entry for APT and store it in a source file in the
directory /etc/apt/sources.list.d/. The second command uses apt-key to
go out to the MIT PGP key server to download and install the key used to
verify the NeuroDebian packages. Once these two commands have been run,
you then can do:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo apt-get update
</pre>
</p><p>
to download the package definitions for everything provided by
NeuroDebian. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11626neurof2.large.jpg"><img src="11626neurof2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. You can get NeuroDebian further down on the main page.
</p></div></div><p>
This works well if you already are running some version of
Debian, or a derivative like Ubuntu, as your desktop operating system. But,
what can you do if you are running Windows or Mac OS X? The NeuroDebian
project provides a virtual machine option for those situations. If you select
either Windows or Mac OS X as the operating system in the download section,
you will be provided with a link to download an OVA file. This type
of file is a standard file format for virtual machines. For example,
you can import this file into Virtual Box (Figure 3). This virtual
machine uses Debian 7, or Wheezy, as the core operating system. The main
Web site says that GNOME is used as the desktop environment. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11626neurof3.large.jpg"><img src="11626neurof3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. The OVA file can be imported in Virtual Box to get a complete environment.
</p></div></div><p>
However,
when I actually installed the latest version of the virtual machine, the
desktop environment that is used is XFCE. You even could use this on your
Linux desktop in a virtual machine. This way, you always have a stable,
complete computing environment for neuroscience that you know will not
change or be broken. 
</p><p>
When you first start up this virtual machine, you
will be presented with some configuration steps. The first step is to
do an update of the installed packages. After this, you will be asked
whether you want to take part in an application survey. If you are using
NeuroDebian regularly, you may want to take part in order to provide
feedback to the team. Several tools require environment
variables to be set. The next step asks you whether you want these to be
set automatically in the default profile settings. The next step allows
you to select several extra packages like Emacs, a PyMVPA tutorial and
R. Be prepared for a bit of a wait, as there are several packages to be
downloaded. In my case, I ended up with a download of 625MB of extra
packages. 
</p><p>
After all of the configuration steps are completed, you can
click on the Applications Menu button in the top right-hand corner
and go down to the NeuroDebian menu entry. Here you will find all of
the particular applications specifically selected for neuroscience. They
are broken down into categories for electrophysiology, medical imaging,
psychophysics and a section of support links to access the relevant
mailing lists. There is also an entry to re-run the setup wizard for
the virtual machine.
</p><p>
Now that you have NeuroDebian installed and set up, let's take a quick
look at some of the provided tools. The core reason for the creation of
NeuroDebian was to deploy PyMVPA, so let's start there. PyMVPA
provides a set of tools to do multivariate pattern analysis on large data
sets. This is very useful in neuroimaging. Several processing
steps are usually involved in this type of work flow, such as
data preparation, classification, feature selection and generalization
testing. PyMVPA provides high-level abstraction of these processes. 
</p><p>
A tutorial is available at the PyMVPA project Web site that walks you
through the core concepts and processes involved in using it. A full
description of what you can do would require a whole article on its
own. 
</p><p>
PyMVPA isn't the only software included, however. Going to the package
list at the NeuroDebian home page gives a full listing, broken down into
the following categories: distributed computing, electrophysiology,
magnetic resonance imaging, modeling of neural systems, neuroscience
datasets and psychophysics. 
</p><p>
An interesting piece of software is under
the educational category: virtual-mri-nonfree. This package provides
a virtual MRI scanner to simulate running an MRI. This way, you can
learn about how scanner parameters affect your images&mdash;a very cool tool.
</p><p>
Software is not the only thing provided by the NeuroDebian
distribution. There is also a rather large set of data packages available,
all in one location. These include items like brain atlases, fMRI data
from face and object processing in the ventral temporal cortex, and an
MRI-based brain atlas of the anatomy of a normal human brain. 
</p><p>
There
are tutorials for PyMVPA and MRI analysis that require sample data
sets. These also are available from NeuroDebian. Additionally, there is a blog
on the NeuroDebian Web site where you can find articles on specific tools
and help with particular techniques.
</p><p>
If you do work in computational neuroscience, you could do worse than
starting with NeuroDebian. This distribution gives you a full set of tools
to get you started. There even are further derivatives of NeuroDebian,
built to support classwork or to have a specific subset of the tools
available for well-defined work flows. Maybe other research communities
might be tempted to do a similar project? If you have the ability, you
should consider offering some of your skills back to the project in order
to help it grow. Of course, this is true of all-open source projects.

<h2 class="title">Full SteamOS Ahead!</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #238, February 2014</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Although its timetable may not always be ideal, Valve has come through for
Linux users lately. Not only has it released a native Linux version
of Steam (with many native games!), it also has expanded its Linux
support as the basis for its standalone SteamBox. The first step toward
a Steam-powered console is the operating system. Thankfully for nerds
like me, Valve released its operating system (SteamOS) to the public.
</p><p>
SteamOS is in beta testing right now, and unfortunately at the time of
this writing, it supports only NVIDIA graphics cards. That limits who
can test the OS, but releasing the operating system at all is extremely
exciting! Geeks have been creating their own XBMC boxes for years, and
now we'll be able to create our own gaming consoles too.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11626steamf1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
(Image from <a href="http://www.steampowered.com" target="_self">www.steampowered.com</a>)
</p></div></div><p>
If you haven't tried SteamOS yet, and if you have an NVIDIA graphics card,
I urge you to go try it out (<a href="http://store.steampowered.com/steamos/buildyourown" target="_self">store.steampowered.com/steamos/buildyourown</a>). Will the SteamBox finally bridge the gap
between PC gaming and console gaming? Will its open-source roots help
SteamOS become the dominant living room device? It's been a number of
years, but Valve definitely has invested into the Linux community. Now
if you'll excuse me, I need to go shoot some zombies.

I'm not really much of a computer gamer. That said, I'm both ashamed and
oddly proud of the hours (probably thousands!) I spent playing <span   class="emphasis"><em>Dune
2000</em></span>
back when it was cutting-edge gaming technology. There's just something
about real-time strategy games that appeals to those of us lacking the
reflexes for the more action-packed first-person shooters. If you also
enjoy games like <span   class="emphasis"><em>Dune 2000</em></span>,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Starcraft</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Warcraft</em></span>,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Civilization</em></span> or other
RTS classics, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Warzone 2100</em></span> will be right up your alley.
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Warzone 2100</em></span> reminds me very much of my beloved
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Dune 2000</em></span>. The landscapes,
the missions and even the look of the game pieces resemble that old RTS
game I spent so much time playing. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Warzone 2100</em></span> is far
better than <span   class="emphasis"><em>Dune
2000</em></span> ever was, however, thanks to its amazing set of features:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Cross-platform, supporting Windows, Mac and Linux.
</p></li><li><p>
Single-player missions.
</p></li><li><p>

</p></div></div><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Warzone 2100</em></span> truly excels at being a fun, easy-to-learn game. The coolest
part, at least in my opinion, is its history. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Warzone
2100</em></span> started as a
commercial game. Much like the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Quake</em></span> engine was
open-sourced, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Warzone 2100</em></span>
was released to the public as an open-source project back in 2004. Then,
in 2008, the rights of that license were clarified, and the in-game
videos and soundtrack also were released. Now the game is under active
development, and it has a healthy community releasing maps and mods.
</p><p>
The game is available for direct download either at SourceForge
or its Web site: <a href="http://www.wz2100.net" target="_self">www.wz2100.net</a>. It's also available using Desura,
the Linux-native game manager (similar to Steam) that we've covered
before in <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>. Due to its fun and relevant gameplay,
cross-platform availability and awesome history, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Warzone
2100</em></span> is this
month's Editors' Choice.
