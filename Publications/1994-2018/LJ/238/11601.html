Can't afford to lose time in code refactoring for security? Why
not make everything secure in the first place? Read on!

As a software developer myself, I have seen developers rushing to finish the
feature they are assigned to, with little or no consideration for security
in the code&mdash;no security guidelines, no coding standards, just a mad
dash
to finish the feature. Next comes the security review, in which the
software obviously fails, and then comes the security-hardening phase.
</p><p>
Although trying to improve code's security obviously is a nice thing to do, the
time when it commonly is done is often in the final code development phase, and as
with the basic nature of software development, changing the code almost
always leads the software away from maturity. So,
the software that has almost ended its development phase is again
pushed to instability during the security-hardening phase. Is this really
necessary?
</p><p>
Why can't developers make the code secure in the first place?
What can be done to make developers more aware of application security
policies, so they are more informed and alert when they develop their
next application? In this article, I discuss how developers can do so effectively.
</p><p>
One simple way is to change developers' coding styles and make
them write code that is inherently secure. Also, following simple
policies related to application security can make a lot of difference. This
is sometimes not a very easy thing to do, but if the practices to follow are
simple and easy to adopt, it is not very difficult.
</p><p>
Let's look at some security concerns/flaws typically found in
software and the corresponding security mechanisms and policies that can
be applied to counter them. These mechanisms generally can be implemented
in all programming languages and follow the OWASP code development
guidelines. But, for the sake of open-source culture, I use PHP as the
language for the examples in this article.

SQL Injection</h2></div></div><p>
Let's start with the most famous of the lot. It is also one of the most widely used
and one of the most simple for unleashing attacks on the Web. What many
people don't know, however, is that it's easy to prevent as well. Let's first
consider what an SQL injection attack is. 
</p><p>
Suppose you have a text box in your
application for a user name field. As the user fills it in, you take the data to
the back end and fire a query to the database&mdash;something like this:


<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;Input Type = "Text" value ="username" name = "username"&gt;

&lt;?php $username = $_POST['username']; ?&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
Then, the SQL query:

<pre     class="programlisting">
SELECT * FROM table WHERE name = '" + $username + '"
</pre>
</p><p>
A simple way to attack this system would be to type &ldquo;'&rdquo; or
&ldquo;'1'='1&rdquo; in the text
box. The resulting database query now will be:

<pre     class="programlisting">
SELECT * FROM table WHERE name = '  ' or  '1'='1'
</pre>
</p><p>
As you can see, this condition always is true and when executed, the query
will just split out all the rows in the table. This was a simple example,
but in real-life scenarios, such attacks are very severe and can take down a
whole application in a few seconds, because they are targeted directly at
the database. 
</p><p>
So, how can you prevent this? Simple logic is that instead
of passing the input taken from the front end directly, it should be
checked thoroughly and only then sent to the database as a part of the query.
Here are the most common and effective ways to do that:
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Parameterized Queries:</b></span> such queries result
in exactly the same way as normal
SQL queries, but the difference is that here you need to define the SQL code
first and then pass the parameters to the query later. So, even if someone
tries to attack by passing malicious data to the query, the query searches
for the exact match of whatever is sent as input. For example, if someone
tries to pass ' or '1=1 as the data, the query will look up the DB
for a literal match of the data. 
</p><p>
Here is an example of how to write
parameterized queries in PHP (see your programming language manual for more
about parameterized queries):


<pre     class="programlisting">
/* Prepared statement, stage 1: prepare */
if (!($stmt = $mysqli-&gt;prepare("INSERT INTO test(id) VALUES (?)"))) {
 echo "Prepare failed: (" . $mysqli-&gt;errno . ") " . $mysqli-&gt;error;
}

/* Prepared statement, stage 2: bind and execute */
$id = 1;

if (!$stmt-&gt;bind_param("i", $id)) {
    echo "Binding parameters failed: (" . $stmt-&gt;errno . ") " .
$stmt-&gt;error;
}

if (!$stmt-&gt;execute()) {   
    echo "Execute failed: (" . $stmt-&gt;errno . ") " . $stmt-&gt;error;
}
</pre>
</p><p>
So, the next time you need to look up the database, use a parameterized
query for it. But beware, this approach has a downside as well. In some
cases, doing this can harm performance, because parameterized queries need server
resources. In situations where an application is performance-critical, 
there are other ways to counter SQL injection attacks. 
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Stored procedures:</b></span> this is another
commonly used method for
countering SQL injection attacks. It works the same as parameterized queries,
the only difference being that the procedure or the method is itself stored
in the database and called by the application when required. Here's how to
write a stored procedure in PHP for MySQL:


<pre     class="programlisting">
/* Create the stored procedure */
if (!$mysqli-&gt;query("DROP PROCEDURE IF EXISTS p") ||
    !$mysqli-&gt;query("CREATE PROCEDURE p(IN id_val INT) 
     &#8618;BEGIN INSERT INTO
test VALUES(id_val); END;")) {
    echo "Stored procedure creation failed: (" . $mysqli-&gt;errno . ") " .
$mysqli-&gt;error;
}

/* Call the stored procedure */
if (!$mysqli-&gt;query("CALL p(1)")) {
    echo "CALL failed: (" . $mysqli-&gt;errno . ") " . $mysqli-&gt;error;
}
</pre>
</p><p>
This approach is equally effective in preventing SQL injection as
the parameterized queries method I mentioned earlier, so you can decide which
is better for your situation.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Escaping user supplied input:</b></span> in this
approach, user input is
manually (or sometimes with the help of DBMS escaping mechanisms) escaped
for valid strings, thus minimizing any chance of SQL injection attacks.
Although it is bit weaker than other approaches, it can be useful in
cases where you want better performance or are rewriting legacy code and
want to finish with lesser effort. 
</p><p>
PHP provides an automatic input escape
mechanism called magic_quotes_gpc that you can use before sending the
input to the back end. But, it would be better to use the escaping mechanism
provided by your database, because in the end, the query comes to the database,
and the database will know better about what is a valid query. MySQL provides
the mysql_real_escape_string() method to escape the input. Check your
database documentation to find which escape function is supported.

Session Handling</h2></div></div><p>
As soon as legitimate users log in to a site with their credentials, a
session is started and maintained until they log out. The problem begins
when someone impersonating a genuine user tries to sneak in. Obviously,
the results can be very severe&mdash;users'
money or even their identities can be stolen. Let's explore how you
can change your coding style so that the session is handled safely.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Session management implementation:</b></span> you
always should use the built-in
session management feature that comes out of the box with your Web
development framework. Not only does this save critical development time and
cost, it generally is safer as well, because many people are 
using and testing it. 
</p><p>
Another thing to take care of while implementing session
management is keeping track of what method the application uses to
send/receive the session ID. It may be a cookie or URL rewriting or a
mixture of both, but you generally should limit it and accept the session
ID only via the mechanism you chose in the first place.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Cookie management:</b></span> whenever you plan to use cookies, be aware that you
are sending out data about the user/session, which potentially can be
intercepted and misused. So, you need to be extra careful while handling
cookies. Always add the cookie attributes securely with HttpOnly, because
this
ensures that the cookie always is sent only via an HTTPS connection and
doesn't allow scripts to access the cookie. These two attributes will
reduce the chances of cookies being intercepted. 
</p><p>
Other attributes like
domain and path always should be set to indicate to the browser where
exactly the cookie should be sent, so that it reaches only the exact
destination and not anywhere else. 
</p><p>
Last but definitely not least, the
expire and max age attributes should be set in order to make the cookie
nonpersistent, so it is wiped off once the browser instance is closed. 
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Session expiry management:</b></span> a timeout should be enforced over and
above the idle time out, so that if users intend to stay longer, they
should authenticate themselves again. This generates a new session ID, so
attackers have less time to crack the session ID. 
</p><p>
Also, when the session
is being invalidated, special care should be taken to clear the browser
data and cookie, if used. To invalidate a cookie, set the session ID to
empty and the expires date to a past date. Similarly, the server side 
also should close and invalidate the session by calling proper session handling
methods, for example session_destroy()/unset() in PHP.

Web Service Security</h2></div></div><p>
In layman's terms, a Web service can be defined as a software system designed
to support communication between two electronic devices over the Internet.
In real-life scenarios, however, things are not that simple. As the Internet
grows, the threat of misuse of these services grows. Let's look at some
important tips you should keep in mind while developing Web services.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Schema validation:</b></span> whatever SOAP payloads you expect your Web
service to handle, they should be validated against the associated XML schema
definition. The XSD should at least define the maximum length and character
set of every parameter allowed in the Web service. Also, if you expect a
fixed-format parameter, such as e-mail ID, phone numbers and so on, define the
validation pattern in the XSD.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>XML denial of service prevention:</b></span> denial
of service attacks try
flooding the Web server with a large number of requests so that it eventually
crashes. To protect your Web service from such attacks, be sure to optimize
the configuration for maximum message throughput and limit SOAP message
size. Also, validate the requests against recursive or oversized payloads,
because such payloads generally can be malicious.

Safe URL Redirects</h2></div></div><p>
Many times you will need to redirect to a new page based on user input.
But, the
redirects can take a dangerous turn if not done properly. For example, if 
attackers get to redirect the application to a URL of their choice, they 
then can launch a phishing attack and compromise user data. A safe URL redirect
is one where you have hard-coded the URL in the code like this:
 
<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;?php header("Location: http://www.mywebsite.com") ?&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
Cases like the following where you have to go to a URL passed by the user
should be avoided:
 
<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;?php $url = $_GET['inputURL'];
header("Location: " . $url); ?&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
If you can't avoid this, keep reading.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Don't use the URL as the input:</b></span> even if you want to redirect to
a URL based on user input, it is better not to allow the user to enter the URL.
Instead, you can use other input mechanisms like a button or a direct link.
This way you can prevent users from entering any random link.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Validate the input before the redirect:</b></span> in cases where you simply can't
avoid user input, make sure you validate the input against exactly the same
site or a list of hosts or a regex. Also notify users with an
indication of the site they are being redirected to. 
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcf0580.0xde9ab8"></a>
Cross-Site Scripting</h2></div></div><p>
Such attacks are targeted to the end user's browser. A common way to
attack is to inject a malicious script, in the form of JavaScript, Flash or
even HTML to a genuine Web site. When the user accesses that site, the
browser has no clue whether script is genuine and just executes it.
Such scripts, once executed, can access the cookies, session data or other
sensitive information stored in the browser, because they are sent via a
genuine Web site that the user tried to access. 
</p><p>
To counter such attacks/injections in your Web site, OWASP
suggests treating the Web pages as templates with certain slots for the
untrusted data. For example, say you are creating a home page, and on the
top left, you have a slot for the user name, which is retrieved by the
application and displayed to the user while the Web page renders. These
slots can be for one of several components&mdash;for example,
JavaScript, HTML or CSS.
For each component, there are preventive measures that help make sure
others can't
inject their code. 
Let's look at all the rules.
</p><p>
First, you need to define the slots that should be present
in the Web page. Then, make sure you don't allow any untrusted data into
the document, unless it is within one of the slots you already defined. 
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Untrusted data in HTML tags and
attributes:</b></span> when you need to insert
untrusted data in HTML tags like div, p, b, td and so on, make sure it is
escaped before being used. This way, even if attackers somehow manage to
send in their code, escaping the untrusted data will ensure that the code
doesn't cause much harm. For example, characters like &lt;, &gt;, &amp; and
so on
should be changed to &amp;lt, &amp;gt and &amp;amp, respectively. Also attribute fields in
HTML tags like name, id, width and so on sometimes can be required to take
variable values, so you may need to pass untrusted data to such fields. In
this case, make sure to escape the data before using it as well. Take a
look 
at the ESAPI reference implementation of HTML entity escaping and
un-escaping. Here is a sample usage of the API:

<pre     class="programlisting">
String safe = ESAPI.encoder().encodeForHTMLAttribute( 
 &#8618;request.getParameter("input" ) );
</pre>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Untrusted data in CSS:</b></span> in situations where you need to put untrusted data in
CSS, it is important to take care that it is done only in a property value
and nowhere else. Especially when you need to pass a URL, check if it
starts with &ldquo;http&rdquo;. Then, except for alphanumeric characters, escape
all the other characters with an ASCII value less than 256 (the ESAPI also
supports CSS escaping and un-escaping):

<pre     class="programlisting">
String safe = ESAPI.encoder().encodeForCSS( 
 &#8618;request.getParameter( "input" ) );
</pre>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Untrusted data in an HTTP GET parameter:</b></span> URLs like
&ldquo;http:www.mysite.com/value=data&rdquo; can be possible targets of attack if the
GET parameter is not being escaped before execution. In such cases, make
sure to escape all characters with an ASCII value less than 256 with the %HH
escaping format. The ESAPI for URL validation looks like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
String safe = ESAPI.encoder().encodeForURL( 
 &#8618;request.getParameter( "input" ) );
</pre>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Untrusted data in JavaScript data values:</b></span> if you want to place
untrusted data in JavaScript, the only safe place is inside the quoted data
value. Because otherwise it is very easy to change the execution context and
execute the statement, which actually is meant to be data. Again, the
escaping mechanism to follow is the same as in previous cases&mdash;that is,
escape all the characters with an ASCII value less than 256. The ESAPI
for this is:

<pre     class="programlisting">
String safe = ESAPI.encoder().encodeForJavaScript( 
 &#8618;request.getParameter("input" ) );
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcf0580.0xde09d0"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Finally, it is best to acquaint yourself with the OWASP security guidelines if you are a
Web developer or plan to become one. This not only will save you a lot of
work in design changes and security hardening, but it also makes sure your
end users' data and identity are safe.
