Why let your e-mail do all the nagging? Let screen alert you to
Nagios issues.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe6e580.0xf663b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
In the February 2011 issue, I wrote about screen, the console window
manager, and how I configure its hardstatus line to show notifications
along the bottom of my terminal window. Although some people like their
desktop environment to fire up notifications when they have a new e-mail
or IM, because I spend a good deal of my time within screen, it has my
focus, and it makes sense to put important notifications there. In that
February 2011 article (see Resources), I introduced how to set up the hardstatus line and demonstrated
a custom script I use to show when I have new e-mail.
</p><p>
For this article, I expand on the topic of screen notifications
with a new notification script I've found incredibly useful. Ever since
I've had more than a handful of servers, I've relied on monitoring programs
like Nagios to keep track of server health. Although monitoring software has
its own method of notifications via e-mail or SMS, I've found it valuable
to have my current Nagios health right there in my screen session. It
not only provides a backup to my mail notifications, it also saves me from
having a Nagios window open in my browser all the time.
</p><p>
If you are new to screen and haven't set up a custom hardstatus line,
check out my February 2011 article first to get up to
speed. Instead of revisiting how to configure a .screenrc file from
scratch, I'm assuming you already have a basic .screenrc set up,
and instead, I'm skipping ahead to how to add this Nagios script to your
existing screen session.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe6e580.0xf66670"></a>
Screen Scraping for Screen</h2></div></div><p>
When I set about writing this script, I realized there are a number
of different ways to capture the current health of Nagios. Although I didn't
spend a lot of time looking into it, I imagine there are lower-level APIs
I could query, but honestly, all I really wanted was to know if Nagios was
all green (okay) or had any warnings or critical alerts (yellow or red),
and if so, how many. To accomplish that, I decided the simplest method
was to scrape one of the Nagios status pages for the information I
needed. Honestly, this same method should work pretty well for just about
any monitoring program you might use, as long as it has a Web interface
and you have enough regex-fu to parse the HTML for the data you need.
</p><p>
I originally wrote the script so that if the Nagios status was okay,
it would print that, and if there were any critical or warning alerts, it
would output those statistics instead. I realized that I wanted screen to
print okay in green, warnings in yellow and critical alerts in red. That
way, I might notice problems even if I wasn't looking directly at my
terminal at the time. To accomplish this, I actually needed to run the
script three different times within screen.
</p><p>
The script below takes just two arguments: the Nagios host to poll
(with an optional user name and password if you use one) and the type
of status to report. I chose the color codes green, yellow and red to
represent okay, warning and critical statuses, respectively. I found the
http://nagioshostname/cgi-bin/nagios3/tac.cgi page was the simplest to
scrape and had all of the information I needed for the script:


<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/usr/bin/perl

# usage: nagios_scraper.pl [user:password@]nagios_host STATUS
# where STATUS is green, red, yellow, or all

$nagios_host=shift;
$show=shift;

open TAC, "wget --timeout=2 -q -O - 
 &#8618;http://$nagios_host/cgi-bin/nagios3/tac.cgi |"; @tac = &lt;TAC&gt;;
close TAC;

foreach $line (@tac){
   if	($line =~ /(\d+) Down/){ 	$hosts_down = $1; }
   elsif($line =~ /(\d+) Unreachable/){	$hosts_unreachable = $1; }
   elsif($line =~ /(\d+) Up/){ 		$hosts_up = $1; }
   elsif($line =~ /(\d+) Pending/){ 	$hosts_pending = $1; }
   elsif($line =~ /(\d+) Critical/){ 	$services_critical = $1; }
   elsif($line =~ /(\d+) Warning/){ 	$services_warning = $1; }
   elsif($line =~ /(\d+) Unknown/){ 	$services_unknown = $1; }
   elsif($line =~ /(\d+) Ok/){ 		$services_ok = $1; }
   elsif($line =~ /(\d+) Pending/){ 	$services_pending = $1; }
}

# remove the username and password from the output
$nagios_host =~ s/.*\@//;

if($show eq "green" &amp;&amp; ($hosts_down == 0 &amp;&amp; $services_critical == 0 
 &#8618;&amp;&amp; $services_warning == 0)){
   print "$nagios_host: OK";
}
elsif($show eq "red" &amp;&amp; ($hosts_down &gt; 0 || $services_critical &gt; 0)){
   print "$nagios_host: ${hosts_down}D ${services_critical}C "; 
}
elsif($show eq "yellow" &amp;&amp; $services_warning &gt; 0){
   print "$nagios_host: ${services_warning}W "; 
}
elsif($show eq "all"){
   print "${hosts_down}D ${hosts_up}U ${services_critical}C 
   &#8618;${services_warning}W ${services_ok}OK";
}
</pre>
</p><p>
As you can see, I actually collect a lot more statistics than I ultimately
use, just in case I want to refer to them later. The important thing
to note in this script is that in each of the green, red and yellow
statuses, I print something only if there's something of that status to
print. This is crucial, because I don't want to
clutter my hardstatus line, and I want to see yellow or red text only if it truly needs my
attention.
</p><p>
Name this script nagios_scraper.pl, put it either in /usr/local/bin
for everyone to use or your user's ~/bin/ directory, make sure it is
executable, and then test it against your Nagios server to make sure you
have the syntax right. For instance, if you had no user name or password
set up for Nagios, and your Nagios server was named naggyhost, you would
type the following command to test if everything was okay:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ /usr/local/bin/nagios_scraper.pl naggyhost green
</pre>
</p><p>
Type the following to test for critical alerts:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ /usr/local/bin/nagios_scraper.pl naggyhost red
</pre>
</p><p>
Or, type the following to test see all statuses:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ /usr/local/bin/nagios_scraper.pl naggyhost all
</pre>
</p><p>
I do recommend that you set up a user name and password for your Nagios Web
access if you haven't already. Because the user name and password
you use for this script ultimately will end up in plain text, I recommend setting up
an account for the Nagios Web interface that can log in but can see
only the Nagios status and can't submit any changes (like maintenance modes
and acknowledgements). Let's assume I set up an account called readonly
with a password of n0wr1t3 on naggyhost. I would call the script like this:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ /usr/local/bin/nagios_scraper.pl readonly:n0wr1t3@naggyhost red
</pre>
</p><p>
Again, if the script doesn't provide any output in one of the modes,
it could just mean that the status doesn't currently apply. If you want
to test that for sure, run the script with the all argument instead of
green, yellow or red to see the full status.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe6e580.0xf66d50"></a>
We Will, We Will, Nag You</h2></div></div><p>
Once you have tested the script and have it working, the next step is to
add it to your ~/.screenrc. The first step is to add three new backtick
configuration lines to ~/.screenrc that will call nagios_scraper.pl each
with green, red and yellow statuses. In my case, I assume you might
have a few backtick commands defined, so I start with command 110:

<pre     class="programlisting">
backtick 110 27 27 /usr/local/bin/nagios_scraper.pl 
 &#8618;readonly:n0wr1te@naggyhost red
backtick 111 61 61 /usr/local/bin/nagios_scraper.pl 
 &#8618;readonly:n0wr1te@naggyhost yellow
backtick 112 73 73 /usr/local/bin/nagios_scraper.pl 
 &#8618;readonly:n0wr1te@naggyhost green
</pre>
</p><p>
I've set each of these commands to run at different intervals. I want to
check for critical alerts more frequently than warnings or when everything
is okay, so I run the command with the red argument every 27 seconds. I
then run it with yellow and green every 61 and 73 seconds. Note that
I set these intervals to be at odd times. I've realized the value in
staggering my screen notification scripts so they don't risk all running
at the same time, so to help with that I try to choose odd intervals.
</p><p>
Once you have defined the backtick lines, the next step is to add them
to your hardstatus string so they show up in green, yellow and red. In
my case I pasted in:

<pre     class="programlisting">
%{+b r}%110`%{+b y}%111`%{= g}%112`
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe6e580.0xf66fb8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
so that my hardstatus string modified from my previous article would be:

<pre     class="programlisting">
hardstatus string '%{= w}%Y-%m-%d %c | %l | %101`| 
 &#8618;%{+b r}%110`%{+b y}%111`%{= g}%112`'
</pre>
</p><p>
Now save your changes to your ~/.screenrc, and either start up a new screen
session or type Ctrl-A : and type <tt  >source ~/.screenrc</tt> to load these changes
into your existing screen session. Figures 1 and 2 show
what the hardstatus line will look like either when the status is okay
or when there are critical alerts.

Figure 2. One host is down alert with five critical services.
</p></div></div><p>
What amazes me the most the more I dig in to screen notifications is just
how simple it is to add new scripts to the list once you get the hang
of it. Even if you don't use screen, it wouldn't be too difficult to
modify the script so that it outputs to a desktop notification instead
(see my December 2009 column for details).
