If you want to contribute to the Linux community but would rather talk
than develop software or write documentation, podcasting may be the
ideal approach for you.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cf6580.0x1dee250"></a></h2></div></div><p>
If you like to talk and have something interesting to say, you may
enjoy podcasting. A podcast is simply an audio file in MP3 or Ogg
format that people can download and listen to on their own
schedule.
</p><p>
A few years ago, I created a podcast called mintCast, which was
designed to help new users get started with Linux. I had been
listening to several podcasts, but I knew nothing about producing one
myself. This article summarizes what I learned during the following
two years. It should save you some time and pain, if you
decide to create a podcast.
</p><p>
Entire books have been written about podcasting, and you should read
some of them if you want to study the subject in depth. To keep this
article to a manageable length, I focus on what I learned
while producing mintCast.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cf6580.0x1dee4b8"></a>
Plan</h2></div></div><p>
The first step is to choose your topic and target audience. If your
topic is too broad or too narrow, it will be hard to build an
audience.
</p><p>
Going Linux has a great example. The home page describes the target
audience (&ldquo;New to Linux, upgrading from Windows to Linux, or just
thinking about moving to Linux?&rdquo;) and what it provides (&ldquo;practical,
day-to-day advice on how to use Linux and its
applications&rdquo;). Potential listeners can see at a glance if this is a
podcast they want to listen to.
</p><p>
A podcast episode usually has multiple segments. Typical
segments might include an introduction, personal news, industry news,
opinions and commentary, interviews, tutorials, tips, recommendations
of software or Web sites, and listener feedback. Whichever segments
you decide to use, it's a good idea to stay consistent. 
</p><p>
That doesn't mean you need to be absolutely rigid. A typical episode
of mintCast would have these segments: introduction, personal news,
Linux news, main topic, Web site recommendation and listener
feedback. The main topic would be a tutorial, interview or discussion
about a new distro release. This approach gave us a consistent format,
with enough variety to keep it fresh and interesting.
</p><p>
You should write an outline before you start recording. Include the
topics you want to talk about and the points you want to make. If
your show has multiple hosts, Google Documents is an effective way to
share your notes, because all the hosts can read and even edit the
document.
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Do not</em></span> write a script of exactly what you want to
say, and do not read directly from your notes. It's very obvious to
listeners when you do this, and it sounds
bad. It's acceptable to read a <span   class="emphasis"><em>brief</em></span> quotation, for
example, when you're reading from a news item. Otherwise, just write out
the points you want to make, and use the list only as a reminder as
you're speaking.
</p><p>
Will you work alone, or with other hosts? I always found it easier to
record a show with one or two other hosts. Having additional hosts means that
you don't have to know everything, and you don't have to do all the
talking.
</p><p>
In the first few episodes of mintCast, each host recorded separately,
then we edited the recordings together. In later episodes, we recorded
at the same time, allowing us to converse and play off each
other. Doing it that way made the shows more interesting, and it was easier for the hosts
to keep going. It did, however, add complexity to the process of
recording the show.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cf6580.0x1dee988"></a>
Recording</h2></div></div><p>
There are many ways to record a podcast. Sometimes I used a small handheld
recorder that saved the recordings in MP3 format and had a USB port
that allowed me to copy the files over to my PC.
</p><p>
Most of the time, I used Audacity to record the show. Audacity is an
open-source program that can record, edit and play audio files. You
can install it from your distro's repositories.
</p><p>
A good quality microphone makes a big difference when you're recording
a podcast. It doesn't need to be expensive, but do some research and
read reviews before choosing a microphone. 
</p><p>
A headset may seem to be a good choice, and that's what I worked
with. It causes problems, though&mdash;unless you're very disciplined
about always keeping your hands away from your head, it's very easy to
bump the headset, making an ugly noise on the recording. A microphone
boom can help avoid this.
</p><p>
Although Audacity has a lot of power and features, it's very easy to
use. The default settings are fine for recording spoken voice. You can
tweak the input settings by watching the meter while speaking a few
words, then click the big red Record button when you're ready to
start.
</p><p>
It becomes more complicated if you have two hosts and you're not sitting
in the same room. On mintCast, we solved this problem by talking on the
telephone, and each of us recorded our own audio in Audacity. We could
then assemble the recordings as side-by-side tracks in Audacity. This
gave us a very high recording quality.
</p><p>
When more hosts joined the team, or when we did user interviews, we
needed to get three or four people on the call at the same time. We
did not have the ability to do conference calls from our personal
phones, and we didn't want to ask our interview subjects to try to use
Audacity.
</p><p>
We tried Skype and Skype Call Recorder, but never managed to get that
working. I know other podcasts use this software, and I
certainly would try it again if I were doing a podcast now.
</p><p>
Some podcasts use the Talkshoe Web site. Once you've created a free
Talkshoe account, you can create a call series and invite others to
the calls. You can allow them to participate fully or just
listen. Calls can be recorded and then are available to listen to or
download at any time.
</p><p>
You can listen to Talkshoe calls on your computer or telephone. You
can participate by calling in from a telephone or by using Skype or
Ekiga. Talkshoe also sets up a chat room, allowing listeners on a live
show to interact with the hosts.
</p><p>
Talkshoe can be your start-to-finish solution to
podcasting. It allows
you to promote, broadcast, record and publish your recordings. Why,
then, should you bother with any of the other tools and processes in
this article?
</p><p>
For mintCast, I could not bring myself to publish our shows without a
considerable amount of editing. Each of the hosts had a verbal tic&mdash;for
example, frequently saying &ldquo;uh&rdquo;, &ldquo;you know&rdquo; or
&ldquo;basically&rdquo;&mdash;that was too embarrassing to leave in the recording. In Talkshoe, the
audio is published exactly as it is recorded.
</p><p>
We also wanted to edit in theme music at the beginning and end of the
show. We couldn't do that with Talkshoe.
</p><p>
Still, we often used Talkshoe to record the show. I then
would download the recording and do the necessary editing before
publishing it to our own Web site.
</p><p>
The mintCast team now is using Mumble to record shows. Mumble is
a free and open-source voice chat program. It uses a nonstandard
protocol, so you need to set up a Mumble server to which the Mumble
clients can connect. With Mumble server and client version 1.2.3, you
have the ability to record the Mumble call. You then can load the
recording into Audacity for editing.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cf6580.0x1def118"></a>
Recording Tips</h2></div></div><p>
Before making your first recording, it's a good idea to do a test
recording for at least five to ten minutes. Make sure your recording
levels are good, and that it sounds like you expect. Listen for
background noise&mdash;things that you normally don't even notice, like
ceiling fans and air conditioners, might interfere.
</p><p>
Even low-quality microphones seem to pick up everything you don't want on
the recording. If you're eating, drinking or typing, listeners
will know it.
</p><p>
Make sure you know where your mute button is. If your microphone
doesn't have a mute button, leave the sound control panel open on your
PC and find the mute control. A lot of things can happen that you
don't want on the recording, and the mute button can save you a lot of
tedious editing.
</p><p>
Don't worry about making a perfect recording. Unless you're using
Talkshoe to publish the podcast exactly as recorded, you can edit out
most mistakes. We often found ourselves rambling or stumbling over
our words, and then we would take a moment to collect our thoughts and then go
back and start over at the beginning of the sentence or
paragraph. These &ldquo;do-overs&rdquo; helped us produce a better show. 
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cf6580.0x1def380"></a>
Editing</h2></div></div><p>
Once you have the show recorded, the best tool for editing is
Audacity. It's in the repo of every major distro, and it's very easy
to use, even if you have no previous experience editing audio.
</p><p>
If you recorded in Audacity, you're ready to start editing. If you
recorded with some other tool, Audacity can open files in any audio
format. If you have each host's audio in a separate recording, you can
add new audio tracks and paste each recording into a separate track. 
</p><p>
I also like to add a separate track for music. We had a theme song at
the beginning of the show, a longer version of the theme for the end
of the show, and a five-second clip from the theme that we used as a
bumper between segments. I put all of those clips into the audio
track.
</p><p>
Audacity allows you to select part of the audio, then cut or copy 
and paste it. A scrolling display shows a waveform of your audio for
each track, making it easy to select exactly the part of the clip you
want to work with. You can zoom in or out on the waveform
display. After doing a few shows, I could recognize my &ldquo;uhs&rdquo; from the
waveform before I even heard them.
</p><p>
If your audio is in multiple tracks, be careful about deleting
material. If you delete a clip from one track, you've now changed
the timing for the rest of that track, and it will be out of sync with the
other tracks. If you delete a clip, be sure to select and delete that
time frame from all tracks so that they will stay in sync. Audacity
allows you to click and drag across all of the tracks if you need to.
</p><p>
But, if you need to remove unneeded noise from one track while a host
is talking on another track, you don't want to delete it. Just select
the noise in the waveform, then click the Generate menu and choose
Silence. This will silence that part of that track, without affecting
that track's timing compared to the other tracks.
</p><p>
Audacity has several useful tools on the Generate and Effect menus. If
you want to remove a sound without silencing it, you also can select
the clip and Generate a tone, a chirp or a noise that sounds like
static.
</p><p>
It was not unusual for our initial recording levels to come out way
too low. The Effect menu includes an Amplify command, allowing us to
select an entire track (or any portion of it) and amplify the volume.
</p><p>
If the volume varies too much in different parts of the recording, the
Compressor command on the Effect menu can bring the levels closer
together. The volume will be increased for the quiet parts and reduced
for the loud parts.
</p><p>
If you do have a consistent noise in the background, such as an air
conditioner, the Noise Removal command on the Effect menu often
can remove it. You need a few seconds of audio where you're not talking,
where the only sound is the background noise you want to remove. When
you click the Noise Removal command, a dialog box pops up explaining
how to use it.
</p><p>
Save often as you work. Although crashes were not frequent, Audacity did
crash more than any other program I've used in Linux.
</p><p>
Finally, Audacity can export the finished file to the appropriate
audio format. Podcasts are typically MP3, though many also are offered
in Ogg format.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cf6580.0x1def8a8"></a>
Music</h2></div></div><p>
Remember that all those CDs and MP3s you've purchased over the years
are copyrighted&mdash;you can't use those songs in your show. However,
there are sources where you can get music without spending thousands
of dollars.
</p><p>
The Podcast Themes Web site has music specifically created for
podcasts. A few songs are available for free, and many others
are available at a low cost. Various licenses allow you
to buy exclusive or non-exclusive rights to the music. 
</p><p>
Unique Tracks is another Web site that offers royalty-free music. They
offer individual songs and albums in many different styles: classical,
uplifting, rock, heavy metal, hip-hop, New Age and many
others. Many of the songs include the full-length song as well as
shorter versions, and some even include a loop of five to ten seconds,
which is ideal for a bumper.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cf6580.0x1defab8"></a>
Publishing</h2></div></div><p>
Once you have a completed recording, you need to publish it so that
others can download it. If you recorded in Talkshoe, it's already
published. Even if you recorded in Talkshoe, you still can publish it
to your own site. 
</p><p>
Any Web-hosting company will offer a template for publishing a
podcast. If your site uses WordPress, you'll need the PodPress
plugin. In any case, you'll have a Web location to upload the finished
files. Then, create a blog entry on your site and link the audio files.
</p><p>
Although your site probably already offers a feed, you can use Google
FeedBurner to get information allowing you to analyze your
traffic. Once you're set up in FeedBurner, it's a good idea to submit
your podcast to the iTunes store, the Zune Marketplace and Podcast
Alley. All of those will make it easier for people to find your
podcast. 
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cf6580.0x1defc70"></a>
Feedback</h2></div></div><p>
Once you have listeners, some will give you feedback about the
show. It's best if your Web site is set up with a forum where
listeners can discuss the show. On simpler sites, they may be
able to leave comments only on the blog post. If nothing else, at least get
a Gmail account and publish the address.
</p><p>
Read the comments and consider them seriously, especially the negative
comments. I know it's painful to read criticism after you've put so
much work into the podcast, but those criticisms often can help you
make a better podcast. Encourage listeners to write in with
comments and suggestions, and thank them for their feedback.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
When I first started using Linux, the podcasts I listened to really
helped me a lot. I was reading books and magazines, of course, but
listening to a friendly voice really helps make a new topic
accessible. It's also nice to be able to learn new things while
driving to and from work.
</p><p>
If you like to talk and know a thing or two about Linux, why not help
others increase their mastery of Linux?
