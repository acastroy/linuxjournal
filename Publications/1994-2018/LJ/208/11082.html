Compuware's Gomez Platform</h2></div></div><p>
Compuware's integrated application performance management (APM) solution
not only has been upgraded but also rechristened the Compuware Gomez
Platform. Gomez, says Compuware, &ldquo;optimizes mobile and Web application
performance across the entire application delivery chain, from data
centers, through the cloud, to the edge of the Internet&rdquo;. This update
includes new functionality in both Compuware's on-premise APM products
(formerly called Vantage) and its software as a service (SaaS) APM
products, now all operating under the Gomez product brand name. New
features and capabilities in the new Gomez release include 
real-user monitoring, mobile-readiness assessment, real-user transaction
analytics, integration with Google Page Speed and Internet health map with
last-mile data.

Noble Harmony</h2></div></div><p>
Noble Systems has released the next generation (that is, version 2) of Noble
Harmony, a browser access tool for remote and mobile contact center
management. Version 2 builds on the earlier edition's flexible,
browser-agnostic design, adding improved user-interface layout and
customization. The net effect is that managers and supervisors can
operate effectively without being tethered to an individual station by
allowing them to monitor real-time activities with mobile devices and
tablets. More specifically, they now can arrange how KPI information is
displayed on the dashboard, speed access to frequently used screens, query
a vastly expanded array of variables, set alerts to be triggered on
specific activities and parameters, find and analyze individual campaigns
and agents, and manage list assignments.

Protecode's Developer Assistant</h2></div></div><p>
The folks at Protecode have expanded the reach of Developer Assistant, a
tool that the company calls &ldquo;the industry's first solution for
real-time management of open-source licensing and copyrights&rdquo;.
Previously available only for the Eclipse IDE, the tool now supports all
operating systems and all software development tools worldwide. Developer
Assistant, says Protecode, operates unobtrusively in the background and
requires no training for developers, allowing them to concentrate on
development rather than open-source license management. Operating directly
at the developer workstation, it uses the code analysis services of
Protecode's Enterprise Server and compares the code structure of a file
to signatures of millions of files stored in Protecode Global IP
Signatures. There, it identifies the licensing and copyright obligations of
the file and provides instant feedback to the developer as the code is put
together or brought in from the Internet, an external storage device or a
corporate repository.

InMage Scout</h2></div></div><p>
From the backup and recovery news desk comes breaking news from InMage on
version 6 of InMage Scout&mdash;a single, easy-to-use solution for local backup
and replication of physical and virtual environments that is based on
continuous data protection (CDP) technology. InMage claims that the
upgraded InMage Scout becomes the only unified product on the market
featuring CDP-based backup and remote disaster recovery support for most
major enterprise platforms, including Linux, AIX, Windows, VMware, Solaris,
XenServer and Hyper-V. The new Scout also features both asynchronous IP and
synchronous FC-based data protection without imposing software-based
storage virtualization on customers. With this launch, InMage Scout 6.0
also introduces the PureSplit architecture, which allows customers to use
their existing storage without having to virtualize it though server
appliances.

Queplix QueCloud</h2></div></div><p>
Integrate your disparate cloud-based, SaaS and on-premise applications with
Queplix's new QueCloud, easily and without coding. This can be done using
QueCloud, says Queplix, at low cost and with a great deal of automation
while avoiding common drawbacks, such as long service engagements, manual
processes and the constant wholesale movement of entire datasets.
QueCloud cites its Application Software Blades technology that provides
automatic connection to data sources, complemented by data virtualization
that brings all of the structure of the data sources into the system
instantly. From there, the entire data integration process merely involves
checking off boxes to align the data and the business rules desired. Once
applications are integrated, QueCloud keeps critical customer, product
and financial data consistent between applications. Absent from the process
are typical elements of ETL technology, such as coding, SQL, complex widgets
and wire diagrams.
