    Free software helps librarians serve the public on a

<span   class="emphasis"><em>koha</em></span>. It's also an integrated library system
from New Zealand. Written for the Horowhenua Library Trust (HLT),
it was licensed under the GPL and is now in use by libraries around
the world.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2354580.0x244c6b8"></a>History of the Project</h2></div></div><p>In 1999, HLT made a momentous decision. They were using a
12-year-old integrated library system (ILS) that was no longer
being developed. They knew the system wasn't Y2K-compliant, and
they realized it no longer fit their needs. HLT also knew that
buying a new system would cost them a lot of money up front and
would require capital improvements they couldn't afford to make
(communication lines and gear to support the new system).</p><p>Considering all of these factors, HLT, in consultation with
Katipo Communications, decided to write their own system. They then
decided to release this new system under the GPL, ensuring that
other libraries could benefit from the work and also cooperate in
future development of the system. This decision has had
far-reaching effects.</p><p>Koha was developed during the fourth quarter of 1999 and went
into production on January 1, 2000. There was a brief flurry of
work on the system, and it was released to the world early that
year. Koha won two awards in 2000: the 3M award for Innovation in
Libraries and the ANZ Interactive Award (Community/Not-for-Profit
Category).</p><p>Initially, Koha was picked up by other libraries in New
Zealand (many of them hiring Katipo for support). One early
adopter, Mike Mylonas, caught the vision of open-source software in
libraries and began to contribute to the project. Mike currently
supports Koha for four private libraries, one for his current
employer and three for nonprofit organizations.</p><p>It didn't take long for Koha to cross the Pacific. In the
fall of 2000 the rural Coast Mountain school district in British
Columbia, Canada, was looking for a solution for their library
needs. They had been running a home-brew system built on Apple II
computers, and it had finally died. Finding the money for a
proprietary solution would be difficult (a small elementary school
in New England recently received a quote for $20,000 to install a
new ILS&mdash;proprietary library automation isn't cheap), so they put
one of their network technicians to the task of finding a better
option.</p><p>Steve Tonnesen, Coast Mountain's network engineer, came
across Koha and started to evaluate it. It took him about two days
to get Koha up and running. Once he had that base to work from, he
starting hacking. He cleaned up the circulation interface, added
importing tools and wrote a Z39.50 client for querying other
libraries. Z39.50 is a standard protocol libraries use to exchange
data about books. Word of this new option spread quickly, and he
soon had three schools running the new system. Steve's changes went
back into the main Koha system, and he became a member of the
development team.</p><p>During April and May of 2002, Koha development took another
big step. Project leadership always had come from Katipo, but the
development team was now much more international and new
development goals were being proposed. One of the first steps was
the beginning of the 1.2 release cycle. These releases have focused
on building basic functionality and greater stability. So far,
there have been four releases in this series. New features include
an installation script, a fully template-driven on-line public
access catalog (OPAC), which supports both translation and
customization and bundled user documentation.</p><p>Right now, development is running in earnest on the 1.4
series, which features a new database schema that supports several
flavors of MAchine Readable Cataloging (MARC), the cataloging
standard used by libraries. The first development release in this
series (1.3.0) was made on September 24, 2002. A second release
occurred in October, and a 1.4.0 release is expected to occur in
the first quarter of 2003.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2354580.0x244ca28"></a>Using and Maintaining Koha</h2></div></div><p>Koha is pretty undemanding as library systems go and runs
handily on a stock Linux server. HLT is a library with 25,000
patrons at four locations and a collection of 80,000 items. They
run over 1,200 transactions a day on a system with dual P3 1GHz
processors and 1GB of RAM.</p><p>At the Immaculate Heart of Mary School library in Madison,
Wisconsin, Robert Maynord installed Koha on an AMD 1800-based
system with 256MB of RAM. Coast Mountain's systems run on 200MHz
Pentiums with 64MB of RAM located in each school.</p><p>Getting Koha running in a library used to be a rather
daunting task, but two easy methods now are available. The easiest
method is to download the CD image, burn a copy with a CD burner
and boot the new Koha server from the CD. You also can use the
install script to set up Koha on your hardware.</p><p>The CD can be run as a demo system, using the included data,
or it can be used as your server. If you choose to use it as your
server, you will need to create a set of data files on your
server's hard drive. The CD provides an interactive tool to do
this.</p><p>If you'd rather install your own copy, the process is a bit
more involved, but it still is not difficult. Before you get
started, you should make sure some basic components are installed,
namely Perl, Apache and MySQL. You'll need a few Perl modules as
well, but the install script helps you take care of those. The
install script has made installing Koha pretty painless. An upgrade
script also has been written to help ease the burden of keeping the
system up to date.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2354580.0x244cc90"></a>The Business Case for Libraries</h2></div></div><p>Proprietary ILS packages are expensive beasts. A larger
library may pay well in excess of $500,000 US for the server,
clients and software, and it still has yearly license and support
fees to worry about. Once a library has bought their system, they
experience a high barrier to change as well. Data is most often
kept in proprietary formats from which it is difficult to
export&mdash;in some cases, the data is actually &ldquo;owned&rdquo; by the system
vendor.</p><p>As with all non-free software, customers are left at the
mercy of their vendors for enhancements and customizations. Library
system vendors historically have been slow to provide innovative
new options. Although user groups exist for many of the existing
systems, they seem to be more like mutual support groups than
sources of feedback for the vendors. A worse fate is in store for
those whose ILS vendor goes out of business or is bought by another
vendor.</p><p>This situation presents a great opportunity for free
software. It's an opportunity that's not lost on librarians either,
at least not all of them. There is still a great deal of ignorance
and inertia to overcome. During an interview for the 2002 American
Library Association's (ALA) presidential election this past spring,
the candidates were asked what were their stands on free software.
One of the responses boiled down to, &ldquo;We need to support standards
and let the vendors work out how to provide the solutions we
need.&rdquo;</p><p>More encouraging signs are emerging. The ALA has an
information technology interest group, which reviewed open-source
software in the March 2002 edition of their journal. Some of the
articles were favorable, while others expressed a lack of
confidence in free software's ability to produce a viable ILS. The
definition of a viable ILS seems to vary considerably from library
to library.</p><p>Some of the brightest lights come from the small, but growing
open-source subculture, within the library community. The best
example of this is the Open Source for Libraries group, hosted at
<a href="http://www.oss4lib.org" target="_self">www.oss4lib.org</a>, which
maintains a news site and mailing list. usr/lib/info
(<a href="http://www.usrlib.info" target="_self">www.usrlib.info</a>) is
another group with a similar focus but a less technical
approach.</p><p>A number of presentations made at library conferences in 2002
offered more encouraging signs. In October 2002, Chris Cormack (one
of the original Katipo developers of Koha) was at the Ohio Library
Conference to talk about what we've done and where we're going.
Open-source software also got on the program at the Michigan
Library Association Conference, the British Columbia Library
Association Conference and Access 2002, a Canadian conference on
internet-based technology for libraries.</p><p>Perhaps the greatest indicator of our success is that
libraries have started to sponsor the development of features they
feel are important. Sometimes this patronage is direct, as with
Nelsonville Public Library, which contracted with one of the core
Koha developers to finish work on its internal use of MARC. In
other cases, the link is less direct, as is the case with recent
work done by another developer being paid by a library automation
vendor to develop a Koha solution for the vendor's customer.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2354580.0x244d058"></a>Free Software and Librarians, a Natural
Match</h2></div></div><p>Librarians espouse many of the same ideals that drive the
free software community. They collaborate and communicate; they
work hard to share the results of their work with one another. They
understand freedom and feel that it's an important value. That more
librarians aren't actively using and evangelizing free software is
an indictment against us for not letting them in on our
secret.</p><p>It's important that we not think we'd be munificent
benefactors, bringing a sack full of goodies to share. We can learn
a lot from librarians as well. They have a number of skills that
we, as a community, lack.</p><p>One of the key skills librarians bring to the table is
information architecture. Librarians have spent a long time
organizing information and making it accessible. If these skills
could be harnessed in the free software community, we might see
less duplication of efforts due to ignorance of existing projects,
better cooperation between projects and easier acquisition of
information by new developers and users.</p><p>Librarians also have been around as a group much longer, and
they are fixtures in the academic community as well. This presence,
and the established connections that come with it, could pay off
handsomely if we used them to help spread the work of free
software.</p><p>Librarians also could play a key role in creating and
improving documentation in free software projects. Librarians tend
to be good editors; they also have a good sense of what questions
people tend to ask&mdash;the kind of thing you really want in your
documentation. It also doesn't hurt that they have an expectation
that documentation and support will be there. I have received
personal mail (and phone calls) from librarians since my earliest
involvement in Koha&mdash;writing good documentation becomes more
attractive when you're faced with the alternative.</p><p>Librarians also are more likely to be involved in direct
communication with end users than are most free software hackers.
They are at the forefront of user-interface questions and
internationalization issues. Putting that experience to work in
creating user-friendly interfaces and documentation would be a
great boon to most projects. Librarians also are much less
forgiving of the technology; it has to run, all the time and within
much tighter parameters than do a lot of other types of
applications.</p><p>In recent years, open-source developers have become more
political. Librarians still have a significant leg up on us in this
area, however. What's more, their political ends overlap
significantly with our own. Working together to help ensure open
access to information, widespread adoption of free software and
improved educational opportunities would be a win for both
sides.</p><p>Finally, librarians tend to do a good job of engaging the
public. They advertise to, interact with and provide services for
our communities. They are seen as trusted sources of information,
true public servants. If libraries become staunch bastions of the
concepts behind free software, we gain a tremendous ally in
reaching out to those who don't yet use or understand free
software.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2354580.0x244d3c8"></a>Looking Ahead</h2></div></div><p>A lot of opportunities are on the horizon for Koha. As the
1.4 release series stabilizes, the developers' eyes have already
targeted a number of new projects. One of the areas starting to get
more attention is translations. French and German teams are already
in place, and interest in Italian, South African and Spanish groups
has started to build. (A nice side effect of this work is, we're
gaining experience here that can help other free software
projects.)</p><p>Right now, Koha is installed in libraries with collections of
up to about 300,000 items. This is still on the small end of
medium-sized libraries. Work to enable Koha to scale well past that
is already on the drawing boards. The search tools are being
rewritten to improve their efficiency and allow new searching
options.</p><p>Work is also underway to build a reporting API and a number
of bundled reports for Koha. These reports range from inventory
checking, to financial reports and into more esoteric realms like
&ldquo;weeding&rdquo;, or removing infrequently used items.</p><p>A bundled Z39.50 server and support for NCIP, a library
protocol for handling interlibrary requests, are both in
development and are being sponsored by libraries interested in
using Koha. These new features will allow a Koha-based library to
participate in larger library communities, including interlibrary
loan programs, and to function as a solution for &ldquo;union&rdquo;
catalogs, catalogs that integrate all of the libraries in a
region.</p><p>Members of the Koha community have started a strategic
discussion of what Koha needs to provide to continue to thrive.
