    If Linus cared more about what happens outside the kernel,

Cruise, over a hundred Linux faithful got to hang with Linus
Torvalds himself for a week. Although conversation seemed to run to
children more often than to technology (between us we have four
kids under six), Linus talked enough techno trash for me to gather
that the man's mantra consists of three short words: I don't care.
</p><p>There's a lot of stuff Linus doesn't care about: anything in
&ldquo;user space&rdquo;, other operating systems, new noncommodity
microprocessors, fights over development methods, the whole &ldquo;free
vs. open&rdquo; thing, etc. The list goes on forever, as there's a vast
world of technical and political stuff going on outside the one
thing he does care about: the kernel.</p><p>Linus opened his talk on the boat with this disclaimer: &ldquo;I
only do kernel stuff. I did user-level stuff about ten years
ago&mdash;only because without it the kernel isn't usable. I don't know
what happens outside the kernel, and I don't much care. What
happens inside the kernel I care about.&rdquo;</p><p>By not caring, Linus doesn't mean he has no opinions. Like
the rest of us, he has plenty of those. Unlike the rest of us,
however, he's a Major Figure whose opinions are given a great deal
of weight&mdash;even when he goes out of his way to remove gravity by
disclaiming any interest in a subject. That's why Linus made news
with a number of zero-gravity opinions he offered in his talk on
the boat, such as why he doesn't like Intel's Itanium or Apple's
Mac OS X.</p><p>It's only natural to assume that strong feelings accompany
strong opinions; but this seems to be less true for Linus than it
is for most people, because he often goes out of his way to explain
how little he cares about stuff that might be interesting but also
distracting. Politics is a perfect example. In that same talk on
the boat, he said, &ldquo;To me all the politics is just amusement
value. I don't care.&rdquo; And because he doesn't care, Linux is a huge
success. In fact, it's getting huger every day.</p><p>Another geek cruiser was Roland Smith, director of Global IT
Operations at LSI Logic. He explained to me how LSI Logic was
gradually converting to Linux pretty much across the board, from
fancy engineering workstations to desktops. For them, it wasn't
only that Linux is cheap and useful, but that it uncomplicates many
things.</p><p>Roland's story is consistent with a shift in the direction of
news about Linux that I began to sense around the time of the
cruise. The OS was suddenly being taken seriously and not simply as
a &ldquo;threat&rdquo; to Microsoft. It was becoming established as a
mainstream OS&mdash;perhaps <span   class="emphasis"><em>the</em></span> mainstream OS&mdash;and
the reasons were purely practical. Linux is cheap and easy to
deploy. It's about as simple and useful as an operating system can
be. These virtues are old hat for the Linux community, but they're
new hat for many of the world's suits, who aren't used to an OS
that doesn't obsolete itself as a matter of policy.</p><p>One of the panel discussions on the boat raised the subject
of obsolescence. Linus pointed out that commercial software is
based to some degree on a model that values obsolescence. Case in
point: when Windows 98 came out, Bill Gates was asked about threats
from Mac OS. Gates dismissed the question and said the real enemy
of Windows 98 was Windows 95. His goal, plainly, was to extract
fresh revenues from his entire customer base. Apple clearly has
similar plans with major new releases of Mac OS X. For two decades,
customers have taken this imperative for granted. They had no
choice.</p><p>Linux lets customers choose an OS that doesn't care to
obsolete itself. That choice became much more interesting to a lot
of suits last summer when Microsoft raised its licensing rates for
Windows. In a down economy, this rate increase put customers in a
much better frame of mind to entertain the Linux
alternative.</p><p>At the kernel level, Linux doesn't have a commercial agenda.
Its purpose is to be useful, period. If you can find a way to make
money with it, fine. Linus and his kernel don't care. Sure, some
things do get obsoleted along the way. In his talk, Linus explained
how the 2.6 kernel will have a whole new block device layer. But
even those changes are not being made for the sake of obsoleting
anything. They're being made so the kernel will be more useful, in
more ways, for as long as possible.</p><p>The inherent practicality of the Linux kernel extends upward
through the countless choices it supports. By contrast, it's hard
to imagine Microsoft or Apple wanting to support multiple desktops
or UIs by developers other than themselves. But that's exactly what
Linux does. It supports those desktops and UIs by not caring about
them.</p><p>Dave Sifry explains how it all works:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>By focusing on a strong separation between
kernel-space code and user-space code, the kernel is more stable
and strong user-space projects increase momentum. For example, by
reducing the amount of code in the kernel, projects like Samba have
been able to innovate in a decentralized manner and to create more
stable, feature-filled code. No one has to post a patch to
linux-kernel in order to get changes made to Samba. All of the
major subsystems of Linux share this attribute&mdash;XFree86, GNOME and
KDE, browsers, heck, even glibc (although the glibc example isn't
as strong as the others). We also don't have to worry about Linus
creating hidden APIs to make OpenOffice better than AbiWord, or
Mozilla better than Opera or KDE better than GNOME, no matter which
of those Linus personally prefers.</p></blockquote></div><p>Not caring is the ultimate level playing field, and it tends
to best support other level paying fields built on top of it. For
example, while Debian is perhaps the least commercial of all the
major Linux distributions, it has provided extremely practical
commercial &ldquo;solution&rdquo; building material for the likes of Lindows
and Xandros. If Debian were busy caring about those
implementations, it might be a lot less practical.
</p><p>&ldquo;Transparency&rdquo; is another old-hat Linux virtue that's
becoming a hot buzzword in the world of suits. How long before
customers demand the same absence of opacity in their OSes as they
do in their accounting systems? Hey, why care? It's going to happen
anyway.</p></div></div>
