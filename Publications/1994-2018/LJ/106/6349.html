    Moving the school computer lab to Linux was not an easy

Greater Houlton Christian Academy, enthusiastic students sit down
at their shiny, new computer workstations. In one corner, the red
cabinet housing the server hums quietly as two stuffed penguins
look on fondly from their perch. Other penguins keep watch from
different locations as the students enter their user names and
passwords to access their accounts. Ask a student who &ldquo;Tux&rdquo; is,
and he or she will point to the large penguin painted on the front
wall of the computer lab and say, &ldquo;He's the Linux penguin!&rdquo; About
this time KDE has loaded, and young boys and girls are opening the
application they need for class as easily as kicking a ball.

</p><p>Now for a little history. Greater Houlton Christian Academy
(GHCA) is a private school and nonprofit organization in Maine. As
such, it does not have the same access to funding as the public
school system. As the computer science teacher and system
administrator, this means I have to be creative about providing our
students with computer technology while working with a tight
budget. In the past I relied on area businesses and generous
individuals to donate their used computers. While these donations
were a great blessing to us, they were a temporary solution at
best.</p><p>Last year it became quite evident that we would need to
replace our old, secondhand computers running Windows 95. The
decision to move from donated computers to new computers was based
on many factors, though our primary goal was to make sure our
students had the best technology available for the enhancement of
their educational experience. Therefore, this would be a software
upgrade as well as a hardware upgrade. In fact, choosing the
software was by far the bigger challenge.</p><p>Interestingly enough, it was during this time that many
schools in the western US were being audited by Microsoft
concerning the school's use of Windows and Office software. I began
to realize my ignorance concerning exactly how strict and
inflexible the Microsoft EULA is. It was also during this time that
Microsoft's new licensing initiative, called Software Assurance,
was causing quite a stir in the tech headlines. As my research
opened my eyes to the various limitations to proprietary software,
I began to think that the answer for us might be found in
open-source software.</p><p>The decision to switch to an open-source platform for our new
computer lab was not an easy one. My experience was with DOS and
various versions of Windows and not with UNIX-compatible operating
systems. I had experimented with Linux a few years earlier but
found it somewhat difficult and incomplete. Because some time had
passed, I decided to give Linux another try. Going with Mandrake's
8.0 distribution, I installed Linux at home to see if it could
replace Windows in a desktop environment. To my amazement, I found
Linux to be much more capable this time around. I was one step
closer to making my decision to switch our computer lab to the
Linux OS.</p><p>Other factors went into the final decision to go with
open-source software, not the least of which was cost. By
purchasing bare-bones computer &ldquo;kits&rdquo;, we were able to save
considerable money on the hardware. Part of the savings in
purchasing a bare-bones system is that the computer does not come
with an operating system. We knew by then we would have to spend
more money on software than we did on hardware if we went with
Microsoft. Not only would I need to consider the initial purchase
of the operating system and application software, but I would also
need to factor in the costs of upgrading our software every couple
of years. Needless to say, going with an open-source platform would
save us considerable money now and in the future.</p><p>Another key issue was flexibility. As many of you know, it
takes time to install an operating system, customize it for the
particular hardware it runs on and install the desired
applications. Having purchased 20 new, identical computers, it made
sense to completely configure one machine and then clone the hard
drive to the other 19 computers. However, Microsoft's EULA prevents
a user from doing this, even if they have 20 copies of Windows. Not
only would Linux save me considerable time by allowing me to clone
my configured PC, it also gave me great flexibility in the degree
to which I could customize the OS for the hardware. By recompiling
the kernel to take advantage of our specific hardware, I could
fine-tune the OS to run at peak performance. Linux would even save
us money in the cloning process, thanks to the dd command.</p><p>A few aspects, however, made the decision to switch to Linux
a difficult one. The smaller software base to choose from and the
lack of mature drivers for our hardware were among the lesser
obstacles. The major obstacle was my own lack of experience with
the Linux OS. In fact, most of the money and time spent in the
software upgrade of our computer lab was for a shelf full of books
I had to purchase and read to really feel confident using and
teaching Linux. It isn't always easy to teach an old dog new
tricks, but I found the experience one of the most challenging and
rewarding experiences of my IT career.</p><p>Today our private school of over 170 students has one of the
finest computer labs in Maine. We have 20 computers with Athlon
1600+ XP processors, 128MB of RAM, 20GB hard drives and all the
accessories&mdash;3-D graphics, sound, 17" monitors and 100Mbps Ethernet
networking. Our computers run Mandrake Linux 8.2 with KDE 3.0.2.
What is most amazing is we upgraded our computer lab for under half
the cost of what many neighboring schools paid for inferior
equipment. Most of this savings was the result of switching to
Linux.</p><p>Our servers also run Linux. Using NFS, students can access
their accounts from any computer in the lab. Student- and
staff-owned files are backed up on a daily basis, so gone are the
days of &ldquo;the computer lost my homework.&rdquo; Our proxy server runs
Squid to help speed our wireless internet connection to 20
workstations, and we use proxy software along with iptables to
provide firewall protection. A nice program called Dansguardian
provides filtering to protect our children from pornography and
other inappropriate content.</p><p>Many of you may be asking at this point, &ldquo;How do you use
Linux in teaching your students?&rdquo; GHCA is a K-12 school, and so we
strive to offer some level of computer training for each grade.
Kindergarten students, for example, can use such programs as Potato
Guy to practice hand-eye coordination and familiarize themselves
with how to use a mouse to manipulate objects on the computer
screen. Elementary and secondary teachers integrate the computer
lab into their curriculum by using the computer for research,
multimedia enhancements or even something simple as coloring
digital pictures.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6349f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div><p>Starting with grade seven, education in computer science
takes a more formal approach. Seventh graders are taught
keyboarding skills using programs such as KTouch and TuxTyping.
Grade-eight students are taught the basics of programming with the
kate editor and yabasic interpreter. It is during this class that
students gain a better understanding of how computers process
instructions.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6349f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Students learn touch typing with KTouch.
</p></div></div><p>Computer Fundamentals is a one-credit course that introduces
the ninth-grade student to &ldquo;how a computer works&rdquo; and &ldquo;how to
work a computer&rdquo;. During the second semester, students learn about
the purpose and use of the operating system and various
applications, such as word processors, spreadsheets and web
browsers. Because our computers run Linux, it is the Linux OS and
open-source software that students learn in this class. Being
sensitive to the fact that Microsoft currently dominates the PC
market in corporate America, I do spend time discussing the
similarities and differences between Linux and Windows.</p><p>Tenth- through twelfth-grade students can chose from a
variety of computer electives, including how to upgrade and repair
computers, web site design, advanced programming and even an
upcoming course in robotics. In making the switch to Linux, I
easily found all the tools needed to teach these courses using
open-source software. In many cases, the open-source software we
now use is superior to the proprietary software originally donated
to us.</p><p>This is our first year with our new computer lab, and I am
very pleased with how it is progressing. One of the most pleasing
experiences I am having as a system administrator of a Linux-based
lab is the actual ease of administration. Once I set something up
in Linux, I rarely need to worry about it again. This was not the
case with Windows. Last year we were constantly suffering from
system crashes, frozen servers, strange bugs and the infamous
&ldquo;blue screen of death&rdquo;. Needless to say, it was a frustrating
situation for many students. While Linux is not bug-free, it has
been a far more stable operating system for both our workstations
and servers. Linux also has shown itself to be a much more
versatile operating system to administer in a network environment.
My job is more pleasurable thanks to our switch to Linux.</p><p>As a teacher of computer science, I am finding this year a
fascinating test for Linux. Very few of our students, parents or
teachers knew what Linux was before this year. I have actually
found this to be a great advantage in teaching computers. In the
past, I have found students to be disinterested in learning about
the personal computer running Windows, because it is something most
of them grew up with at home. This lack of interest made it more
difficult to teach the more-advanced aspects of the operating
system. However, Linux is something completely new, different and
unexplored. Instead of being intimidated by the change, as many
adults might be, young people are excited to explore the
&ldquo;uncharted territory&rdquo;. This opens a door for me as a teacher,
allowing me to educate eager minds in the more-advanced aspects of
computer operating systems and software. In fact, it only took two
weeks until students began to ask me, &ldquo;Where can I get
Linux?&rdquo;</p><p>People sometimes ask me, &ldquo;Is teaching our students Linux
preparing them for the workplace?&rdquo; This question is based on the
fact that Microsoft is the current dominating presence in operating
systems and office software. It is a question I have thought over a
long time, and the answer I always come up with is, &ldquo;Yes, most
definitely.&rdquo; The basic principles of any type of operating system,
office application or other similarly grouped software are the
same. A student who becomes proficient in Linux will not find
themselves lost in a Windows environment. I have found Linux to be
the more advanced of the two operating systems, yet our students
are very quickly and easily learning it. The process of copying a
file or formatting a paragraph is not so different between one
operating system and the other. The important thing is we are able
to offer the latest in hardware and software tools to train our
students in these fundamental principles&mdash;something we could not do
if we went with proprietary software.</p><p>Another question that may be even more important to ask is,
&ldquo;What is the future of Linux?&rdquo; When our students graduate a few
years from now, will they enter a Microsoft-dominated workplace or
will the tide have changed? Even in our small New England town of
Houlton, Maine, businesses are beginning to look to Linux as an
alternative to proprietary operating systems. These businesses will
need qualified personnel familiar with the Linux operating system
and open-source applications. Greater Houlton Christian Academy
will be graduating young men and women who will be able to meet
that need, a claim not many schools in our nation can currently
make. In fact, some of our students may go on to write the future
applications for Linux, giving back to the community that helped
them during their school years.</p><p>For us, switching to open-source software running on the
Linux operating system has been the right choice, allowing us to
provide our students with modern equipment and software for a
fraction of the cost of a computer lab running proprietary
software. If Linux continues to grow in popularity and gain a
foothold in the workplace, we will look back at our choice as one
of the most important decisions we've ever made.</p></div></div>
