    Better to pick the platform after you write the application.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbce580.0xcc63f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>The days of developing applications for a
single platform are history. Why? Because every platform offers at
least one key benefit that cannot be attained on any other;
Windows, Linux/UNIX, Mac OS X, embedded Linux and others each offer
unique advantages. But given changing market conditions, it's
impossible to predict which platform will give you the competitive
edge you need.
</p><p>Our anwser is: why pick? We feel that developers can and
should leverage all the best qualities of each platform by
embracing multiplatform development. This is true not only on the
desktop, but also on the server, the network, mobile devices and
every other tool that connects us. Our increasingly mobile working
style demands portable data and portable applications to match
today's distributed networks and global organizations.</p><p>Organizations that want to compete and survive must recognize
a fragmented OS environment as a given, and they must respond by
developing applications that run quickly, cleanly and natively on
the greatest number of platforms possible. Applications written in
this way take advantage of the best features each platform has to
offer, without having to be written and rewritten for every
instance. This process limits your company and represents a
colossal waste of time. Forward-looking companies already recognize
that single-platform development is destined to fail, and they have
embraced a better way. Here's why we think this report on the death
of single-platform development is not exaggerated.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbce580.0xcc65b0"></a>Single-Platform Development Is Expensive</h2></div></div><p>If you wish to develop for more than one platform, thus
expanding your target market, your costs rise dramatically. You
need a full team to develop for each platform. Perhaps more
importantly, you need a full team to maintain and support each
platform. This represents a linear increase in cost for each
platform&mdash;an extremely inefficient way to do business.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbce580.0xcc66b8"></a>Single-Platform Development Closes Doors</h2></div></div><p>Developing applications for one platform increases your risk
because you have to choose among markets before their potential is
clear. Who's to say you'll be right? Software companies have been
made or broken by this choice. In the recent past, people said
Windows (with its momentum and market dominance) was the obvious
choice&mdash;but wait! Linux has proven itself as a serious competitor
in the server space and is picking up serious momentum on the
desktop and in the embedded space. World-class consumer and
enterprise companies are embracing its power, flexibility, security
and low cost. So, what used to be an obvious platform decision
isn't so obvious anymore. Do you know when (or where) this kind of
rapid transformation will happen again? I don't.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbce580.0xcc67c0"></a>Single-Platform Development Does Not Encourage
Mobile Deployment</h2></div></div><p>Perhaps most importantly, if you limit development to a
single desktop or server platform, you immediately restrict your
access to the fastest-growing software market in the world: mobile
systems. If, for example, you write an application for Microsoft
Windows NT/2000, you automatically eliminate any cost-effective way
to run your application on a mobile device, because you have to
rewrite the source. Given that it's nearly essential to make
applications mobile, developing applications on a single
desktop/server platform can be a death sentence for that
application even before it's finished.</p><p>The software industry has struggled for some time to develop
commercially viable strategies for multiplatform development, and
its history is littered with companies that have tried to do this,
and failed. Why?</p><p>One difficulty has been a lack of complete functionality.
Many toolkits deliver only subsets of functionality on multiple
platforms, not the whole set. Another problem has been reliance on
emulation or virtual machines. Both of these impose a significant
and usually unacceptable performance penalty, especially for mobile
devices that need high performance the most.</p><p>It's a well-recognized fact that differences between virtual
machines lead to implementation workarounds and tweaks, as well as
increased maintenance. This is another expense, and it makes the
developers who have to do this work miserable.</p><p>Today, though, proven ways exist to write an application
once, compile and run it anywhere. Companies who do multiplatform
development create an environment in which development innovation
will once again be the order of the day&mdash;not the exception.</p></div></div>

      multiplatform software development. The company's products
      encourage innovation by letting developers write single-source
