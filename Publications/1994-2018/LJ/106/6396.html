    As the USB input subsystem spreads further with each kernel
    release, it's time to understand what it's doing for your
    devices.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dfa580.0x1ef26b8"></a></h2></div></div><p>The Linux USB input subsystem is a
single, harmonized way to manage all input devices. This is a
relatively new approach for Linux, with the system being partly
incorporated in kernel version 2.4 and fully integrated in the 2.5
development series.
</p><p>This article covers four basic areas: a description of what
the input subsystem does, a short historical perspective on
development, a description of how the input subsystem is
implemented in the kernel and an overview of the user-space API for
the input subsystem and how you can use it in your programs. The
first three areas are discussed in this article. The user-space
API, the final topic, will be discussed in Part II of this
article.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dfa580.0x1ef2818"></a>What Is the Input Subsystem?</h2></div></div><p>The input subsystem is the part of the Linux kernel that
manages the various input devices (such as keyboards, mice,
joysticks, tablets and a wide range of other devices) that a user
uses to interact with the kernel, command line and graphical user
interface. This subsystem is included in the kernel because these
devices usually are accessed through special hardware interfaces
(such as serial ports, PS/2 ports, Apple Desktop Bus and the
Universal Serial Bus), which are protected and managed by the
kernel. The kernel then exposes the user input in a consistent,
device-independent way to user space through a range of defined
APIs.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dfa580.0x1ef2920"></a>How We Got Here</h2></div></div><p>The Linux input subsystem is primarily the work of Vojtech
Pavlik, who saw the need for a flexible input system from his early
work on joystick support for Linux and his later work on supporting
USB. The first integration for the input subsystem replaced
existing joystick and USB drivers in the 2.3 development kernel
series. This support carried over to version 2.4, and input support
in the 2.4 series is basically limited to joysticks and USB input
devices.</p><p>The 2.5 development kernel series fully integrates the input
subsystem. This tutorial is based on the full integration, which
will be the input API for the 2.6 stable kernel. Although some
differences exist in the user-space APIs between 2.4 and 2.5
kernels at the time of this writing, there is ongoing work to
harmonize them&mdash;mainly by updating the 2.4 kernel.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dfa580.0x1ef2a80"></a>Under the Hood&mdash;Understanding the Kernel
Internals</h2></div></div><p>The three elements of the input subsystem are the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>input core</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>drivers</em></span> and
<span   class="emphasis"><em>event handlers</em></span>. The relationship between them
is shown in Figure 1. Note that while the normal path is from
low-level hardware to drivers, drivers to input core, input core to
handler and handler to user space, there usually is a return path
as well. This return path allows for such things as setting the
LEDs on a keyboard and providing motion commands to force feedback
joysticks. Both directions use the same event definition, with
different <span   class="bold"><b>type</b></span> identifiers.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6396f1.large.jpg"><img src="6396f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. The Relationship between the Elements of the Input
Subsystem
</p></div></div><p>The interaction between various elements is through
<span   class="emphasis"><em>events</em></span>, which are implemented as structures
(see Listing 1). The first field (time) is a simple timestamp,
while the other fields are more interesting. The type field shows
the generic type of event being reported, for example, a key press
or button press, relative motion (like moving a mouse) or absolute
motion (like moving a joystick). The code field tells which of the
various buttons or axes are being manipulated, while the value
field tells you what the state or motion is. For example, if the
type is a key or button, code tells you which key or button it is,
and value tells you if the button has been pressed or released.
Similarly, if type is a relative axis, then code tells you which
axis, and value tells you how much motion you have and the
direction of that motion on that axis. If you move a mouse in a
diagonal direction, while simultaneously moving the scroll wheel,
you will get three relative events per update: one for motion in
the vertical direction (Y-axis), one for motion in the horizontal
direction (X-axis) and one for motion of the wheel.</p><p><a href="6396l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1.
event-dev-struct.txt</a></p><p>Event handlers provide the interface to user space,
converting the standard event format into the format required by a
particular API. Handlers usually take care of the device nodes
(/dev entries) too. The most common handler is the keyboard
handler, which is the &ldquo;standard input&rdquo; that most programmers
(especially C programmers) are familiar with.</p><p>Drivers usually interface with low-level hardware, such as
USB, PCI memory or I/O regions, or serial port I/O regions. They
convert the low-level hardware version of the user input into the
standard event format before sending it to the input core. The
input core uses a standard kernel plugin design, with
input_register_device() used to add each device and
input_unregister_device() used to remove it. The argument to these
calls is the input_dev structure, which is shown in Listing 1.
Although this structure looks quite large, most of the entries are
provided to allow a driver to specify the capabilities of the
device, such as which event types and codes may be sent or received
by the device.</p><p>In addition to managing drivers and handlers, the input core
also exports a useful /proc filesystem interface, which can be used
to see what devices and handlers are currently active. Here is a
typical example from /proc/bus/input/devices showing a USB
mouse:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
I: Bus=0003 Vendor=046d Product=c002 Version=0120
N: Name="Logitech USB-PS/2 Mouse M-BA47"
P: Phys=usb-00:01.2-2.2/input0
H: Handlers=mouse0 event2
B: EV=7
B: KEY=f0000 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
B: REL=103
</pre><p>The I: line is the identity information&mdash;showing bus type 3
(which is USB) and the vendor, product and version information from
the USB descriptors in the mouse. The N: line shows the name, which
in this case is a string provided by the USB descriptors. The P:
line shows the physical device information; here, it's structure
information comprised of the PCI address for the USB controller,
the USB tree and the input interface. The input0 part indicates
this is the first logical input device for the physical device.
Some devices, such as multimedia keyboards, can map part of the
physical device to one logical input device and map another part to
a second logical input device. The H: line shows the handler
drivers associated with this device; we'll discuss this in more
detail later in the article. The various B: lines show the
bitfields that identify the devices' capabilities, in this case
some keys for the buttons and relative axes for the ball and the
scroll wheel.
</p><p><a href="6396l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2. register.c</a></p><p>This /proc interface is a useful way to test some simple
drivers. Let's consider the example of a driver that registers on
init and unregisters on removal, as shown in Listing 2. This does
some preliminary initialization using init_input_dev(). It sets up
the name, physical and identification descriptors, and then sets up
the bit arrays to indicate that the device is capable of providing
one type of event (EV_KEY indicating buttons and keys) with two
possible codes (KEY_A and KEY_B, indicating the key labels). The
initialization routine then registers the device with the input
core. If you add this code to the kernel (using
<b  >modprobe</b>), you can see the new device has been
added to /proc/bus/input/devices, as shown below:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
I: Bus=0019 Vendor=0001 Product=0001 Version=0100
N: Name="Example 1 device"
P: Phys=A/Fake/Path
H: Handlers=kbd event3
B: EV=3
B: KEY=10000 40000000
</pre><p>If we actually want to send events from our device driver to
the input core, we need to call input_event or one of the
convenience wrappers, such as input_report_key or input_report_abs,
provided in &lt;linux/input.h&gt;. An example of code that does
this is shown in Listing 3. This example is basically the same
setup as the previous one, except that we add a timer that calls
ex2_timeout(). This new routine sends four presses of KEY_A and
four presses of KEY_B. Note that 16 key press events are created in
total, because a separate event is created for each press and each
release. These events are passed to the input core and, in turn, to
the keyboard handler, which will cause the pattern &ldquo;aaaabbbb&rdquo; or
&ldquo;AAAABBBB&rdquo;, depending on the Shift key selection, to be
transmitted to the console or command line. The timer is then set
up to run four seconds later, looping infinitely. The four-second
delay is intended to give you enough time to remove the module when
you have seen enough of the pattern. If you reduce the delay, make
sure you have another way of accessing the system, such as an SSH
connection. Also note the call to the input_sync function. This
function is used to inform the event handler (in this case, the
keyboard handler) that the device has transmitted an internally
consistent set of data. The handler may choose to buffer events
until input_sync is called.</p><p><a href="6396l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3. aaaabbbb.c</a></p><p>Let's look at one final example of a driver, this time
showing how relative information is provided, shown in Listing 4.
This example is a driver that emulates a mouse. The initial setup
configures the device to have two relative axes (REL_X and REL_Y)
and one key (BTN_LEFT). As in the previous example, we use a timer
to run <b  >ex3_timeout</b>. This timer then calls
input_report_rel to provide small relative motion (five unit
steps&mdash;the relative movement is the third argument to the function)
consisting of 30 steps right, 30 steps down, 30 steps left and 30
steps up, so the cursor is moved in a square pattern. To provide
the illusion of movement, the timeout is only 20 milliseconds.
Again, note the call to input_sync, which is used to ensure that
input handlers only process events that make up a consistent set.
This specification wasn't strictly necessary in our previous
example. But, it is definitely required to convey information like
relative movement to the input core, because more than one axis may
be required to represent movement. If you were moving diagonally,
you would do something like:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
...
input_report_rel(..., REL_X, ...);
input_report_rel(..., REL_Y, ...);
input_sync(...);
...
</pre><p>which ensures that the mouse will move diagonally and not
across, then up.

basically sat between the hardware and the input core, translating
hardware events, usually interrupts, into input events. To make use
of those input events, we use handlers, which provide a user-space
interface.</p><p>The input subsystem includes most of the handlers you'll
likely need: a keyboard handler to provide a console, a mouse
handler for applications like the X Window System, a joystick
handler for games and also a touchscreen handler. There is also a
general-purpose handler called the event handler, which basically
provides input events to user space. This means you almost never
need to write a handler in the kernel, because you can do the same
thing with the event handler and equivalent code in user space.
This API discussion is covered in the second part of this
article.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dfa580.0x1ef37e8"></a>Acknowledgements</h2></div></div><p>I'd like to thank Greg Kroah-Hartman and Vojtech Pavlik for
