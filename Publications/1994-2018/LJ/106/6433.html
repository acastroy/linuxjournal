    Connect two private LANs securely with a FreeS/WAN tunnel
    that runs on your existing firewall systems.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2137580.0x222f450"></a></h2></div></div><p>Last month I introduced FreeS/WAN,
Linux's implementation of the IPSec tunneling protocol for secure
virtual private networks (VPNs). For my sample configuration, I
used the common scenario of remote access (RA) VPN. RA VPNs, you'll
recall, are used when each remote user is expected to connect to
the home network using separate connections, resulting in a
one-tunnel-per-user setup.
</p><p>But what happens when some or all of your remote users are
connected to the same local area network (LAN)? I mentioned this
type of site-to-site VPN scenario last month, but I didn't explain
how to set up one. Building site-to-site VPNs with FreeS/WAN,
therefore, is our focus this month.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2137580.0x222f5b0"></a>Architecture: Site-to-Site VPNs</h2></div></div><p>Before we dive into FreeS/WAN configurations, let's take a
quick look at architectural considerations. Figure 1 shows a
typical site-to-site VPN network layout.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6433f1.large.jpg"><img src="6433f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Simple Site-to-Site VPN Design
</p></div></div><p>In Figure 1, each site's firewall acts as a tunnel endpoint.
There are several good reasons to use a firewall as a VPN
endpoint:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Convenience: most firewall platforms support IPSec
or some other VPN protocol, eliminating the expense and time
required to configure and administer separate VPN servers.</p></li><li><p>Security: a firewall acting as a VPN endpoint can
regulate traffic entering and leaving VPN tunnels with excellent
granularity and accuracy.</p></li><li><p>Simplicity: if your firewall and IPSec software
were designed to run together on the same host, it can be much
easier to get your tunnels working and to troubleshoot them when
they don't.</p></li></ol></div><p>However, there are several reasons why this type of setup may
not be feasible or desirable:
<div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Non-interoperability: if you aren't in control of
both sides of the VPN tunnel (e.g., if you're connecting to a
vendor's or partner's network), the remote firewall's VPN
implementation may not be compatible with your firewall's.</p></li><li><p>Performance: if your firewall is already fully or
over-subscribed doing its normal duties, it may not be able to
support the added overhead of VPN authentication and
encryption.</p></li></ol></div>

If, for these or other reasons, you can't use your firewall as a
VPN endpoint, you may prefer to use an architecture such as the one
in Figure 2.
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6433f2.large.jpg"><img src="6433f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Alternative Site-to-Site VPN Design
</p></div></div>

</p><p>In Figure 2, each VPN endpoint is a dedicated computer (in
Figure 2 <span   class="emphasis"><em>both</em></span> endpoints are set up this way,
but you can also mix and match, say, a combined firewall/VPN
endpoint on one end and a split on the other). It may seem reckless
to put any device in parallel with your firewall. Couldn't such a
device be used as a back door?</p><p>Indeed, it could&mdash;unless the VPN server is carefully
configured to accept <span   class="emphasis"><em>only</em></span> VPN traffic and its
VPN software is carefully configured to accept VPN connections from
only approved endpoints, i.e., using strong authentication
mechanisms.</p><p>Let's jump right into FreeS/WAN and see how to set up a
site-to-site VPN with endpoints secure enough to reside either on
firewalls or on standalone hosts.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2137580.0x22300b0"></a>An Example Scenario</h2></div></div><p>Figure 3 shows a site-to-site VPN scenario that's
functionally equivalent to the one in Figure 1. That is, it also
has the same host at each site serving as a combined Linux firewall
and FreeS/WAN IPSec server. Figure 3, however, offers a bit more
detail. First, you can see that each network is connected to the
Internet via a local router. Second, Figure 3 shows the IP
addresses needed for tunnel definitions (we'll see which IPs get
used where shortly).</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6433f3.large.jpg"><img src="6433f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Our Example Site-to-Site VPN Scenario
</p></div></div><p>In this scenario, we need to set up a VPN tunnel between two
sites' firewalls' respective &ldquo;external&rdquo; interfaces. When a user
on one site's LAN wishes to communicate with a host on the other
LAN, the firewall sends those packets through the tunnel. Reply
packets take the same path back through the tunnel. Hosts on either
side may initiate connections through the tunnel.</p><p>The firewalls restrict what sort of data may enter and leave
the tunnel at either side. On a combined iptables/FreeS/WAN server,
these firewall rules can be the same, as though no tunnel were
being used, even if network address translation (NAT) is involved.
This point is explained later in this article.</p><p>A few important premises about this scenario should be noted.
First, both firewalls are running Linux kernel version 2.4.18.
Second, both firewalls' kernels have been patched with FreeS/WAN
version 1.97 and had the user-space FreeS/WAN tools (same version)
installed as well. Third, the two networks can reach each other
<span   class="emphasis"><em>without</em></span> IPSec, i.e., in the clear. (We don't
<span   class="emphasis"><em>want</em></span> them to communicate that way, but we need
to know they <span   class="emphasis"><em>could</em></span>; otherwise troubleshooting
VPN problems are much harder.)</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2137580.0x2230580"></a>Exchanging Host Keys</h2></div></div><p>Another ground rule for this scenario is using RSA
authentication rather than a &ldquo;shared secret&rdquo;. While I don't want
to completely re-explain last month's material on host key
generation and maintenance, it's important to review the most
important points.</p><p>You hopefully recall that each host running FreeS/WAN should
have a unique host key; you should <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> use the
default key provided by the FreeS/WAN binary package you installed.
Once you've generated a new key on a given host, however, you'll be
able to use that key for as many different tunnels as that host
needs. The key remains useful for as long as the secret portion of
the host key (stored in /etc/ipsec.secrets) is kept hidden or until
advances in cryptanalysis render your host key too short.
(Actually, the chances of this occurring before FreeS/WAN itself
becomes obsolete for some reason are pretty slim.)</p><p>To generate a new host key using FreeS/WAN 1.92 or higher,
enter this command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# ipsec newhostkey --hostname my.host.fqdn \
--output /etc/ipsec.secrets --bits 2192
</pre><p>This generates a 2192-bit RSA key, saving both its public and
private components in /etc/ipsec.secrets. I didn't point out last
month that because these commands deal with RSA keys, longer key
lengths are required than for, say, a block cipher such as 3DES.
</p><p>Do <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> be tempted, therefore, to use a
value of 128, 196 or some other three-figure number for newhostkey
--bits. Public key mechanisms such as RSA and DSA work differently,
and their keys must be roughly ten times longer than block- and
stream-ciphers' keys. 1,096 bits is the smallest RSA key size you
should even consider; 2,192 is much safer.</p><p>To display your new public key in a format that can be
directly copied and pasted into tunnel definitions, use this
command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
bash-# ipsec showhostkey --left
</pre><p>You can use the option --right instead if you want to print a
rightrsasigkey statement instead of a leftrsakey statement.
</p><p>Remember, the output of this command may be shared safely. It
contains only the public component of your host's signing key. You
may e-mail it without encryption, post it on a web site or set it
to music and sing about it at your favorite coffee shop. This is
why RSA authentication is more convenient than shared-secret
authentication, in which you <span   class="emphasis"><em>must</em></span> securely and
covertly send the authentication credentials (shared-secret string)
to another site any time you wish to build an IPSec tunnel. RSA
authentication allows you to be sloppy (except with
/etc/ipsec.secrets, which must be kept root-readable-only at all
times); shared-secret authentication does not.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2137580.0x2230aa8"></a>Setting Up ipsec.conf</h2></div></div><p>FreeS/WAN's main configuration file, other than
/etc/ipsec.secrets, is /etc/ipsec.conf. In the interest of
simplifying things, FreeS/WAN was designed in such a way that
tunnel definitions usually look the same on both endpoints of a
FreeS/WAN tunnel. Most of the example lines that follow, therefore,
are the same on both firewalls in our example scenario.</p><p>Last month I focused mainly on tunnel definitions. We'll get
to them here, too. But first, let's delve a little deeper into the
config setup and conn %default sections. Listing 1 shows a config
setup for one of our firewalls (it doesn't matter which
one).</p><p><a href="6433l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1. Basic Setup in
/etc/ipsec.conf</a></p><p>The first parameter in Listing 1, interfaces, is crucial. It
defines the interface on which the host will listen for IPSec
connections from other IPSec servers. This is not to be confused
with the interface on which the host listens for packets
<span   class="emphasis"><em>sent through</em></span> the tunnel. If you think of the
Internet (or other untrusted network) as the outside and the local
LAN as the inside, always make sure that the interfaces' parameter
is set to your outside interface.</p><p>The two debug options, klipsdebug and plutodebug, determine
how much logging is done by FreeS/WAN's kernel-interface
d&aelig;mon (KLIPS) and IKE keying d&aelig;mon (Pluto),
respectively. Both of these parameters accept the self-explanatory
magic values all and none, plus a variety of specific IPSec
attributes/events that can be logged. See the ipsec_klipsdebug(8)
and ipse_pluto(8) man pages for complete lists of these.</p><p>The parameter plutoload specifies which tunnel definitions to
initialize when FreeS/WAN starts up. The magic value %search tells
Pluto to check each subsequent tunnel definition's auto parameter
to determine this (i.e., each tunnel for which auto is set to
add).</p><p>Similarly, the value plutostart tells Pluto which tunnels to
try to connect to automatically when FreeS/WAN starts. In other
words, whereas plutoload merely tells Pluto to allow other hosts to
bring up specified tunnels, plutostart tells Pluto itself to bring
up specified tunnels, without waiting for their other endpoints.
Again, the %search value may be specified. In this case, it will
match tunnel definitions in which auto is set to start.</p><p><a href="6433l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2. Tunnel Defaults in
/etc/ipsec.conf</a></p><p>Listing 2 shows the subsequent conn %default section in an
ipsec.conf file. The first parameter in Listing 2, keyingtries, is
set to zero, which actually translates to no limit. This means when
Pluto tries to bring up or replace a tunnel, it tries to key it as
many times as necessary. This is a reasonable setting for a
site-to-site VPN in which both hosts have persistent network
connections, but it's not for a remote-access VPN in which remote
clients will be on-line only sporadically.</p><p>disablearrivalcheck, if set to no, causes KLIPS to make sure
that each packet entering the host from an IPSec tunnel has
plausible source- and destination-IP addresses in its header. The
default value is yes, which prevents these checks, but you should
set it to no unless you really know what you're doing.</p><p>Finally, authby lets you choose the default authentication
method for tunnels, which, as I said earlier, will be via RSA
(rsasig) for our example scenario. And now we arrive at our actual
tunnel definition&mdash;it's displayed in Listing 3.</p><p><a href="6433l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3. Tunnel Definition in
/etc/ipsec.conf</a></p><p>Because this is a site-to-site scenario, FreeS/WAN's
convention of server = left, remote-access clients = right isn't
meaningful. So it's completely arbitrary which side is designated
right or left. The important thing is to be consistent across the
tunnel definitions in <span   class="emphasis"><em>both</em></span> hosts' setups.
Here, the site to the left of the Internet (Figure 3) is left, and
the site to the right of the Internet is right. That sounds
obvious, but if I were to decide to make right left and vice versa,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>the tunnel would behave the same</em></span> (provided I
used the same configuration on both sides).</p><p>As you can see, in Listing 3, left is set to the external
(Internet-reachable, tunnel-listening) interface's IP address.
leftsubnet, however, is set to the address of the network that
receives incoming packets (i.e., leaving the tunnel).</p><p>leftnexthop is the IP address of the next hop between the
firewall/IPSec host and the Internet. And leftrsasigkey obviously
is the host key of left. This line (and the comment above it) can
be obtained verbatim by running the command <b  >ipsec
showhostkey --left</b>.</p><p>The right parameters are the same, but for the right side. I
leave it to you to use your powers of deduction to figure out to
which hosts in Figure 3 these parameters correspond.</p><p>Finally, we have the tunnel's auto parameter, which is set to
start. When the Pluto d&aelig;mon executes its search for
instructions on what to do with tunnel definitions at startup (as
described in the section following Listing 1), this setting tells
it to initiate the tunnel defined above.</p><p>As I've been hinting, in this example scenario, the
/etc/ipsec.conf files for both firewalls and gateways are
identical. Once they're set up, we can start IPSec on each host and
start tunneling. The command to do this on most distributions
is:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
bash-# /etc/init.d/ipsec start
</pre><p>If IPSec is already running, use:
<pre     class="programlisting">
bash-# /etc/init.d/ipsec restart
</pre>


Once IPSec has been (re)started on both hosts, the tunnel will come
up, and each gateway will begin routing traffic addressed to the
other network through the tunnel. This routing is done
automatically, based on the leftsubnet and rightsubnet parameters
defined in your tunnel definition in /etc/ipsec.conf.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2137580.0x2629748"></a>Firewalls and NAT</h2></div></div><p>Naturally, you'll want to restrict what sorts of things hosts
from the other network may do on your network and vice versa. I
stated earlier that firewall rules on a Linux host running
FreeS/WAN aren't necessarily any different from when they are
without tunneling. This even holds true with NAT. When writing your
firewall rules on each gateway, set up FORWARD, POSTROUTING and
PREROUTING rules the same as if you weren't using IPSec&mdash;just be
careful about interfaces. If you use -i and -o parameters, don't
say &ldquo;eth0&rdquo; if you mean &ldquo;ipsec0&rdquo; (or &ldquo;ipsec+&rdquo; if you mean
&ldquo;all tunnel interfaces&rdquo;). When in doubt, try to stick to IP
addresses rather than interface names in your firewall
rules.</p><p>In addition, make sure that no NAT is performed on tunneled
packets. IPSec packets' headers are checksummed in the body of each
packet's data field. Rewriting the IP header (e.g., by translating
source or destination IPs) violates this message-digest, and
weirdness will ensue. You can do NAT on packets as they leave the
tunnel or before they enter it, but not while they're in the
process.</p><p>Whatever else you do, you will need at least three new rules
on each gateway to allow IPSec key negotiation and tunneling. In
the INPUT and OUTPUT chains, you'll need to permit packets sent to
UDP port 500, IP protocol 50 packets and IP protocol 51 packets.
The relevant rules on both gateways would look like what is shown
in Listing 4.</p><p><a href="6433l4.html" target="_self">Listing 4. iptables Rules to Allow
