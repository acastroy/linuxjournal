    Setting up an SMTP mail server for multiple domains on a
    single machine with remote access via IMAP.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e8d580.0x1f85920"></a></h2></div></div><p>Although this article provides
instructions on setting up an integrated mail server using Postfix,
OpenLDAP and Courier-IMAP, it does not discuss how these software
components were chosen, which could be a whole article in and of
itself. The goal is to set up an SMTP mail server for multiple
domains on a single machine with remote access via IMAP. Also,
instead of having mail delivered only to people with shell
accounts, we want to have IMAP accounts that do not have a
corresponding shell account. This gives rise to two classes of
accounts: local and virtual. Local accounts are those with shell
access. They use their shell user name and password to access IMAP.
Virtual accounts have a user name and password that only works for
logging in to IMAP. The terms local and virtual are used throughout
the rest of the article.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e8d580.0x1f85a28"></a>The Big Picture</h2></div></div><p>Figure 1 shows how Postfix, Courier, Procmail and OpenLDAP
interact. Local account information is stored in /etc/password, and
authentication is handled by pluggable authentication modules
(PAM). Virtual account information is stored in an LDAP directory.
LDAP provides both account lookup and authentication capabilities.
It is possible to avoid an LDAP directory, but it will be more
difficult to administer the virtual account information. For
example, Postfix and Courier both support virtual accounts using
configuration files, but they have different file formats.</p><p>Postfix accepts incoming mail from SMTP. It will reject any
mail for unknown accounts, both local and virtual. It delivers the
mail itself for virtual accounts and uses Procmail as the MDA for
local accounts. Courier provides remote access to the mailboxes via
the IMAP and POP protocols.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="5917f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Overall Design
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e8d580.0x1f85d40"></a>Mailbox Location</h2></div></div><p>A local account's mail is stored in its home directory at
${HOME}/Maildir/ in the Maildir format. It is standard practice for
Maildir delivery to go into the account's home directory rather
than /var/spool/mail. Both Postfix and Courier work out of the box
with this standard behavior.</p><p>Unlike local accounts, there is no standard location for
virtual accounts' e-mail. We created a single UNIX account, called
vmail, that holds the mail for all the virtual accounts. Each
virtual domain has a subdirectory within the ~vmail/domains/
directory. For example, if there is an account
&lt;john@example.com&gt;, mail would be stored in
~vmail/domains/example.com/john/ in maildir format. You can also
spread virtual accounts across multiple UNIX accounts, for example,
by creating a UNIX account for each virtual domain.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e8d580.0x1f85ea0"></a>LDAP Directory Design</h2></div></div><p>There are many possibilities when designing your directory,
and not all aspects of this topic are covered here. One useful
reference is the iPlanet Deployment Guide (see Resources). This
article assumes you are familiar with LDAP concepts and
terminology. You should take the time up front to design a tree
that matches your specific requirements.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e8d580.0x1f85fa8"></a>Tree Structure</h2></div></div><p>Figure 2 shows a sample directory tree for a web hosting
company. The company's domain name, myhosting.example, was chosen
as the root suffix. Postfix and Courier both search the
o=hosting,dc=myhosting,dc=example subtree for e-mail information.
The o=accounts,dc=myhosting,dc=example subtree shows how you could
integrate shell account information for PAM into the same
directory, but this is not necessary for setting up e-mail. Each
hosted domain gets its own organization beneath the hosting
organization. Each e-mail account goes under the domain's subtree.
Thus, the distinguished name for the &lt;user2@domain2.example&gt;
e-mail address is:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
mail=&lt;user2@domain2.example&gt;,o=domain2.example,
 o=hosting,dc=myhosting,dc=example
</pre><p>This is a fairly stable design as accounts will never
transfer between domains. The end result is good LDAP design,
because moving subtrees can be troublesome in LDAP. The design is
also quite flexible because each domain's tree can be tailored, if
necessary. Each domain must have a postmaster entry that provides
dual functionality. Its primary function is for access control, but
it also acts as a forwarding e-mail address. Each domain also must
have an abuse alias that forwards mail to the system administrator.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e8d580.0x1f86318"></a>Choosing a Schema</h2></div></div><p>The schema defines which attributes an entry can have by
defining object classes. None of the default schemas that come with
OpenLDAP are really suited for entries used exclusively for e-mail
mailboxes or forwarding. We are using the schema that Courier
provides in its distribution. Another possible schema to look at is
the schema distributed with the qmail-LDAP Project. You also can
design your own schema, but be aware that you should use OIDs
registered with the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority
(IANA).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e8d580.0x1f86420"></a>Courier Schema</h2></div></div><p>The courierMailAccount object class, summarized in Table 1,
is used for virtual e-mail accounts. The courierMailAlias object
class, summarized in Table 2, is used for e-mail addresses that
forward to another address.</p><p><a href="5917t1.html" target="_self">Table 1.
courierMailAccount</a></p><p><a href="5917t2.html" target="_self">Table 2.
courierMailAlias</a></p><p>The courierMailAccount object class does not exactly fit our
needs. We do not need uidNumber and gidNumber because all mail goes
to the vmail account. However, we must put in dummy values as the
schema requires them. Note that these values would be meaningful if
we were spreading virtual accounts over many UNIX accounts. We
require the mailbox attribute, because it is needed to determine
the location of the mailbox on the filesystem. The mailbox must end
in a slash to indicate that it's a Maildir-style mailbox. The
userPassword attribute also is required because all e-mail accounts
must have a password in order to be accessed via IMAP or POP. We do
not use the other optional attributes.</p><p>The courierMailAlias object class is a good fit for our
needs. We use only the two required attributes and do not use
either of the optional attributes. The maildrop attribute can be
another e-mail address or a local account on this machine.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e8d580.0x1f86738"></a>Access Control</h2></div></div><p>OpenLDAP provides many possibilities for access control. By
default, the root account has read and write access to all entries
in the tree. We would like to delegate some of this administration
to individual accounts in each hosted domain so they can do minor
changes on their own without access to the root account. This is
done by making the postmaster entry an organizationalRole with a
roleOccupant attribute for each entry with administration
privileges. OpenLDAP can then be configured to allow access only to
members of this group.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e8d580.0x1f86840"></a>Implementation</h2></div></div><p>This section describes how to implement a virtual mail
solution. Not every little detail is covered, only what is needed
above and beyond the standard installations.</p><p>Following is the list of software, with version numbers, with
which we tested this configuration:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Red Hat Linux 6.2, 7.1, or 7.2</p></li><li><p>Postfix 1.1.x</p></li><li><p>OpenLDAP 2.0.21</p></li><li><p>Courier-IMAP 1.4.1</p></li><li><p>Procmail 3.22</p></li></ul></div><p>You need to create the vmail account, and then create the
~/vmail/domains/ directory. You also need to create an account and
two groups for Postfix as covered in Postfix's INSTALL
documentation.</p><p>You do not need to follow any special instructions for
compiling and installing OpenLDAP, so consult its documentation for
instructions. For a production environment, read up on running
OpenLDAP as a non-root account, setting up a chroot environment and
replication. This article describes how to configure slapd for a
single server, create the base tree structure and insert some basic
data into the LDAP directory. Figure 2 shows the LDAP tree we set
up here.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e8d580.0x1f7d6a8"></a>Configuring slapd</h2></div></div><p>You need to make Courier's schema file available, so copy the
file from authlib/authldap.schema in the Courier distribution to
/usr/local/etc/openldap/schema/courier.schema. Courier's schema
depends on cosine.schema and nis.schema. Add these lines to
slapd.conf:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
include   /usr/local/etc/openldap/schema/cosine.schema
include   /usr/local/etc/openldap/schema/nis.schema
include   /usr/local/etc/openldap/schema/courier.schema
</pre><p>Next, set up a database definition with the following lines
in slapd.conf:
<pre     class="programlisting">
database      ldbm
directory     /usr/local/var/openldap-ldbm
suffix        "dc=myhosting,dc=example"
</pre>


The database directive specifies the back-end type to use (use LDBM
as the back-end database). The directory directive specifies the
path to the LDBM database. Make sure the directory specified exists
prior to starting slapd and that slapd has read and write
permissions on the directory. The suffix directive specifies the
root suffix for this database. The next few lines set up the
superuser or root account:
<pre     class="programlisting">
rootdn       "cn=Manager,dc=myhosting,dc=example"
rootpw       {SSHA}ra0sD47QP32ASAlaAhF8kgi+8Aflbgr7
</pre>


The rootdn entry has complete access to the database, which is why
the password is stored outside the actual database. The password in
rootpw should always be stored in hashed format. Do not store the
password in clear text. To convert the clear text password secret
to a hashed format, use the slappasswd command:
<pre     class="programlisting">
% slappasswd
New password: secret
Re-enter new password: secret
{SSHA}ra0sD47QP32ASAlaAhF8kgi+8Aflbgr7
</pre>


Take the output from slappasswd, and copy that into slapd.conf, as
we did above.
</p><p>To speed up searches, you should create indexes for commonly
searched attributes:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
index   objectClass  pres,eq
index   mail,cn      eq,sub
</pre><p>The last part in slapd.conf is the access control. The
OpenLDAP FAQ contains good information on how you would set up
postmaster as a group ACL.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e8d580.0x1f7da70"></a>Creating the Directory Tree</h2></div></div><p>Now that slapd is configured, it's time to start adding data
to the LDAP directory. We use the command-line tools that come with
OpenLDAP and create LDIF files to modify the directory.</p><p>The first step is to create a base tree structure with our
root node, the hosting organization and an entry for the rootdn.
Create a file called base.ldif with the following contents:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
dn: dc=myhosting, dc=example
 objectClass: top
 dn: cn=Manager, dc=myhosting, dc=example
 objectClass: top
 objectClass: organizationalRole
 cn: Manager
 dn: o=hosting, dc=myhosting, dc=example
 objectClass: top
 objectClass: organization
 o: hosting
</pre><p>Now use ldapadd, binding as the root account, to add this
LDIF:
<pre     class="programlisting">
ldapadd -x -D "cn=Manager,dc=myhosting,dc=example" \
-w secret -f base.ldif
</pre>


</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e8d580.0x1f7dcd8"></a>Adding a Domain</h2></div></div><p>Domains can now be added under the hosting tree. Each domain
needs to have postmaster and abuse entries at minimum. To make a
tree for domain1.example, create a file called domain1.example.ldif
with the following contents:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
dn: o=domain1.example, o=hosting, dc=myhosting,
 dc=example
objectClass: top
objectClass: organization
o: domain1.example
dn: cn=postmaster, o=domain1.example, o=hosting,
 dc=myhosting, dc=example
objectClass: top
objectClass: organizationalRole
objectClass: CourierMailAlias
cn: postmaster
mail:
maildrop: postmaster
dn: mail=abuse@domain1.example, o=domain1.example,
 o=hosting, dc=myhosting, dc=example
objectClass: top
objectClass: CourierMailAlias
mail:
maildrop: abuse
</pre><p>Notice that the maildrop attributes are local e-mail accounts
and will forward to the postmaster and abuse accounts in
/etc/aliases. There are no accounts in the postmaster role, so only
the root account can create accounts at the moment. Add this domain
with the following command:
<pre     class="programlisting">
ldapadd -x -D "cn=Manager,dc=myhosting,dc=example"
\
-w secret  -f domain1.example.ldif
</pre>


</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e8d580.0x1f7dee8"></a>Adding an Account</h2></div></div><p>Now, let's add an account with an e-mail
&lt;user1@domain1.example&gt;. Let's also grant this account
postmaster privileges for domain1.example. Create a
user1.domain1.example.ldif with the following contents:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
dn: mail=user1@domain1.example, o=domain1.example,
 o=hosting, dc=myhosting, dc=example
objectClass: top
objectClass: CourierMailAccount
mail:
homeDirectory: /home/vmail/domains
uidNumber: 101
gidNumber: 101
mailbox: domain1.example/user1
dn: cn=postmaster, o=domain1.example, o=hosting,
dc=myhosting, dc=example
changetype: modify
add: roleOccupant
roleOccupant: mail=user1@domain1.example,
 o=domain1.example, o=hosting,
 dc=myhosting, dc=example
</pre><p>The first section adds a new entry for the account. The home
directory and mailbox point to the physical mailbox on the
filesystem. The uidNumber and gidNumber attributes are required but
not used, so they are filled in with dummy values of 101. The
second section modifies the postmaster entry by adding a
roleOccupant attribute with the DN of user1@domain1.example. Let's
create this account:
<pre     class="programlisting">
ldapadd -x -D "cn=Manager,dc=myhosting,dc=example"
\
-w secret -f user1.domain1.example.ldif
</pre>


The account does not have a password yet, so even though it has
been granted postmaster privileges, it cannot be authenticated. Use
the ldappasswd command to set the initial password to user1:
<pre     class="programlisting">
ldappasswd -x -D "$DN" -w $PW -s user1 \
"mail=user1@domain1.example, o=domain1.example,
o=hosting, dc=myhosting, dc=example"
</pre>


Other domains and accounts can be added with similar LDIF files.
Creating LDIF files by hand can be cumbersome and error-prone. We
discuss alternatives for administration later.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e8d580.0x1f7e150"></a>Postfix</h2></div></div><p>We cover only the sections of Postfix that pertain to the
mail hosting. To deal with other parts of Postfix setup, please
visit the Postfix web page.</p><p>Download the Postfix source and untar it. You need to rebuild
the Postfix Makefiles to be aware of LDAP and link against it. To
do this, execute the following command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
make makefiles CCARGS="-I/usr/local/include
-DHAS_LDAP" AUXLIBS="-L/usr/local/lib -lldap
-L/usr/local/lib -llber"
</pre><p>At this point, follow the normal Postfix compiling and
installing instructions as documented in its INSTALL and
LDAP_README files.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e8d580.0x1f7e360"></a>Configuring Postfix</h2></div></div><p>While configuring Postfix for this task, we are mostly
concerned with /etc/postfix/main.cf. For most of the Postfix
configuration, you will configure in a way that makes the most
sense for your site, and you can follow the documentation contained
in the Postfix source or on the Postfix web site. Here, we talk
about the settings that are affected by this setup. If any of the
configuration examples shown below aren't explicitly attributed to
a specific file, assume they can be found in main.cf.</p><p>The transport table maps domains to message delivery
transports (as specified in /etc/postfix/master.cf) and/or relay
hosts. For our virtual domains, we want to map them to the virtual
delivery agent that comes with Postfix. A transport table could
look something like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
domain1.example           virtual:
domain2.example           virtual:
</pre><p>After making your transport table in plain text, you need to
make it into a binary DB file using postmap (see <b  >man
postmap</b>). At this point, tell Postfix that there is a
transport table and where to find it. You also need to let Postfix
know that we accept mail for those domains. This is done through
the transport_maps and mydestination directives:
<pre     class="programlisting">
transport_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/transport
mydestination = $myhostname, localhost.$mydomain,
  $mydomain, $transport_maps
</pre>


You can define multiple LDAP sources easily. LDAP source parameters
are documented in README_FILES/LDAP_README in the Postfix source.
The parameter names follow the pattern of
&lt;ldapsource&gt;_parameter. The LDAP source name is defined by
use. In main.cf, you'll need one LDAP source definition per each
lookup.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e8d580.0x1f7e620"></a>Aliases</h2></div></div><p>The first LDAP source definition is for virtual aliases.
We've named this LDAP source aliases. In our configuration, our
LDAP server is running on localhost. The search base is the top of
the hosting subtree we defined in our LDAP server. We're querying
for items where the mail elements match the e-mail recipient as
well as items that are of the courierMailAlias object class. The
destination of the alias is stored in the maildrop attribute.
Postfix won't bind using an account, instead it will do an
anonymous lookup:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
aliases_server_host = localhost
aliases_search_base =
  o=hosting,dc=myhosting,dc=example
aliases_query_filter =
  (&amp;(mail=%s)(objectClass=CourierMailAlias))
aliases_result_attribute = maildrop
aliases_bind = no
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e8d580.0x1f7e780"></a>Accounts</h2></div></div><p>When using the accounts source we're looking for entries that
have an object class of courierMailAccount. We request the mailbox
attribute as the result:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
accounts_server_host = localhost
accounts_search_base =
  o=hosting,dc=myhosting,dc=example
accounts_query_filter =
  (&amp;(mail=%s)(objectClass=CourierMailAccount))
accounts_result_attribute = mailbox
accounts_bind = no
</pre><p>A second source for accounts, accountsmap, also needs to be
defined to help locate accounts when a catchall is used. Without
this lookup, a catchall in the aliases would override virtual
accounts in a domain:
<pre     class="programlisting">
accountsmap_server_host = localhost
accountsmap_search_base = o=hosting,dc=myhosting,dc=example
accountsmap_query_filter =
(&amp;(mail=%s)(objectClass=CourierMailAccount
accountsmap_result_attribute = mail
accountsmap_bind = no
</pre>


Now that the aliases and accountsmap LDAP source are defined, let
Postfix know to use it by defining the virtual_maps parameter in
main.cf:
<pre     class="programlisting">
virtual_maps = ldap:aliases
</pre>


For this example, assume there is a vmail UNIX account created that
has a UID of 125, a GID of 120 and its home directory is
/home/vmail:
<pre     class="programlisting">
:virtual_mailbox_base = /home/vmail/domains
virtual_mailbox_maps = ldap:accounts
virtual_minimum_uid = 125
virtual_uid_maps = static:125
virtual_gid_maps = static:120
</pre>


Set the virtual_uid_maps and virtual_gid_maps to a special static
map and hard code it to the UID and GID of the vmail account. All
of the parameters shown here are fully documented in
README_FILES/VIRTUAL_README, which comes with the Postfix source.
</p><p>We also need to edit the local_recipient_maps parameter to
look at the virtual_mailbox_maps so Postfix knows what accounts are
valid. This is needed so Postfix can reject mail for unknown
accounts:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
local_recipient_maps = $alias_maps
  unix:passwd.byname $virtual_mailbox_maps
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e8d580.0x1f7eaf0"></a>Courier</h2></div></div><p>There aren't any special instructions for installing Courier,
so see its documentation for full instructions. It should
autodetect LDAP and build it in. You should seriously consider
passing the --enable-workarounds-for-imap-client-bugs option to
./configure, otherwise Netscape mail users may have trouble
interacting with your server. This bends the IMAP protocol a little
bit, but it's better to have happy users than a perfect protocol
with unhappy users.</p><p>Courier uses an authentication d&aelig;mon to keep
authentication separate from the other parts of the system.
Configure it so that a valid e-mail account is either found in
either LDAP or PAM. Specify this in authdaemonrc using the
authmodulelist parameter:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
authmodulelist="authldap authpam"
</pre><p>All LDAP parameters are in authldaprc. Most parameters are
self-explanatory. To use the Courier schema, you actually have a
few modifications to make, though. You also need to map all virtual
accounts to the vmail account. Here is a summary of the updates you
need to make to authldaprc:
<pre     class="programlisting">
LDAP_GLOB_UID           vmail
LDAP_GLOB_GID           vmail
LDAP_HOMEDIR            homeDirectory
LDAP_MAILDIR            mailbox
LDAP_CRYPTPW            userPassword
</pre>


Three other settings to be concerned with are LDAP_AUTHBIND,
LDAP_BINDDN and LDAP_BINDPW. These relate to authenticating the
user. LDAP_AUTHBIND is mutually exclusive with LDAP_BINDDN and
LDAP_BINDPW. We recommend using LDAP_AUTHBIND. A comment in
authldaprc mentions a memory leak in OpenLDAP when using
LDAP_AUTHBIND, but it has been fixed in OpenLDAP version 2.0.19.
</p><p>If you use LDAP_BINDDN and LDAP_BINDPW, you are limited to
the crypt, MD5 and SHA algorithms for passwords. SMD5 and SSHA are
not available. Also, you must put the root LDAP password in clear
text in authldaprc when defining LDAP_BINDPW. There are security
issues with putting the root LDAP password in clear text, so
definitely use LDAP_AUTHBIND if you can.</p><p>The last change is to enable the IMAP server by setting the
IMAPDSTART parameter to YES. You should now be able to use the
courier-imap.sysvinit startup script to start and stop the IMAP

and deleting accounts and aliases, require modifying the LDAP
directory. You can do this with the OpenLDAP command-line tools or
a generic LDAP browser like gq. These methods are cumbersome,
however, because they are generic tools and are not tailored to the
task of administering e-mail accounts. We've been working on a web
administration application called Jamm that is essentially an
application-specific LDAP browser written in Java and JSP. It also
has its own LDAP schema that is a slightly modified Courier schema.
Jamm is currently usable and is constantly evolving. Visit the Jamm
web page on SourceForge for the latest Jamm information.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e8d580.0x1f7ef10"></a>Account Creation Notes</h2></div></div><p>When you create an account or an alias inside the LDAP
database it will instantly become active as far as the mail system
is concerned. For virtual accounts, note that the UNIX directory in
~vmail is not created at this time. However, we can work around
this because Postfix's virtual delivery agent will create the
necessary directories the first time it has to deliver mail. Due to
this fact, we recommend sending a welcome e-mail as soon as you
create the account.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e8d580.0x1f7f018"></a>Account Deletion Notes</h2></div></div><p>When you delete an account or an alias in the LDAP database,
it will instantly become inactive. For virtual accounts, note that
the UNIX filesystem isn't cleaned up. In other words, the data
remains on disk until a system administrator can remove it. This
allows you to keep the data from dead accounts for a grace period
in case the account was deleted in error. However, if another
account is created with the same name and the same mail path, the
data will be available to the new account. This could be considered
a privacy violation for the previous user.</p><p><a href="5917s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
