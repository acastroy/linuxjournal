    What's new with the kernel and more...
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28ed580.0x29e5190"></a>diff -u: What's New in Kernel
Development</h2></div></div><p>Folks waiting for <span   class="bold"><b>LVM1</b></span> to be
fixed in the kernel can stop waiting. It's been removed, after six
months of sitting in an unmaintained, broken state.
<span   class="bold"><b>Joe Thornber</b></span> posted the actual
patch to take it out. This seems to be part of a general &ldquo;let's
get cleaned up for 2.6&rdquo; push. There was talk on the mailing list
of replacing the code with <span   class="bold"><b>LVM2</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>Device Mapper (DM)</b></span> or even
<span   class="bold"><b>EVMS</b></span>. None of these were
universally hailed as the obvious choice. DM had a lot of missing
features, while EVMS had too many available ones. There was even
some talk of trying to fix LVM1 instead of pulling it out&mdash;or at
least of finding a suitable replacement first. So far, EVMS looks
like the prime candidate for 2.6, but it's still too soon to
say.</p><p>At the Ottawa Kernel Summit it was agreed that
<span   class="bold"><b>driverFS</b></span> would be changing its
name, and patches have begun appearing to do exactly that. The only
problem is no one can agree on what the new name should be.
<span   class="bold"><b>Patrick Mochel</b></span> wants &ldquo;kfs&rdquo;, but
others say that single-letter-plus-fs is getting to be a cluttered
namespace. <span   class="bold"><b>H. Peter Anvin</b></span> has
suggested &ldquo;kernelfs&rdquo; or simply &ldquo;kernfs&rdquo;. About the only thing
that's known so far is the name will change.</p><p>Support has been added for the <span   class="bold"><b>NEC
PC-9800</b></span> architecture, a popular architecture in Japan
that is roughly the equivalent of the Intel-based PC in the West.
Traditionally, it has run ported versions of MS-DOS and Microsoft
Windows, although it has never been fully &ldquo;IBM-compatible&rdquo;. With
40-50% PC market share in Japan, these patches open Linux up to a
huge number of people who previously may not have had access to
it.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Jeff Dike's User-Mode Linux</b></span>
now has SMP support. Up until now, regardless of the number of CPUs
on your system, UML processes were entirely uniprocessor. Among
other things, this meant that testing SMP software (particularly
the kernel itself) under UML was not going to get you much. This
new advance opens the door for speedier testing of various
applications that otherwise would require many lengthy reboots,
possibly accompanied by filesystem corruption.</p><p>The <span   class="bold"><b>ioctl</b></span> interface is now
deprecated. New drivers should create a filesystem-based interface
with <span   class="bold"><b>libfs</b></span>, newly included in the
2.5 tree. I/O control functions have been condemned for years as an
unmaintainable, undocumentable, ever-growing mess, but for a long
time there was no way around it. Now at last, Linux developers can
use an interface that makes sense&mdash;one that won't cause more
trouble than it's worth.</p><p>The kernel went into
<span   class="bold"><b>feature-freeze</b></span> on October 31,
2002. It's much too soon to tell if this will lead to 2.6 in a
reasonable amount of time, or if events will lead back to a period
of rapid development with no end in sight.
<span   class="bold"><b>Linus Torvalds</b></span> and others have
been struggling for a while to bring the kernel rev-time into a
reasonably short time frame, but the time between stable series is
still measured in years. If we see 2.6 before April 2003, it will
be a major achievement in the development of the development
process itself.</p><p>&mdash;Zack Brown</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28ed580.0x29e5978"></a>Think of It as a Hacksess Point</h2></div></div><p>Wi-Fi (802.11 wireless Ethernet) access points have been
around for a while. But most of them allow rather limited
programmability, especially if you want to make a business out of
selling customized ones.</p><p>Chipset maker Intersil
(<a href="http://www.intersil.com" target="_self">www.intersil.com</a>) has
walked into this marketplace and taken care of the opportunity
problem by introducing a new self-hosting access point reference
design called PRISM AP. What makes it so marketable is its
operating system: embedded Linux. PRISM AP comes with a whole Linux
development environment on which you can run a web server, a DHCP
server, DHCP client and SNMP server, among other things.</p><p>Because the OS is Linux, you can customize units for your own
uses or develop whatever product you like&mdash;VPN gateway, bridge,
router, mesh network, whatever&mdash;and burn the code into Flash
memory. Then you can sell it without worrying about licensing
costs.</p><p>In other words, it's hard to imagine anything more equally
hackable and marketable, or in more different ways.</p><p>&mdash;Doc Searls</p><p>PHPRecipeBook:
<a href="http://phprecipebook.sourceforge.net" target="_self">phprecipebook.sourceforge.net</a></p><p>If you need to keep a recipe book, this is the ticket. You
can input ingredients and the preparation process and save it. When
you decide you want to cook something, the program can generate a
list of ingredients in a shopping list and you can print it out.
Now, if you could just ship it off via the Web to a local grocery
store and have the ingredients delivered, you wouldn't even have to
leave the house. Unfortunately, recipes are not included. Requires:
web server with PHP and SQL (PostgreSQL or MySQL) support, SQL
server and a web browser.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6441f1.large.jpg"><img src="6441f1.jpg"></a></div><p>&mdash;David A. Bandel</p><p>Techtables:
<a href="http://techtables.sourceforge.net" target="_self">techtables.sourceforge.net</a></p><p>This particular trouble ticket and asset tracking system is a
little different from some others. It deals fairly exclusively with
trouble tickets and assets, not so much with clients and the the
rest. Depending on your needs, this might fill the bill nicely.
Installation and use is simple. If you need to protect anything,
you'll need to implement htpasswords and/or secure web support
(easily done). Requires: web server with PHP and SQL (PostgreSQL or
MySQL) support, SQL server and a web browser.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6441f2.jpg"></div><p>&mdash;David A.

applications; so is Sun with Solaris. ISVs are going to be asking
themselves, &ldquo;Why should I bother to develop for a specific UNIX if
I can develop for Linux and it will run on almost all UNIX
platforms?&rdquo;</p><p>&mdash;Dan Kusnetsky</p><p>Middleware? I think it's something that sits between
something that's useful and something you can understand.</p><p>&mdash;David Sifry</p><p>You need 64-bit support; you need terabyte filesystems. IBM
says the Open Source community will tackle that. I don't think so.
Somebody's got to build that.</p><p>&mdash;Jonathan Schwartz, Sun Microsystems</p><p>[<span   class="emphasis"><em>See page 44.</em></span>]</p></div></div>
