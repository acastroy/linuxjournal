    New developments for Linux in the Enterprise.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a7f580.0x2b773a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>There are two common points of view about
Linux in the so-called enterprise. The first is that Linux is only
capable of displacing Microsoft products on cheap low-end servers,
and that proprietary UNIXes with their huge 64-bit address spaces
and big SMP scalability are safe. The second is that Linux is
mainly displacing UNIX, since it's easy to port software from UNIX
to Linux, and that Microsoft with its difficult-to-port-from APIs
is safe.
</p><p>Both points of view are wrong. Nothing is safe. On page 44,
Linux is running on a new 64-processor NUMA system. And, on page
52, Linux is displacing the nastiest Microsoft server to replace,
Exchange&mdash;undocumented protocols and all.</p><p>In our December 2002 issue, Douglas B. Maxwell wrote about
how he beat the graphics performance of a large SGI system with
$15,000 worth of PCs. This month, we're celebrating SGI's release
of a big Linux box by putting it on our cover. Do we have the
world's shortest attention span? Aren't generic PCs taking over
everything?</p><p>If they are, they're not done yet. If you have a big problem
that you haven't figured out how to split into PC-sized chunks, or
don't want to take the time to split into PC-sized chunks, the
512GB of memory on the new SGI Altix 3000 seems like just what you
need.</p><p>One slogan at SGI is &ldquo;do science, not computer science&rdquo;. Do
big problems the way you know how and get better results now. Of
course, this is waving a red flag in front of the commodity cluster
faction, and I'm sure we'll soon have plenty of articles pointing
out how you can get previously unclusterable work done on a
cluster.</p><p>The diversity of success stories in this issue makes it clear
that any company that tries to compete with Linux in a fair fight
will lose. So it's going to be an unfair fight for a while, with
the non-Linux vendors pulling shenanigans such as bogus software
patents, FUD-based marketing, copy-restricted content, carefully
placed &ldquo;donations&rdquo; and &ldquo;campaign contributions&rdquo;, and who knows
what else.</p><p>But most of the companies, and most important, the people,
who are promoting non-Linux legacy products today are going to be
part of the Linux business tomorrow. Since our community will
survive and theirs won't, ours has to be able to welcome and do
business with them in the future. So we can't engage in the same
desperate nonsense they are. All we have is the best software and
the truth, and that's plenty.</p><p>Finally, the one enterprise that's most important to pulling
some people from just getting by up to knowledge and success is the
public library. Your local library provides educational materials,
entertainment, training and community programs. Now, that important
institution's budget won't be wasted on expensive, inflexible
proprietary software. The Koha Project is offering library
cataloging and search software under the GPL, in the same spirit we
have public libraries in the first place. Join your local Friends
of the Library and read Pat Eyler's article on page 58.</p></div></div>
