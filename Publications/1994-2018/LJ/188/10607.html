I saw a short video on YouTube about something called a Beagle Board, and it
looked really interesting. It was this incredibly tiny board with plenty
of ports. It even had an HDMI, which meant it would be easy to hook up
to the LCD television in my living room. I put in my order to Digi-Key,
and a few weeks later, it showed up. (I ordered it while Digi-Key was working
on a new version, so your order should arrive faster.)
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10607f1.large.jpg"><img src="10607f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Up close with the Beagle Board&mdash;the gray thing underneath it is
a floppy disk for scale.
</p></div></div><p>
When the package arrived, and I pulled out the box, my first reaction
was <span   class="emphasis"><em>wow</em></span>! This thing is tiny! When I opened the box, I realized that
Digi-Key wasn't kidding by calling it the Beagle Board. The only
thing in the box was a shiny red PCB (Printed Circuit Board). I had 
seen the board in the video, but until I got it, I didn't realize 
it came as a bare board. This led to my second order from Digi-Key.
I didn't own the proper 5V power supply to make it work. I also added
on a Beagle Board serial cable, which was lucky because it is an essential
part of the setup process. I already had a serial-USB dongle, so if your
computer does not have a serial port, you will need that as well.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10607f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

Features</h2></div></div><p>
The Beagle Board has a ton of features built in, with options to add on
more. The main feature of the Beagle Board, besides its 3"x3" form
factor, is the OMAP 3530 processor. This tiny ARM processor handles all
the heavy lifting on the board. The rev C. board that I have even
has an extra USB port that is not shown in the picture, making it
even easier to hook up USB peripherals to the board. In my case, that
would be a USB hub, keyboard, mouse, Wi-Fi dongle and a thumbdrive.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb14580.0xc0ca38"></a>
History</h2></div></div><p>
The Beagle Board was developed by a very small team of engineers inside
Texas Instruments. TI has a &ldquo;small dreams&rdquo; program where employees
are given some funding to pursue a good idea. The first prototypes
were released in June 2008. The engineers' goal was to
provide a platform that gave users access to desktop-like performance
without the bulk or expense. The team also was trying to find a way to
make it easy for a hobbyist to pick up the board and experiment without
requiring a lot of embedded experience.
</p><p>
I can say that in my time working with the Beagle Board, they were able
to achieve both goals. It isn't the fastest computer I have ever used,
but it is very usable. It is so tiny, I occasionally would misplace
it on my work bench. On the embedded side, I had some bumps choosing the
right components, but once I got a working system, it was very
straightforward.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb14580.0xc0cbf0"></a>
Tools</h2></div></div><p>
A great place to get started is at 
<a href="http://elinux.org/BeagleBoardBeginners" target="_self">elinux.org/BeagleBoardBeginners</a>.
The two big things to make sure of when you get into playing with the
Beagle Board are compatibility and connectivity.
</p><p>
I used the Beagle Board serial cable to monitor what was going on. In
several cases, I had incompatibilities (it took some tweaking to get
the Beagle to show up properly on my living-room TV). I also grabbed a
Wi-Fi dongle from Linksys, figuring that it would just work. In this case,
it was too new. I went back and got the Belkin G F5D7050 that everyone
else seems to be using, and I was able to get on the wireless network.
</p><p>
The Beagle Board beginners page actually links to a shopping list, showing you
what you need and which versions to buy. I did not find that
information until much later, so I am trying to help you avoid one of my mistakes.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb14580.0xc0ce00"></a>
Common Install</h2></div></div><p>
The Beagle Board bootloader needs to be configured in order to run Linux.
The good news is that once you do this setup, you don't have to do it
again. You actually can do this step before you do anything else, and it's
a good way to make sure you have everything ready for communication
with your Beagle Board.
</p><p>
First, install minicom on your Linux host. You will need to change
some settings:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo minicom -s
</pre>
</p><p>
Inside minicom, you need to enter the &ldquo;Serial port setup&rdquo;.
Make sure you set the correct device to which to talk. In my case, I have the
serial cable connected to a serial-to-USB dongle. That means my serial
device is /dev/ttyUSB0. Make sure the Bps/Par/Bits is set to 115200
8N1. Turn off all hardware and software control. Once that is done, save
it as the default.
</p><p>
Now, connect the serial cable to your Beagle Board, start minicom, and
power on the Beagle Board. You should see a message about the OMAP3530
being ready. It also will show you a countdown until autoboot. You need
to press a key to stop the boot process, so you can change some settings.
</p><p>
Once you are at the OMAP3 beagleboard.org prompt, type the following:


<pre     class="programlisting">
setenv bootcmd 'mmcinit; fatload mmc 0:1 0x80300000 
 &#8618;uImage; bootm 0x80300000'
setenv bootargs 'console=ttyS2,115200n8 console=tty0 
 &#8618;root=/dev/mmcblk0p2
rootwait rootfstype=ext3 ro omapfb.mode=dvi:1024x768MR-24@60'

saveenv
printenv
</pre>
</p><p>
This configures your Beagle Board to look for the kernel image you are
going to create. Now you need to get an SD card and prepare it to work
for the Beagle Board.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb14580.0xc0d220"></a>
SD Card Preparation</h2></div></div><p>
The important thing to understand about the SD card you're using is
that it needs to be partitioned and formatted in a very specific
way.
Using fdisk or gparted, remove all existing partitions on
the card. Then, create two partitions. The first one needs to be 50MB
and formatted to fat32. The second partition can use the rest of the
space on the card and should be formatted to ext3.
</p><p>
For the OS installs, you will be putting a uImage file on the fat32
partition. The rest of your files will go on the Linux ext3 partition.
As you go through the process of building your install image, make sure
you keep your uImage and Linux root filesystem in sync with the
same kernel versions.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb14580.0xc0d3d8"></a>
&Aring;ngstr&ouml;m</h2></div></div><p>
The fine people at &Aring;ngstr&ouml;m have worked hard on a distribution that
is easy and stable to run on embedded devices. This is a good place to
start if you just want to boot your Beagle Board into a Linux environment
quickly.
</p><p>
I even found a handy tool to build your own custom &Aring;ngstr&ouml;m
image at <a href="http://amethyst.openembedded.net/~koen/narcissus" target="_self">amethyst.openembedded.net/~koen/narcissus</a>. This is
still experimental, but it was nice to be able to choose what
I wanted in my image quickly.
</p><p>
If you want something even easier, &Aring;ngstr&ouml;m also offers a tarball
containing a working system that demonstrates the capabilities
of the Beagle Board. Simply download the latest tarball from
<a href="http://www.angstrom-distribution.org/demo/beagleboard" target="_self">www.angstrom-distribution.org/demo/beagleboard</a>, and get the uImage
that has the same timestamp. Untar the tarball directly onto the ext3
partition of your SD card, and put the uImage (make sure you rename it to
uImage) on the fat32 partition.

Ubuntu</h2></div></div><p>
The nice thing about &Aring;ngstr&ouml;m is how easy it is to get up and running.
The downside is I am not very familiar with that distribution as
an environment. I ran into some problems configuring the Wi-Fi for
the board, so I decided to switch to Ubuntu. Installing Ubuntu is more
complicated upfront, but once installed, it was a lot easier for me to
work with.
</p><p>
The other nice thing about Ubuntu is that Canonical announced late last
year that it would officially
support the ARM architecture (<a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/news/arm-linux" target="_self">www.ubuntu.com/news/arm-linux</a>).
This means Canonical would be working on
making sure that the packages I know and love on my x86 are all available
on the ARM. Because the OMAP processor in the Beagle Board is an ARM chip,
it will benefit from all this support.
</p><p>
A step-by-step guide for installing Ubuntu can be found at
<a href="http://elinux.org/BeagleBoardUbuntu" target="_self">elinux.org/BeagleBoardUbuntu</a>. By the time this article is published,
Karmic Koala should be officially released, so instead of giving you
out-of-date instructions, I recommend you follow the link to
get the latest information.
</p><p>
I actually installed Jaunty, as that was the stable version of Ubuntu
at the time of this writing. Once it was up and running, any software I needed was simply
an apt-get away (in most cases). In this case, that meant adding wicd
(light network manager), Firefox and VLC.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb14580.0xc0db10"></a>
Pitfalls</h2></div></div><p>
It would be easy enough to use the Beagle Board as a simple
workstation. You can browse, look at documents, listen to music
and even watch video. Those tasks demonstrate the board's flexibility
combined with the wealth of open-source software. On one hand,
it is really amazing to have so much processing power packed into such
a tiny form factor. On the other hand, turning the Beagle Board into
a desktop seems like a waste of that form factor (unless you mount it
inside a keyboard).
</p><p>
My initial goal was to use it as a set-top box. I was going to use
it to stream Hulu to my living-room television. I did some research
and found that you can build your own IR USB receiver (USB-IR-Boy).
That would make it easy for me to interface a standard remote to the
Beagle Board. Before I started ordering parts, I decided it would be
better to see how good the streaming capabilities were. This walked
me straight into a problem with no clear workaround. In order to
stream Hulu, your browser must support Flash. At this time, the
only Flash available for the ARM processor family is Flash Lite.
Flash Lite seems to be licensed in a way that makes it impossible
to distribute to a single end user. It is targeted more at handset
vendors who will be shipping millions of units. I installed Gnash
just to see if it was compatible, and it didn't work either. But, Adobe
has announced that it is working on Flash 10 for ARM-powered devices
(<a href="http://www.adobe.com/aboutadobe/pressroom/pressreleases/200811/111708ARMAdobeFlash.html" target="_self">www.adobe.com/aboutadobe/pressroom/pressreleases/200811/111708ARMAdobeFlash.html</a>).
</p><p>
So all is not lost. On the open standards front, I can hope that
the progress being made on HTML 5 and video will remove the need for a
proprietary solution to see video on the Web.
</p><p>
My first plan dashed, I realized there was another project that
I've been meaning to play with&mdash;namely building a MAME cabinet.
In honor of the Beagle Board's tiny size, I started looking at building a
Mini-MAME cabinet. This basically is a smaller version of an arcade cabinet, and
it has some advantages&mdash;namely that it will not take up too much
space, and it will be usable by my one-year-old son sooner. Once again,
before I ordered any parts, I installed all the MAME packages just to test
things out. Bam! (That's the sound of me hitting another wall.) In this
case, the MAME packages have been compiled and packaged, but they are
not set correctly to run on an ARM processor. I made some attempts at
hacking the Makefile to fix the problem, but I was unsuccessful. There are
videos of the Beagle Board running MAME, but I was not able to duplicate
their success.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb14580.0xc04608"></a>
The Future</h2></div></div><p>
Neither of these examples should dampen your enthusiasm for the Beagle
Board. I included them to highlight the challenges involved in working
in an embedded/non-x86 environment. The good news is that the software
issues I ran into will likely be fixed as more energy is put into
supporting the ARM platform.
</p><p>
All in all, it is a neat platform. It allows me to attack problems that
are too small for a full-blown PC without requiring me to be an embedded
expert (which I'm not).
