Using some reasonably simple techniques, you may be able to
reduce dramatically the boot time of your embedded Linux system.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d24580.0x1e1c2a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
It is no secret that Linux has won the race in the embedded device
marketplace. Tremendous advantages in Linux have broken almost every
barrier to entry for using Linux on embedded systems across a wide variety
of processor architectures. Today's developers are not asking, &ldquo;Should
I use Linux for my embedded system?&rdquo;, but instead are asking questions
like, &ldquo;How can I get more performance out of my embedded Linux
design?&rdquo; Reducing boot time has become one of the more interesting
discussions taking place in the embedded Linux community.
</p><p>
As it turns out, it is relatively easy to save substantial time on system
boot. Without a significant expenditure of engineering resources, savings
of more than 80% are possible with certain system configurations.
Of course, there is a point of diminishing returns. The graph of
engineering effort against boot time would rapidly approach infinite effort
as time reduced into the milliseconds and lower.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d24580.0x1e1c5c0"></a>
Fast Boot Requires Definition</h2></div></div><p>
Before you can measure boot time, you must define what it means. (I
introduce measurement techniques later in this article.) Most often, your customers or end
users provide, or at least influence, the definition. The type of product
you design certainly impacts your definition. Most systems that appear to
boot very quickly actually are just providing early feedback to users in the form
of graphical banners, audible feedback, animation or some combination
thereof. You as the system designer must specify what it means for your
embedded device to be booted and exactly what the user experience will be
during power-on.
</p><p>
Do you define boot time as the time from power-on to playing your favorite
music? Or, maybe you design big iron, and boot time eats into your annual
&ldquo;five-nines&rdquo; reliability budget. A cellular radio node controller
that takes two minutes to boot eats up almost half your annual downtime
budget! Yet, many systems we perceive as fast boot systems are not actually booting from
power-on. Consider a popular cell-phone design, such as the BlackBerry
Curve. The only time these systems perform a full boot is when the battery
is removed and replaced. Power &ldquo;on&rdquo; is actually a resume from a low-power
system state that largely preserves its current operational status.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d24580.0x1e1c7d0"></a>
It Starts with the Hardware</h2></div></div><p>
Although it may seem trivial to mention, sound hardware design is a
fundamental component of a fast boot system. Many aspects of
hardware design can have a marked influence on 1) how quickly your
first bits of code get to execute and 2) how quickly that code can be read
out of a nonvolatile storage device during initial boot. Pay particular attention
to power-on reset circuitry and initial hardware strapping, which provides
default timings for external buses and chip selects on certain processors.
It is not uncommon to find &ldquo;conservative&rdquo; values being employed
here that often can be improved upon.
</p><p>
Your overall hardware architecture will set the stage for what performance
you will be able to achieve. Choice of processor, clock speed, choice of
nonvolatile storage used for boot images and many other factors will
influence how fast your design can fetch and execute its startup image
(usually a bootloader) and then go on to load and execute an operating
system. Your hardware choices at design time must be carefully considered
if single-digit boot times are part of your product requirements.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d24580.0x1e1c988"></a>
Typical Boot Sequence</h2></div></div><p>
To understand where time is being spent, it helps to visualize the boot
sequence of a typical embedded Linux system. Figure 1 shows the basic
sequence.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10572f1.large.jpg"><img src="10572f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Typical Boot Sequence of Events
</p></div></div><p>
Upon power-on, the hardware needs time for voltages (and often clocks) to
stabilize and for reset to be released. The first code executed upon
release of reset depends on the hardware architecture and processor, but
often it is your bootloader running from nonvolatile memory, such as NOR
Flash. A small section of code performs some low-level initialization
that includes the memory controller and typically copies itself into
DRAM for further execution. This copy operation can consume a significant
portion of boot time. It is easy to see that keeping the bootloader small
and simple (the KISS principle) will help keep boot time to a minimum.
The bootloader's primary responsibility after hardware initialization is to
locate, load and pass control to your Linux kernel. Once the kernel has
completed its own initialization, it must locate and mount a root filesystem. Your root filesystem will contain a set of initialization scripts
as well as your own applications. There are numerous opportunities for
optimization in all of these steps, as I explain below.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d24580.0x1e1cca0"></a>
Bootloader Considerations</h2></div></div><p>
Virtually every embedded system has some type of bootloader, and there are
many bootloaders from which to choose. Some of the more popular include U-Boot
for PowerPC, MIPS and ARM processors, and RedBoot, which is frequently found on ARM
processors. Most popular bootloaders today contain far more functionality
than actually is required for the task of initializing a system. Indeed,
they have become valuable tools used by developers during initial board bring-up and
system development.
</p><p>
Modern bootloaders are packed with features, such as Flash erase and program
utilities, memory management utilities, network capabilities for loading
images and for self-configuring (DHCP and BOOTP for example), drivers for PCI,
IDE, USB and support for various partition types and filesystems. Some
even have scripting language support useful for development, manufacturing
(production test, image load and so on) and system upgrade.
</p><p>
These features make bootloaders an indispensable tool during product
development. However, the size of bootloader images has significant impact
on boot time. Bootloaders are stored in nonvolatile storage media, most
commonly NOR Flash. However, embedded systems rarely execute code directly
from Flash, mostly because it is far too slow. Read times of DRAM are
orders of magnitude faster than read times from Flash.
</p><p>
The first job of the bootloader is to load itself into DRAM and continue
execution from there. Consider the operating environment of early boot
code. There is no stack, no C context (meaning all this code is written
in the processor's native assembly language), and quite often, the
processor's instruction and data caches are not yet enabled. This means
the size of the bootloader image, which needs to be copied into RAM,
will have a major impact on startup time.
</p><p>
The quickest path to performance improvement in your bootloader is to keep
it small. Remove features that are unnecessary in a production
environment. Some bootloaders, such as U-Boot, make it easy to do this. Its
features are driven by a board-specific configuration file that contains
directives to enable or disable features. Your requirements will
ultimately rule, but prudent trimming of all but the most essential
features will yield significant savings in boot time.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d24580.0x1e1cf08"></a>
Uncompressed Kernel</h2></div></div><p>
When you build a Linux kernel image, it is virtually always compressed as
one of the final build steps. It is the responsibility of your bootloader
(or a small bootstrap decompression loader that is appended to your kernel
image) to decompress the kernel image and place it into system memory. One
of the single largest easy gains you can achieve is to remove the
decompression stage. Some architecture/bootloader combinations don't
bother to enable caches, making decompression take much longer. It is not
uncommon to find systems that take several seconds to perform the
decompression and relocation stage. Using an uncompressed kernel can
significantly reduce your system boot time.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d24580.0x1e1d068"></a>
Eliminate initrd/initramfs</h2></div></div><p>
Linux distributions use initrd/initramfs (hereinafter referred to as simply
initramfs) primarily as a tool to enable a generic kernel to be used across
a huge variety of system configurations. It is the job of the initramfs to
provide the necessary device drivers to enable the devices that are
required to complete system boot. Because embedded systems often
are restricted to limited well-known configurations, they usually can eliminate
initramfs with a corresponding reduction in boot time. Furthermore,
removing support for initramfs in the kernel results in a smaller
kernel (and, thus, faster boot.)
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d24580.0x1e1d170"></a>
Smaller Kernels Boot Faster</h2></div></div><p>
If you compile a kernel with a &ldquo;default&rdquo; configuration, it often
contains a vast number of features your system may not need. You may
be surprised to discover how many features are enabled by default that your
embedded system does not need. Spend some quality time with your favorite
kernel configuration editor (menuconfig, gconfig and so on), and go through each
and every kernel configuration parameter. Evaluate whether your system
requirements can do without it. Yes, it may take you the better part of a day (or even
more if you add in some research time), but your savings in boot time
reduction can be substantial. Some examples of features found in many
default kernel configs include IPv6, RAID, support for many filesystems
you may not need, extended partition support and many more. There 
also may be numerous device drivers compiled into the kernel for devices
that
are not present in your system. They are harmless, but each driver runs
initialization code, including registration functions, and some spend
lengthy milliseconds (or more) in device probe routines for devices that
are not present&mdash;precious boot time can be spent probing for
non-existent devices.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d24580.0x1e1d2d0"></a>
Calibration Routine</h2></div></div><p>
You may have seen the interesting &ldquo;BogoMIPS&rdquo; message plastered on
your screen or terminal during boot. Linux calibrates its internal
software timing loops to your processor system clock on each boot, arriving
at a constant value used by the loops_per_jiffy variable (lpj). Although
the technique varies across different architectures, this can be a
time-consuming routine. It is easy to bypass this dynamic calibration
routine by &ldquo;hard-coding&rdquo; the time constant calculated by this
routine. This is quite easily passed to the kernel through the kernel
command line. Simply add <tt  >lpj=xxxxx</tt> to your kernel command line, where
xxxxx is the lpj value printed to your boot log during boot. This is what
the boot message looks like on the Intel Atom-based Netbook on which this
article is being drafted:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Calibrating delay using timer specific routine..
    3194.85 BogoMIPS (lpj=6389712)
</pre>
</p><p>
From this information, simply add the string
<tt  >lpj=6389712</tt>to your
kernel command line. This will bypass the often lengthy calibration
routine and instead use the fixed value for loops_per_jiffy.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d24580.0x1e1d5e8"></a>
Filesystem Selection</h2></div></div><p>
One of the keys to achieving single-digit boot times is your choice of root
filesystems. Some filesystems designed for Flash use, for example the
ubiquitous JFFS2, can get into a state that requires a significant and
noticeable time delay while the kernel reads the sequential journal entries
and reconstructs the files and directories on the filesystem. Consider
using a small, compact and fast root filesystem for your initial system
boot, and then mount a more general-purpose filesystem later in the
initialization sequence.
</p><p>
CRAMFS is a read-only, compressed filesystem that is perfectly suited for
this purpose. Configure a preliminary root filesystem using CRAMFS, which
contains all the executables and libraries you need to get your system into
a preliminary operational state. Later, while other less critical tasks
are being executed, you can mount a writable JFFS2 partition when time is
not so critical. Also consider the liberal use of tmpfs for volatile data
such as /tmp, /var and others. Tmpfs is fast and efficient, and
dynamically resizes itself to meet storage requirements. Remember, the
contents of all tmpfs filesystems are lost on power-down, so if there are
any files (log files, configuration data and so on) that must be saved, it will
be up to your application to save this data periodically to nonvolatile
storage.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d24580.0x1e1d748"></a>
Udev Considerations</h2></div></div><p>
Udev has become an efficient and powerful system configuration tool. Its
primary role is to create device nodes for devices that the kernel
discovers. Virtually every modern Linux distribution uses udev coupled
with a set of rules for device naming. Udev also has the capability to run
external programs in response to device detection. The most common example
of this is to run modprobe to install a device driver upon device
detection. For example, if you plug an SD card into an appropriate socket,
a properly configured udev-based Linux system will perform all the actions
required to enable the device. This includes loading device drivers and
creating the device nodes associated with the device and driver.
</p><p>
This powerful and flexible scheme has one drawback. Although udev itself is
fast and efficient, some of the external programs it runs may require
significant time to complete.
</p><p>
When a Linux system is booted and reaches userland, udev basically
&ldquo;plays back&rdquo; all the device notification events generated by the
kernel and performs the required actions (primarily device node creation
and module loading). This can take a significant amount of time. One
solution to this problem is to configure your Linux system with statically
generated device nodes for critical system devices (those that you need
to be operational immediately) and defer the running of udev until your fast-path
boot chores are complete. For each device you need to have immediately
available at boot time, create a static device node in /dev as part of your
root filesystem. Later, when udev takes over, your udev startup script can
merge these static devices with those devices that udev creates
dynamically.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d24580.0x1e1d9b0"></a>
Measuring Boot Time</h2></div></div><p>
Several tools are available to help you identify the long paths in
your system boot. They vary in complexity and ease of use, but most can be
mastered quickly. The simplest tool (and perhaps a good starting point) is
to configure your kernel to add timestamps to the kernel messages that are
displayed on boot. Select CONFIG_PRINTK_TIME in the Kernel Hacking section
of your kernel configuration to enable this feature. This lets you see at
a glance where significant time is being spent during the actual kernel
boot sequence.
</p><p>
Another easy tool to use is to enable printout of each kernel initcall. An
initcall is a special type of kernel function call specifically related to
subsystem initialization. This is accomplished by adding the single
parameter initcall_debug to your kernel command line. When enabled, the
kernel will display a line that lists the kernel virtual address of each
initcall together with return data and call duration. While you must
&ldquo;decode&rdquo; the kernel virtual address into its symbolic function
name, this data is readily available in the System.map file in your Linux
kernel source tree. If you have CONFIG_KALLSYMS enabled (found under
General setup&rarr;Configure standard kernel features for small systems), the
initcall line will be decoded for you. A sample of the output from the
system boot log with initcall_debug enabled is displayed in Listing 1.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d24580.0x1e1dbc0"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Listing 1. initcalls Taking More than Nine Milliseconds to Complete</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">
root@8548cds:~# dmesg | grep initcall | egrep '[0-9][0-9] msecs'
initcall pty_init+0x0/0x43c returned 0 after 57 msecs
initcall serial8250_init+0x0/0x138 returned 0 after 20 msecs

</pre></div><p>
Using initcall_debug in this scenario reveals that almost nine seconds could
be saved by eliminating or deferring ide and IP auto configuration!
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d24580.0x1e146b8"></a>
Using KFT for Boot Time Measurements</h2></div></div><p>
One of the more powerful tools for boot time measurement is Kernel Function
Trace. KFT instructs the compiler to generate instrumentation for
virtually all kernel function calls. When enabled and triggered, data is
logged for each function call entry and exit, which allows you to identify
functions that consume large amounts of time. To use this tool, you will
need to apply the KFT patch to your kernel. Detailed instructions and
links to KFT kernel patches can be found at
<a href="http://elinux.org/Kernel_Function_Trace" target="_self">elinux.org/Kernel_Function_Trace</a>.
</p><p>
For each function call not specifically filtered out by your trace
configuration, a line is generated that contains a timestamp at function
entry, the function address, the address of the caller, process ID and a
delta. The raw data is accessed by reading /proc/kft_data after the
run has completed.
</p><p>
Several tools are available to post-process the raw data. The addr2sym
converts the kernel virtual address in the raw data to symbolic addresses.
It is simple to use:

<pre     class="programlisting">

# addr2sym &lt;kft_data.raw -m System.map &gt;kft_data.sym

</pre>
</p><p>
Above, kft_data.raw is the raw data copied from /proc. System.map is
produced by the kernel build and can be found in the top-level kernel
directory, and of course, kft_data.sym is the output file.
</p><p>
The KFT dump (kd) utility can be found in the Linux kernel scripts
directory after the KFT patch has been applied. Running kd on the raw data
produces a statistical summary of the functions called. You can use kd to
display the most time-consuming functions or functions with time greater
than that specified in your configuration and several other useful
filters. Listing 2 contains a partial listing (top ten) of the most time-consuming functions on a typical high-performance Power Architecture
processor. The negative number associated with the schedule call is due to
the fact that schedule changes context to another process&mdash;that is, it never
exits in the traditional manner that a function call usually does.

Improving Linux boot time is moving from the obscure corners of R&amp;D
labs to
mainstream product development. Driven by competitive pressures in a wide
variety of markets, system developers are devoting an increasing amount of
effort to making sure their systems are ready to use when users want
them. Always a hot topic, we are sure to see many more developments in the
near future aimed at further reducing Linux system boot time.
