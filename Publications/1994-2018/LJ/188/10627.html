Here at <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>, we take Linux very seriously. In fact, even my kids
are embedded. No really, I tucked them in about 20 minutes ago. They're
almost asleep. (See, every month you think Shawn can't possibly have
another cheesy issue-focus-related joke.) Seriously though, when it
comes to Linux, the biggest area of growth is in the tiniest of
spaces&mdash;the
embedded market. It sort of reminds me of a B spy movie:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux quietly takes over more and more devices; then one day Bill Gates
wakes up in a hospital room.</em></span>
</p><p>
Mr Gates: What happened, did the surgery go wrong? Did my pacemaker quit
working?
</p><p>
Nurse: No Mr Gates, it's working just fine. Your pacemaker is running
Linux...
</p><p>
Mr Gates: Nooooooooo!!!!!!
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Okay, perhaps I should stick to editorials and not try my hand at writing
movie scripts. With or without my movie, however, Linux really does
dominate the embedded market. This month, we've got a wide variety of
articles to help you learn more about developing for such markets or
to introduce you to embedded Linux for the first time.
</p><p>
What better way to attract everyone's interest than with a
remote-controlled rover? Kevin Sikorski tells us all about the Player Project.
It's a software framework for interfacing with PC-based robots. For
most of us, sending up missions like the Mars Rovers might be a bit much.
However, after reading Kevin's article, a &ldquo;Backyard Rover&rdquo;
might be possible&mdash;or at
the very least, a robot that could find and fetch missing left socks from
the laundry room. If you're not quite up to such a daunting task and
would like to learn a little more about how embedded Linux systems actually
work, you might want to read Johan Thelin's article first. It introduces
the concepts and functions of embedded systems&mdash;possibly a primer
course for your robot-building adventure.
</p><p>
If robots were the only type of embedded projects that ran Linux, it would
be rough to devote an entire issue to it. The beauty of embedded Linux is
that it can be so diverse. For instance, David Rowe shows us the Mesh
Potato. It may seem like a simple wireless access point, but thanks to the
operating system underneath, it's a lot more. This month, even Kyle Rankin
is trying to embed Linux&mdash;onto his face, in fact. Check out his review of
the Vuzix video goggles and see if they make him more awesome or more
likely to be kidnapped by Romulans.
</p><p>
Don't worry if embedded Linux doesn't really tickle your fancy. Dirk
Elmendorf shows us the Beagle Board this month. It's a full-blown computer
system that you probably could fit in your wallet. Granted, it would make
interacting with it difficult, and it likely wouldn't survive too many
sit-downs, but because the Beagle Board is so tiny, hiding it in places a
little more useful should be simple.
</p><p>
We have lots of non-embedded material for you this month too. Whether you
want to run multiple operating systems from the convenience of a thin
client (Jorge Salgado shows you how) or check your e-mail every
minute of every day (Kyle Rankin explains a method you've probably never seen
before), this month should satisfy. Plus, we've got book reviews from
Reuven M. Lerner, shell scripting longitude and latitude from Dave Taylor and
lots of new products from James Gray.
</p><p>
So make some chamomile tea, turn down the thermostat (possibly with the
help of Jeffery Ramsey's article on controlling room humidity with an
embedded system), and grab this month's issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span>. Carefully
crawl into bed and embed yourself under the covers. Enjoy an exciting
month of projects and read well into the morning. If you have a hard time
booting up in the morning, Christopher Hallinan's article on reducing boot
time in embedded systems might help. Or, call in sick with your
cell phone. It might just be running embedded Linux too.
