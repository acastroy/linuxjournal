The Player Project is a robot-control software framework for interfacing
with PC-based robots. Learn how to use it to interface with sensors,
actuators and even full research robots.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e02580.0x1efa250"></a></h2></div></div><p>
We've all heard that PC-based computers have increased in power and
decreased in size, power consumption and cost. These improvements mean
more people have access to them, but also that PCs are
becoming more suited to being the brains of a mobile robot. It brings to
robots a number of advantages, such as USB connectivity, greater memory
capacity, more powerful processors and even allows for plugging in a
mouse, keyboard and monitor to debug your robot <span   class="emphasis"><em>on</em></span> your
robot. The largest cost associated with the choice of a PC-based robot,
besides the dollar cost, is power consumption.
</p><p>
Programming your PC-based robot can be a little different from programming
a robot that uses a smaller, embedded processor. As you would expect,
PC-based robots can take advantage of programming features, such as
threads, using multiple languages and leveraging third-party libraries
to perform complex tasks.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e02580.0x1efa4b8"></a>
What Is Player?</h2></div></div><p>
One such third-party library is the Player Project. The Player Project
is a framework for building robot-control software. It provides a
wide-reaching infrastructure that gives you a network protocol, data
serialization support, a message loop and supports a large number of
common off-the-shelf components, such as Webcams, laser range finders,
RFID, GPS devices and interface boards. It even supports a large number
of commercially available robots, and some robot manufacturers, such as
CoroWare, provide Player drivers for their robots. And, of course, it's
open source.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e02580.0x1efa5c0"></a>
Requirements to Run Player</h2></div></div><p>
The newest version of Player runs on the majority of Linux distributions
with little effort. It is also cross-platform, with version 3.0 supporting
Microsoft Windows and even Cygwin under Microsoft Windows. It has low
memory requirements and is pretty easy on your CPU. Although it's not
completely cross-language, it does offer native support for C and C++,
and has nice Python and Ruby interfaces.
</p><p>
You don't really need a real robot to work with Player. If you have
a few sensors and actuators that you can connect to your laptop or
desktop computer, you still can run the Player server and control
those disembodied devices&mdash;think of it as a way to accomplish home
automation. Player also can be used with some of its close cousins:
Stage (a 2-D simulation system that integrates with Player) and Gazebo
(a 3-D simulation system that also integrates with Player). In this way,
you can simulate a full robot, or even a fleet of robots, without any
special hardware.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e02580.0x1efa778"></a>
What Does Player Look Like?</h2></div></div><p>
Several layers of the infrastructure are diagrammed in Figure 1,
which should be familiar if you have written code that interacts with hardware
devices.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10566f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. The relationship between Webcam hardware,
the driver that interfaces with it, the device created by the
driver and the interface that it exposes.
</p></div></div><p>
At the lowest level, we have the hardware layer. This corresponds to
the hardware that embodies the sensor, actuator or any other physical
component of the robot. The driver level sits on top of the hardware
level. This is one layer where a programmer writes code. For example,
a driver that interacts with a USB Webcam will provide whatever code is
necessary to make a connection with the camera, read the sensor's output,
package it up neatly and make it available to the rest of the system. A
lot of drivers of this type are provided with Player as <span   class="emphasis"><em>static
drivers</em></span>. This means you won't have to provide any special
shared object libraries to use them, just the usual Player libraries. You
also can write your own drivers, called plugins. The
code for these drivers lives in a shared object library (.so file).
</p><p>
You can create multiple instantiations of a single driver. When you
do this, you need a way to refer to a specific instance. For example,
if your robot has two cameras, one facing forward and one facing
backward, you will need to tell them apart to know in which direction
you are driving. In order to do this, Player gives you the concept of
a device. Each time you instantiate a driver, you assign it a device
name and number. For example, in your robot, camera:0 might refer to the
forward-facing camera, and camera:1 might refer to the backward-facing
camera.
</p><p>
Finally, we arrive at the concept of an interface. The interface is just
like the API for a software package; it defines the software interfaces
for getting data out of and putting data into the device. In our example,
the camera interface defines a set of messages to get images out of the
camera, and a set of messages to set up the camera and capture images.
</p><p>
Drivers don't have to exist solely for communicating with a piece
of hardware. Player supports a number of algorithmic drivers,
such as blob-finders or wavefront planners, or even camera image
compressors. These operate just like normal drivers, consuming and
producing data and exposing interfaces.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e02580.0x1efac48"></a>
Player Configuration</h2></div></div><p>
Now that we have dealt with the vocabulary, we can get down to
business. Let's say you've just acquired a CoroWare CoroBot robot (Figure
2). You've
installed Player, and you want to make the robot do something interesting. You
can type <tt  >player corobot.cfg</tt> to run the Player drivers on the
robot. This loads a configuration file that describes all the drivers
Player must load to make your robot work. Here's an excerpt of a
configuration file for the CoroBot:

<pre     class="programlisting">
driver
(
  name       "corobot"
  plugin     "libcorobotdriver"
  provides   ["position2d:0" "power:0" "ir:0"
              "limb:0" "gripper:0" "ptz:0"]
  requires   ["aio:0"]
  ssc32port  "/dev/ttyS1"
  ptzport    "/dev/video0"
)
</pre>
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10566f2.large.jpg"><img src="10566f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. CoroWare Robot
</p></div></div><p>
We start off by telling Player that we are constructing a driver. The
first two lines in the driver description tell Player where it can
find the relevant code: the <tt  >name</tt> line indicates the name of the driver
in the code (a single library can supply multiple drivers), and the
<tt  >plugin</tt> line indicates the name of the shared object library
that contains the code for this driver. In this case, it is stored in
libcorobotdriver.so, in the same directory as the configuration file. The
<tt  >provides</tt> line specifies the devices that this driver makes
available&mdash;in this case, the CoroBot driver exposes six devices. The
<tt  >requires</tt> line specifies the devices that this driver will
consume. If any devices here are not present on the system when Player
tries to instantiate the driver, Player will abort.
</p><p>
The last two lines in the driver description are not standard. Any
driver is free to parse its driver description and make use of special
identifiers. The CoroBot driver uses two of these: ssc32port specifies the
Linux device (a serial port) through which it will communicate with its
servo controller and a video device that controls its pan-tilt camera.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e02580.0x1efb1c8"></a>
Player Tools</h2></div></div><p>
Player provides a number of tools to make working with Player easier. For
example, you can use the playercam program to view the image provided
by a Webcam. Let's say you have Player installed on your computer
and a simple configuration file that brings up a camera driver:

<pre     class="programlisting">
driver
(
    name     "camerauvc"
    provides ["camera:0"]
    port     "/dev/video0"
    size     [640 480]
)
</pre>
</p><p>
You can run Player with this configuration file with <tt  >player
camera.cfg</tt>, and then run <tt  >playercam</tt> to see the camera
image in real time (Figure 3). If your Webcam is on another
computer&mdash;for example,
on a PC-based robot&mdash;and connected by a network, you can just as easily
see the Webcam output by running:

<pre     class="programlisting">
playercam -h hostname -p port
</pre>
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10566f3.large.jpg"><img src="10566f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Player's playercam Tool, with the Webcam
Pointed at the Computer Monitor
</p></div></div><p>
playerprint is a tool that works much like playercam, displaying the
output of a device to the user. But, playerprint does this textually
and can support a large number of interfaces, while playercam can 
support only the camera and blob-finder interfaces. For example, if we have a
CoroBot running its Player drivers, we can display its infrared sensor
readings with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
playerprint ir -h hostname -p port
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e02580.0x1efb6f0"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>

Player also lets you control your robot, not just inspect it. playerv
is a utility that also knows how to interact with many interfaces. Once
you have started the Player server on your robot, you can run it with
<tt  >playerv</tt> (if you are on the same machine) or
<tt  >playerv
-h hostname -p port</tt> (if you are on another computer). playerv will
show a graphical display of the world around your robot, but it does
not automatically connect with any devices. You will have to go to the
Devices menu, and subscribe to the devices that you are interested in
playerv plotting. In order to drive your robot around, you'll want to
subscribe to the position2d device and select the option to
&ldquo;command&rdquo;
the interface. Then, you will be able to drag a small targeting reticle
around the window to drive the robot (Figure 4).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10566f4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

Playing with Player</h2></div></div><p>
So far, our robot is awake, alert and ready to be told to do something
interesting. Let's give it something to do. The CoroBot robot comes with
a number of sensors and actuators&mdash;probably the easiest of which to
interface with are the front- and rear-facing infrared ranging sensors and
the mobility base's drive motors. Thus, we can write a small C program
to talk to the Player server, read the IR sensors and drive the robot
until it is 10cm away from an obstacle in front of the robot.
</p><p>
The first thing we have to do to interface with the Player server is
open up a connection to it. For the sake of brevity, we will skip a lot
of error checking, but you can download the full version of the code
from the <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> FTP server (see Resources).
</p><p>
This code defines the variables we will use to talk to the Player
server and the device interfaces in which we are interested:

<pre     class="programlisting">
#include "libplayerc/playerc.h"
static playerc_client_t*      clientHandle;
static playerc_position2d_t*  positionProxy;
static playerc_ir_t*          irProxy;
</pre>
</p><p>
The clientHandle is used for talking to the Player server
itself. The second position2d interface talks to the position2d interface,
providing us with encoder information about how the wheels are moving
and allowing us to send motor commands to the robot. We'll ignore the
encoder information for this example. Lastly, the IR interface gives us
information about the distances that the robot's IR sensors are reporting.
</p><p>
The next code snippet uses these proxies to interface with the server
and these devices:


<pre     class="programlisting">
playerc_client_connect(clientHandle);

// convert our interface to a PULL interface,
// only updates when we read
playerc_client_datamode(clientHandle, PLAYER_DATAMODE_PULL);

// tell the robot to drop older messages
playerc_client_set_replace_rule(
       clientHandle, -1, -1, PLAYER_MSGTYPE_DATA, -1, 1);

// create the position proxy (controls the motors)
positionProxy = playerc_position2d_create(clientHandle, 0);
playerc_position2d_subscribe(positionProxy, PLAYER_OPEN_MODE);

// create the IR proxy (controls the IRs)
irProxy = playerc_ir_create(clientHandle, 0);
playerc_ir_subscribe(irProxy, PLAYER_OPEN_MODE);
</pre>
</p><p>
We start off by connecting to the Player server and configuring our
connection. We want to get new messages from the server only when we
are ready for them, so we configure the connection for a pull-type
arrangement. And, because we want only the most recent information (we
don't care what the IR sensors were indicating a second ago, we care
about what they are saying right now), we tell the server to report
only the most recent data. If we really wanted, we could let Player ensure
that every IR message was delivered, but that might result in getting
less-than-fresh data and possibly driving into a wall.
</p><p>
After our connection is configured, we open up the position2d interface
on the Player server and subscribe to it. Then, we do the same with the
IR interface. So far, so good. Now we need to get the state of the IRs
from the robot and tell it how to move the motors:

<pre     class="programlisting">

while (!timeToQuit) {
  // attempt to read from the client
  if (playerc_client_read(clientHandle) == 0)
    continue;      // nothing to read, try again.

  // read the IR distances and verify we have good data
  if (irProxy-&gt;data.ranges_count == 2) {
    frontIr = irProxy-&gt;data.ranges[0];
    rearIr  = irProxy-&gt;data.ranges[1];
  }

  // figure out how to drive
  runController(frontIr, rearIr,
                &amp;desiredTranslation,&amp;desiredRotation);

  playerc_position2d_set_cmd_vel(
      positionProxy, desiredTranslation,
      0, desiredRotation, 1);
}

</pre>
</p><p>
Each time through the loop, we try to read the newest data from the
robot. After a little sanity checking, we take the ranges reported by the
IR sensors and feed them into a controller function. This controller
does some magic processing (we'll talk about that later) and returns
information on how we should drive the robot. Finally, we pass these
driving commands back to the Player server and start it all over again.
</p><p>
All that's left now is to provide a runController function
that maps from IR sensor readings to drive commands. The CoroBot driver
accepts numbers in the range of &ndash;1.0 to +1.0 to tell how to drive the
robot forward and backward: +1.0 means 100% power forward, &ndash;1.0 means
100% power in reverse, and 0.0 means stop. It accepts the same range
for telling the robot how to turn: &ndash;1.0 means turn full power left, +1.0
means turn full power right, and 0.0 means drive straight ahead. Noting
that the IR readings are provided in meters, we can use the following
P-controller to drive our robot forward until we are 10cm away from a
front obstacle. We even get a bonus for free&mdash;if we are closer than
10cm away, the robot will back up a bit until it is at the proper distance:


<pre     class="programlisting">
void runController(double frontIr, double rearIr,
                   double *translation,double *rotation)
{
  // convert our IR readings into drive commands
  *translation = (frontIr-0.1) * 3.0;
  *translation = *translation &gt; 0.9? 0.9: *translation;
  *rotation    = 0.0;
}
</pre>
</p><p>
And finally, good programmers always shut down their server connections
when they are done:

<pre     class="programlisting">
void shutDownProxies()
{
  // close down proxies we have opened
  playerc_ir_unsubscribe(irProxy);
  playerc_ir_destroy(irProxy);
  playerc_position2d_unsubscribe(positionProxy);
  playerc_position2d_destroy(positionProxy);
  playerc_client_disconnect(clientHandle);
  playerc_client_destroy(clientHandle);
}
</pre>
</p><p>
Building on the design we showed earlier, we can see how our drive-by-IR
program interacts with the Player infrastructure. The CoroBot
configuration file loads the phidgetIFK driver, which exposes an aio:0
device. This device allows the CoroBot driver to read the robot's onboard
infrared sensors. The CoroBot driver also exposes the position2d and
IR interfaces, which the drive-by-IR program reads with the help of the
libplayerc library (Figure 5).

The Player Project offers a lot of functionality that there just isn't
room to get into in one article. This includes robot simulation, support
for numerous commercial robots of many different prices and qualities,
and support for a whole slew of readily available devices. Its plugin
system even allows you to build your own drivers for new devices, either
to support new hardware or to implement new experimental algorithms. Give
it a try, and give your computer a chance to stretch its legs.
