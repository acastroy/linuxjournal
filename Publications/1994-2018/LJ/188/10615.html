How do video goggles designed for gaming on Windows stack up to
a Linux geek's desktop? Find out below.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2375580.0x246d358"></a></h2></div></div><p>
I'm a sucker for cyberpunk. It probably has to do with all those
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Shadowrun</em></span> sessions when I was a kid, but even the worst cyberpunk movies
and books can grab my interest. Although my friends shake their heads
at the cheesy acting and special effects in movies like <span   class="emphasis"><em>Johnny
Mnemonic</em></span>, I
still love the concept of total immersion into your computer and virtual
reality that you see in classic cyberpunk. With all of this in mind, it
shouldn't surprise you that I've been keeping close watch on the current
state of the art with consumer video goggles. Even though I'm not quite
ready to become a <span   class="emphasis"><em>Snow Crash</em></span>-esque gargoyle just yet, I still jumped at
the chance to review the Vuzix VR920 video goggles (<a href="http://vuzix.com" target="_self">vuzix.com</a>, $399.95).
</p><p>
I've been following the Vuzix company's product line for a number of
years&mdash;before they even were called Vuzix&mdash;and it's been interesting to
watch the product line progress. At the moment, Vuzix has a few different
consumer-grade video goggles: lower-res glasses aimed at portable
video devices like the iPod, and the VR920 that it aims at the computer
gaming market. All of the goggles include built-in headphones, and each
model has different audio and video inputs. The AV920 and VR920 feature
the higher-res 640x480 screens, but the AV920 still is designed to connect
to video devices, such as portable DVD players, and includes a rechargeable
battery and standard DVD player video inputs. If you want to connect
goggles to a computer, you'll definitely want to go with the VR920, as it
not only comes with a VGA connector, but it also can be powered from
USB.
</p><p>
VR920 specifications (from the product page):
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Twin high-resolution 640x480 (920,000 pixels) LCD displays.
</p></li><li><p>
Equivalent to a 62" screen viewed at nine feet.
</p></li><li><p>
24-bit true color (16 million colors).
</p></li><li><p>
Visor weighs 3.2 ounces.
</p></li><li><p>
60Hz progressive scan display update rates.
</p></li><li><p>
Fully iWear 3-D-compliant and supports NVIDIA stereo drivers.
</p></li><li><p>
Built-in noise-canceling microphone for Internet VoIP communications.
</p></li><li><p>
Built-in three-degree-of-freedom head-tracker.
</p></li><li><p>
USB connectivity for power, tracking and full duplex audio.
</p></li><li><p>
Analog VGA monitor input.
</p></li><li><p>
Support for up to 1024x768 VGA video formats.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
The VR920 definitely is aimed at the gaming market and has some pretty
interesting features, such as an accelerometer that under Windows can be
used (along with compatible games) to track your head movement, so when you
turn your head left, for instance, your character's head turns left. The
VR920 is powered by your USB port, and the USB connection also is used, so
sound can be sent to the included earbuds. You also can take advantage
of the NVIDIA stereo drivers under Windows to display different images
for each eye and get a 3-D-like experience. Unfortunately, even though
you can find a few homegrown projects to get basic accelerometer support
and stereo video working under Linux, as of yet, I wouldn't call it fully
functional, so in this review, I focus on what it would be like
for average users to use the VR920 with their Linux desktops.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2375580.0x246df60"></a>
Look and Feel</h2></div></div><p>
Before I go into how to set up the hardware in Linux, I first
should get something out of the way. You see, the primary thing that has made
the video goggle market grow so slowly in my mind isn't so much the lower
resolutions on the screens or the price, as much as the fact that you still
look a little bit dorky wearing any of the major vendors' goggles. I mean,
we are all geeks here, so we are used to looking a little bit dorky anyway.
Plus, many people would think it's a bonus to look like a character from
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Star Trek: The Next Generation</em></span>, but still, the look is not exactly for
everyone. The next revision of goggles apparently is going to address this
issue somewhat, as they appear to look more like large sunglasses.
Figure 1 shows a picture of me wearing the goggles, so you can see
what they look like. It's definitely a fashion statement. I know some
people will have no qualms walking around their daily lives with these on,
but others will use them only in the privacy of their own homes.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10615f1.large.jpg"><img src="10615f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Space Odyssey Indeed
</p></div></div><p>
Also, if you can't tell from the picture, these goggles don't completely
obstruct your vision. You can arrange them so that they sit a bit higher
on your nose, and if you lean back a bit, you can look up and see through
the goggles and look down to see your computer screen. This means
you still can use your regular display if you want and extend the desktop
to the goggles.
</p><p>
So, I wasn't surprised that I looked a little dorky with the goggles on,
and to be honest, I didn't care that much. What surprised me though
was how uncomfortable the nose bridge was out of the box. I think one of
the most important things you can do up front is adjust the nose of the
goggles so it's comfortable. The goggles don't feel very heavy, but after
a full movie, you will start to feel fatigue on your nose, especially
if the bridge is pinching too much. Once I had everything adjusted, it was
pretty comfortable, but I still wouldn't expect to wear them all day.
</p><p>
I also had a rather pleasant surprise with respect to eye fatigue, or
the relative lack of it. After all, you have these screens very close
to your eyes, so I figured my eyes would be focused very closely when
I used them. It turns out that the way they have engineered the optics,
they are telling the truth when they say it appears like a 62" screen
viewed at nine feet. If you connected your computer output to a large LCD
TV mounted on your wall and looked at it from your couch, it would look
a lot like a desktop through the VR920. To be honest, the effect is
so complete, I found myself squinting not because the image was too close,
but because it appeared too far away! You see, I'm nearsighted, but it's
mild enough that it doesn't affect my daily life in front of a computer. I
wear my glasses only when I'm driving at night, at a presentation or
when I'm watching a movie with subtitles. The downside for me is that
it's a bit tricky to wear glasses and the goggles at the same time, but
of course, if you use contact lenses, it wouldn't be a problem.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2375580.0x246e430"></a>
Hardware Setup</h2></div></div><p>
There is really very little hardware setup to do. Just plug in the
VGA and USB plugs to your machine. As I mentioned before, the USB port
is used to power the display as well as to send audio to the goggles
(it's also how you would access the accelerometer). Here is the relevant
syslog output I got when I connected the VR920 to my Ubuntu machine:


<pre     class="programlisting">

</pre>
</p><p>
So pulseaudio does appear to see the audio mixer, and even though it
throws some strange errors in syslog output, the sound worked fine. From
the output, I can tell that it sees it as the hw:1 ALSA device. I also
saw a new /dev/dsp1 device, and the device even showed up in my GNOME
sound properties window, so I could select the device from there.
</p><p>
The screen itself is detected without any extra effort on my part and
shows up in xrandr:


<pre     class="programlisting">
greenfly@moses:~$ xrandr
Screen 0: minimum 320 x 200, current 1280 x 800, maximum 1280 x 1280
VGA connected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)
   1024x768       60.0  
   800x600        60.3  
   640x480        59.9  
   720x400        70.1  
</pre>
</p><p>
You certainly can use xrandr to toggle whether the display is on, but you
also can configure it in the default GNOME Display Preferences window
(Figure 2). Personally, I set up a quick xrandr script to toggle the
goggles on when I wanted to use them:


<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/sh

if [ -f /tmp/.goggles_on ] ; then
        xrandr --output VGA --off &amp;
        echo "Goggles Off" | osd_cat --shadow=2 --align=center 
        &#8618;--pos=bottom --color=green --delay=2 
        &#8618;--font=lucidasanstypewriter-bold-24 --offset 40 &amp;
        rm /tmp/.goggles_on
else
        xrandr --output VGA --mode 640x480 --below LVDS
        echo "Goggles On" | osd_cat --shadow=2 --align=center 
        &#8618;--pos=bottom --color=green --delay=2 
        &#8618;--font=lucidasanstypewriter-bold-24 --offset 40 &amp;
        touch /tmp/.goggles_on
fi
</pre>
</p><p>
In this configuration, the goggles act as a 640x480 screen below my
regular desktop, and I can drag windows there just like with any other
monitor.

General Desktop Use</h2></div></div><p>
The main thing to realize when you use the VR920 like a regular monitor
is that even though the display supports 1024x768 input, the actual
screens go up to only 640x480, and anything higher resolution gets scaled
to fit. For my uses, I stayed with 640x480. Honestly, at that resolution,
the screen worked pretty well as an extra screen on my desktop, and I
moved IRC windows and other small terminals over to it.
</p><p>
The main limiting factor for how useful the screen is on a regular desktop
is the resolution, but nearsightedness aside, I thought it actually
was a pretty slick way to have IM, IRC or a terminal window always in your
field of view. As a sysadmin, I also can see how it might be useful
to tail logfiles in that screen or possibly put all of your monitoring
applets there. Just realize that if you arrange the goggles so you can
look up to view them and look down to view your regular screen, you
won't necessarily be able to use your peripheral vision to see changes
in the goggles&mdash;you'll have to look up every now and then. Also, I don't
think it would work quite as well for programs like The GIMP or for
word processing or anything else that might need more screen real estate.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2375580.0x246ebc0"></a>
Video Games</h2></div></div><p>
Video games are the main function the VR920 is geared toward, and I wasn't
surprised that it worked really well for that purpose. Again, the display
is 640x480 at maximum, so don't expect complete realism. Now, I'm an
old-school <span   class="emphasis"><em>Quake</em></span> gamer, so I just had to see what
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Quake 3</em></span> was like through the
goggles. Once the desktop was set up to span to that screen, I didn't have
to do any extra tweaking. I launched <span   class="emphasis"><em>Quake 3</em></span>, and it output to both of my
displays. Even though I didn't have the head-tracking feature enabled, I
have to admit it was really cool to play games with the goggles on. You do
feel even more immersed in the environment than normal, so any FPS (First-Person Shooter) games should work well here. Any other games that could
benefit from more virtual-reality-like immersion, such as flight
simulators,
would get an extra dimension of fun here as well. I should let my fellow
Point/Counterpoint columnist Bill try these out in <span   class="emphasis"><em>Second
Life</em></span>. I bet
it'll knock his socks off.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2375580.0x24656b8"></a>
Movies</h2></div></div><p>
I think that apart from gaming, movie viewing is one of the best uses for
the VR920 under Linux. The resolution isn't a real issue for anything
up to DVD quality, and once I had adjusted the goggles so they were
comfortable, they worked great for movies. Just be sure to tell your
video player to use the correct audio device. For my machine, this just
meant adding the <tt  >-ao alsa:device=hw=1,1</tt> to MPlayer,
but of course, it
will vary from program to program. I have to say it was really nice
to be able to watch an entire movie on my computer and still have my full
desktop to use. In my mind, the killer app for this is airplane travel,
as they are essentially headphones for your eyes&mdash;you can watch movies
with complete privacy.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2375580.0x2465870"></a>
Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
I had been anticipating all kinds of scenarios where I would use
the VR920 before I had them. I could see myself at my desk at work
displaying a terminal and maybe wearing them combined with some sort
of video camera for augmented reality and become a true <span   class="emphasis"><em>Snow
Crash</em></span>
gargoyle. The reality of having the goggles around for daily use isn't
quite as exciting though. To be perfectly honest, I didn't find myself
using them nearly as often as I thought I would. Part of the reason is
that I haven't been gaming much recently, but I think the main reason
is due to the low resolution. There are only so many programs that work
well in 640x480. Having said that, I'm definitely going to bring the
goggles with me the next time I travel. If you do play a lot of FPSs
or other games with a first-person perspective, or if you watch a lot
of videos in public and are tired of people looking over your shoulder,
I definitely think you should give the VR920 a try.
