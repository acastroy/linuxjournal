Is your security worth its salt? Try this assessment strategy to
find out.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27f0580.0x28e82a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Many of you think you have a secure environment. You follow best
practices. You check your logs regularly. Then, something gets through and
although it may not wreak havoc, you wonder how it happened. A lot of
shops practice passive security by putting security measures in place
and assuming they work based on logs, dashboards or other output. This
practice is inadequate for today's security landscape. Administrators
must take an active approach to security to combat
threats effectively. Active security can be as simple as verifying a password policy
or as complex as running a full-blown penetration test. Whatever approach
you choose, it always is a good idea to test the locks
periodically with a security assessment to make sure they work. The locks are items
such as the operating systems, network, applications and most
important, security policies that exist in your environment. With
regular security assessments, you can gain confidence that your security
measures are keeping the bad guys out.
</p><p>
This article covers a security assessment in four parts. The
sections are organized in reverse order of what an actual attack
might look like. By the fourth section, I bring everything together
and explain how such an attack might occur. I recommended that
before proceeding with any of the following tests, you get the approval of
upper management or the owner of the network and/or systems you will be
testing. To minimize further any risk to a production network/system, the
following tests should be performed after production hours if possible.
</p><p>
To assist in this assessment, I use a prebuilt VMware virtual
machine (VM) with the BackTrack distribution on it (available from
<a href="http://remote-exploit.org" target="_self">remote-exploit.org</a>). BackTrack is a comprehensive security auditing and
testing platform with many tools preconfigured and ready to use upon the
first boot. All the scripts and applications presented here should
be run as root. Only the custom script in the first section should be
run locally on a target machine. All other tools should be run from the
BackTrack VM.

1. Think Globally, Act Locally</h2></div></div><p>
Let's begin by checking the locks at the local level. The included script
(Listing 1) profiles basic settings to identify and weed out common
misconfigurations. It is by no means a catchall to validate all of
your security measures. The script has been tested on Red Hat- and
Debian-based systems, and as such, output may vary from system to system. You
also may need to customize the script for your own systems to ensure
functionality. All output is placed in the /tmp/seccheck/hostname
directory, where hostname is your locally defined hostname.

</pre></div><p>
Rather than go line by line, let's look at the output of the
script. The first prompt identifies the base distribution and
checks for needed patches and then outputs this information to
/tmp/seccheck/hostname/patchcheck.txt. After patch-checking, the main
output file is created as /tmp/seccheck/hostname/secoutput.txt. The first
section of this file lists the local services that run at startup. With
this information, you can view and disable any unnecessary services. This
section is followed by a listing of failed authentication messages
along with the results of the lastb command (Figure 1). From these two
sections, you quickly can determine whether the machine has been accessed by
an unauthorized user.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10244f1.large.jpg"><img src="10244f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Some Output from the Local Script
</p></div></div><p>
Next, the script checks whether the inetd d&aelig;mon is in use. Most modern
distributions no longer use the inetd super server, but some legacy
systems still do. If possible, you should convert those servers/services
to xinetd. xinetd-enabled services are listed in the section that
follows. Both super-servers can provide host-based access control to
specific services using TCP Wrappers. The access controls for TCP Wrappers
are stored in the hosts.allow and hosts.deny files. The contents of
these files are output after the xinetd section. If you use TCP Wrappers,
there should be an entry in your hosts.deny that reads
<tt  >ALL:ALL</tt> to deny
hosts that aren't allowed access explicitly. Local firewall (if used)
rules are listed next.
</p><p>
Next, the script lists any SUID/SGID files and directories found on the
machine. These files should be identified and their access verified, as
they often are taken advantage of by rootkits. After that, the script
concatenates a listing of the /etc/sudoers file. Users and groups found
in the sudoers file can run as a super user (root) or any other user
defined in the file. You should take stock of these users and verify
they need sudo access.
</p><p>
Other good utilities/commands that could be added to this script,
but have been omitted due to space considerations, are ps, top, mount, route, history,
find / -perm 777 and testparm (Samba). If you use SELinux, you can run
the <tt  >getsebool -a</tt> command for confirmation of policy enforcement.
</p><p>
At the end of the script, you are prompted to copy the machine's local
password and shadow files to the /tmp/seccheck directory, so you
can transport them to the VM and perform a brute-force crack using
John the Ripper later. After the script has completed, copy or burn
the /tmp/seccheck directory to removable media for analysis on the
BackTrack VM. Boot the VM, and log in with root and use &ldquo;toor&rdquo; as the
password. After logging in, type <tt  >startx</tt> to launch KDE. Copy the seccheck
folder containing the password and shadow files from the removable
media to the VM. 
</p><p>
With the files local to the VM, let's run a brute-force
password crack to test our password policies. Brute-forcing can be time
consuming. You can speed the operation with the use of word lists, some
of which are available from the john Web site. To start the crack with a
basic brute-force, open a terminal on the VM and run the following command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
/usr/local/john/unshadow /pathtopasswdfile/passwd 
 &#8618;/pathtoshadowfile/shadow &gt; password.txt  
</pre>
</p><p>
This command combines the two files into the password.txt into a
traditional UNIX-style password file. Next, run the following command
from the terminal in your VM:

<pre     class="programlisting">
john password.txt
</pre>
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10244f2.large.jpg"><img src="10244f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Hashes and Their Plain-Text Passwords Cracked by john on BackTrack
</p></div></div><p>
john will output its results to the terminal and also write to
/usr/local/john/john.pot (Figure 2). One really nice feature of john is
the ability to restart a terminated crack. If you need to terminate john
for any reason, use Ctrl-C to end it. To resume it, type:

<pre     class="programlisting">
john --restore
</pre>
</p><p>
Within a few minutes, you should see any simple passwords displayed. More
complex passwords will take longer, based on various factors, such as
complexity, system performance and the use of word lists.
</p><p>
Regardless of when you run john, you should review the
secoutput.txt file thoroughly, document its findings and remedy any that fall short
of our defined security policies.

2. Communication Is the Key</h2></div></div><p>
The second set of locks to validate is on your network. Any
comprehensive security assessment must include validation of your network's
correct operation. There is no better way to validate this than by simple
observation. The first tool to use for this is the Wireshark network
protocol analyzer. Wireshark puts your network card in promiscuous mode
and captures any traffic broadcast on your local network segment. It may
be necessary to take samples on different parts of your network or use
span ports to get a good representation of normal traffic. 
</p><p>
To start the
program, open a terminal inside the VM and type
<tt  >wireshark</tt>. Once open,
click on the Capture menu and then on Interfaces. On the Interface options
window, click Start next to eth0 to start the capture (Figure 3). If you
use something other than the BackTrack VM to run Wireshark, you might
select a different interface. Click on the Capture menu again, and then
click Stop to end the capture. When finished, save the capture to a file. I
recommend that you take captures of no less than five minutes at random times
during the day. The capture files will be big (longer capture = bigger
file) if you have a busy network, but in my experience, five minutes is
enough for most small-to-medium networks. Scan the capture files to
identify unusual traffic, and validate any network-level policies you may
have in place. For example, many networked printers, by default, broadcast
NetBIOS for discovery on Windows networks, but you may not allow NetBIOS
traffic on your network. Captures also can help find rogue-user PCs or
VMs running without approval. Many people are surprised the first time
they run a capture. The shortcoming of captures is the time required to
analyze them. That is where our second network tool, Snort, comes in.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10244f3.large.jpg"><img src="10244f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Wireshark analyzes all the way to the packet level.
</p></div></div><p>
Snort is many things, but traditionally it's used as an intrusion-detection system (IDS). An IDS patterns network traffic against a
database of known attack signatures to alert administrators to potential
intrusions. Unlike Wireshark, Snort aggregates and analyzes the data
it collects providing a thousand-foot view of the network. When
using Snort, you should be aware of two things: IDSes are sensitive
to false positives, and they do not alert on normal traffic. Snort
is useful as an assessment tool, because it can tell you whether there are any
major problems on your network in a short amount of time.
</p><p>
The BackTrack team conveniently has packaged Snort with the BASE Web
front end in the distribution. From the KDE menu, select
Services&rarr;Snort&rarr;Setup and Initialize Snort. You will be prompted by the setup script to
enter root and Snort user passwords for MySQL in order to create the
needed tables. At the end of the script, open a Web browser and enter
http://youripaddress/base/base_db_setup.ph, and on the page that loads,
click on the Create Base AG button. Now, click on the Main Page link
(Figure 4) to access alert information. Unlike Wireshark, Snort should
be run over a longer period of time (more than 24 hours in most cases) to provide
a good sampling of network data.

3. Finding the Chink in the Armor: Vulnerability and Application
Scanners</h2></div></div><p>
The third set of locks to test is found in the operating systems and
applications on your network or, more specifically, in the vulnerabilities
that exist on them. A reasonable approach to finding these vulnerabilities
is to perform one or more broad vulnerability scans across the network,
followed by any application-specific scans for our critical apps. Let's
use the Security Administrator's Integrated Network Tool (SAINT) as our
primary scanner. 
</p><p>
SAINT normally allows only two IP addresses for scanning
for 15 days, but BackTrack users can use up to ten IP addresses for up to a
year by using the registration page found under the KDE menu:
BackTrack&rarr;Vulnerability Identification&rarr;SAINT Exploit&rarr;SAINT Exploit License. From
this Web page, click the Get License button at the bottom of the page
and provide the necessary information on the registration page. Proceed
with registration, and generate a key for use with the scanner. Once the
key has been entered on the VM, launch SAINT from the same KDE folder
as the License link, but click on the SAINT link instead. This launches
the Web front end. Click the Scan Set-Up tab. Enter the IP addresses
or range you want to scan (Figure 5). Under the Scanning Level section,
check off Exhaustive and Full Port Scan. In the Firewall section, select
No Firewall Support. You can play with any of these options to tailor
the scans to your needs. Click Scan Now at the bottom of the page when
finished. The results are displayed when the scan is finished (Figure
6). You should review and document the scan results, and wherever possible,
remediate discovered vulnerabilities.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10244f5.large.jpg"><img src="10244f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

Figure 6. Results from a SAINT Scan
</p></div></div><p>
This broad scan with SAINT should be followed up with more specific scans
against your most valuable (and therefore juicier targets) machines. As an
example, let's scan a Web server using another tool found on BackTrack,
Nikto. Nikto is a mature, simple scanning tool and an excellent resource
for locking down a Web server. Assuming you have a Web server in your
environment, launch a Nikto shell from the VM under the KDE menu
BackTrack&rarr;Penetration&rarr;All&rarr;Nikto2, and from the resulting
shell, type:

<pre     class="programlisting">
nikto.pl -h yourwebserveripaddresshere
</pre>
</p><p>
As you can see, the output is straightforward and can be redirected
to a file easily for later analysis (Figure 7). As with SAINT, you should follow
up this scan by documenting the results and fixing any discovered issues.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10244f7.large.jpg"><img src="10244f7.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27f0580.0x2bf4df8"></a>
4. Casing the Joint</h2></div></div><p>
The last lock to test is, in many cases, the first entrance into your
network, the perimeter. Let's test it by placing our VM outside the
network and then performing a network map against our publicly facing IP
address(es) to verify that only allowed services are allowed in or out
of the network. We use the time-tested Nmap application for this
role. 
</p><p>
Although Nmap is on the BackTrack VM, you need to update to the
latest version to use the handy new topology tab of the zenmap front-end
GUI. Download Nmap from the project's site, and install on the VM with
the usual <tt  >./configure, make, make install</tt> sequence. Type the command
<tt  >zenmap</tt> from a terminal to bring up the GUI. Enter a host, host range or
network as the target, select Regular Scan from the Profile drop-down
list and click on Scan. This performs a cursory scan of the host/networks
and identifies open ports and other available information about the host,
such as OS and app versions (Figures 8 and 9). Be patient; this process may take a
while. Use Nmap's results to verify that only allowed hosts and services
are accessible from the outside.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10244f8.large.jpg"><img src="10244f8.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27f0580.0x2bf5378"></a>
Let the Battle Begin</h2></div></div><p>
After running Nmap, we can start to envision how an attack against our
network might take place. Assume we can glean our network's external IPs
from public DNS or whois records. With this information, we run a network
map against those IP addresses and identify host OS and application
versions. With map results in hand, we scan said hosts for vulnerabilities
as discussed in section 3 of this article. If we are lucky, we find one and run an exploit against it
to take control of the box. If all we wanted was to own the box, mission
accomplished. But, if we wanted to own other hosts or the network, we might
begin a new map from the inside or sniff with a tool like Wireshark from
the owned box. If we passively sniff traffic instead of map, we are less
likely to set off any IDS alarms. At that point, we notice SSH traffic
to a particular machine, so we attempt to gain a remote shell against
it. Hopefully, there aren't any glaring openings in our local
configuration,
as we checked for in section 1, or we might lose another box or boxes.
</p><p>
Although this is not a standard blueprint for attack by any means, it is
a possible avenue for attack. There are too many methods, techniques,
hacks, cracks and attacks to document at length here. By performing regular
assessments like the one shown in this article, we can lower the risk of attack,
but not eliminate it. Unfortunately, it is a lot harder to play defense
than offense. The bad guys do not focus on one aspect of security
(or insecurity), and all they need is a single opening in the network,
the OS or the application to be successful. Hopefully, after sampling
the tools here, you can test your own locks and get the peace of mind that
your network, your systems and your security measures work.
