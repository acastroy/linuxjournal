<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #177, January 2009</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Tejun Heo</b></span> has expanded <span   class="bold"><b>FUSE</b></span> (Filesystem in USErspace) to allow
creating character devices as well as filesystems. He calls the new
branch of code <span   class="bold"><b>CUSE</b></span> (Character device in USErspace). Tejun's first
example application to use CUSE, however, might have been better
chosen. His sound card wasn't working so well with the ALSA drivers,
so he implemented an OSS proxy character device using CUSE. It worked
for him, which at least demonstrated the usefulness of CUSE itself,
but as <span   class="bold"><b>Adrian Bunk</b></span> pointed out, a better approach for that specific
case might have been to fix the ALSA drivers instead of emulating OSS.
On the other hand, as Tejun said, even his CUSE-based OSS
implementation would let people run old binaries that hadn't been
ported to ALSA and compile old source trees that were no longer
maintained.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Jonathan Corbet</b></span> has announced the election of several new members to
the <span   class="bold"><b>Linux Foundation Technical Advisory
Board</b></span> (TAB). <span   class="bold"><b>Kristen Carlson
Accardi</b></span>, <span   class="bold"><b>James Bottomley</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>Dave Jones</b></span>, <span   class="bold"><b>Chris
Mason</b></span> and <span   class="bold"><b>Chris Wright</b></span>
will each serve for two years, and <span   class="bold"><b>Christoph
Hellwig</b></span> will serve for
one year. Christoph replaces <span   class="bold"><b>Olaf Kirch</b></span>, who resigned recently. The
vote actually was split between Christoph and <span   class="bold"><b>Theodore T'so</b></span>, so the
folks decided by a coin toss.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>BtrFS</b></span> seems to have been selected as the filesystem of the future by a
number of influential kernel folks, including Theodore T'so. This was
partially the result of back-room discussions about the need for a
&ldquo;next-generation&rdquo; filesystem for Linux, and about which of the
available options it might be. BtrFS, thus, has gained the focused
attention of a wide-ranging group of developers and companies
(including <span   class="bold"><b>HP</b></span>, <span   class="bold"><b>Oracle</b></span>, <span   class="bold"><b>IBM</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>Intel</b></span> and <span   class="bold"><b>Red
Hat</b></span>), and we can expect
its development to proceed along carefully considered lines. We 
also can expect BtrFS to be accepted into the main-line kernel tree fairly
quickly, even though it hasn't yet stabilized, as part of an effort to
recruit a wider body of users and contributors. <span   class="bold"><b>Andrew Morton</b></span> supports
this plan, and <span   class="bold"><b>Linus Torvalds</b></span>' new policy of favoring early merges in
general seems to support it as well. However, folks like Adrian Bunk
caution that the code may not be ready yet, and that merging it into the
main tree may not get the users and developers that folks expect.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>David Vrabel</b></span> has created a git repository
for the <span   class="bold"><b>Ultra-Wideband (UWB)
radio</b></span>, <span   class="bold"><b>Certified Wireless USB</b></span>
(WUSB) and <span   class="bold"><b>WiMedia LLC Protocol</b></span> (WLP)
subsystems that he maintains, and he made some motions to get the code
accepted into the main kernel tree. At the time he did this, it wasn't
100% clear whether he was submitting the code right then or looking for
final feedback before submission. But one way or the other, it does
seem as though the code will be going into the kernel soon.
</p><p>
In a step along the road to running multiple operating systems on a
single machine at the same time, <span   class="bold"><b>Yu Zhao</b></span> has written code to allow
those various OSes to share the same PCI device during concurrent
operation. This <span   class="bold"><b>single-root I/O
virtualization</b></span> (SR-IOV) is part of a
general trend of allowing very different operating systems to coexist
productively, almost as different subsystems of an overarching OS,
that may in time come to communicate with each other and rely on each
other in more and more integrated ways.

<h2 class="title">eyeOS: Clouds for the Crowd</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Doc Searls</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #177, January 2009</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Cloud computing from the likes of Google and Amazon has become quite the
rage in the last few years. Nick Carr's <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Big Switch</em></span> and other works
have pointed toward a future of &ldquo;utility&rdquo; computing where we'll all use
hosted apps and storage, thanks to the &ldquo;scale&rdquo; provided by big back-end
companies and their giant hardware and software farms. But, there also
has been pushback. Most notable among the nay-sayers is Richard M. Stallman,
who calls it &ldquo;worse than stupidity&rdquo; and &ldquo;a trap&rdquo;.
</p><p>
At issue is control. Of Web apps, RMS says, &ldquo;It's just as bad as using a
proprietary program. Do your own computing on your own computer with your
copy of a freedom-respecting program. If you use a proprietary program or
somebody else's Web server, you're defenseless. You're putty in the hands
of whoever developed that software.&rdquo;
</p><p>
We wrote about it on-line at LinuxJournal.com, and among the many comments
was one that pointed to eyeOS: a cloud computing approach by which people
can make their own clouds: &ldquo;...all you need is a Web server that supports
PHP and OpenOffice.org to get the most out of the included office
suite&rdquo;, the
commenter said. &ldquo;It's cloud computing, but at the same time you still have
control over your data.&rdquo;
</p><p>
eyeOS is based in Barcelona, and obviously, it doesn't believe you need to be a
Google or anyone special to run a &ldquo;cloud&rdquo; Web service environment. Unlike
Google's cloud, you don't need to run the eyeOS's hosted apps. You can
upload your own or choose ones from eyeOS or other developers. The UI is a
virtual desktop, inside a browser (just as with Google), and the initial
suite of apps are the straightforward set you'd expect, plus many more.
These come with user ratings and a very active set of forums for
developers and users.
</p><p>
eyeOS is a commercial company, privately held (and debt-free, it says).
Its business model is service and support. If you need help installing
eyeOS or adapting apps for your company, they're available.

I worry about the idea of trying to centralize everything. The Washington
tactic is, when there's a problem, you appoint a czar, and the czar is
responsible. It's like the War on Drugs or the War on Poverty. But it
never quite works; you don't get very good solutions.

<h2 class="title">Tribler: BitTorrent and Beyond</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Doc Searls</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #177, January 2009</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
P2P (peer-to-peer) is the nature of the Net. You can fight that, or you
can embrace it. Here in the US, the mainstream entertainment business has
mostly been fighting it. Hollywood and its phone and cable company allies
have long regarded P2P, and BitTorrent in particular, as a copyright piracy
system and a bandwidth hog. In the European Union, however, P2P is more
than accepted: it's supported by the Union itself.
</p><p>
Early last year, the EU granted 14 million euros to P2P-Next, a consortium of
21 media companies and universities, including the BBC, Delft University of
Technology, the European Broadcasting Union, Lancaster University,
Markenfilm, Pioneer Digital Design Centre Limited and VTT Technical
Research Centre of Finland. The purpose of the grant is &ldquo;to develop a
Europe-wide 'next-generation' Internet television distribution system,
based on P2P and social interaction&rdquo;. (An additional 5 million euros is also
being donated by some of the P2P-Next partners, for a total of 19
million euros.) The project has a four-year span and will include technical
trials of new media applications on many devices.
</p><p>
&ldquo;Everything we're doing is based on open source&rdquo;, says Johan Pouwelse,
PhD, scientific director of P2P-Next and Assistant Professor of Computer
Science at Delft. The good doctor also runs P2P-Next's first trial
application: Tribler (pronounced &ldquo;tribe-ler&rdquo;), a BitTorrent-based client
with no servers and a &ldquo;zero-cost&rdquo; business model. Tribler provides an
all-in-one way to find, consume and share media.
</p><p>
But Tribler goes beyond BitTorrent to support live streaming and other
enhancements. The project's Research page lists 26 allied development
projects, including six that are already completed and operational. If
you're looking to help media evolve past the TV model, there's a rich pile
of possibilities on the Tribler project list.
</p><p>
The Tribler download page lists two Linux sources: Ubuntu Linux and
&ldquo;GNU+Linux/Source&rdquo;.

<h2 class="title">What They're Using: Tom Limoncelli</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Doc Searls</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #177, January 2009</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
I first met Tom Limoncelli on a cold January day in Burlington, Vermont,
where he was a volunteer geek at the Howard Dean campaign headquarters. I
was extremely impressed not only by his technical know-how, but by his
real-world wisdom about where technology and humanity intersect.
</p><p>
At the time, Tom was coming out with his first book, <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Practice of System
and Network Administration</em></span>, cowritten with Christine Hogan.
Since then, he
also has written <span   class="emphasis"><em>Time Management for System
Administrators</em></span> for O'Reilly.
</p><p>
These days, Tom works as a System Administration Manager for Google in New
York. Although he wrangles many platforms, he remains a devoted Linux user and
advocate. Here's how he runs down what he's using right now:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
The bumper sticker on my car reads, &ldquo;My other computer is a massive Linux
cluster!&rdquo; It's true. At Google, we use massive clusters of Linux boxes for
our Web services and nearly everything else too. (The actual number of
computers is a company secret.) Once I used MapReduce (Google's parallel
scheduling system) just to copy a database (each machine copied less than
1% of the total rows). In our remote offices, we deploy small Xen clusters
and manage them with Ganeti (a package we recently open-sourced). The Xen
clusters run Ubuntu, as does my desktop and one of my laptops. My phone
runs Android, which is also Linux.
</p><p>
Since all my data is on servers, I can do all my work with an SSH client
and a Web browser. My documents are all in Web-based office applications,
and thanks to &ldquo;Gears&rdquo;, they work whether or not I'm connected to the network. My
preferred SSH client is OpenSSH with an old-school xterm, but Mac OS X's
Terminal app is winning me over. My favorite Web browser is Chrome, but I
use Firefox as a close second. When I use Windows, I immediately install
Cygwin's OpenSSH and rxvt to reduce the pain.
</p><p>
I cowrote my first book using vim, CVS, make and teTeX. My next book was
written using vim and Subversion. Now I'm moving everything to Git. Even
for solo projects, I can't live without a source code repository on a safe,
backup'd, server.
</p><p>
I couldn't live without screen, rsync, wget and curl. I think more system
administrators should use make to maintain servers as I described in
<span   class="emphasis"><em>TM4SA</em></span>.
I program in Python at work, Perl at home, and awk so much it makes younger
sysadmins cry. I also love cat, tee, sed, grep, bc, mount, man, date, cal,
ftp and ping...but doesn't everyone?
</p><p>
When people ask me, &ldquo;When will Linux be usable by a typical
grandmother?&rdquo;, I
reply, &ldquo;She uses Linux every time she uses Google! So there!&rdquo;
</p></blockquote></div><p>
