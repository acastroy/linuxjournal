&ldquo;We will encourage you to develop the three great virtues of a programmer:
laziness, impatience, and hubris.&rdquo;&mdash;Larry Wall,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Programming Perl</em></span>
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21f6580.0x22ee300"></a></h2></div></div><p>
For most programmers, deployment is an area that could do with a touch
of laziness. Deploying to a cluster&mdash;or even one machine&mdash;can
be
repetitive and tiring.
Enter Capistrano, a Ruby deployment tool that makes the task of deploying
an application to servers easier by running defined tasks for you on
the remote servers.
</p><p>
The Ruby programmers' toolbox contains so many tools for eliminating most
of their work, it's fair to say that Ruby programmers are probably some 
of the laziest. If having all the boring jobs done for you isn't enough,
Ruby programmers even contrive to have most of their tools built in one
language&mdash;Ruby. No bash-make-PHP-Perl combinations. It's all Ruby.
</p><p>
Think of Capistrano as a build system that specializes in running
commands remotely on any number of machines. If you have to connect to
a half-dozen machines to push updates, or have no quick-and-easy
way of rolling back the entire cluster if (or when?) something goes
wrong, you need to be a little more lazy.
</p><p>
Capistrano groups tasks in recipes, and the default recipe, which we'll
look at in a moment, is very geared toward Rails, running migrations
and restarting the Rails server. However, Capistrano's core is not
Rails-specific. You can build your own recipes for all your dullest tasks,
and you can tweak the Rails recipe to work with whichever language or
framework you're using.
</p><p>
Let's take a look at what Capistrano does for Rails deployment, how
to build your own tasks and how to push your own application out to 20
servers with just one command.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21f6580.0x22ee670"></a>
Capistrano and Rails</h2></div></div><p>
Like Rails, Capistrano increasingly is deployed with flavours of Linux
and is installed by default in Leopard, so you might not even have to
install it. If you do need to, installing Capistrano is as easy as
any Ruby gem. Simply run:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo gem install -y capistrano
</pre>
</p><p>
Capistrano has two main commands: cap, which is used for viewing and
running the tasks, and capify, which is used to set up a Rails project
for use with Capistrano. Assuming you have a Rails project, grab a copy
of it, and run capify at the project root:

<pre     class="programlisting">
cd path/to/project capify .
</pre>
</p><p>
This creates just two files: Capfile and config/deploy.rb. Capfile
is to Capistrano as Makefile is to make and Rakefile is to rake.
Capistrano expects a Capfile to be present and to contain the tasks or
to include a Ruby file that does.
</p><p>
In this case, the Capfile just includes config/deploy.rb, so the latter
is the one of interest. The deploy file contains a bunch of settings
you need to take care of before running cap, starting with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
set :application, "set your application name here"
set :repository,  "set your repository location here"
</pre>
</p><p>
If you aren't used to Ruby's syntax, this all will look deceptively
like simple configuration. However, because you don't have to use
brackets when calling functions in Ruby, each line actually is a call to
the set() function in Capistrano's core:

<pre     class="programlisting">
set(:application, "your-app-name")
</pre>
</p><p>
Set the :application variable to a name without spaces&mdash;this will be
used to create a deployment directory later. Set :repository to your
versioning repository's URL (in this example, we use SVN).
</p><p>
If you have a user name and password for SVN, set them with the lines:

<pre     class="programlisting">
set :scm_username, "svn-username" 
set :scm_password, "svn-password" 
</pre>
</p><p>
Then, uncomment and set the deployment directory. If the deploy_to
doesn't exist on your deployment server, Capistrano creates it:

<pre     class="programlisting">
set :deploy_to, "/path/to/doc/root/www/#{application}"
</pre>
</p><p>
Here, we're using the application variable we set previously to set part
of the deploy_to variable. This is all standard Ruby syntax, available
in all Capistrano scripts, making this way of working extremely powerful
and a little less cumbersome than a hodge-podge of obscure syntaxes.
</p><p>
Finally, we need to set the servers that will host the deployment. You
can add as many servers as you like, and the server name just has to
be something that SSH understands&mdash;for example:

<pre     class="programlisting">
role :app, "app-server-1", "app-server-2", "app-server-3"
role :web, "192.168.1.123"
role :db,  "db-server-1", :primary =&gt; true
</pre>
</p><p>
If you're just testing out Capistrano, it's worth setting the
deployment location as your working machine; that way, you can learn without
moving between machines:

<pre     class="programlisting">
role :app, "me@my-local-ip"
</pre>
</p><p>
Now we're ready to ask Capistrano to set up the deployment location using
the command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
cap deploy:setup
</pre>
</p><p>
When you run this, Capistrano starts showing you what it's doing. This
helps when debugging Capfiles, and it reassures you that you're doing the
right thing. Whenever you connect to another server, you'll be prompted
for the password, as usual, after which Capistrano will run a bunch of
other commands.
</p><p>
After deploy:setup, the deployment directory now contains some extra
directories that will allow cap to push new versions, do rollbacks and
so on:

<pre     class="programlisting">
myapp/
      releases/ shared/log shared/pids shared/system
</pre>
</p><p>
Next, we get on and deploy the application. Capistrano will check out
the source, put it into releases and create a symlink to it called
current:

<pre     class="programlisting">
cap deploy:cold
</pre>
</p><p>
After this has run, take another look in the deployment location:


<pre     class="programlisting">
# current@ -&gt; /www/captest/myapp/releases/20080614144520
</pre>
</p><p>
This a &ldquo;cold&rdquo; deployment, meaning tasks that are one-time tasks are
run. To deploy the application in the future, you simply use the deploy
task:

<pre     class="programlisting">
cap deploy
</pre>
</p><p>
When you've run either deploy:cold or deploy, have a look in
the deployment directory and find where your source code fits into
Capistrano's way of deploying things.
</p><p>
The deploy task replaces logging in to the server, getting the source,
setting up any databases and restarting the servers. Run it a few times,
and get used to that lazy feeling!
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21f6580.0x22ef328"></a>
Finding More</h2></div></div><p>
To deploy our application, we used only
<tt  >deploy:setup</tt>, <tt  >deploy:cold</tt>
and <tt  >deploy</tt>. The recipe has a lot more in it. To see all the available
tasks, run:

<pre     class="programlisting">
cap -Tv
</pre>
</p><p>
Much like <tt  >rake -T</tt>, this lists all the tasks with their documentation. If
you've run <tt  >deploy</tt> a few times, play with either of the 
<tt  >rollback</tt> or <tt  >rollback_code</tt>
tasks.
</p><p>
Each time you roll back, Capistrano simply points the symlink to the previous
deployment's directory. Rollbacks can be run repeatedly until you find
the stable version you want:

<pre     class="programlisting">
cap deploy:rollback_code
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21f6580.0x22ef7f8"></a>
Your Own Tasks</h2></div></div><p>
Once you get Capistrano working on a Rails project, it's easy to see how
it could help make your life really lazy. The same kind of tasks that
wrap around Rails-specific commands can contain pretty much any command.
</p><p>
When you run Capistrano tasks, like deploy, you'll see various SSH
commands and responses scroll by. If you have several servers, the
responses will come back from multiple servers as Capistrano runs your
tasks across as many machines as you need.
</p><p>
The potential uses of this are huge&mdash;checking disk space, copying live
data from clusters and running maintenance tasks&mdash;so how can we build
our own tasks?
</p><p>
Tasks in Capistrano are defined with the following syntax:

<pre     class="programlisting">
desc "Short description here..."
task :name_of_function, :roles =&gt; :servers do
        # tasks is in here...
end
</pre>
</p><p>
Ruby's elegant syntax often makes things confusingly simple, so let's
pick it apart. The first line provides some documentation that is output
when you run the following on the command line (still from the root of
your project):

<pre     class="programlisting">
cap -Tv
</pre>
</p><p>
Ruby can cope without brackets when calling functions, so the second
line actually is a call to Capistrano's task function.
</p><p>
The first argument is the new task's name (name_of_function). The second
is the set of machines on which the task will be run; this can be either
:servers, :app, :db or any other collection of servers you have.
</p><p>
The last part, starting at do, is an anonymous function, which means that
everything between do and end is executed when your task is run. You
may have come across anonymous functions in JavaScript.
</p><p>
A very simple task would be to run <tt  >df -h</tt> on the remote servers to
check on disk space. This isn't going to change anything on your servers,
so you should feel safe running it:

<pre     class="programlisting">
desc "Check disk space"
task :diskspace, :roles =&gt; :servers do
        run 'df -h'
end
</pre>
</p><p>
The run function simply runs the command on the remote servers. You
can replace this with sudo, which also does what it sounds like&mdash;runs
remote commands under sudo:

<pre     class="programlisting">
desc "Who hasn't been cleaning out their home directories?"
task :home_disk_usage, :roles =&gt; :servers do
        sudo 'du -sh /home/*'
end
</pre>
</p><p>
If you have capified a project as we did on the Rails project in the
previous section, you even can add your own custom tasks to the standard
Rails recipe and change the behaviour of the Rails recipe itself. This
lets you get Capistrano working just as you need it to work, and it's is good for
those commands you never can remember how to run!
</p><p>
To add your own tasks to a capified Rails project, add them to
config/deploy.rb using the task syntax described above. Once you have
added a task, run <tt  >cap -Tv</tt> to check whether your task
was found, and then
run the task as you would any other.
</p><p>
Tasks can call each other just like functions can, so complex tasks
can be broken down into simple tasks that will keep your custom
Capistrano recipes &ldquo;DRY&rdquo;. Tasks can call each other using the normal
Rails function call:

<pre     class="programlisting">
task :home_disk_usage, :roles =&gt; :servers do
        vhosts_disk_usage
        run "ls /home/"
end
</pre>
</p><p>
You'll probably want your customised tasks to know the location in the
filesystem where your project is being deployed. This is a matter of using
the configuration variables we set right at the beginning, which can be
done using the Ruby syntax:

<pre     class="programlisting">
run "tar czf ~/snapshot.tgz #{release_path}"
</pre>
</p><p>
If you need additional variables, you can set them using the same syntax
as before:

<pre     class="programlisting">
set :foo, "bar"
</pre>
</p><p>
Alternatively, you can prompt the user for the variables by using the
set function, but with a slightly different usage:

<pre     class="programlisting">
set(:deploy_version) do
        Capistrano::CLI.ui.ask "What version is this? "
end
</pre>
</p><p>
The variables are used in the same way, no matter which method is used
to set them.
</p><p>
All this Ruby should start falling into place, and by this point, you'll
start thinking of Capistrano as a Ruby framework rather than a standalone
application or script. If Ruby is new to you, keep going&mdash;it'll start
dropping into place soon.
</p><p>
Finally, it's nice to keep things neat as well as DRY. All of the Rails
recipes are found in the deploy namespace, which you'll notice when
you run <tt  >cap -Tv</tt>. Namespaces allow you to group tasks
together, and this
can be done by wrapping the tasks in the namespace command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
namespace :our_tasks do
  desc "The default task"
  task :default do
    restart
end
  
  desc "Empty logs"
  task :empty_logs do
        # ...
  end
end
</pre>
</p><p>
When you run <tt  >cap -Tv</tt>, you'll see these neatly grouped:

<pre     class="programlisting">
cap our_tasks            # The default task
cap our_tasks:empty_logs # Empty logs
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21f6580.0x26e8758"></a>
Customising the Rails Recipe</h2></div></div><p>
Making new Capistrano tasks is straightforward, but the Rails recipe we
used earlier probably contains 90% or more of what you need. In this case,
it's best to customise the recipe rather than create one from scratch. We
can do this by overriding specific tasks to customise the corresponding
behaviour of the recipe.
</p><p>
I discovered this when trying Capistrano on our internal makefiles, which
is where I
do most of our code file management, database versioning and installation
configuration loads. We use these for pretty much everything that
isn't committing or editing files, so the idea that we also could deploy
really quickly using Capistrano was just too tempting.
</p><p>
If you've read this far but are thinking, &ldquo;cool, but we're not about to
migrate to Rails&rdquo;, customisation will make sense for you because
you can override the tasks that try to do Rails-specific things.
</p><p>
First, try <tt  >capify</tt> on a non-Rails project, but make sure you have a
config/ directory where capify can put its deploy.rb file. Once capify
has run, you can start trying the various <tt  >cap deploy</tt> tasks we did above,
but it all goes wrong when Capistrano starts whining about the Rails
server not being present and about a Rakefile not being present.
</p><p>
This is because one of the tasks, <tt  >deploy:restart</tt>, tries to restart
the Rails server. Another of the tasks tries to run <tt  >rake
db:migrate</tt>. Your
project probably will support neither of these, so you should override
it by adding the following to config/deploy.rb:

<pre     class="programlisting">
desc "Do nothing"
deploy.task :restart, :roles =&gt; :app do
  # ...do what you like here... 
end
</pre>
</p><p>
Intuitively, this is overriding the restart task in the deploy
namespace, and everything inside the task (everything from do to end)
can be edited as normal. You might want to restart your Apache server
instead of the Rails server:

<pre     class="programlisting">
desc "Do nothing"
deploy.task :restart, :roles =&gt; :app do
        sudo '/etc/init.d/restart'
end
</pre>
</p><p>
When you run <tt  >cap deploy:cold</tt>, the Rails migrations are run to create
the database. We override this to run our equivalent, which is:

<pre     class="programlisting">
deploy.task :migrate, :roles =&gt; :app do
        run "make data"
end
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21f6580.0x26e8d88"></a>
Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Capistrano provides a really simple way of deploying an application. It
also can be used for anything involving remote servers: monitoring,
arbitrary tasks, creating ad hoc backups and so on.
</p><p>
Thanks to Ruby's elegance, Capistrano can be extended in pretty much
every way. The Rails recipe can be honed for non-Rails applications,
and adding whole new recipes involves very little Ruby knowledge.
</p><p>
Finally, to make things even quicker, use SSH identities so you
don't even have to log in to the remote servers. If you want to keep
your identities somewhere nonstandard, simply add the following to your
deploy.rb file:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ssh_options[:keys] = "/path/to/identity_file" 
</pre>
</p><p>
This way, you can deploy your app using <tt  >cap deploy</tt>
and nothing else&mdash;now you really can master laziness.
