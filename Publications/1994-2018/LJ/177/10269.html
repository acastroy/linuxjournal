New Subscriber Love
</h4><p>
I just got my first issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>, and I must say I'm floored. In
fact, I suddenly caught myself getting nostalgic, because there I was,
reading code in a computer magazine&mdash;I haven't done that since the
eighties! It gave me a great idea though. What if there was a regular
column that looked just at programming techniques? For inspiration, look
no further than columns written by the legendary Commodore guru, Jim
Butterfield. Or, how cool would it be to feature complete program listings
the readers could type in or download, just like the days of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>COMPUTE!</em></span>
magazine? Only now, of course, instead of being written in Apple or
Commodore Basic, it could focus on Python and Pygame, or C++ and Gtkmm.
Perhaps some well-known open-source developers would even enjoy stepping
through parts of their code they are particularly proud of, and explaining
how it works.
</p><p>
I certainly enjoy the features in the magazine focusing on the
enterprise side of the Linux world, but I'd also love to see a celebration
of the sheer joy of coding.
</p><p>
Anyway, thanks for a great magazine! My only dilemma now is whether to
read <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> or <span   class="emphasis"><em>Tape Op</em></span> first.

In his August 2008 column, Dave Taylor uses the following line:

<pre     class="programlisting">
pickline="$(expr $(( $RANDOM % 250 )) + 1 )"
</pre>
</p><p>
Although that code is not wrong, I prefer this simpler line:

<pre     class="programlisting">
pickline=$(($RANDOM % 250 + 1))

I was noticing that <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> has been doing more software articles than in
the past and that was the reason I renewed this last month. When I received
the programming language issue [October 2008] I thought, &ldquo;Yes! Finally an issue about
languages.&rdquo; I even thought, &ldquo;I'm going to write them to say
thanks.&rdquo; And,
then I noticed someone had written in requesting more hardware
articles. I guess it's hard to please us all, eh? Keep it up (but please
don't forget about the languages!).

</p><a name="N0xfb5580.0x10adeb0"></a><h4 class="title"><a name="N0xfb5580.0x10adeb0"></a>Compression Algorithms</h4><p>
The Tech Tip on page 72 in the November 2008 <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> uses tar and netcat to copy a
directory tree between systems, but the specific command options are
often painfully slow on a LAN. The bottleneck is that the gzip
compression chosen (tar -z) executes slowly.
</p><p>
It is preferable to choose the compression algorithm according to the
network and processor speed. Selecting faster but less efficient
algorithms, like lzop, can speed up the transfer for fast connections,
while slow but effective compression, like lzma, is preferred for very
slow networks.
</p><p>
As a test, I used this Tech Tip with various compression options to
transfer 4.6GB from an old server (2.6GHz P4-HT) able to read the ext3
files at about 30Mb/s with a gigabit network able to tcp at about
85Mb/s.
</p><p>
The commands used are:


<pre     class="programlisting">
[server] tar $TAR_OPT -cpsf - $dir | pv -b | nc -l 3333
[client] nc server 3333 | pv -b | tar $TAR_OPT -xpsf -
</pre>
</p><p>
Results using these options:

<pre     class="programlisting">
TAR_OPT="-z"
TAR=OPT="--use-compress-program=lzop"
TAR=OPT=""
</pre>
</p><p>
are, respectively:

<pre     class="programlisting">
gzip    time 679sec, rate 6.38  MBPS
lzop    time 357sec, rate 12.15 MBPS
(none)  time 160sec, rate 27.15 MBPS
</pre>
</p><p>
Here, the network is faster than filesystem I/O, so any compression slows
the transfer. For these systems, I calculate that lzop would be
helpful below a 62Mb/s network speed and gzip below 4Mb/s.
These breakpoints would increase if the computers could compress and
decompress faster.
</p><p>
I couldn't bring myself to test lzma, as it is many times slower than
gzip, but it may be useful for dial-up transfer.
</p><p>
For a fine comparison of compression algorithms, see the September 2005

Mr. Bonny's letter [&ldquo;It's a Vendor Thing&rdquo;,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>, November 2008] raises the hackles of us Linux
enthusiasts. Still, he raises important issues.
</p><p>
Despite claims to the contrary, Linux driver support is on par with
Windows and is radically superior to OS X.
However, most new users are used to buying a computer with an OS
pre-installed and configured and
trivially installing vendor-supplied drivers for any widgets they add.
</p><p>
Installing Linux is vastly improved today, and in most instances, it is
far easier than installing Windows.
But, very rarely do people install Windows themselves anymore.
Installing third-party hardware is substantially more challenging.
</p><p>
Googling &ldquo;3 mobile broadband linux&rdquo; seems to suggest that there is
Linux support, and I would be shocked if there was not Linux support for Mr
Bonny's 56K modem.
This does not mean getting hardware working that does not have out-of-the-box support from your Linux distribution 
is inside the skill set of ordinary users.
</p><p>
No OS is perfect. I run Linux on my PowerBook because the internal
NIC failed, and I could not find a supported add-on card.
I regularly inherit often fairly new &ldquo;broken&rdquo; Windows laptops. Virus
infections, spyware, conflicting software installs and flaky hardware
drivers have resulted in slow and unstable operation. In all instances,
a clean re-install restores them to like-new operations. In extremely
rare instances, Linux systems suffer the same problems. And in most cases,
the problems can be cleaned up, but few Windows machines go 18 months
without requiring a clean re-install.
</p><p>
Unfortunately, Mr Bonny and many other users need the skills of a
Linux guru and extraordinary vendor support to configure Linux for their
needs.
But, the payoff is a system that will be more robust. Further, a few
months of using Linux regularly inevitably will result in developing a
dependence on features that do not exist elsewhere.
</p><p>
Viruses, spyware, corrupted registries, flaky drivers and dll
conflicts are of no interest to most Windows users who typically solve
those problems by buying new systems.

On page 51 of the November 2008 issue, Daniel Bartholomew writes that he mapped
the IP address of his Popcorn device using his /etc/resolv.conf file. I'm
guessing that he meant using his local /etc/hosts file to map the name to
the IP?

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Jonathan Miner  <br><br>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Daniel Bartholomew replies:</b></span> You are correct. This looks like a case of my
mind thinking one thing
and my fingers typing something completely different. Thanks for
catching it!
</p><a name="N0xfb5580.0x10a5920"></a><h4 class="title"><a name="N0xfb5580.0x10a5920"></a>Thanks for the HPC Articles</h4><p>
As a number-crunching scientist who has used Linux daily since 1994, let me
thank you for two excellent articles in the November 2008 issue: Michael
Wolfe's article on GPGPUs and Joey Bernard's article on Python for
scientific computing. There is more to Linux than Web 2.0.
</p><p>
That said, I have a minor quibble with Joey Bernard's matrix
multiplication example using numpy. By default, numpy objects are arrays,
not matrices. So a1*a2 in his example is an element-by-element array
multiplication, not a matrix multiplication. To get the result he intended,
Joey either should have created explicit matrix objects or used a3 =
numpy.dot(a1,a2) or a3 = mat(a1)*mat(a2).
</p><p>
That minor criticism aside, can we have more articles like Joey's and
Michael's please!

</p><a name="N0xfb5580.0x10a5c90"></a><h4 class="title"><a name="N0xfb5580.0x10a5c90"></a>Array Multiplication</h4><p>
Joey Bernard's article &ldquo;Use Python for Scientific Computing&rdquo;,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>, November 2008, is a valuable introduction, and it prompted
me to compare Python versus my own language, experix. The most
important feature of experix that (as far as I know) is not
found elsewhere is the detailed exposure of the kernel device
driver interface to user command input. In my lab at Washington
University, we are using experix to perform device control and
data acquisition on instruments with piezoelectric and stepper
motors; to analyze and archive the data; to perform analytic
and Monte-Carlo simulations of fluorescence intensity
distributions; and to fit photon count records from a Zeiss
ConfoCor system to particle distribution models.
</p><p>
I find Bernard's exe times for array multiplication highly
questionable. The time for unoptimized C is close to what I get
on my Pentium laptop, but the other times (for -O3 and Python)
are preposterous unless it was done with massive parallel
processing.
</p><p>
Here is a very contrived experix example, demonstrating most of
what Bernard did with Python plus some other things, and written
in a way that fits in a 40-character column for printing. For
info and downloads, see

</p><a name="N0xfb5580.0x10a61b8"></a><h4 class="title"><a name="N0xfb5580.0x10a61b8"></a>Democratic Utopia?</h4><p>
In the November 2008 issue, Doc Searls writes about how technology can finally
bring us to some democratic utopia. I think that nothing could be further
from the truth. I believe de Tocqueville coined the phrase &ldquo;tyranny of the
majority&rdquo; to describe the almost certain results.
</p><p>
For evidence, just look at current events. Huge numbers of folks (very
likely a majority) have no problem with a presidential candidate who
announces his plan on the first day in office to shut down opponents on
talk radio. No problem at all. &ldquo;The People&rdquo;, as it were, are
too easily
swayed and too easily deceived.
</p><p>
As a member of a number of minorities, such as &ldquo;bicycle
commuters&rdquo;,
&ldquo;private pilots&rdquo;, &ldquo;skiers&rdquo;, &ldquo;EEs&rdquo;,
&ldquo;tax-payers&rdquo;, &ldquo;non-smokers who think
smokers should be able to smoke&rdquo; and numerous others, I'm painfully aware
that I'm always at the mercy of the majority as it is. The idea that at
any moment, some democratic good-will impulse will cut out another little
freedom is all too real. When democracy starts to turn into populism and
nationalism, history has shown that things always turn ugly.
</p><p>
I bet that a large number of readers, if not a majority, already view the
phrase &ldquo;tax the rich&rdquo; with joyous enthusiasm. It gives me a cold chill.
To me, the rich are entitled to their riches. I'd like to join them some
day. The idea that they are some minority that we should milk for our
benefit is an assault on liberty. It means that we no longer have the
thirst for equality and justice that once wrote our Constitution.
</p><p>
One can ask what the solution is. I would say a little less democracy and
a lot more education&mdash;the kind that is no longer taught in our public
schools. A little more Adam Smith, and a lot less Karl Marx. Uneducated
people historically vote themselves into a kind of servitude.
</p><p>
I do agree that more openness in government is a good thing. Politicians
all too often hide behind layers of legalese and obfuscation. But Whitman's
ode to democracy is downright scary. Politics 24/7? Every
interaction governed by the masses? Please, no. Just keep every bill to a
page or two of actual English.
</p><p>
I really don't want to be involved in every nit that needs to be picked,
and I really don't want the government to be picking nits anyway. What I
want government to worry about are the big things that folks can't do
individually. Things that people wiser than myself can handle. Take care of
it and don't bother me is my utopia. I'll take a little more wisdom and
liberty, and a lot less democracy, anytime.
