Ever since its inception, the Linux space has been full of contention. From the
initial Minix vs. Linux debates to GNOME vs. KDE to distribution
holy wars, it seems for any Linux question, people with strong
opinions are willing to join the flame fest. In this column, we throw
a little fuel on the fire with an article dedicated to promoting two
conflicting points of view. This month, Bill Childers and Kyle Rankin tackle
an issue near and dear to their hearts&mdash;small laptops vs. large laptops.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> I have always been a fan of small laptops. When I look back, I was
probably first inspired by Penny's computer book on <span   class="emphasis"><em>Inspector
Gadget</em></span>. My
very first laptop was a Toshiba Libretto 50CT&mdash;a 75MHz mini-laptop about
the size of a VHS tape (those of you who remember 75MHz computers should
also remember what a VHS tape is, and for the rest of you, there's always
Wikipedia). Ever since the Libretto, all of my laptops have had 10.6"
screens or smaller, and that is my personal standard for a small laptop. I
just don't understand the current trend of 15"&ndash;17" Sport Utility Laptops
(SULs). Some of these SULs are almost of the size of those luggable
computers of yesteryear&mdash;so big you have to get a special bag to
carry them, and so big that most vendors hesitate to refer to them as
<span   class="emphasis"><em>lap</em></span>tops and call them notebook computers instead. For
me, a true laptop should be extremely portable and should have excellent
battery life.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Bill:</b></span> I used to like small laptops, but then I got better. I had
an HP200LX palmtop for a long time&mdash;it was the only portable PC I
could afford. That thing had an 80186 running at 8MHz and ran on two
AA batteries. It had CGA graphics and was the epitome of cool. Then I
stepped into the modern era and started getting systems that would let
me do actual work. A system with a 15" or 17" screen isn't a luggable
unless you're a little girly-man. It's a system that's capable of doing
anything from standard office tasks to CAD work to playing the latest
and greatest 3-D games&mdash;all the power of a desktop PC, except I can hang
out on the couch. Or in my hammock. What's wrong with that?
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Kyle:</b></span> I wouldn't call what Bill has a &ldquo;laptop&rdquo; until he has someone
else's lap beside him. I heard he has a Mac cube too. It's pretty sad
when your desktop is smaller than your laptop.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Bill:</b></span> Hey, have you seen me lately? It fits on my ever-increasing
lap. Let's see you do any kind of graphics on that single-lung Yugo
of a computer. Yeah, that's what I thought. It's also nice to have
the added heat-generating capacity of the larger laptop in the winter
months. Just put a kid by each exhaust fan and no more complaining
about being cold. And, no jokes about <span   class="emphasis"><em>Star Wars</em></span> or
&ldquo;exhaust ports&rdquo;,
please. It's not the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Death Star</em></span>.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Kyle:</b></span> That's no laptop, it's a space station. Sure, he may be able to play
video games made in the 21st century, but you should see him deathmatch
with me in <span   class="emphasis"><em>Quake III</em></span>. Anyway, when his laptop's battery runs out a few
seconds after booting, he hits the escape latch, and my laptop pops out
like a pod full of droids from the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Death Star</em></span>. One advantage to my small
laptop is I don't need a suitcase to carry it around. I use a nice, small
vinyl case made for a portable DVD player. Okay, so it looks like a man
purse, but it's small all the same.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Bill:</b></span> I don't need a suitcase. It fits in a backpack. Okay, the backpack
has an aluminum frame, but that's just for decoration. Hmm, yours cost the
same as mine, yet mine can do twice as much work as yours. Who got the
better value? And, I get a workout when carrying it as a bonus. Besides,
when a server falls on my bag, the aluminum frame lets my computer just
shrug it off like an NFL lineman. What happened when a server fell on
your laptop, Kyle?
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Kyle:</b></span> Wow. That was below the belt. Too soon, man, too soon. You don't
have to worry about servers hurting your laptop, because when they fall
near it, the laptop's gravitational pull causes the server to orbit
it. You can get an inexpensive tiny laptop too. So what if its specs
are the same as your BlackBerry? It can run a Web browser. Don't get
me wrong, I can see some advantages to having Bill's laptop on my lap,
but right now, I'd like to keep my sperm count where it is.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Bill:</b></span> Hey, that's not an issue, I've had my kids. Plus, I have 4GB of
RAM in my system. I may not use all 4GB, but it's nice to know I have it
on tap should I decide that I need it. How much memory can Kyle shoehorn
into his dinky box?
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Kyle:</b></span> He needs all 4GB so he can start his mail client. As a
mutt user,
I guess I just don't need as much RAM, but that's for a different
Point/Counterpoint column.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Bill:</b></span> Hey, Gmail doesn't take any more RAM than Firefox. Besides, I
start my mail client only when I need to write a long message or a
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span> article. Like you said above, I have a BlackBerry for all other
e-mail duty.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Kyle:</b></span> For me, battery life is the key. I can sit for most of a workday on a single charge. When Bill wants to work from a coffee shop, he
definitely needs his power cord. When he wants to work outside, he has
to fire up his diesel generator.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Bill:</b></span> Diesel generator? Hardly. My Precision M90 laptop can run for a
little more than an hour on battery. While that's not your &ldquo;all
day&rdquo; runtime,
it's plenty of time for me to knock out the work I need to do before
hunting for a power outlet.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Kyle:</b></span> This is ultimately what it comes down to for me: when I have work
to do, I don't want to hunt for an outlet, and when I work on an airplane,
I like that I can fully open my laptop on the seat-back tray, even if
the person in front of me leans all the way back. Today, you can get a
dual-core processor even in mini-notebooks. When you combine that with
a solid-state drive, you don't even have to sacrifice performance to go
ultraportable. I want a laptop that fits on my lap, lasts most of the
day, yet still has plenty of power for everything I do. These days,
a number of laptops fit the bill&mdash;even if they don't
fit Bill.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>
Bill:</b></span> &ldquo;Even if they don't fit Bill?&rdquo; Wow, man, you said I hit below the
belt, yet you bust out a fat joke. My main thing is, I need a system that
doesn't feel like I'd break it if I looked at it wrong. It's got to have
the horsepower to do anything I throw at it and be something I can haul
around comfortably. Opening it on an airplane is obviously a non-starter,
but I've gotten to the point where the last thing on my mind when on an
airplane is <span   class="emphasis"><em>doing work</em></span>. Heck, I'm management now. I just fire up
my BlackBerry's media player and put my feet up in business class while
the nice flight attendants bring me drinks. You can sit back in coach and
&ldquo;work&rdquo;, Morlock. The bottom line for our readers is they need to make
the decision that works best for them.
