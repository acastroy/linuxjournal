Centrify Suite 2008</h2></div></div><p>
The new Centrify Suite 2008 is an integrated family of Active
Directory-based auditing, access control and identity management
solutions for cross-platform environments. The applications also help
address regulatory compliance, says its maker Centrify, by adhering to
requirements from SOX, PCI, HIPAA, GLBA and FISMA. The Standard Edition
contains two applications: DirectControl, which secures non-Microsoft
platforms using the same authentication and Group Policy services found
in a Windows environment, and DirectAuthorize, which provides centralized
role-based entitlement management for fine-grained user access and
privilege rights on UNIX and Linux systems. The Enterprise Edition adds
DirectAudit, which offers auditing, logging and real-time monitoring
of user activity on non-Microsoft systems. The Application Edition,
meanwhile, is for organizations using Web/Java applications, databases
or enterprise applications, such as SAP or PeopleSoft.

Primera Technology's Bravo Disc Publishers</h2></div></div><p>
It appears that our constant pestering for Linux support on various
devices is paying off. The latest manufacturer to announce Linux
support is Primera Technology, maker of a range of disc publishers,
which announced support for its Bravo II, BravoPro, Bravo XR and
Bravo XRP CD/DVD/BD devices. Primera says that its full-featured
Linux printer drivers can be integrated with open-source or
commercially available disc-burning engines easily. The drivers can be
downloaded from the firm's Web site.

Sun Microsystems' StarOffice</h2></div></div><p>
StarOffice, the enterprise-oriented sibling of OpenOffice.org, has
been upgraded to Version 9. This open-source office productivity
suite contains the Writer word processor, Calc spreadsheet, Impress
presentation, Base database and Draw drawing/graphics applications.
StarOffice Version 9 adds features, such as Mozilla Thunderbird for
e-mail and Lightning for calendaring, an enterprise migration tool and
various extensions for blogging, communicating, wiki publishing and
PDF editing. Further, like OpenOffice.org 3.0, StarOffice 9 can read
and write Microsoft Office .docx files. A range of support models are
available; indemnification against intellectual property lawsuits is
included in each. StarOffice comes in Linux, Solaris and Windows flavors.

Redpill Linpro's Varnish</h2></div></div><p>
The new Varnish 2.0 from Linpro is an open-source reverse-Web accelerator
for high-content Web sites that was designed from the ground up for
incoming traffic and not as a client-side proxy or origin server. Varnish
temporarily stores the most frequently requested pages in cache memory and
offers tools for identifying which pages should and should not be cached,
and if they are cached, when to delete them and present fresh content.
The result, says Linpro, is a 90% reduction in server requirements.
Varnish 2.0 offers new features like improved compression, expanded
support for filtering Web content for caching, ESI language support,
tighter integration with CMS solutions, load-balancing support, better
scaling and improved accelerator tuning. Varnish runs on Linux, Solaris
and FreeBSD.

R1Soft's Hot Copy</h2></div></div><p>
The new Hot Copy from R1Soft is a Linux command-line utility that takes
on-line snapshots of disks or volumes on a Linux server. Because Hot
Copy does not use LVM, it can work on any Linux system and with any
block device. Some sample applications are turning legacy backups
into on-line ones, creating a copy before running or testing dangerous
scripts and commands (for example, <tt  >rm -Rf</tt>), running fsck safely while the
filesystem is mounted and viewing changes on systems. Features include
instant, non-interrupting point-in-time snapshots of any block device,
point-in-time snapshots with the system in a totally consistent state,
copy-on-write snapshots, writeable snapshots and no need for dedicated
snapshot devices or storage.

Detection</h2></div></div><p>
TotalView Technologies recently upgraded to Version 8.6 its TotalView
tool for source code analysis and memory error detection. Most notably,
this latest release adds TVScript, a new troubleshooting utility
offering a streamlined mechanism for automated and unattended debugging.
In addition, the new SSH-based Remote Display Client allows users to
set up and operate securely an interactive graphical debugging session
on remote systems located anywhere. The Remote Display Client
is available for 32- and 64-bit Linux and Windows.

Walter Goralski's <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Illustrated Network</em></span> (Morgan-Kaufmann)</h2></div></div><p>
This new book from Walter Goralski and Morgan-Kaufmann, <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Illustrated
Network: How TCP/IP Works in a Modern Network</em></span>, updates the classic
<span   class="emphasis"><em>TCP/IP Illustrated</em></span> from W. Richard Stevens to apply to 2008 equipment,
OSes and routers. The book contains 330 illustrations, such as screenshots and topology diagrams, which portray examples from a real, working
network configuration including servers, routers and workstations. The
publisher says the illustrated approach &ldquo;allows the reader to follow
the discussion with unprecedented clarity and precision&rdquo;. <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Illustrated
Network</em></span> is device- and platform-agnostic.

enhancement and development.
