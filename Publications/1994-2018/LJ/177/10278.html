If you are into British detective fiction and names like Sherlock Holmes,
Sexton Blake, Mr. J. G. Reeder, Miss Marple, Hercule Poirot, Father Brown,
Dr. John Evelyn Thorndyke and Lord Peter Wimsey mean anything to you,
you also probably will recognize E. W. Hornung's (brother-in-law to
Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the creator of Sherlock Holmes) character: the
white-glove thief, Raffles. In the &ldquo;A Jubilee Present&rdquo; short story,
the thief is fascinated with an antique gold cup, displayed at the
British Museum. Upon finding only one guard, Raffles questions him on
the perceived lack of security and gets the confident answer, &ldquo;You see,
sir, it's early as yet; in a few minutes these here rooms will fill up;
and there's safety in numbers, as they say.&rdquo; With Linux, rather
than security by
numbers (which eventually is no good for the poor guard; see
Resources for a link to the complete story), security is managed by
Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM). In this article, we
study PAM's features, configuration and usage.
</p><p>
Let's start at the beginning and consider how an application
authenticates a user. Without a common, basic
mechanism, each application would need to be programmed with particular
authentication logic, such as checking the /etc/passwd for a valid user
and password. But, what if you have several different applications
that need authentication? Do you include the same specific logic in all
of them? And, what if your security requirements vary? Would you
then have to modify and recompile all those applications? This wouldn't
be a practical method and surely would become a vulnerability. How
would you be sure that all applications were duly updated and correctly
implemented your new specifications?
</p><p>
The PAM Project provides a solution by adding an extra layer. Programs
that need authentication use a standard library or API (Application
Programming Interface), and system administrators can configure 
what checks will be done by that library separately. (Checks are implemented via
independent modules; you even can program your own modules.) This way,
you can change your security checks dynamically, and all utilities 
will follow your new rules automatically. In other words, you can modify the
authentication mechanism used by any PAM-aware application, without ever
touching the application itself. For programmers, this also is a good
thing, because they need not be concerned with the mechanisms that will be
used. 
Simply by using the PAM libraries, whenever the application is run,
the appropriate checks will be made (Figure 1).
</p><p>
The PAM library breaks down authentication in four areas or groups (Table
1). Note that all applications won't always require the four
previous actions. For example, the passwd command will require
only the last group. (Quick tip: how can you learn whether an application uses
PAM? Use <tt  >ldd</tt> to print the shared libraries required by the program,
and check for libpam.so; see Listing 1 for an example.)

</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10278f1.large.jpg"><img src="10278f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Whenever an application does an authentication request, the
PAM library executes whatever modules are specified in the configuration
file and decides whether to approve (success) or reject (failure)
the request.

Configuring PAM</h2></div></div><p>
For each service (such as login or SSH), you must define which
checks will be done for each group. That list of actions is called a
stack. Depending on the results of the actions in each stack, users
will succeed or fail, and whatever they attempted to do will be allowed or
rejected. You can specify each action in the stack for each service using
a specific file at /etc/pam.d (the more current method) or by editing the single,
catchall file /etc/pam.conf (the older method); in this article, we
use the former method.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1164580.0x125d748"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Note:</b></p><p>
Remember that playing with configuration files can
be dangerous to your health! A particularly nasty thing to do is
remove all configuration files accidentally, because then you won't
be able to log back in again. Make sure to back up all files before you
start experimenting and have a live CD available just in case.
</p></div><p>
Each stack is built out of modules, executed sequentially in the given
order. For each module, you can specify whether it's necessary (failure automatically denies access), sufficient (success automatically grants access) or 
optative (allows for
alternative checks). Table 2 shows the actual control flags. The file
for each service consists of a list of rules, each on its own line. (Longer
lines can be split by ending with a \, but this is seldom required.) Lines
that start with a hash character (#) are considered to be comments and,
thus,
are ignored. Each rule contains three fields: the context area (Table
1), the control flag (Table 2) and the module that will be run, along
with possible (optional) extra parameters. Thus, the specification for
the PAM checks for login would be found in the /etc/pam.d/login file.
</p><p>
The control flag field actually can be more complicated,
but I won't cover all the details here. See Resources if you are
interested. Also, you can use include, as in <tt  >auth include
common-account</tt>, which means to include rules from other files.
</p><p>
There is a special, catchall service called other, that is used
for services without specific rules. A good start from a security point
of view would be creating /etc/pam.d/other, as shown in Listing 2. All
attempts are denied, and a warning is sent to the administrator. If you
want to be more forgiving, substitute pam_unix2.so for pam_deny.so,
and then the standard Linux authentication method will be used, although
a warning will still be sent (Listing 3). If you don't care about security,
substitute pam_permit.so instead, which allows entry to everybody,
but don't say I didn't warn you.
</p><p>
Finally, give the files in /etc/pam.d a quick once-over. If you find
configuration files for applications you don't use, simply rename the files,
so PAM will fall back to your &ldquo;other&rdquo; configuration. Should you
discover later 
that you really needed the application, change the configuration file back
to its original name, and everything will be okay again.

Secure Remote Access</h2></div></div><p>
To get a handle on all this, let's consider an actual
application. I wanted to be able to access my machine remotely with SSH,
but I didn't want to allow any other users (Listing 4). So, I configured
my /etc/pam.d/sshd file. See the
Modules, Modules Everywhere sidebar for more details on these and
other modules. Here are some of the modules I used:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
pam_unix2.so: provides traditional password, rights, session and
password-changing methods, in the classic UNIX way.
</p></li><li><p>
pam_nologin.so: disallows login if the file /etc/nologin exists.
</p></li><li><p>
pam_access.so: implements extra rules for access control (more later in
this article on
how I used this).
</p></li><li><p>
pam_limits.so: enforces limits for users or groups according to the file
/etc/security/limits.conf.
</p></li><li><p>
pam_umask.so: sets the file mode creation mask for the current
environment (do <tt  >info umask</tt> for more information).
</p></li><li><p>
pam_pwcheck: enforces password-strength checks (more details on 
further uses of this module later in this article).
</p></li></ul></div><p>
If you check your own /etc/pam.d/sshd file, it probably will look
like this, except for the pam_access module, which is the interesting
part. This module implements added security controls based on the
/etc/security/access.conf file. I edited it in order to specify who could
access my machine (Listing 5). The first line means that anybody
(ALL) can log in to my machine from within the internal network at
home. The second line allows the remoteKereki user to access my machine from
anywhere in the world, and the final line is a catchall that disables
access to anybody not included specifically in these lines. I created
the remoteKereki user with minimum rights to allow myself entry to
the machine, and then I execute <tt  >su</tt> and work as
myself or even as root, if
needed. If people guess the correct password for remoteKereki,
it won't help them much, because attackers still will have to guess the
password for the other, more useful, users. As it is, it provides an extra
barrier before intruders can do serious damage.
</p><p>
I had to modify /etc/ssh/sshd_config by adding a line <tt  >UsePAM
yes</tt>, so
sshd would use the PAM configuration. I had to restart SSH with
<tt  >/etc/init.d/sshd restart</tt> so the configuration would be used. For even
more secure connections, you also could change the SSH standard port
(22) to a different value, forbid root remote logins and limit 
retries to hinder brute-force attacks, but those topics are beyond the
scope of this article.
Do <tt  >man ssh_config</tt> for more details.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1164580.0x1255688"></a>
Requiring Good Passwords</h2></div></div><p>
Left on their own, most users will (trustingly and unknowingly) use
easily guessable and never-changed passwords, simplifying the
job
for intruders. With PAM, you can enforce several good practices
for password management by using the password stack
and the pam_pwcheck.so module. This module does several checks on the
strength of your password:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Is the new password too short?
</p></li><li><p>
Is the new password too similar to the old one?
</p></li><li><p>
Is the new password merely the old password, reversed or rotated (for
example, safe123 and 123safe)?
</p></li><li><p>
Is the new password the same as the old one, with only case
changes (such as sEcReT and SEcrET)?
</p></li><li><p>
Was the new password already used before? (Old passwords are
stored in the /etc/security/opasswd file.)
</p></li></ul></div><p>
You can add several parameters to the module (do <tt  >man
pam_pwcheck</tt>
for complete documentation) for extra rules, such as:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
minlen=aNumber: specifies the minimum length (by default, five characters) for the
new password. If you set it to zero, all password
lengths are accepted.
</p></li><li><p>
cracklib=pathToDictionaries: allows use of the cracklib library for
password checks. If the new password is in a dictionary, a simple
brute-force attack quickly will guess it.
</p></li><li><p>
tries=aNumber: sets how many attempts to allow, if previous
attempts were rejected because they were too easy.
</p></li><li><p>
remember=aNumber: defines how many previous passwords will
be remembered.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Another module provides similar functionality,
pam_cracklib.so, but it has some different parameters. For example,
you might specify how many characters must differ between your old
and new password and whether you want to include digits, uppercase,
lowercase and nonalphabetic characters. Do <tt  >man
pam_cracklib</tt> for
more information.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1164580.0x1256028"></a>
Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
There might be security in numbers (as the poor British Museum guard
thought when he
tried to deter Raffles from stealing the cup), but for Linux,
PAM is the way to go. Without even resorting to rolling out your own
modules, you can add plenty of flexibility to your security by
setting up a few configuration files and rest assured that those
rules will be obeyed globally.

Your system's security depends on the modules you use. Modules
are stored in /lib/security or /lib64/security (for 64-bit systems),
but some distributions do not follow this standard. For example,
you might find the modules in /usr/lib/security. You can write your own
modules if you want (see Resources), but for starters, you probably will be
able to manage with the standard ones. The following is a list
of the more common modules. For more information, use the
<tt  >man</tt> command. Also note that there is no standard list of modules,
and each distribution may include more modules or variations on
the modules below.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>pam_access:</b></span> allows or refuses access, based on IPs, login names, host
or domain names and so forth. By default, access rules are specified in
/etc/security/access.conf. Whenever a user logs in, the access rules
are scanned in order for the first match, and permission is granted or
denied accordingly. See also pam_time for further restrictions.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>pam_cracklib</b></span> and <span   class="bold"><b>pam_pwcheck:</b></span> 
provide password strength-checking
and disallow repeated, too simple and easily guessed
possibilities. Users are prompted for a password, and if it passes the
predefined rules and is considered strong, users are prompted again
as a check.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>pam_deny:</b></span> simply denies access. It can be used to block users as a
default rule. See also pam_permit.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>pam_echo:</b></span> displays a (configurable) text message to the user. See also
pam_motd.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>pam_env:</b></span> allows setting or unsetting environment variables.
The default rules are taken from /etc/security/pam_env.conf.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>pam_exec:</b></span> calls an external command.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>pam_lastlog:</b></span> displays the date and time of the last login.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>pam_limits:</b></span> sets limits on the system resources that a user might
require. The default limits are taken from /etc/security/limits.conf.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>pam_listfile:</b></span> allows or denies services based on a
file. For example,
you could limit FTP access to users in the file /etc/ftpusers_ok by
including the line <tt  >auth required pam_listfile.so item=user sense=allow
file=/etc/ftpusers_ok onerr=fail</tt> in the /etc/pam.d/ftpd file. See also
pam_nologin.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>pam_mail:</b></span> informs users whether they have
mail.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>pam_mkhomedir:</b></span> creates a user home
directory, if it doesn't exist on the
local machine. This allows you to use central authentication (NIS or LDAP,
for example) and create user directories only when needed.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>pam_motd:</b></span> displays the &ldquo;message of
the day&rdquo; file to users.
See also pam_echo.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>pam_nologin:</b></span> disallows logins when /etc/nologin exists.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>pam_permit:</b></span> allows entry without
checks&mdash;quite unsafe!
See also pam_deny.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>pam_rootok:</b></span> allows access for the root user 
without further checks. This typically is used in /etc/pam.d/su to let root
act as another user without entering a password. The file should contain
the following lines (regarding the second line, see pam_wheel):

<pre     class="programlisting">
auth  sufficient   pam_rootok.so
auth  required     pam_wheel.so

</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>pam_succeed_if:</b></span> tests for account characteristics, such as belonging 
to a certain group, having a certain UID and so on.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>pam_time:</b></span> restricts access to services depending on the day of
the week and time of the day. The default rules are taken from
/etc/security/time.conf. Note, however, that only the login time is
enforced. There's no way to force the user to log out afterward.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>pam_umask:</b></span> sets the file mode creation
