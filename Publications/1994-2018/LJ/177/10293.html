Use a few simple techniques and a couple extra tools to simplify
things when you must administer a group of machines at a time.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b8e580.0x1c863b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Through the years I've had to manage a wide-ranging number of different
servers. At one job, I started with only a few and expanded to around
ten, while at another job, I've managed hundreds. In both cases, I've found
that you just can't accomplish everything you need to do efficiently
when you log in to machines one at a time. Over the years, I've discovered
a couple tools and techniques that certainly make it easier. Now
granted, even these techniques can scale only so far. If you have a very
large environment, you probably will be best served with some sort of
centralized management tool like Puppet, cfengine or other tools that
you can buy from vendors. Even so, for those of you who have a small-to-medium environment at work (or at home), here are some tricks to help
you manage those machines better.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b8e580.0x1c86568"></a>
SSH Loops</h2></div></div><p>
A common need you have when there are more than a few servers in your
environment is to run the same command on more than one machine. When
I first had this problem, I came up with a pretty simple shell script:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ HOSTS="machine1 machine2 machine3 machine4"; 
 &#8618;for i in $HOSTS; do ssh $i uname -a; done;
</pre>
</p><p>
This one-liner iterates through each machine I've listed in the HOSTS
environment variable and runs uname -a. You can, of course, replace
uname -a with any command-line command that you would want to run on the
hosts. For instance, one need I had was to keep all of my Debian servers
up to date. I created a small shell script on each Debian host called
/usr/local/bin/apt-automate:

<pre     class="programlisting">

#!/bin/sh

apt-get update &amp;&amp; apt-get -u upgrade

</pre>
</p><p>
Then, I edited my /etc/sudoers file, so that my regular user could execute
that script as root without a password:


<pre     class="programlisting">
username ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /usr/local/bin/apt-automate
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b8e580.0x1c868d8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
(Replace username with your local user name for that host.) Once I had
the script in place and sudo configured, I set up SSH keys so my user
could log in to each of those machines easily. Then, I could update
four hosts with a simple one-liner:

<pre     class="programlisting">
HOSTS="machine1 machine2 machine3 machine4"; 
 &#8618;for i in $HOSTS; do ssh $i sudo apt-automate; done;
</pre>
</p><p>
Ultimately, I found I executed this one-liner so much, it warranted its
own script, which I called update-all:

<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/sh

hosts="machine1 machine2 machine3 machine4"

# Run the command on each remote host
for i in $hosts;
do
  echo $i;
  ssh $i sudo apt-automate;
done;

# Also run the command on the local machine
sudo apt-automate
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, this system worked for me at the time, but it has plenty of room for
improvement. For one, I potentially could set up a set of environment
variables for different host groups. Then, instead of defining HOSTS each
time I ran the one-liner, I could reference one of those groups.

ClusterSSH</h2></div></div><p>
When I had only a few hosts to manage, the SSH loop method worked
well for me. However, that plan didn't scale quite so well when I needed
to manage a few hundred machines in different data centers. For one, I
didn't always just need to run a command on a group of machines. Sometimes,
I wanted to make the same change to the same file on each of the
hosts. Although I could play with Perl, or use awk and sed scripts to edit files
in-line, that was prone to mistakes. Lucky for me, I found an invaluable
tool for managing small-to-medium server environments called ClusterSSH
(<a href="http://clusterssh.sourceforge.net" target="_self">clusterssh.sourceforge.net</a>).
</p><p>
ClusterSSH opens a terminal for every machine you want to manage. In
addition to these terminals, ClusterSSH opens a small Tk control
window. Anything you type into one of the individual terminals will
execute just on that server, but anything you type or paste into the Tk
window is input into every terminal. The control window also allows you
to toggle whether input goes to a particular terminal and allows you to
add extra hosts as well.
</p><p>
ClusterSSH is packaged by a number of distributions. If your distribution
doesn't have it, you also can download and build the source from the
project page. Once the package is installed, execution is simple:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ cssh host1 host2 host3 host4
</pre>
</p><p>
A nice feature of ClusterSSH is that it automatically will tile all
of the windows for you so that you get the maximum amount of visible
screen space on each (Figure 1). This is particularly useful when you
operate on a large number of servers at the same time. If you happen to
rearrange the windows or add or remove hosts from ClusterSSH, you can
press Alt-R or click Hosts&rarr;Refile Hosts to rearrange all the windows.

</p></div></div><p>
Now you might be saying, &ldquo;That all looks fine, but you still have
to specify all the servers on the command line each time. What if
I have a cluster of 30 servers to manage?&rdquo; Well, ClusterSSH has that
covered via its configuration files. In the ~/.csshrc file, you not
only can define default settings for ClusterSSH, such as terminal settings,
but you also can define groups of servers. If you want to change settings
for all users, you can define clusters in the /etc/clusters file and
set ClusterSSH parameters in /etc/csshrc. Otherwise, ~/.csshrc works fine
as a place to store all the settings for your user. Here's a sample
~/.csshrc that highlights some of the useful options:


<pre     class="programlisting">
terminal_args = -fg green
terminal_font = 7x14
clusters = web dbtest dbprod dns
web = web1 web2 web3 web4 web5 web6 web7 web8 web9 web10
dbtest = testdba@db1.test.example.net testdba@db2.test.example.net
dbprod = proddba@db1.prod.example.net proddba@db2.prod.example.net
dns = root@ns1 root@ns2 root@10.1.1.1
</pre>
</p><p>
The first two options in this file configure terminal settings. First,
I set the foreground to green on my xterm (since green on black is the
one true terminal color), and then I set the terminal font. The third line
sets the clusters option and defines aliases for all the clusters
you will define below. Note that if you define a cluster in this file
but don't remember to add it to the cluster option, you won't be able to
access it. Below the clusters option, I've defined a number of different
clusters. The syntax is essentially clustername = serverlist with each
hostname separated by spaces. As you can see in the examples, you can
specify servers strictly by hostname (in which case your DNS search
path will attempt to resolve the fully qualified domain name), by the
host's fully qualified domain name or by IP. If you want to log in under
a different user name, you also can specify that on a host-by-host basis.
</p><p>
Once your configuration file is in place, you can connect any or all of
the cluster aliases on the command line. So, if I wanted to run a command
on all the Web servers I would type:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ cssh web
</pre>
</p><p>
If I wanted to access both the dbtest and dbprod servers, I would type:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ cssh dbtest dbprod
</pre>
</p><p>
One downside when you specify multiple host groups is that if you
don't have SSH keys set up, you might have to type in different passwords
for each host. In that case, you need to highlight each terminal
window individually and then log in. After that, you can return to the
Tk control window and execute commands across all hosts.
</p><p>
All in all, I've found ClusterSSH to be an invaluable tool for
managing small-to-medium groups of servers. The interface is pretty
straightforward, and there is something so cool about being able to paste
20 lines of configuration to a vim session across 30 hosts or quickly run
tail against all of your Web server logs. I've found I use it the most
to deploy packages to groups of servers. I can single out one server to
make sure the package works correctly, then toggle that server off and
apply it to the rest.
