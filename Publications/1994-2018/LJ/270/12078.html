LinkedIn's {py}gradle</h2></div></div><p>
To facilitate better building of Android apps, the technical team at
LinkedIn has developed {py}gradle, a new powerful, flexible and reusable
Python packaging system. Now available to the Open Source community,
{py}gradle wraps Python code into the Gradle build automation tool so that
developers can build Android apps more easily. The tool currently is used
for all Android projects at LinkedIn, and the company expects it to be
widely used in the Open Source community as well. With {py}gradle,
LinkedIn has bridged a gap between two similar but different technologies:
Setuptools and Gradle. LinkedIn says that Python's Setuptools works
well for self-contained Python applications with a small set of external
dependencies. However, Setuptools can become problematic in certain
situations as an organization's Python footprint grows, which led
LinkedIn to integrate Gradle and a plugin architecture. For each
language or technology stack, one simply needs to apply the build plugin
for the underlying language or technology stack. With Gradle, LinkedIn was
careful to enhance rather than replace the existing and idiomatic Python
package management ecosystem.

Netlist, Inc.'s HybriDIMM Storage Class Memory</h2></div></div><p>
The metachallenge in today's data-saturated world is turning Big Data into
actionable insight. A straight line to faster insights can be found in
Netlist, Inc.'s new HybriDIMM Storage Class Memory (SCM), which the
company describes as the industry's first standards-based, plug-and-play
SCM solution. Based on an industry-standard DDR4 LRDIMM interface, Netlist
calls HybriDIMM the first SCM product to operate in current Intel x86
servers without BIOS and hardware changes, as well as the first unified
DRAM-NAND solution that scales memory to terabyte storage capacities and
accelerates storage to nanosecond memory speeds. Netlist adds that
HybriDIMM's breakthrough architecture combines an on-DIMM co-processor with
Netlist's PreSight technology&mdash;predictive software-defined data
management&mdash;to unify memory and storage at near-DRAM speeds. The
result is a dramatic improvement in application performance by reducing
data access latency by up to 1,000 times vs. the fastest existing storage
solution and up to 80% cost reduction compared to the highest existing
memory density for in-memory applications.

Canonical Ltd.'s Ubuntu Core</h2></div></div><p>
Canonical Ltd.'s &ldquo;Snappy&rdquo; Ubuntu Core, a stripped-down version of
Ubuntu designed for autonomous machines, devices and other
internet-connected digital things, has gained significant traction in the
chipset/semiconductor market recently. Following on partnerships with
Samsung ARTIK, Qualcomm and MediaTek, Ubuntu core now adds UcRobotics' Bubblegum-96 board to the list of supported devices. Canonical describes
Ubuntu Core as the ideal platform for developers in the semiconductor arena
for deploying large numbers of IoT devices due to its secure and
open-source design, transactional updates that are fast and reliable and
its small footprint. The Bubblegum-96 board, a great open platform for
applications and IoT devices, represents one of the most powerful
commercial-edition Linaro 96Boards and the third Linaro board enabled on
Ubuntu Core.

Vivaldi Technologies Vivaldi Web Browser</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Wired</em></span> magazine likes the Vivaldi web browser, calling it a tool for power
users just like &ldquo;500-pound squats are to power lifters&rdquo;. Led by a
founder of the Opera browser, Vivaldi Technologies' browser eschews the
pared-down base browser plus extensions model for one in which
personalization rules. &ldquo;You can truly make Vivaldi yours&rdquo; is
the company's mantra. The new Vivaldi 1.3 adds new options for personalization, most
notably custom themes to allow customization of every UI element,
protection for WebRTC IP leakage to improve privacy and additional mouse
gestures, bringing to 90 the number of customizable browser actions.
Platform-specific improvements for Linux users in this release include
improved right-click tab hibernation for conserving system resources and
better support for proprietary media in HTML5.

Penclic B3 Mouse</h2></div></div><p>
&ldquo;Does the world need a new computer mouse?&rdquo; asks Penclic.
&ldquo;Yes it does!&rdquo; says the Swedish peripherals developer. Most devices in
our lives have undergone extensive changes through the years, notes Penclic,
save the unlucky, unglamorous computer mouse. The poor little guy is due
not just for a facelift but a total makeover in the form of the new
Penclic B3 Mouse, a faster, better and sleeker product. With this device,
Penclic applies its formula of uniting cutting-edge technology with
innovative, ergonomic Swedish design, resulting in a &ldquo;new and amazing
user experience&rdquo;. The Penclic Mouse looks, feels and moves like a pen,
says the company, and is so responsive and intuitive that it nearly feels
like the mouse predicts where the user intends to move the cursor. The
device enables the extension of bodily movements and harnesses the natural
power and dexterity in our fingers and hands, which promotes a healthy and
natural working position. Endless clicking and unnecessary cursor movements
are things of the past. Penclic's innovative pen grip counteracts health
problems like repetitive strain injury that often arise from using a
traditional computer mouse. The Penclic B3 mouse is compatible with Linux,
Mac OS and Windows systems that support HID 1.1.

Linaro Ltd.'s OpenDataPlane</h2></div></div><p>
The OpenDataPlane (ODP) project is a founding initiative by the Linaro
Networking Group to produce an open-source, cross-platform application
programming interface (API) for the
networking Software Defined Data Plane. Linaro Ltd. recently announced the
availability of the first Long Term Support (LTS) Monarch release of
OpenDataPlane, which will enable other projects to leverage the
acceleration provided by the ODP APIs now that the code base will be fully
supported for the foreseeable future. Linaro adds that work already
has begun on network protocol stacks, such as OpenFastPath (OFP), products like
the nginx web server accelerated with ODP and OFP and libraries like
OpenSSL that provide crypto acceleration via ODP. In addition, ODP and
ODP-based products, such as OFP, nginx and
OpenSSL, now can be made available as packages in popular Linux
distributions like Debian, CentOS and OpenEmbedded. To accompany the
release, Linaro launched a validation test suite that permits users and
vendors to verify API compatibility between different ODP implementations.

Elizabeth K. Joseph and Matt Fischer's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Common OpenStack
Deployments</em></span> (Prentice
Hall)</h2></div></div><p>
Public and private clouds typically are built and integrated using
OpenStack technology. Professionals seeking guidance on this important
topic should investigate Elizabeth K. Joseph and Matthew Fischer's new book
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Common OpenStack Deployments</em></span>, which its publisher, Prentice Hall, describes
as &ldquo;a complete, practical guide to deploying OpenStack and
understanding its internals&rdquo;. The authors share up-to-date, detailed
strategies for deploying OpenStack on both virtual and physical servers, as
well for using OpenStack to address any real-world challenge. Joseph and
Fischer begin the book by covering OpenStack concepts and components by
guiding the reader through small-scale, virtualized deployments. Later,
readers learn how to build large, horizontally scalable infrastructures
that integrate multiple components in a feature-rich cloud environment.
Sprinkled throughout the book is current coverage of enhancements that make
the OpenStack platform more mature and production-ready, plus expert tips
on debugging and growth. Finally, the authors explain the broader OpenStack
ecosystem, illustrating how to drive value through hybrid clouds blending
local and hosted solutions.

Paragon Software Group's ExtFS for Windows</h2></div></div><p>
Fellow Linux/Windows dual-booters out there are familiar with this problem:
you can access Windows files from your Linux session, but not the other way
around. Saving humanity by chipping away at Windows' illogic is 
ExtFS for Windows, a handy utility from the Paragon Software Group that
gives dual-boot users full read-write access to Linux partitions from their
Windows session. ExtFS' drivers are based on Paragon's proprietary
cross-platform Universal File System Driver (UFSD) technology, which
provides a higher data transfer rate than native filesystem performance.
Paragon recently unveiled a new feature-rich version 4 of ExtFS for
Windows, which comes with extended support for Ext4 file formats enabling
the highest transfer speeds and mounts Linux volumes, including those more
than
2TB in size, at up to twice the rate of the previous release. Thanks to the
development of ExtFS, Paragon calls itself the first software developer to
implement a full set of drivers with complete read and write access to
partitions on all popular filesystems. ExtFS for Mac is also available
from the company.
