You've probably already heard of machine learning, but read on for some
examples of why you should learn it and how it can help you. 
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1812580.0x190a3b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The field of statistics typically has had a bad reputation. It's seen
as difficult, boring and even a bit useless. Many of my friends had
to take statistics courses in graduate school, so that they could
analyze and report on their research. To many of them, the classes
were a form of nerdy, boring torture.
</p><p>
Maybe it's just me, but after I took those courses, I felt like I was
seeing the world through new eyes. Suddenly, I could better understand
the world around me. Newspaper articles about the government and scientific
and corporate reports made more sense. I also could identify the
flaws in such reports more easily and criticize them from a position of
understanding.
</p><p>
Much of the power of statistics lies in the creation of a
&ldquo;model&rdquo;, or
a mathematical description of reality. A model is a caricature of
sorts, in that it doesn't represent all of reality, but rather just
those factors that you think will affect the thing you're trying to
understand. A model lets you say that given inputs A, B, C and D,
you can know, more or less, what the output will be.
</p><p>
Sometimes, the goal of a statistical model is to predict a value&mdash;for example, given a certain size and neighborhood, you can predict
the price of a house. Or, given someone's age, weight and where they
live, you can predict his or her likelihood of getting a certain disease.
</p><p>
Often, the goal is to predict a category&mdash;for example, in an
upcoming election, for whom are people likely to vote? Taking into
account where they live, what level of education they've received,
their ethnic background and a few other factors, you can often
predict for whom people will vote before they know it themselves.
</p><p>
During the past few years, there has been a huge amount of buzz around the
terms &ldquo;big data&rdquo;, &ldquo;data science&rdquo; and
&ldquo;machine learning&rdquo;. As these
buzzwords continue to gain acceptance, many statisticians are
wondering what the big deal is. And to be honest, their complaint
makes some sense, given that &ldquo;machine learning&rdquo; is, more or less, a
computerized version of the predictive models that statisticians have
been creating for decades.
</p><p>
Now, why am I telling you this? Because I actually do believe that
machine learning is a game-changer for huge parts of our lives. Just
as my perspective was changed when I learned statistics, giving me
tools to understand the world better, many businesses are having their
perspectives changed, as they use machine learning to 
understand themselves better. Everything from online shopping, to the items
you see in your social-network feeds, to the voice-recognition
algorithms in your phone, to the fraud detection used by your
credit-card company is being affected, boosted and (hopefully)
improved via machine learning.
</p><p>
This means that no matter what sort of software development you do,
you would be wise to gain as much experience as you can with machine
learning. Its benefits might not be obvious to you at once or even
be applicable to your work right away. But machine learning is
becoming ubiquitous, and there is no shortage of ways in which to use
it.
</p><p>
So with this article, I'm starting a series on machine learning and
some of the ways your organization can take advantage of it.
I'll look at a number of problems, many of which are common on web
applications, that can benefit from using machine learning. Along the
way, I hope you'll get lots of ideas for the sorts of analysis
and uses that machine learning can bring to your applications.
</p><p>
If you're completely new to the world of machine learning, I encourage
you to read the free Geek Guide I wrote on the subject, published by
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> and available at <a href="http://geekguide.linuxjournal.com/content/machine-learning-python-0" target="_self">geekguide.linuxjournal.com/content/machine-learning-python-0</a>.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1812580.0x190ab40"></a>
Uses for Machine Learning</h2></div></div><p>
If you have ever invested money, you'll undoubtedly remember that the
fund in which you invested, or the broker with whom you worked, warned
you that &ldquo;past performance is no guarantee of future results&rdquo; or
words to that effect. That's because we, as living beings, are
conditioned to assume that if the world worked a certain way in the
past, then it'll likely work a certain way in the future. For most of
us, most of the time, this is a good way to live our lives.
</p><p>
Machine learning works on this principle, that the past is a good
indicator of the future. We create a machine-learning model, telling
the model that given a set of inputs, we got a particular output. One
such piece of information is unlikely to give us anything useful.
But, several hundred samples later, the model can start to make some
predictions. Several thousand, or even million, samples later, and
your predictions can potentially be quite accurate.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1812580.0x190ad50"></a>
Customer Patterns</h2></div></div><p>
If you run an online store, machine learning can help you to
understand your customers better. For example, if you know that
customers who bought products X and Y also bought product Z, you
can send email promotions to such people who haven't yet bought Z,
knowing that a proportion of them will respond positively.
</p><p>
More nefariously, you also could raise the price on product Z when
those people visit your site, knowing that a fair number of such people
are likely to buy it anyway.
</p><p>
(And by how much should you raise the price? Assuming enough traffic,
you can try different numbers on different people, until you figure
out the optimal setting.)
</p><p>
If you have additional information about your customers, such as their
age, gender or where they live, a machine-learning algorithm can
help you determine even more about them&mdash;from what they're likely
to buy, to how often they'll visit your store. You also can keep track of
things they thought about buying, but later removed from their
shopping carts.
</p><p>
Take the famous story of Target, which sent a &ldquo;so you're
expecting&rdquo;
promotion to a teenage girl in the United States. It turns out that
Target's machine-learning systems had correctly identified that based
on her purchasing habits, she was likely to be pregnant. The only
problem was that this teenager in question, who was indeed pregnant,
hadn't told her parents.
</p><p>
I recently spoke with the CTO of a new online marketplace for a
specific type of consulting, in which customers and consultants would
communicate, with a goal toward solving the problem. After each
session, each of the participants would then indicate how satisfied
they were. The CTO wanted to know where machine learning could help; I
told him that over time, they could accumulate a huge amount of data
regarding which types of customers got along best with which sorts of
consultants&mdash;allowing them to make increasingly good
recommendations and be better matchmakers.
</p><p>
And speaking of &ldquo;matchmakers&rdquo;, every modern online dating site uses
machine learning. They know a lot about their users, and they use that
data to try to predict which people in their database are likely to be
the greatest success. You could say that these dating sites, thanks
to their machine-learning systems, know more about people's dating
preferences than people could explicitly say about themselves.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1812580.0x190b118"></a>
Recommendation Engines</h2></div></div><p>
One classic example of machine learning is a recommendation engine. I
have been shopping on Amazon since it first opened, so I've
provided that company with a great deal of data about myself and the things
I like to purchase. When it suggests that I might be interested
in a product, the odds are good that I either have it already, or that I
considered it or that I would indeed be interested in it.
</p><p>
If you run an e-commerce site, you can use machine learning to
similar ends. You can create a model that identifies which products
are similar to which other products. Then, you can go through
someone's purchase history, finding unpurchased products that are
similar to the ones that they already have bought.
</p><p>
Nowadays, sites like Amazon often have access not only to your
purchase history, but also to the ratings you gave to various
products. In this way, sites can suggest not only the products that
you're likely to buy, but also those that you're most likely to enjoy as
well.
</p><p>
Another way to handle recommendations is to look at people, rather
than products. Instead of telling me what I'm likely to buy based on
my past purchases, a site could tell me what I'm likely to buy, based
on my friends' purchasing habits. If you have access to friends'
recommendations, the combination of a friend's purchase and a
high rating from that friend might make a product especially
attractive&mdash;and, thus, the object of a special promotion.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1812580.0x190b328"></a>
Finances</h2></div></div><p>
Of course, many of the heaviest and largest users of machine learning
are financial firms. You can be sure that credit-card companies
and other payment companies, such as PayPal, spend a great deal of time
and effort on machine-learning algorithms that identify when someone
might be committing fraud. If I use my credit card to buy something
unusual or in a country I haven't visited before, my credit-card company
sometimes will contact me to make sure the
transaction is legitimate.
</p><p>
As you can imagine, such machine-learning models take a wide variety
of inputs to try to determine whether the transaction is legitimate
or fraudulent. These checks often have to take place in real time,
which makes them particularly impressive in my book, given the amount
of data that they have to deal with in a given moment. But, there 
inevitably will be some false positives and false negatives in such a
system. If you're like me, the false negatives continue to haunt you
for a long time afterward. After all, although I understand how these
companies are just trying to do their jobs, it's maddening to be stuck
at the supermarket checkout, trying to convince your credit-card
company that you're simply trying to buy milk and bread in Stockholm.
</p><p>
&ldquo;FinTech&rdquo; companies are popping up all over, and much of what they do
is an application of machine learning to finance (hence the name, of
course). Whether it's identifying fraud or looking for investment
opportunities, such models can crunch more data more quickly than
people&mdash;and can draw upon millions of previous examples, rather than
the dozens that humans can keep in their heads.

Summary</h2></div></div><p>
As you can see, machine learning offers an incredible variety of
solutions, providing opportunities for new types of analysis. It's
definitely worth sitting down to learn something about machine
learning. In upcoming articles, I plan to walk you through how to solve
some of the problems described in this column using open-source
languages and tools. I hope you'll soon see that in data
science and machine learning, the coding is the easy part. The hard
part is thinking about how to build your model, what to include and
which algorithm would be the most appropriate.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1812580.0x190b698"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Resources</b></p><p>
Machine learning is a huge field, and part of the problem is the
plethora of sources of information.
</p><p>
One long-standing weekly email list is KDnuggets at
<a href="http://kdnuggets.com" target="_self">kdnuggets.com</a>. You also should consider the Data Science
Weekly newsletter (<a href="http://datascienceweekly.com" target="_self">datascienceweekly.com</a>) and This Week in Data
(<a href="https://datarepublicblog.com/category/this-week-in-data" target="_self">https://datarepublicblog.com/category/this-week-in-data</a>), describing the latest data sets available to the public.
</p><p>
I am a big fan of podcasts, and I particularly love &ldquo;Partially
Derivative&rdquo;. Other good ones are &ldquo;Data Stores&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Linear
Digressions&rdquo;. I listen to all three on a regular basis and learn
from them all.
</p><p>
Finally, if you're looking to get into data science and machine
learning, I recommend Kevin Markham's Data School
(<a href="http://dataschool.org" target="_self">dataschool.org</a>) and Jason Brownlie's &ldquo;Machine Learning
Mastery&rdquo; (<a href="http://machinelearningmastery.com" target="_self">machinelearningmastery.com</a>), where he sells a number of
short, dense, but high-quality ebooks on these subjects.
