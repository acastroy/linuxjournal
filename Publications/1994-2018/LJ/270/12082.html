Changing topics six times in one column? That's what it's like to
talk with Shawn Powers!
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18e4580.0x19dc358"></a></h2></div></div><p>
For every column, I try to write something that is interesting, entertaining,
educational and fun. Sometimes I even succeed. Many other times I
have some things I'd like to talk about, but there's not enough of it
to fill a column. Sometimes I turn those ideas into UpFront pieces, and
sometimes I just forget about them. This column, I decided a disjointed
hodge podge would be the theme. So let's just have a virtual nerdy talk
about stuff, shall we?
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18e4580.0x19dc510"></a>
My Little Cloud Puff</h2></div></div><p>
It's really nice to have a server on the internet that is online even
when you're not. Even with my two business-class internet connections
(one cable modem and one DSL), the reliability of my connection is shoddy
at best. The thing is, I don't really <span   class="emphasis"><em>need</em></span> very much in a server. I
mainly use them for hosting files I want to access when out and about,
or to test services, and so on. It used to be prohibitively expensive to
purchase a dedicated server. Thanks to VPS options though, it's actually really
cheap to get full-blown internet servers that have a dedicated public
IP address. In order to get the best deal, however, it's important to
think about what you need and then shop around.
</p><p>
For example, I like to have a server I can use as a VPN. There are
affordable services, like Private Internet Access (<a href="https://www.privateinternetaccess.com" target="_self">https://www.privateinternetaccess.com</a>), which I do use for
$40/year, but if you want your own VPN to protect your data, a VPS
is perfect. The thing is, you need a specific type of VPS. It doesn't
take much CPU, RAM or storage to run a VPN, but limited bandwidth on
low-end servers really can be a showstopper for something like a VPN
service. The key is to find a very low-end machine that has unmetered
data. It usually doesn't have to be any faster than 100mbps either,
because that sort of speed is still more than enough for browsing the
web. (That said, it's hard to find a VPS with less than 1gbps speed.)
</p><p>
I'm not endorsing VPSCheap.net as a vendor, since I don't actually use it,
but a quick search found this plan from <a href="https://vpscheap.net" target="_self">https://vpscheap.net</a> (Figure 1). For
$20/year, you get a small server with unlimited bandwidth. For a VPN,
it's perfect! Plus, with unmetered bandwidth, you can do things like
run a BitTorrentSync server and not worry about getting your VPS shut
off. The only downside with unmetered bandwidth is that it usually comes
as a trade-off with memory, CPU and storage space/speed.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="12082f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Although $20 is a significant amount of money, for a year, it's 
pretty reasonable!
</p></div></div><p>
If you need storage, like for an offsite backup, other VPS
plans exist that favor large storage while trading off CPU/RAM. For
instance, Bit Accel (<a href="http://www.bitaccel.com" target="_self">www.bitaccel.com</a>) has 100GB of storage with 256MB of RAM and
a shared CPU. It even offers unlimited transfer. It's only $1.99/month
(Figure 2) with other plans scaling up and down from there. I don't
use this either, so I can't vouch for its reliability.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="12082f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. This example is only slightly more expensive than the other VPS,
but it has 100GB of storage!
</p></div></div><p>
Really, if you're looking for a small server of your own, the best
place to look for a deal is LowEndBox (<a href="https://lowendbox.com" target="_self">https://lowendbox.com</a>). It's a very active community
sharing links to deals from vendors all over the world. There's not
really a database of current deals or the ability to sort based on
criteria, but scrolling through a few pages is almost always worth the
effort. Plus, the community leaves comments after each posted deal, so you
get a feel for what sort of quality the vendors provide. (Most vendors
also support Bitcoin payment, so if you truly want to stay anonymous,
it's easier than going with places that require credit cards.)

NAS</h2></div></div><p>
Through the the years, I've mentioned the various NAS devices I use for my home
network. Kyle Rankin recently talked about his foray into ARM-based
servers and his NAS system. I've gone between full-blown servers with
off-the-shelf distributions installed, to embedded systems with proprietary
partitioning (I'm looking at you, Drobo). There are advantages and
disadvantages to the various methods and brands, but I would be
lying if I said I didn't have a favorite: Synology (<a href="https://www.synology.com" target="_self">https://www.synology.com</a>). 
</p><p>
My current Synology NAS is the Synology 1815+ (Figure 3), which 
probably already is outdated. It has eight 3.5" SATA slots, and I have it
populated with eight 6TB Western Digital Red NAS drives. It's configured to
use RAID6, so I have 36TB of usable space. Plus, it has a handful of
actually useful tools built in. (I use it as a reverse proxy, Transmission
BitTorrent client and SickRage for keeping track of my television shows.)
The best part about it, however, is that it manages to maintain its
integrity automatically with regular system checks, self-installing
updates and data scrubbing to keep the RAID system clean. It does those
things without needing me to interact, and somehow it manages not to lock
up my other servers connected via NFS and Samba. If there was ever a
set-it-and-forget-it NAS device, it's the Synology in my basement. Compared
to the Qnap, Netgear, Drobo and countless other NAS devices I've used,
there's simply no comparison. I can't recommend Synology enough.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12082f3.large.jpg"><img src="12082f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Seriously, this is the nicest NAS I've ever used&mdash;and I've
used many.
</p></div></div><p>
If you're set on using something like FreeNAS or a standard Linux
distribution and hosting your own files, I should mention that I've
always had very, very good luck with software-based RAID on Linux. The
best part about software RAID is that it's not tied to a specific piece of
RAID hardware. If your computer fails, you can take all the drives
out of the broken computer, put them in a new system, and the RAID
partition is simple to rebuild. In most cases, it will 
detect the software RAID partitions and rebuild itself automatically! Seriously,
I'd chose Linux software RAID over a hardware-based RAID card any day,
especially in a home or small office environment.

Bitcoin</h2></div></div><p>
Bitcoin isn't nearly the media sensation it once was, but for some
of us, it's still an incredible idea that is just starting to gain
traction. I still use Bitcoin often, and I love how fast transactions
take place. There have been a few recent advances in how you can use
Bitcoin that are worth looking into.
</p><p>
Coinbase (<a href="http://www.coinbase.com" target="_self">www.coinbase.com</a>) is still a very popular
online wallet system. It supports
buying and selling Bitcoin, and it recently has added support for Ethereum
(an alternative cryptocurrency). One of my favorite new features,
however, is the integration with PayPal. It's possible to buy
and sell Bitcoin instantly using a connected PayPal account. That means rather
than waiting for transfers to go back and forth to bank accounts (which
takes days, even in our modern world), it's possible to send money via
PayPal in a flash. It seems like a silly thing to get excited about, but
far more people are comfortable with PayPal than are comfortable with
Bitcoin, so having the ability to transfer back and forth is very nice.
</p><p>
Also, I've mentioned it before, but the too-good-to-be-true service
offered by Purse (<a href="https://purse.io" target="_self">https://purse.io</a>) is still amazingly reliable. You literally
can get 15&ndash;20% or more off purchases from Amazon by using Bitcoin instead
of paying directly. The system works by having people who can purchase from
Amazon, but can't buy Bitcoin (maybe they have Amazon gift cards, or
maybe they're from a country where buying Bitcoin is hard), buy items from
your wish list in return for Bitcoin. Purse acts as an escrow service,
and the entire process is simple. Plus, it works. The shipping often
takes a couple extra days as you're waiting for someone to
&ldquo;buy&rdquo; your
offer, but if the item is something you can afford to wait on (such as
Christmas gifts), it's a wonderful way to save significant money. And,
most of us in the US easily can buy Bitcoin from Coinbase. In fact,
Coinbase allows you to store your money as US dollars so the volatility
of Bitcoin doesn't burn you while your money is stored there.

Being Big Brother, or Father</h2></div></div><p>
I love automation, the IoT, smart houses and quite frankly, data
in general. My family has a mix of phones (various iPhones and 
Androids), and now that my eldest is in college, we're separated by
geography as well. Thankfully, we can all keep track of each other
with Life 360. If you're creeped out by the idea of your family, and
potentially the Life 360 company knowing your every move, I highly
recommend you <span   class="emphasis"><em>do not</em></span> install the program. It's a real-time GPS tracker that
shares your location with others in your circle. It doesn't have to be
a family circle, but that certainly makes the most sense in my case. It
also allows two free geo-fenced areas that allow you to get notifications
when circle members come and go. For example, we have &ldquo;Home&rdquo;
and &ldquo;School&rdquo;
as our two free locations, so whenever the kids and my wife go to school
(she's a teacher), I get notifications. When they leave to come home, I get
notifications, and I can start dinner. In addition, we like that anyone
in the family can look and see where the others are at a glance. Again,
we're not concerned about privacy, but if you are, Life 360 might not
be for you. Check it out at <a href="https://www.life360.com" target="_self">https://www.life360.com</a>.

The other issue we're facing with a daughter away at college is how to
monitor her car. A couple years ago we purchased &ldquo;Automatic&rdquo; devices
that plug in to the OBD2 port under the dash of modern vehicles. It syncs
with the driver's phone and explains check-engine lights, along with
monitoring driving speeds, and makes suggestions for saving fuel and so on. The
problem is that with our daughter leaving, it would sync only with her
phone, so I wouldn't be able to help her remotely. Thankfully, Automatic
has come out with a new product called Automatic Pro (Figure 5).
It's fairly pricey at $129, but it has built-in 3G data, built-in GPS, and
it works with If This Then That for triggering notifications. Plus, there's
no monthly fee. What it means is that when my daughter is driving around
campus and inevitably gets a check-engine notification on her 16-year-old
Volkswagen Beetle, and she calls me in a panic, I can help her
figure out how serious the problem is. Plus, it tracks her car, so if it's
stolen, we can help the police find it. And the icing on the cake is that
if she's in an accident, the Automatic Pro will call me
and the police automatically, even if she's unconscious and even if she doesn't have
her phone (it has 3G, remember?). I bought one for each of our vehicles,
and I sleep a lot better at night.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="12082f5.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

low-jacked!

Send Me More!</h2></div></div><p>
This type of column reminds me of the &ldquo;Lightning Talks&rdquo; that were popular
at conventions a few years ago. Sometimes it's nice to cover a
bunch of interesting things that deserve mention but aren't really
complex enough to warrant their own article. If you have cool tech info,
or interesting ways Linux is integrated into your life, drop me an email at
<a href="mailto:info@linuxjournal.com">info@linuxjournal.com</a>
and let me know. If I share with everyone, I'll be sure to give you
credit. Besides, sharing awesome ideas is really what the Open Source
community is all about. Expanding that beyond code is awesome!
