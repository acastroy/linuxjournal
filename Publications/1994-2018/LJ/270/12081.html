<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #270, October 2016</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kan Liang</b></span> recently tried to get some networking configuration code
into the kernel that would interpret a simple set of user policies in
order to tweak the networking code in subtle ways to speed up data
transfers as much as possible.
</p><p>
Unfortunately, although his ideas seemed sound to folks like <span   class="bold"><b>Stephen
Hemminger</b></span> and <span   class="bold"><b>Alexei
Starovoitov</b></span>, they both objected to including code
in the kernel that wasn't strictly necessary. They felt the same
features could be achieved entirely in user space.
</p><p>
Kan's argument that a user-space implementation would be more complex
and difficult fell on deaf ears. The same argument has been used many
times before, but the kernel folks have to take a hard line on the
issue or risk the kernel being overrun with bloat. Some even
would argue that this already has happened.
</p><p>
Because of this, unless Kan finds a better argument, it doesn't seem
likely that his code will get into the kernel, although it could very
well become a tightly integrated user-space tool.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>William C. Roberts</b></span> recently posted some code to randomize the
locations of new memory allocations. This is a standard security
technique, but William wanted to apply it by default to all mmapped
memory regions.
</p><p>
Various folks objected that <span   class="bold"><b>Android</b></span> had experienced particular
problems with this sort of thing in the past, as it caused extreme
memory fragmentation that inevitably would lead to the failure of all
attempted memory requests.
</p><p>
The solution, as suggested by <span   class="bold"><b>Dave Hansen</b></span>, turned out to be simply
to disable William's patch on 32-bit systems. Once this idea was
presented, everyone immediately agreed that it would solve the
problem. Even William liked it.
</p><p>
Presto&mdash;an extremely rare case of a security issue having a simple,
clean solution that everyone agrees on.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Luis R. Rodriguez</b></span> and others have been simplifying the very complex
Linux boot procedure, in part by removing support for early access to
device firmware. Their hope was that kernel devices could access
firmware at a slightly later time in the boot process, after the
firmware could be made available on a mounted filesystem.
</p><p>
As it turned out, however, there were more pieces of code and more
use cases, such as embedded systems, relying on early access to
firmware than Luis had realized. After some discussion, it became
clear that support for a few remaining users of early firmware access
would have to remain in the kernel, at least for now, and that a more
gradual approach to rooting out the remaining users would have to be
taken.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Rafael J. Wysocki</b></span> recently proposed a new kind of runtime driver
dependency, in which a given driver could be loaded only if the
drivers it depends on are also loaded, and may be unloaded only if no
other drivers depend upon it.
</p><p>
It turns out there are some nuances to get right before something like
this really could be accomplished. For one thing, the code to
implement dependencies might look awfully similar to the existing code
to probe for resources before loading a given driver. It would be
important to avoid too much code duplication, which might require
refactoring that entire area of the kernel source.
</p><p>
There's also the question of when a dependency might be identified.
For some drivers, certain dependencies would be clearly known and
could be registered in a configuration file. For others, a dependency
would be based on which other drivers already had been loaded and
could provide certain resources, so there would have to be at least
two phases of dependency identification.
</p><p>
Some dependencies also might be &ldquo;weak&rdquo;&mdash;useful if present, but not
absolutely needed for normal operations.
</p><p>
After some discussion, Rafael posted some code implementing the
beginnings of his idea. There seems to be general approval of the
overall concept. The only issues are exactly how to support the various
features and how to avoid too much complexity in the implementation.

<h2 class="title">Android Candy: That App Is for the Birds!</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #270, October 2016</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Usually bird-related apps involve pigs and anger, but if you're a bird
watcher like myself, there's another bird app you must download. Cornell
Labs has released a free app called Merlin Bird ID that helps identify
birds you see in the wild.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12081androidf1.large.jpg"><img src="12081androidf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
(Image from Google Play Store)
</p></div></div><p>
Hundreds of books are available to help you figure out what sort of
bird you're looking at, but Merlin uses several metrics to narrow down
the feathery mystery. It uses:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Size.
</p></li><li><p>
Color(s).
</p></li><li><p>
Geographic location (via GPS).
</p></li><li><p>
Time of year.
</p></li><li><p>
Environment (on tree, in water, on ground and so on).
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Once it narrows down the options to a handful of birds, it provides photos
of the male, female and juvenile varieties. It even includes a button
that lets you listen to their particular birdsong.
</p><p>
If you're a bird-lover, or just like to sound smart in front of your
friends, the Merlin Bird ID app is a must-have. It's completely free
and remarkably accurate. Find it on the Google Play store today!

<h2 class="title">Chemistry on the Desktop</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Joey Bernard</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #270, October 2016</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
For this article, I thought I'd introduce another chemistry
application&mdash;specifically, BKChem, a free chemical drawing program.
As opposed to many other chemistry
applications, BKChem provides both a nice GUI for constructing molecules
and a set of chemical analysis tools to look at the properties of the newly
constructed molecule. 
</p><p>
Most distributions should have a package available
to make installation easier&mdash;for example, Debian-based distributions
can install BKChem with the following command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo apt-get install bkchem
</pre>
</p><p>
Once BKChem is installed, you can start it either from the menu
entry or by executing the command <tt  >bkchem</tt> from a terminal window. 
</p><p>
When
it first opens, you'll see a blank screen where you can start your
chemical construction.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12081bkf1.large.jpg"><img src="12081bkf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. When you first start BKChem, you get a blank canvas to start
building your molecule.
</p></div></div><p>
If you have a previously created
molecule, you can load it by clicking the File&rarr;Load menu item, which
will load the data into a new tab, or you can click the File&rarr;Load
to the same tab menu option to load it into the currently active tab. 
</p><p>
BKChem 
also can import data from other file formats. If you click 
File&rarr;Import, you'll see that you can import files with CML,
CML2 or Molfile formats. 
</p><p>
If you want to start by building your own molecule,
several menus of building blocks are available. They are laid
out as a pair of rows, just below the menu listings at the top of the
window. The top row of icons selects which list of icons will be available
in the second row. The first icon in the first row is simply an arrow,
allowing you to select objects within your molecule so you can edit their
properties. The next icon pulls up the row of drawing elements where you
can start to draw your new molecule. 
</p><p>
There are several choices in terms
of line thicknesses, styles and bond angles, and you can create a chain of
elements simply by clicking on the end of an existing line segment. 
</p><p>
Once
you have the basics of your structure laid out, you'll want to edit the
details next. To do this, click on the first icon again (captioned with
&ldquo;edit&rdquo;), and then click on the structure element you want to edit. This
is where having a proper mouse is a must, as you need to click with the
middle button on your mouse to pull up the edit panel.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12081bkf2.large.jpg"><img src="12081bkf2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. You can edit an element by clicking the middle mouse button. The
menu you get depends on the type of element you are editing.
</p></div></div><p>
If you are using a laptop touch panel, you need to click the left and
right buttons together and then scroll with the touch pad itself. As
an example, if you click on an atom, you can change the atom in this
location or even replace it with some type of atomic group, such as an
alcohol group. 
</p><p>
You also can edit all kinds of display options, such as
colors used, fonts for text, text placement and line widths. 
</p><p>
The third
icon on the top icon row pulls up a list of available templates for larger
commonly used atomic structures, such as benzene rings. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12081bkf3.large.jpg"><img src="12081bkf3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. You can add larger commonly used structures with templates.
</p></div></div><p>
The fourth icon on the top row lets you pull up a list of
templates that you have created previously, allowing you to add templates
for those substructures that you use most often.
</p><p>
You may need to play with the display in order to be able to
see everything clearly while you are working. The appropriate
instructions are under the Object menu item. The first option on that menu
is Scale. Selecting either a portion of your structure or
the whole thing, you essentially can zoom in or out to see the
structure better as you work on it.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="12081bkf4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. You can scale parts of your molecular structure to make it easier
to work on.
</p></div></div><p>
You also can make changes to the display, such as altering the stack layers
or mirroring horizontally or vertically. 
</p><p>
The last option available
is the Object&rarr;Configure menu item. This will pop up another window
where you easily can change atom, bond, font or common details for the
display. This is also the same window that appears when
you click on the Properties item on the Edit menu (which you get when
clicking
the middle mouse button).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="12081bkf5.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. A configuration window allows you to edit properties of
your structure's elements easily.
</p></div></div><p>
So far, I've just been describing building up a molecule.
In the rest of the screenshots here I'm using a 
simple benzene ring to discuss the
chemistry you can do with BKChem. 
</p><p>
You can get basic information about
your structure by clicking on Chemistry&rarr;Info, which will
pop up a new window with items like the chemical formula, molecular
weight and composition. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12081bkf6.large.jpg"><img src="12081bkf6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. You can get a list of basic chemical information about your
structure.
</p></div></div><p>
If you want to check to see whether
the structure you've built makes sense, you can select it and click on
the Chemistry&rarr;Check chemistry menu item. If everything makes sense,
you'll see a new window telling you that everything is okay. Otherwise,
you'll get an error message highlighting what doesn't quite work
from a chemical point of view. This is where you may need to dig into
the grittier items available from the Edit menu when you click on an
element with the middle mouse button. You may need to change the type
of atom or change its valency. As an example of the type of error you
might encounter, see what happened when I changed one of the carbon atoms
to an oxygen atom in the benzene ring (Figure 7).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12081bkf6.large.jpg"><img src="12081bkf6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 7. Sometimes, the chemistry doesn't work out.
</p></div></div><p>
At the far right
side of the menu bar, there is an entry for available plugins. One of
these plugins allows you to calculate bond angles. You can select two
connected bonds by holding down the Shift key and clicking them one after
the other. Then you can click on the Plugins&rarr;Angle between bonds menu
item to calculate the angle.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12081bkf8.large.jpg"><img src="12081bkf8.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 8. You can calculate bond angles for your molecule.
</p></div></div><p>
When you've finished all of the work of creating your new molecular
structure, you'll want to save it for further analysis or to share
with other researchers. The default file format that structures are
saved in is an SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) file. If you want to
save your work using a different file format, click on 
File&rarr;Export to get a list of all the supported file formats.
Most of them are simply other graphics file formats, but
a few
are specifically used for storing chemical information. 
</p><p>
You
can select CML or CML2 (Chemical Markup Language) to save more of the
chemical information for your structure. You also can save your structure
in the molfile file format, which was created by MDL Information Systems
to store more detailed information about a chemical structure. If you
just want an easily shared image of your molecular structure, you can
export it into either a PDF or PNG file.
</p><p>
As you have seen here, you can use BKChem to build molecular
structures in a way similar to many other chemistry applications. What is
slightly different with BKChem is that you can do some basic chemistry
with your newly created structure directly from BKChem. This added
functionality might be enough to make BKChem a tool you'll want to add to your
arsenal.

<h2 class="title">Non-Linux FOSS: Don't Drink the Apple Kool-Aid; Brew Your Own!</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #270, October 2016</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Some tools that I use on the command line are so basic and
so ingrained in my day-to-day actions that it's weird when they're not
available. This often happens to me on OS X. I love that OS X has UNIX
underpinnings. I love that the terminal window is a
<span   class="emphasis"><em>real</em></span> terminal
window and works like a terminal window should work.
</p><p>
But, I don't like the lack of basic tools that are available. Even more,
I dislike that I can't simply <tt  >apt-get</tt> (or
<tt  >yum</tt>) the missing applications
into my system. Thankfully, I'm not alone. If you've ever opened a
terminal window on OS X and tried to use <tt  >wget</tt>, you know the feeling
too. Enter: Homebrew.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12081fossf1.large.jpg"><img src="12081fossf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
(Image from <a href="http://brew.sh" target="_self">brew.sh</a>)
</p></div></div><p>
The concept of Homebrew has been around for quite a while. Fink, MacPorts
and probably a few others give you the options to install software that
isn't part of OS X itself. Those other options make me uncomfortable,
however, because they're more integrated into the UNIX ports system. It
might seem odd that better integration makes me uncomfortable, but it
does. I'd rather have something I can erase easily without affecting the
rest of the system. I'd rather have the non-native applications live
separately from the native apps. Part of that is personal preference,
but part of it is based on years of experience with troubleshooting
problems. If there's a problem with Homebrew, it's much easier to
troubleshoot.
</p><p>
Anyway, if you'd like to have a package manager for some of the
&ldquo;missing&rdquo;
programs in OS X, but you'd also like to be able to delete the entire
system fairly simply, Homebrew is perfect for you. Simply head over to
<a href="http://brew.sh" target="_self">brew.sh</a> (cool URL, right?) and paste the installation script
into a terminal window. There's an un-install script as well, or you
simply can delete the bits manually. Even if you're just curious, it's
easy to install Homebrew and give it a go. In fact, thanks to its simple
install/un-install and the incredible convenience of having common tools
available on OS X, Homebrew gets this month's Editors' Choice award. If
you have a Mac, check it out.

Most of you have a web server installed on your network somewhere. In fact,
most of you probably have several. In a pinch, however, getting to the web directory
can be difficult. Thankfully, there's a super-simple, incredibly awesome
one-liner you can type to get a functional web server running and serving
out your current directory:

<pre     class="programlisting">
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
</pre>
</p><p>
That one-liner (or the Python 3 alternative, <tt  >python -m
http.server</tt>)
will start a web server on port 8000, serving files from your current
directory. Usually pressing ^C will stop the server, but if not, some more
command-line fu will stop the process as well:

<pre     class="programlisting">
kill `ps | grep SimpleHTTP | grep -v grep | awk '{print $1}'`
</pre>
</p><p>
It's possible to change the port by adding it after the
<tt  >SimpleHTTPServer</tt>, but since you're running as a user, you won't
be able to run on a privileged port. 
</p><p>
(Thanks to jafraldo on
<a href="http://www.commandlinefu.com" target="_self">www.commandlinefu.com</a> for the kill script.)

I'm a bit of a weather nut. It might be because I'm getting older, but
for some reason, the weather fascinates me. I'm not quite to the point
that I watch The Weather Channel on a regular basis, but I do check the
forecast often.
</p><p>
I also spend the vast majority of my day in a terminal window. Until
recently, if I wanted to check the weather, I had to open a browser
and click a link in order to get the forecast. Thanks to Igor Chubin
(@igor_chubin on Twitter), I now can get the forecast from the comfort
of my terminal window. All you need to do is type:

<pre     class="programlisting">
curl wttr.in/your_town
</pre>
</p><p>
and you'll get a nice text-based graphical forecast. You also can view the
page in a web browser if you prefer (it looks cool there too), but being
able to whip up a forecast on the command line is just awesome. I've
tried using city names and zip codes, and both seem to work well. If you
want to know what the weather is like, but don't want to open a window,
give it a try!
