Dave receives a half-written script from a reader and realizes
it's easily replaced with <tt  >find</tt>&mdash;or is it? The problem might
be more subtle than it first appears.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x170d580.0x18053b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
I received a very interesting script from reader Jeremy Stent via e-mail, and
our subsequent conversation is something other script writers should
consider too.
</p><p>
First off, here's the script he sent in:

<pre     class="programlisting">
function recurse_dir()

{
        for f in * ; do
          if [ -d "${f}" ] ; then
            pushd "${f}" 
            recurse_dir 
            popd
          fi
        done
}

pushd ~/dir 
recurse_dir 
popd 
</pre>
</p><p>
It's an interesting little script, and in case you aren't sure
what's going on, it basically is recursively stepping through a directory
tree. It's not actually doing anything, not even pushing any output,
just recursing.
</p><p>
Of course, it'd be easy to add output or commands, but I was a bit
baffled about the script's purpose when I received it. It's also hard to
understand why there are so many
<tt  >pushd</tt>/<tt  >popd</tt> invocations as
well.
</p><p>
The original e-mail message actually was about how to deal with tricky filenames
that contain spaces or punctuation, but that's usually just managed by
ensuring that every time you reference a filename, you include quotes.
Doing so
breaks the &ldquo;for&rdquo; statement, however, as is easily understood if you
think about the fact that Bash uses white space (space, tab) as the field
separator (aka &ldquo;FS&rdquo;). 
</p><p>
So if the current directory contains a file called &ldquo;hello
world&rdquo;,
the &ldquo;for&rdquo; loop will offer up values of the &ldquo;f&rdquo; variable
&ldquo;hello&rdquo;, then &ldquo;world&rdquo;, both of which are invalid filenames.
This is one of the many reasons Linux is really clumsy with modern
filenames, whether they contain punctuation or white space.
</p><p>
Still, here's how I responded to the query e-mail:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
That's an interesting script you're trying to build. I'm
not clear why you're using push/pop as you traverse the directories
too. Why not just have <tt  >cd ${f}</tt> followed by
<tt  >cd ..</tt> to get
back up a level and simplify things?
</p><p>
In terms of difficult filenames, yeah, Linux wasn't really written
to deal with filenames that start with a dash, have a space or other
punctuation. The best you can do is experiment to see if the commands
you're using accept -- as a way to delineate that you're done
with command arguments, and quote the directory names themselves, as
you've done.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Where the entire dialog got interesting was with his response, when he
finally explained what he was trying to do: &ldquo;My end intent is to remove
the execute bit from files in a directory tree. Running
<tt  >rsync</tt> from a
Windows box sometimes sets execute on files that I do not want. I do not
want to remove the execute bit from directories, so I write a script like
this.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Ah, I realized what he was trying to do, and the answer is actually quite
straightforward: use <tt  >find</tt>, not a shell script.
</p><p>
In fact, the <tt  >find</tt> command is more than capable of traversing a
filesystem, identifying non-directory files and changing their
permissions to remove an execute bit that's presumably erroneously
set.
</p><p>
(I say &ldquo;presumably erroneously set&rdquo;, because there are actually a
number of situations where a non-directory should retain its execute
permission, including any shell, Perl or Ruby script and any compiled
program, whether written in C++, Pascal or Fortran. In fact, blindly
removing execute permission is problematic across any large piece of the
Linux filesystem.)
</p><p>
On the assumption that the writer does want to proceed by removing the
executable permission on files in a subsystem of the file tree, it's
easily done with:
  
<pre     class="programlisting">
find . -type f -exec chmod -x {} ;
</pre>
</p><p>
To understand that, start with the benign alternative:
  
<pre     class="programlisting">
find . -type f -exec echo {} ;
</pre>
</p><p>
This simple invocation of <tt  >find</tt> will give you a quick list of every
non-directory file in the current directory and any subdirectory below. 
</p><p>
If you do dig in to the <tt  >find</tt> man page, don't be misled by one of the
other predicates: <tt  >-perm</tt> lets you test permissions, not change them. So if
you wanted to limit things to only those files that were executable,
<tt  >-perm
+x</tt> would make sense.

Sidetracks, We Have Sidetracks</h2></div></div><p>
This problem of trying to debug a complex shell script when a simple Linux
command invocation will do the trick is not uncommon, and it's one of
the challenges for all developers. Unless you're in a shell programming
class, the goal is what should dictate the solution path, not the tools.
In other words, just because you happen to have a desire to learn more
about shell script programming, doesn't mean that it's always the
best and smartest solution for a given challenge.
</p><p>
And in terms of the original script, here's an interesting variation:
what if you used <tt  >find</tt> to generate a list of all files, then probed to see if
you could ascertain whether a given file is associated with program source
code (for example, it finds &ldquo;hello&rdquo; and then tests to see if
&ldquo;hello.c&rdquo; exists) or if it's a shell script (information obtainable
through the <tt  >file</tt> command)?
</p><p>
Here's my first stab at this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
for filename in $(find . -type f -print) ; do
 if [ -x $filename ] ; then
    echo "File $filename is executable:"
    if [ ! -z "$(file $filename | grep "shell script")" ] ; then
      echo "  It's okay, it appears to be a shell script."
    elif [ -f "${filename}.c" -o -f "${filename}.cxx" ] ; then
      echo "  It's okay, there's a corresponding source file."
    else
      echo "  &gt;&gt; might be erroneously marked executable."
    fi
  fi
done
</pre>
</p><p>
You can see that I'm using the <tt  >find</tt> command to generate a list of every
file from the current spot in the filesystem downward, so if there are
lots of directories, this might generate quite a list. If there are too
many,
the shell can complain that it has run out of buffer, but that's
a problem I'll sidestep in the interest of simplicity.
</p><p>
To test whether the executable file is a shell script, there are two basic
output formats for the <tt  >file</tt> command, as demonstrated
here:

<pre     class="programlisting">
test.sh: POSIX shell script, ASCII text executable
test.sh: POSIX shell script text executable
</pre>
</p><p>
In either case, a simple test for &ldquo;shell script&rdquo; does the trick, as
you can see if you closely examine the second conditional statement.
</p><p>
To see if the executable file is associated with a C or C++ source file,
those are tested against the &ldquo;.c&rdquo; and &ldquo;.cxx&rdquo; filename
suffixes in the <tt  >elif</tt> statement. Keep in mind that
<tt  >-o</tt> is a logical
<tt  >OR</tt>, so the test is literally &ldquo;if the .c file exists OR the .cxx file
exists&rdquo;.
</p><p>
A quick run of this script produces this output:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sh test.sh
File ./taylor-trust.pdf is executable:
  &gt;&gt; might be erroneously marked executable.
File ./hello is executable:
  It's okay, there's a corresponding source file.
File ./plus is executable:
  It's okay, there's a corresponding source file.
File ./test.sh is executable:
  It's okay, it appears to be a shell script.
</pre>
</p><p>
You can see that the script has recognized correctly that test.sh is a
shell script (the last file tested), that &ldquo;hello&rdquo; and
&ldquo;plus&rdquo; are both associated with source files (one a C program and
the other a C++ program), but that the file taylor-trust.pdf is probably
erroneously marked as executable. 
</p><p>
In fact, PDF files shouldn't be executable, so the output is exactly as
desired. It's a simple matter to add a <tt  >chmod -x</tt> where the
error message about erroneous executable files is located in the script
source.
</p><p>
By focusing too closely on the script, you could have spent a lot of time
debugging something unneeded. That initial problem was solved more easily 
with a single invocation to <tt  >find</tt>. Thinking about it more,
however, it's clear that a more sophisticated algorithm is required to
ensure that getting rid of the execute permission could be a problem, so a
more sophisticated set of tests is required&mdash;and easily solved.
