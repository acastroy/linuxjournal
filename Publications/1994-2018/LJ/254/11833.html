Use Docker and Weave to build container-based systems.

Containers can be considered the third wave in service provision after
physical boxes (the first wave) and virtual machines (the second
wave). Instead of working with complete servers
(hardware or virtual), you
have virtual operating systems, which are far more lightweight. Instead of
carrying around complete environments, you just move applications, with
their configuration, from one server to another, where it will consume
its resources, without any virtual layers. Shipping over projects from
development to operations also is simplified&mdash;another boon. Of course,
you'll face new and different challenges, as with any technology, but the
possible risks and problems don't seem to be insurmountable, and the final
rewards appear to be great.
</p><p>
Docker is an open-source project based on Linux containers that
is showing high rates of adoption. Docker's first release was only a couple
years ago, so the technology isn't yet
considered mature, but it shows much promise. The combination
of lower costs, simpler deployment and faster start times certainly
helps.
</p><p>
In this article, I go over some details of setting up a system
based on several independent containers, each providing a distinct,
separate role, and I explain some aspects of the underlying network
configuration. You can't think about production deployment without being
aware of how connections are made, how ports are used and how bridges
and routing are set up, so I examine those points as well, while putting a
simple Web database query application in place.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16c3580.0x17bb568"></a>
Basic Container Networking</h2></div></div><p>
Let's start by considering how Docker configures network aspects. When
the Docker service d&aelig;mon starts, it configures a virtual bridge,
<tt  >docker0</tt>, on the host system (Figure 1). Docker picks a subnet
not in use on the host and assigns a free IP address to the bridge. The first try is
172.17.42.1/16, but that could be different if there
are conflicts. This virtual bridge handles all host-containers
communications. 
</p><p>
When Docker starts a container, by default, it
creates a virtual interface on the host with a unique name, such as
<tt  >veth220960a</tt>, and an address within the same subnet. This new
interface will be connected to the <tt  >eth0</tt> interface on the container
itself. In order to allow connections, iptables rules are added,
using a <tt  >DOCKER</tt>-named chain. Network address translation (NAT) is
used to forward traffic to external hosts, and the host machine must be
set up to forward IP packets.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11833f1.large.jpg"><img src="11833f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Docker uses a bridge to connect all containers on the same host to
the local network.
</p></div></div><p>
The standard way to connect a container is in &ldquo;bridged&rdquo; mode, as described
previously. However, for special cases, there are more ways to do
this, which depend on the <tt  >-net</tt> option for the <tt  >docker
run</tt>
command. Here's a list of all available modes:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
<tt  >-net=bridge</tt> &mdash; The new container uses a bridge
to connect to the rest of the network. Only its exported public ports will
be accessible from the outside.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >-net=container:ANOTHER.ONE</tt> &mdash; The new container
will use the network stack of a previously defined container. It will share
its IP address and port numbers.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >-net=host</tt> &mdash; This is a dangerous option. Docker won't
separate the container's network from the host's. The new container will
have full access to the host's network stack. This can cause
problems and security risks!
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >-net=none</tt> &mdash; Docker won't configure the
container network at all. If you want, you can set up your own iptables
rules (see Resources if you're interested in this). Even without the network, the
container could contact the world by shared directories, for example.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Docker also sets up each container so it will have DNS resolution
information. Run <tt  >findmnt</tt> inside a container to produce something
along the lines of Listing 1. By default, Docker uses the host's
/etc/resolv.conf data for DNS resolution. You can use different
nameservers and search lists with the <tt  >--dns</tt> and
<tt  >--dns-search</tt>
options.

</pre></div><p>
Now that you have an idea about how Docker sets up networking for
individual containers, let's develop a small system that will be deployed
via containers and then finish by working out how to connect all the pieces
together.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16c3580.0x17bc380"></a>
Designing Your Application: the World Database</h2></div></div><p>
Let's say you need an application that will let you search for cities that include a given text string in their
names. (Figure 2 shows a sample run.) For this example, I used the geographical
information at GeoNames (see Resources) to create an appropriate
database. Basically, you work with countries (identified by their ISO
3166-1 two-letter codes, such as &ldquo;UY&rdquo; for &ldquo;Uruguay&rdquo;) and cities (with a
name, a pair of coordinates and the country to which they belong). Users
will be able to enter part of the city name and get all the matching
cities (not very complex).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11833f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. This sample application finds these cities with DARWIN in their names.
</p></div></div><p>
How should you design your mini-system? Docker is meant to package single
applications, so in order to take advantage of containers, you'll run
separate containers for each required role. (This doesn't necessarily
imply that only a single process may run on a container. A container
should fulfill a single, definite role, and if that implies running
two or more programs, that's fine. With this very simple example, you'll
have a single process per container, but that need not be the general
case.) 
</p><p>
You'll need a Web server, which will run in a container, and
a database server, in a separate container. The Web server will access
the database server, and end users will need connections to the Web
server, so you'll have to set up those network connections.
</p><p>
Start by creating the database container, and there's no need to
start from scratch. You can work with the official MySQL Docker image
(see Resources) and save a bit of time. The Dockerfile that produces
the image can specify how to download the required geographical data.
The <tt  >RUN</tt> commands set up a loaddata.sh script that takes care of
that. (For purists: a single longer <tt  >RUN</tt> command would have
sufficed, but I
used three here for clarity.) See Listing 2 for the complete Dockerfile
file; it should reside in an otherwise empty directory. Building the
<tt  >worlddb</tt> image itself can be done from that directory with the
<tt  >sudo docker build -t worlddb .</tt> command.

Searching for Data: Your Web Site</h2></div></div><p>
Now let's work on the other part of the system. You can take advantage
of the official PHP Docker image, which also includes Apache. All you need
is to add the <tt  >php5-mysql</tt> extension to be able to connect
to the database server. The script should be in a new directory, along
with search.php, the complete code for this &ldquo;system&rdquo;. Building this
image, which you'll name &ldquo;worldweb&rdquo;, requires the <tt  >sudo docker build
-t worldweb .</tt> command (Listing 3).

Linking Containers</h2></div></div><p>
Given the images that you built for this example, creating both containers is simple,
but you want the Web server to be able to reach the database
server. The
easiest way is by linking the containers together. First, you start and
initialize the database container (Listing 5).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16c3580.0x1ac83d0"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>

</pre></div><p>
Now, start the Web container, with <tt  >docker run -it -d -p 80:80
--link MYDB:MYDB --name MYWEB worldweb</tt>. This command has a couple
interesting options:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
<tt  >-p 80:80</tt> &mdash; This means that port 80 (the standard
HTTP port) from the container will be published as port 80 on the host
machine itself.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >--link MYDB:MYDB</tt> &mdash; This means that the
MYDB
container (which you started earlier) will be accessible from the
MYWEB
container, also under the alias MYDB. (Using the database container
name as the alias is logical, but not mandatory.) The MYDB container won't
be visible from the network, just from MYWEB.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
In the MYWEB container, /etc/hosts includes an entry for
each linked container (Listing 6). Now you can see how search.php
connects to the database. It refers to it by the name given when linking containers (see the 
<tt  >mysqli_connect</tt>
call in Listing 4). In this
example, MYDB is running at IP 172.17.0.2, and
MYWEB is at 172.17.0.3.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16c3580.0x1ac89a8"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>

</pre></div><p>
The environment variables basically provide all the connection data for
each linkage: what container it links to, using which port and protocol,
and how to access each exported port from the destination container. In
this case, the MySQL container just exports the standard 3306 port and
uses TCP to connect. There's just a single problem with some of these
variables. Should you happen to restart the MYDB container, Docker won't
update them (although it would update the /etc/hosts information),
so you must be careful if you use them!
</p><p>
Examining the iptables configuration, you'll find a <tt  >DOCKER</tt> new
chain (Listing 7). Port 80 on the host machine is connected to port 80
(<tt  >http</tt>) in the MYWEB container, and there's a connection for port
3306 (<tt  >mysql</tt>) linking MYWEB to MYDB.

If you need to have circular links (container A links to container B,
and vice versa), you are out of luck with standard Docker links, because
you can't link to a non-running container! You might want to look into
docker-dns (see Resources), which can create DNS records dynamically
based upon running containers. (And in fact, you'll be using DNS later in this example
when you set up containers in separate hosts.) Another possibility would
imply creating a third container, C, to which both A and B would link,
and through which they would be interconnected. You also could look into
orchestration packages and service registration/discovery packages.
Docker is still evolving in these areas, and new solutions may be available at any
time.
</p><p>
You just saw how to link containers together, but there's a catch
with this. It works only with containers on the same host, not on
separate hosts. People are working on fixing this restriction, but there's
an appropriate solution that can be used for now.

Weaving Remote Containers Together</h2></div></div><p>
If you had containers running on different servers, both local
and remote ones, you could set up everything so the containers 
eventually could connect with each other, but it would be a lot of work
and a complex configuration as well. Weave (currently on version
0.9.0, but quickly evolving; see Resources to get the latest version)
lets you define a virtual network, so that containers can 
connect to each other transparently (optionally using encryption for added security),
as if they were all on the same server. Weave behaves as a sort of giant
switch, with all your containers connected in the same virtual
network.
An instance must run on each host to do the routing work.
</p><p>
Locally, on the server where it runs, a Weave router establishes a network
bridge, prosaically named weave. It also adds virtual Ethernet
connections from each container and from the Weave router itself to
the bridge. Every time a local container needs to contact a remote one,
packets are forwarded (possibly with &ldquo;multi-hop&rdquo; routing) to other Weave
routers, until they are delivered by the (remote) Weave router to the
remote container. Local traffic isn't affected; this forwarding 
applies only to remote containers (Figure 3).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11833f3.large.jpg"><img src="11833f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Weave adds several virtual devices to redirect some
of the traffic eventually to other servers.
</p></div></div><p>
Building a network out of containers is a matter of launching Weave on
each server and then starting the containers. (Okay, there is a missing
step here; I'll get to that soon.) First, launch Weave on each server
with <tt  >sudo weave launch</tt>. If you plan to connect containers across
untrusted networks, add a password (obviously, the same for all Weave
instances) by adding the <tt  >-password some.secret.password</tt> option. If
all your servers are within a secure network, you can do without that. See the sidebar
for a list of all
the available <tt  >weave</tt> command-line options.

<tt  >weave version</tt> &mdash; List the versions of the running Weave

</p></li></ul></div></div><p>
When you connect two Weave routers, they exchange topology
information to &ldquo;learn&rdquo; about the rest of the network. The gathered
data is used for routing decisions to avoid unnecessary packet
broadcasts. To detect possible changes and to work around any
network problems that might pop up, Weave routers routinely monitor
connections. To connect two routers, on a server, type the <tt  >weave
connect the.ip.of.another.server</tt> command. (To drop a Weave router,
do <tt  >weave forget ip.of.the.dropped.host</tt>.) Whenever you add a new
Weave router to an existing network, you don't need to connect it to
every previous router. All you need to do is provide it with the address of a
single existing Weave instance in the same network, and from that point
on, it will gather all topology information on its own. The rest of the
routers similarly will update their own information in the process.
</p><p>
Let's start Docker containers, attached to Weave routers. The containers
themselves run as before; the only difference is they are started
through Weave. Local network connections work as before, but connections
to remote containers are managed by Weave, which encapsulates (and
encrypts) traffic and sends it to a remote Weave instance. (This uses
port 6783, which must be open and accessible on all servers running
Weave.) Although I won't go into this here, for more complex applications,
you could have several independent subnets, so containers for the same
application would be able to talk among themselves, but not with
containers for other applications.
</p><p>
First, decide which (unused) subnet you'll use, and assign a different
IP on it to each container. Then, you can <tt  >weave run</tt> each
container to launch it through Docker, setting up all needed network
connections. However, here you'll hit a snag, which has to do with the
missing step I mentioned earlier. How will containers on different hosts
connect to each other? Docker's <tt  >--link</tt> option works only within a
host, and it won't work if you try to link to containers on other hosts. Of
course, you might work with IPs, but maintenance for that setup would
be a chore. The best solution is using DNS, and Weave already includes
an appropriate package, WeaveDNS.
</p><p>
WeaveDNS (a Docker container on its own) runs over a Weave network. A
WeaveDNS instance must run on each server on the network, with the
<tt  >weave launch-dns</tt> command. You must use a different, unused subnet
for WeaveDNS and assign a distinct IP within it to each instance. Then,
when starting a Docker container, add a <tt  >--with-dns</tt> option, so DNS
information will be available. You should give containers a hostname in
the <tt  >.weave.local</tt> domain, which will be entered automatically into
the WeaveDNS registers. A complete network will look like Figure 4.

Figure 4. Using Weave, containers in local and remote networks connect to each other
transparently; access is simplified with Weave DNS.
</p></div></div><p>
Now, let's get your mini-system to run. I'm going to cheat a little, and
instead of a remote server, I'll use a virtual machine for this example. My main
box (at 192.168.1.200) runs OpenSUSE 13.2, while the virtual machine
(at 192.168.1.108) runs Linux Mint 17, just for variety. Despite the
different distributions, Docker containers will work just the same,
which shows its true portability (Listing 8).

$ C=$(weave run --with-dns 10.22.9.1/24 -it -d -e

$ # You can now enter MYDB with "docker exec -it $C bash"

 &#8618;MYWEB.weave.local --name MYWEB worldweb)
</pre></div><p>
The resulting configuration is shown in Figure 5. There are two hosts, on
192.168.1.200 and 192.168.1.108. Although it's not shown, both have port
6783 open for Weave to work. In the first host, you'll find the MYDB MySQL
container (at 10.22.9.1/24 with port 3306 open, but just on that subnet)
and a WeaveDNS server at 10.10.10.1/24. In the second host, you'll find the
MYWEB Apache+PHP container (at 10.22.9.2/24 with port 80 open, exported
to the server) and a WeaveDNS server at 10.10.10.2/24. From the outside,
only port 80 of the MYWEB container is accessible.

</p></div></div><p>
Because port 80 on the 192.168.1.108 server is directly connected to port 80
on the MYWEB server, you can access http://192.168.1.108/search.php
and get the Web page you saw earlier (in Figure 2). Now you have a multi-host
Weave network, with DNS services and remote Docker containers running
as if they resided at the same host&mdash;success!

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Now you know how to develop a multi-container system (okay, it's not very large, but
still), and you've learned some details on the internals of Docker
(and Weave) networking. Docker is still maturing, and surely even
better tools will appear to simplify configuration, distribution
and deployment of larger and more complex applications. The current
availability of networking solutions for containers shows you already
can begin to invest in these technologies, although be sure to keep up with
new developments to simplify your job even further.
