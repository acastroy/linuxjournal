Most of you probably have heard of Wireshark, a very popular and capable
network protocol analyzer. What you may not know is that there exists a
console version of Wireshark called tshark. The two main advantages of
tshark are that it can be used in scripts and on a remote computer through
an SSH connection. Its main disadvantage is that it does not have a GUI,
which can be really handy when you have to search lots of network data.
</p><p>
You can get tshark either from its Web site and compile it yourself or
from your Linux distribution as a precompiled package. The second way
is quicker and simpler. To install tshark on a Debian 7 system,
you just have to run the following command as root:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# apt-get install tshark

</p><p>
To find out whether tshark is installed properly, as well as its version, 
execute this command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ tshark -v
TShark 1.8.2
...
</pre>
</p><p>
Note: this article assumes that you already are familiar with
network data, TCP/IP, packet capturing and maybe Wireshark, and that you
want to know more about tshark.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a9c580.0x1b945c0"></a>
About tshark</h2></div></div><p>
tshark can do anything Wireshark can do, provided that it does not require
a GUI. It also can be used as a replacement for tcpdump, which used
to be the industry standard for network data capturing. Apart from the
capturing part, where both tools are equivalent, tshark is more powerful
than tcpdump; therefore, if you want to learn just one tool, tshark
should be your choice.
</p><p>
As you can imagine, tshark has many command-line options. Refer
to its man page for the full list.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a9c580.0x1b94778"></a>
Capturing Network Traffic Using tshark</h2></div></div><p>
The first command you should run is <tt  >sudo tshark -D</tt> to get a list
of the available network interfaces:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo tshark -D
1. eth0
2. nflog (Linux netfilter log (NFLOG) interface)
3. any (Pseudo-device that captures on all interfaces)
4. lo
</pre>
</p><p>
If you run tshark as a normal user, you most likely will get the
following output, because normal users do not have direct access to
network interface devices:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ tshark -D
tshark: There are no interfaces on which a capture can be done
</pre>
</p><p>
The simplest way of capturing data is by running
<tt  >tshark</tt> without any
parameters, which will display all data on screen. You can stop data
capturing by pressing Ctrl-C.
</p><p>
The output will scroll very fast on a busy network, so it won't be
helpful at all. Older computers could not keep up with a busy network,
so programs like tshark and tcpdump used to drop network packets. As
modern computers are pretty powerful, this is no longer an issue.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a9c580.0x1b94ae8"></a>
Saving and Reading Network Data Using Files</h2></div></div><p>
The single-most useful command-line parameter is <tt  >-w</tt>, followed by a
filename. This parameter allows you to save network data to a file in
order to process it later. The following tshark command captures 500
network packets (<tt  >-c 500</tt>) and saves them into a file called LJ.pcap
(<tt  >-w LJ.pcap</tt>):

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ tshark -c 500 -w LJ.pcap
</pre>
</p><p>
The second-most useful parameter is <tt  >-r</tt>. When followed by a valid
filename, it allows you to read and process a previously captured file
with network data.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a9c580.0x1b94e00"></a>
Capture Filters</h2></div></div><p>
Capture filters are filters that are applied during data capturing;
therefore, they make tshark discard network traffic that does not match
the filter criteria and avoids the creation of huge capture files. This
can be done using the <tt  >-f</tt> command-line parameter, followed by a
filter in double quotes.
</p><p>
The most important TCP-related Field Names used in capture filters are
tcp.port (which is for filtering the source or the destination TCP port),
tcp.srcport (which is for checking the TCP source port) and tcp.dstport
(which is for checking
the destination port).
</p><p>
Generally speaking, applying a filter after data capturing is considered
more practical and versatile than filtering during the capture stage,
because most of the time, you do not know in advance what you want to
inspect. Nevertheless, if you really know what you're doing, using
capture filters can save you time and disk space, and that is the main
reason for using them.
</p><p>
Remember that filter strings always should be written in lowercase.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a9c580.0x1b950c0"></a>
Display Filters</h2></div></div><p>
Display filters are filters that are applied after packet capturing;
therefore, they just &ldquo;hide&rdquo; network traffic without deleting it. You 
always can remove the effects of a display filter and get all your data
back.
</p><p>
Display Filters support comparison and logical operators. The
<tt  >http.response.code == 404 &amp;&amp;
ip.addr == 192.168.10.1</tt> display filter shows the traffic that either comes from the
192.168.10.1 IP address or goes to the 192.168.10.1 IP address that also has the 404 (Not
Found) HTTP response code in it. The <tt  >!bootp &amp;&amp;
!ip</tt> filter excludes BOOTP and IP traffic
from the output. The <tt  >eth.addr ==  01:23:45:67:89:ab &amp;&amp;
tcp.port == 25</tt> filter displays the
traffic to or from the network device with the 01:23:45:67:89:ab MAC address that uses TCP port
25 for its incoming or outgoing connections.
</p><p>
When defining rules, remember that the <tt  >ip.addr !=
192.168.1.5</tt>
expression does not mean that none of the <tt  >ip.addr</tt> fields can contain the
192.168.1.5 IP address. It means that one of the <tt  >ip.addr</tt> fields should
not contain the 192.168.1.5 IP address! Therefore, the other
<tt  >ip.addr</tt>
field value can be equal to 192.168.1.5! You can think of it as &ldquo;there
exists one <tt  >ip.addr</tt> field that is not 192.168.1.5&rdquo;. The correct way of
expressing it is by typing <tt  >!(ip.addr ==
192.168.1.5)</tt>. This is a common
misconception with display filters.
</p><p>
Also remember that MAC addresses are truly useful when you want to track
a given machine on your LAN, because the IP of a machine can change if
it uses DHCP, but its MAC address is more difficult to change.
</p><p>
Display filters are extremely useful tools when used correctly, but
you still have to interpret the results, find the problem and think
about the possible solutions yourself. It is advisable that you
visit the display filters reference site for TCP-related traffic at
<a href="http://www.wireshark.org/docs/dfref/t/tcp.html" target="_self">www.wireshark.org/docs/dfref/t/tcp.html</a>. For the list of all the
available field names related to UDP traffic, see
<a href="http://www.wireshark.org/docs/dfref/u/udp.html" target="_self">www.wireshark.org/docs/dfref/u/udp.html</a>.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a9c580.0x1b957a0"></a>
Exporting Data</h2></div></div><p>
Imagine you want to extract the frame number, the relative time
of the frame, the source IP address, the destination IP address,
the protocol of the packet and the length of the network packet from
previously captured network traffic. The following tshark command will
do the trick for you:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ tshark -r login.tcpdump -T fields -e frame.number -e 
 &#8618;frame.time_relative -e ip.src -e ip.dst -e 
 &#8618;frame.protocols -e frame.len -E header=y -E 
 &#8618;quote=n -E occurrence=f
</pre>
</p><p>
The <tt  >-E header=y</tt> option tells tshark first to print a header
line. The <tt  >-E  quote=n</tt> dictates that tshark not include the data
in quotes, and the <tt  >-E occurrence=f</tt> tells tshark to use
only the first occurrence for fields that have multiple occurrences.
</p><p>
Having plain text as output means that you easily can process it the
UNIX way. The following command shows the ten most popular IPs using
input from the <tt  >ip.src</tt> field:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ tshark -r ~/netData.pcap -T fields -e ip.src | sort 
 &#8618;| sed '/^\s*$/d' | uniq -c | sort -rn
 &#8618;| awk {'print $2 " " $1'} | head
</pre>

Two Python Scripts That Use tshark</h2></div></div><p>
Now, let's look at two Python scripts that read tshark's
text output and process it. I can't imagine doing the same thing
with a GUI application, such as Wireshark!
</p><p>
Listing 1 shows the full Python code of the first script that checks the validity of an
IP address.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a9c580.0x1b95cc8"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Listing 1. checkIP.py</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">
# Programmer: Mihalis Tsoukalos
# Date: Tuesday 28 October 2014

import socket
import sys
import re

def valid_ip(address):
    try:
        socket.inet_aton(address)
        return True
    except:
        return False

# Counters for the IPs
total = 0
valid = 0
invalid = 0

# Read the file from stdin, line by line
for line in sys.stdin:
        line = line.rstrip('\n')
        if valid_ip(line):
            valid = valid + 1
            # print "The IP is valid!"
        else:
            # print "The IP is not valid!"
            invalid = invalid + 1
        total = total + 1

# Present the total number of IPs checked
print "Total number of IPs checked:", total
print "Valid IPs found:", valid
print "Invalid IPs found:", invalid
</pre></div><p>
The purpose of the checkIP.py Python script is just to find invalid IP
addresses, and it implies that the network data already is captured with
tshark. You can use it as follows:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ tshark -r ~/networkData.pcap -T fields -e ip.src 
 &#8618;| python checkIP.py
Total number of IPs checked: 1000
Valid IPs found: 896
Invalid IPs found: 104
</pre>
</p><p>
Listing 2 shows the full code of the second Python script (storeMongo.py).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a9c580.0x1f8e230"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Listing 2. store Mongo.py</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">

        line = line.rstrip('\n')
        parsed = line.split("\t")
        total = total + 1

        # Construct the "record to be inserted
        netpacket = {
                'framenumber': parsed[0],
                'sourceIP': parsed[1],
                'destIP': parsed[2],
                'framelength': parsed[3],
                'IPlength': parsed[4]
                }

        # Store it!
        net_id = traffic.insert(netpacket)

connMongo.close()

# Present the total number of BSON documents written
print "Total number of documents stored: ", total
</pre></div><p>
The Python script shown in Listing 2 inserts network data into a MongoDB database
for further processing and querying. You can use any database you want.
The main reason I used MongoDB is because I like the flexibility it
offers when storing structured data that may have some irregular records
(records with missing fields).
</p><p>
The name of the Python script is storeMongo.py, and it assumes that the
network data already is captured using either tshark or tcpdump. The
next shell command runs the Python script with input from tshark:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ tshark -r ~/var/test.pcap -T fields -e frame.number 
 &#8618;-e ip.src -e ip.dst -e frame.len -e
 &#8618;ip.len -E header=n -E quote=n -E occurrence=f 
 &#8618;| python storeMongo.py
Total number of documents stored:  500
</pre>
</p><p>
The text output of the tshark command is similar to the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
5    yy.xx.zz.189    yyy.74.xxx.253  66      52
6    197.224.xxx.145 yyy.74.xxx.253  86      72
7    109.xxx.yyy.253 zzz.224.xxx.145 114     100
8    197.xxx.zzz.145 zzz.xxx.xxx.253 86      72
9    109.zzz.193.yyy 197.224.zzz.145 114     100
</pre>
</p><p>
Currently, all numerical values are stored as strings, but you easily
can convert them to numbers if you want. The following command converts all
string values from the IPlength column to their respective integer values:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt; db.netdata.find({IPlength : {$exists : true}}).forEach( 
 &#8618;function(obj) { obj.IPlength = new NumberInt( 
 &#8618;obj.IPlength ); db.netdata.save(obj); } );
</pre>
</p><p>
Now you can start querying the MongoDB database. The following commands
find all &ldquo;records&rdquo; (called documents in NoSQL terminology) that contain
a given destination IP address:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt; use LJ
switched to db LJ
&gt; db.netdata.find({ "destIP": "192.168.1.12" })
...
&gt;
</pre>
</p><p>
The next command finds all entries with a frame.len value that is less
than 70:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt; use LJ
switched to db LJ
&gt; db.netdata.find({ "framelength": {"$lt" : "70" }})
...
&gt;
</pre>
</p><p>
The next command finds all entries with an IPlength value greater than
100 and less than 200:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt; use LJ
switched to db LJ
&gt; db.netdata.find({ "IPlength": {"$lt" : "200", "$gt": "100" }})
...
&gt;
</pre>
</p><p>
What you should remember is not the actual commands but the fact that
you can query the database of your choice, using the query language you
want and find useful information without the need to re-run tshark and
parse the network data again.
</p><p>
After you test your queries, you can run them as cron jobs. <span   class="emphasis"><em>La vie
est belle!</em></span>

Examining an Nmap ping Scan Using tshark</h2></div></div><p>
Next, let's examine the network traffic that is produced by
Nmap when it performs a ping scan. The purpose of the ping scan is simply
to find out whether an IP address is up. What is important for Nmap in a
ping scan is not the actual data of the received packets but, put simply,
the actual existence of a reply packet. Nmap ping scans inside a LAN
are using the ARP protocol; whereas hosts outside a LAN are scanned using
the ICMP protocol. The performed scan pings IP addresses outside the LAN.
</p><p>
The following Nmap command scans 64 IP addresses, from 2.x.yy.1 to
2.x.yy.64:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# nmap -sP 2.x.yy.1-64
Starting Nmap 6.00 ( http://nmap.org ) at 2014-10-29 11:55 EET
Nmap scan report for ppp-4.home.SOMEisp.gr (2.x.yy.4)
Host is up (0.067s latency).
Nmap scan report for ppp-6.home.SOMEisp.gr (2.x.yy.6)
Host is up (0.084s latency).
...
Nmap scan report for ppp-64.home.SOMEisp.gr (2.x.yy.64)
Host is up (0.059s latency).
Nmap done: 64 IP addresses (35 hosts up) scanned in 3.10 seconds
</pre>
</p><p>
The results show that at execution time only 35 hosts were up, or to be
100% precise, only 35 hosts answered the Nmap scan. Nmap also calculates
the round-trip time delay (or latency). This gives a pretty accurate
estimate of the time needed for the initial packet (sent by Nmap) to
go to the target device plus the time that the response packet took to
return back to Nmap.
</p><p>
The following tshark command is used for the capturing and is terminated
with Ctrl-C:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# tshark -w nmap.pcap
Running as user "root" and group "root". This could be dangerous.
Capturing on eth0
2587 ^C
18 packets dropped
# ls -l nmap.pcap
-rw------- 1 root root 349036 Oct 29 11:55 nmap.pcap
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, let's analyze the generated traffic using tshark. The
following command searches for traffic to or from the 2.x.yy.6 IP address:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ tshark -r nmap.pcap -R "ip.src == 2.x.yy.6 || ip.dst == 2.x.yy.6"
712  3.237125000 109.zz.yyy.253 -&gt; 2.x.yy.6     
 &#8618;ICMP 42 Echo (ping) request  id=0xa690, seq=0/0, ttl=54
1420 5.239804000 109.zz.yyy.253 -&gt; 2.x.yy.6     
 &#8618;ICMP 42 Echo (ping) request  id=0x699a, seq=0/0, ttl=49
1432 5.240111000 109.zz.yyy.253 -&gt; 2.x.yy.6     
 &#8618;TCP 58 41242 &gt; https [SYN] Seq=0 Win=1024 Len=0 MSS=1460
1441 5.296861000     2.x.yy.6 -&gt; 109.zz.yyy.253 ICMP 60 
 &#8618;Timestamp reply      id=0x0549, seq=0/0, ttl=57
</pre>
</p><p>
As you can see, the existence of a response packet (1441) from 2.x.yy.6 is
enough for the host to be considered up by Nmap; therefore, no additional
tests are tried on this IP.
</p><p>
Now, let's look at the traffic for an IP that is considered down:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ tshark -r nmap.pcap -R "ip.src == 2.x.yy.2 || ip.dst == 2.x.yy.2"
708  3.236922000 109.zz.yyy.253 -&gt; 2.x.yy.2     
 &#8618;ICMP 42 Echo (ping) request  id=0xb194, seq=0/0, ttl=59
1407 5.237255000 109.zz.yyy.253 -&gt; 2.x.yy.2     
 &#8618;ICMP 42 Echo (ping) request  id=0x24ed, seq=0/0, ttl=47
1410 5.237358000 109.zz.yyy.253 -&gt; 2.x.yy.2

As the ICMP packet did not get a response, Nmap makes more tries on the
2.x.yy.2 IP by sending an HTTP and an HTTPS packet, still without any
success. This happens because Nmap adds intelligence to the standard ping
(ICMP protocol) by trying some common TCP ports in case the ICMP request
is blocked for some reason.
</p><p>
The total number of ICMP packets sent can be found with the help of the
following command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ tshark -r nmap.pcap -R "icmp" | grep "2.x" | wc -l
233
</pre>

Displaying Statistics for a Specific Protocol</h2></div></div><p>
tshark allows you to display useful statistics about a specific
protocol. The following command displays statistics about the HTTP
protocol using an existing file with network data:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ tshark -q -r http.pcap -R http -z http,tree

All the work is done by the <tt  >-z</tt> option, which is for
calculating statistics,
and the <tt  >-q</tt> option, which is for disabling the printing of information
per individual packet. The <tt  >-R</tt> option discards all packets that do not
match the specified filter before doing any other processing.
</p><p>
Here's another useful command that shows protocol hierarchy
statistics:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ tshark -nr ~/var/http.pcap -qz "io,phs"
</pre>
</p><p>
Try it yourself to see the output!

Summary</h2></div></div><p>
If you have an in-depth understanding of display filters and a good knowledge of
TCP/IP and networks, with the help of tshark or Wireshark, network-related
issues will not longer be a problem.
</p><p>
It takes time to master tshark, but I think it will be time
well spent.
