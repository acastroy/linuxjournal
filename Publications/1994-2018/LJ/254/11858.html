<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #254, June 2015</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
When you run a program as <span   class="bold"><b>setuid</b></span>, it runs with all the permissions of that
user. And if the program spawns new processes, they inherit the same
permissions. Not so with filesystem capabilities. When you run a program
with a set of capabilities, the processes it spawns do not have those
capabilities by default; they must be given explicitly.
</p><p>
This seemed unintuitive to <span   class="bold"><b>Christoph
Lameter</b></span>, who posted a patch to change
<span   class="bold"><b>capability inheritance</b></span> to match the behavior of setuid inheritance. This
turned out to inspire some controversy.
</p><p>
For one thing, filesystem capabilities never were defined fully in the
<span   class="bold"><b>POSIX</b></span> standard and appear only in a draft version of POSIX that later
was withdrawn, so there can't really be any discussion of whether one form of
capabilities is &ldquo;more compliant&rdquo; than another.
</p><p>
There are other problems, such as the need to make sure that any changes to
capabilities don't break existing code and the need to make sure that any
ultimate solution remains secure.
</p><p>
One problem with Christoph's idea was that it tied capability inheritance
to the file itself, but as <span   class="bold"><b>Serge Hallyn</b></span> pointed out, capabilities were
tied to both the file and the user executing the file. Ultimately, Christoph
decided to adapt his code to that constraint, introducing a new capability
that would list the inheritable capabilities available for the user to
apply to a given file.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Yalin Wang</b></span> recently made an abortive
effort to have <span   class="bold"><b>/proc/stat</b></span> list all
CPUs on a given system, not just the on-line ones. This would be a very
useful feature, because many modern systems bring CPUs on- and off-line at a
rapid pace. Often the number of CPUs actually in use is less important than
the number available to be used.
</p><p>
He posted a patch to change /proc/stat accordingly, and <span   class="bold"><b>David Rientjes</b></span>
pointed out that the /<span   class="bold"><b>sys/devices/cpu</b></span> file would be a better location for
this. <span   class="bold"><b>Andrew Morton</b></span> also pointed out that
<span   class="bold"><b>/proc/cpuinfo</b></span> would be a good
location for this kind of data as well. So, there definitely was some
support for Yalin's idea.
</p><p>
Unfortunately, it turned out that some existing code in the <span   class="bold"><b>Android</b></span> kernel
relied on the current behavior of those files&mdash;specifically desiring the
number of on-line CPUs as opposed to the total number of CPUs on the system.
With an existing user dependent on the existing behavior, it became a much
harder sell to get the change into the kernel. Yalin would have to show a
real need as opposed to just a sensible convenience, so his patch went
nowhere.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>John Stultz</b></span> has been maintaining some
timekeeping test patches on GitHub
for several years now, and he finally wanted to get them into the kernel, so he
could stop porting them forward continually. The test would do a variety of
things, involving changing the system time in some way designed to induce a
problem. He asked what he should do to make the patches acceptable to the
kernel folks.
</p><p>
There were a bunch of generally supportive comments from folks like
<span   class="bold"><b>Richard
Chochran</b></span> and <span   class="bold"><b>Shuah Khan</b></span>, but Shuah requested some fairly invasive changes
that would tie John's code to other testing code in the kernel. John said
he'd be happy to do that if it was required, but that one of his goals had
been to keep the test files isolated, so any one of them could run
independently of anything else on the system. In light of that, Shuah
withdrew her suggestion.
</p><p>
Overall, it's not a controversial set of patches, and they'll undoubtedly get into
the kernel soon.
</p><p>
One problem with making backups that guarantee filesystem consistency is
that files on the system may change while they're being backed up. There
are various ways to prevent this, but if another process already has an
open file descriptor for a file, backup software just has to wait or risk
copying an inconsistent version of the file.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Namjae Jeon</b></span> posted some patches to address this problem by implementing
<span   class="bold"><b>file freezing</b></span>. This would allow backup software to block
writes to a given file temporarily, even if that file already had been opened by
another process.
</p><p>
In addition to backup software, other tools like defragmenting software
would benefit from Namjae's patches by preventing any changes to a file
that was being reorganized on disk.
</p><p>
As <span   class="bold"><b>Jan Kara</b></span> pointed out, however, Namjae's code had some potential race
conditions as well as other technical problems. <span   class="bold"><b>Dave
Chinner</b></span> described the
code as &ldquo;terribly racy&rdquo;.
</p><p>
It's not clear what will happen with these patches. They seem to offer
features that folks want, but the race conditions need to be resolved, and
the code needs to be clean and clear enough that future fixes and
enhancements will not be too likely to introduce new problems.

<h2 class="title">Android Candy: Cloud Bonding</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #254, June 2015</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Although the title might sound like some new-fangled tech jargon, I'm
actually referring to a fairly simple Android app called "Unclouded." If
you're a Dropbox user who also has things stored in Google Drive,
Unclouded is a single interface to multiple file syncing backends. Sure,
it's not horribly difficult to open multiple apps to work with your
cloud-based files, but it can be inconvenient.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11858androidf1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
Unclouded also has some neat features like locating duplicate files
taking up precious space in your cloud storage, and it can do previews
for most media types. Unfortunately, the free version limits the number
of accounts you can connect to, and it also disables useful things like
sharing, moving, renaming and deleting files. Thankfully, the premium
features are a few bucks at the most, and even without them, the app
is elegant and useful. Check it out today at the Google Play Store:
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cgollner.unclouded" target="_self">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cgollner.unclouded</a>.

If you're a cord cutter (and a nerd), you most likely have a server
or two dedicated to serving and possibly retrieving videos from the
Internet. Programs like Kodi and Plex are awesome for media
delivery; however, there's more to a complete system than just playing the
videos. Although the ethical and legal ramifications vary from country to
country (and conscious to conscious), the unfortunate truth is that
programs like Sickbeard and NZBDrone can be difficult to install and
maintain.
</p><p>
The folks over at <a href="http://www.htpcbeginner.com" target="_self">www.htpcbeginner.com</a> created a set of Bash scripts
designed to make the installation of media-related HTPC software
painless. If applied to a freshly installed Ubuntu machine, the AtoMiC
Toolkit installs the appropriate dependencies and software for most of
the media-related software out there.

Like I always say when this topic comes up, using torrents and Usenet to
download television episodes may not be legal where you live. Regardless
of where you live, it might be ethically wrong to download them. Even if
you just use programs like Sickbeard to organize the television shows
you record with your own DVR, however, the AtoMiC Toolkit is a great
way to get them up and running in short order. Check out the scripts at
<a href="https://github.com/htpcBeginner/AtoMiC-ToolKit" target="_self">https://github.com/htpcBeginner/AtoMiC-ToolKit</a> and learn how to install

<h2 class="title">Non-Linux FOSS: Vienna, Not Just for Sausages</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #254, June 2015</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Although the technology itself has been around for a while, RSS is still the
way most people consume Web content. When Google Reader was ended a few
years back, there was a scramble to find the perfect alternative. You
may remember my series of articles on Tiny Tiny RSS, Comma Feed and a
handful of other Google Reader wannabes. I don't mention standalone RSS
readers very often, however, because I don't like being tied to a single
computer for reading Web sites. That's where syncing comes into play.
</p><p>
Vienna (<a href="http://www.vienna-rss.org" target="_self">www.vienna-rss.org</a>) is an open-source RSS feed reader for
OS X. Because it's written in Cocoa, it's available only for Macs. There are
many alternatives for Linux and Windows, but the RSS reader options for
OS X are surprisingly few. 
</p><p>
The interface for Vienna is about like what you'd
expect from an RSS reader. The view is customizable,
and you can open complete stories in tabs to see the original Web site
if you so desire. The real beauty of Vienna, however, is under the hood.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11858fossf1.large.jpg"><img src="11858fossf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
The Open Reader API
(<a href="http://rss-sync.github.io/Open-Reader-API/rssconsensus" target="_self">rss-sync.github.io/Open-Reader-API/rssconsensus</a>) is a protocol
that aims to be vendor-neutral and completely open. Google Reader used to
be the back end that everyone used for RSS feed syncing, and since its
demise, people sort of re-invented the wheel in their own way. The Open
Reader API is one solution that may catch on. It's already
supported by BazQux (<a href="http://bazqux.com" target="_self">bazqux.com</a>) and FeedHQ (<a href="http://feedhq.org" target="_self">feedhq.org</a>), 
and although adoption has been slow, hopefully it becomes the standard
protocol for RSS syncing. 
</p><p>
Luckily, if you're an OS X user, you can take
advantage of the protocol right now with Vienna. Thanks to its great
interface and open attitude, Vienna gets this month's Editors' Choice
award. I think it's the first time we've given a non-Linux program
the Editors' Choice honor, but its great interface and commitment to
open standards makes us proud.

<h2 class="title">Physics Analysis Workstation</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Joey Bernard</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #254, June 2015</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
CERN is the European Laboratory for Particle Physics. It has been in
the news quite a bit lately with the discovery of the Higgs Boson at
the Large Hadron Collider. Something that many people may not know is
that it also has a long tradition of developing software for
scientific use. The HTML document format and the first browser 
both were developed there as a way of using rich documents that could
include links between many different sources of information. It was
so useful, it ended up sparking the World Wide Web. Along with
such widespread software, CERN has been responsible for quite a bit
of scientific software, especially physics software.
</p><p>
In this article, I take a look at a fairly large group of
modules and libraries called the Physics Analysis Workstation (PAW,
<a href="http://paw.web.cern.ch/paw" target="_self">paw.web.cern.ch/paw</a>). PAW contains several thousand subroutines and
programs that are written in FORTRAN, C and even some assembly language
code, which is built on top of a library called the CERN Program Library
(CERNLIB). 
</p><p>
You can download and install the code from the source located at
the main Web site if you have any special needs, but considering the long
list of required external libraries, I suggest you avoid that
if possible. Packages should be available for your distribution. For
Debian-based distros, you can install everything you need with the
command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo apt-get install paw
</pre>
</p><p>
PAW also includes a large series of graphing and data visualization
routines to help in data analysis. Sometimes you need to see what your
data looks like in order to figure out what further analysis you need
to investigate.
</p><p>
PAW actually is an interactive system, where you can apply commands
against your data set. The original interface was a command-line one,
but it now has collected several other interfaces that you can try out. If
you open a terminal, type the command
<tt  >paw</tt> and press Enter,
you are presented with a question as to which terminal type you want
to use (Figure 1). The default is to use type 1, which opens an HIGZ
graphic window where your plots will be displayed (Figure 2). If
you are using PAW on a remote machine, you probably will want to use
a different type. You can get a list by typing 
<tt  >?</tt>. For a regular
xterm, enter <tt  >7879</tt>. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11858pawf1.large.jpg"><img src="11858pawf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. You can select the terminal type to use when you start PAW.
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11858pawf2.large.jpg"><img src="11858pawf2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. The default is to open a graphics window to draw your
plots into, along with a command interface.
</p></div></div><p>
Once everything has finished loading,
you are presented with a prompt that looks like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
PAW &gt;
</pre>
</p><p>
Now you can start typing commands and doing data analysis. But,
what commands can you use? Luckily, PAW includes a help system within
the program that you can access by typing the 
<tt  >help</tt> command, which
pops up a list of topics. 
</p><p>
Commands in PAW are grouped together in a tree
structure, with the top-most level being the topics that pop up when
you start the help system. There is also quite a bit of documentation
available on the main Web site, including tutorials and a very large FAQ.
</p><p>
Because PAW is used for data analysis, let's start with what kinds of
data you can use. PAW has three main data types: VECTORS,
HISTOGRAMS and NTUPLES. VECTORS store arrays of reals or integers. PAW
can handle up to three dimensions, or indexes, for these VECTORS. They
can be manipulated by the group of VECTOR commands. Commands in PAW are
not case-sensitive, but in most documentation, they are shown in
uppercase. You also can use abbreviations for commands, as long as they can
be matched uniquely to the full command text. So, you can create a new
VECTOR of 20 elements with the command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
VECTOR/CREATE  vec1(20)
</pre>
</p><p>
This new VECTOR is named &ldquo;vec1&rdquo;. Then you can add elements to your new
vector with this command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
VECTOR/INPUT vec1 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20
</pre>
</p><p>
The command takes a vector name and a list of values to add. This is
fine if you are dealing with just a small set of data. If you have larger
data sets stored in files, you can use the command
<tt  >VECTOR/READ</tt>. This
command takes a filename, and it also can take several other options, like the
format of the elements, and loads the data into the given VECTORS. 
</p><p>
The
optional format string is similar to those used in reading and writing
data in FORTRAN code, so a refresher course may be a good idea if it
has been some time since you have used FORTRAN. 
</p><p>
You can output
data to a file with the inverse 
<tt  >VECTOR/WRITE</tt> command.
</p><p>
To visualize
your data, use the <tt  >VECTOR/DRAW</tt> command. The options available
allow you to select whether to draw a histogram, a smooth curve or a bar
chart. You also can draw this visualization over the top of another
graph.
</p><p>
You can get a list of all of the VECTORS that have been created
with the <tt  >VECTOR/LIST</tt> command, and you can clean up unneeded data with the
<tt  >VECTOR/DELETE</tt> command.
</p><p>
Once you have loaded your data and taken a look
at it, you may have an idea of how the different parts are related to
each other. You can use the <tt  >VECTOR/FIT</tt> command to take a function,
defined by you with a subroutine, and try to fit the data to it. You
also can include a set of associated errors when issuing the command.
</p><p>
The HISTOGRAM group of commands within PAW gives you a larger selection
of plotting and analysis tools to apply to your data. The commands are
broken down into subgroups that give you commands to create histograms,
2D plots and apply histogram operations to histograms. You can use the
<tt  >GET_VECT</tt> and <tt  >PUT_VECT</tt>
command subgroups to interact with the <tt  >VECTOR</tt>
object that you created above. You also can use
<tt  >FUNCTION</tt> commands to
create functions that are used in commands that do data fitting, among
other areas.
</p><p>
The <tt  >NTUPLE</tt> group of commands are used to manipulate ntuple
objects. Ntuples essentially are lists of lists, and you can think of them as
matrices. In the PAW documentation, each row is called an event,
and each column is called a variable. There are functions to merge
data together or make cuts of subsets. Ntuples have their own plot
commands that allow you to plot different variables against each other
in various forms. If you have lots of data to deal with, you can use the
<tt  >CHAIN</tt> command to chain together multiple ntuples to create data sets of
essentially unlimited size.
</p><p>
Although PAW is no longer under active development, there still is more
than enough really useful code here to keep any scientist busy. If you
are doing any work involving data analysis or modeling, especially in C
or FORTRAN, it would be well worth your time to do a quick search of the
available modules and subroutines in PAW to see if there is anything you
can use to make your work progress more quickly.
I cover only a very small portion of the functionality
available in this article, so be sure to do a bit of a deeper
dive to see what you can mine for your own work.

<h2 class="title">Gettin' Sticky with It</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #254, June 2015</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
In last month's issue, I talked about Linux permissions (see &ldquo;It's
Better to Ask Forgiveness...&rdquo; in the May 2015 UpFront section). 
I could have
covered SUID, GUID and sticky bit in the same article, but it seemed
like a lot to cover in one sitting. So in this article, I describe the
special permissions on a Linux system. Where standard permissions are
fairly intuitive, the special permissions don't make a lot of sense at
first. Once you understand what they do, however, they're really not
too complicated.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>But There's No Room for More Permissions!</b></span>
</p><p>
When you learned to set read, write and execute bits on files and
folders, you probably realized that you used all the available
&ldquo;spots&rdquo;
for permissions. So when manipulating special permissions, you sort
of re-use existing permission bits. It functions just like any other
permission attribute, but they're represented a bit oddly.
</p><p>
Every section of the permissions string (user, group, other) has an
additional &ldquo;special&rdquo; permission bit that can be set just like
<tt  >rwx</tt>. The
indication for whether those bits are set is shown on the execute
section of the string. For example:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
If the SUID (Set User ID) permission is set, the execute bit on the user
section shows an s instead of an x.
</p></li><li><p>
If the GUID (Group User ID) permission is set, the execute bit on the
group section shows an s instead of an x.
</p></li><li><p>
If the sticky bit is set, the execute bit on the other section shows a
t instead of an x.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Confused yet? Here are a few examples:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
<tt  >-rwsrw-rw-</tt> &mdash; SUID is set on this file.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >drw-rwsrw-</tt> &mdash; GUID is set on this folder.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >drw-rw-r-t</tt> &mdash; sticky bit is set on this folder.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >-rwSr--r--</tt> &mdash; SUID is set on this file,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>but</em></span> the user execute bit is not.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Note that in the last example the S is uppercase. That's the way you can
tell whether
the execute bit underneath is set. If the SUID bit is lowercase,
it means the execute bit is set. If it's uppercase, it means the SUID bit
is set, but the executable bit is not.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
What Do They Do?</b></span>
</p><p>
Unlike standard permissions, special permissions change the way files
and folders function, as opposed to controlling access. They also
function differently depending on whether they're assigned to files or
folders. Let's take a look at them one at a time.
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>SUID:</em></span> the SUID bit is applied to executable programs. Once it is set,
the program executes with the permissions and abilities of the user
who owns the file. As you can imagine, this can be an enormous security
risk! If a file is owned by root and has the SUID bit set, anyone who
executes it has the same permissions as the root user. As scary as it
sounds, there are a few valid use cases for such things. One perfect
example is the <tt  >ping</tt> program. In order to access the network hardware
required to ping hosts, a user needs to have root access to system. In
order for all users to be able to use <tt  >ping</tt>, it's set with the SUID bit,
and everyone can execute it with the same system permission that root
has. Check it out on your system by typing <tt  >ls -l
/bin/ping</tt>. You
should see the SUID bit set!
</p><p>
Setting the SUID bit on folders has no effect.
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>GUID:</em></span> the GUID set on executable files has a similar effect to SUID,
except that instead of using the permissions of the user who owns the
file, it executes with the permissions of the group membership. This
isn't used very often, but in certain multi-user environments, it might
be desirable.
</p><p>
Mainly, GUID is used on a folder. If the GUID bit is set on a
folder, files created inside that folder inherit the same group
membership of the folder itself. This is particularly useful in group
collaborations. Normally when someone creates a file, it has the group
membership of that user's primary group. Inside a GUID folder, the user
still owns the file, but the group membership is set automatically so
others in the group can access the files.
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Sticky bit:</em></span> first off, I have no idea why the sticky bit is represented
by a t instead of an s. I've searched high and low, and asked many
people. No one seems to know. Maybe a <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> reader knows the
answer and will enlighten me. (If so, I'll include it in the Letters to
the Editor section.) Anyway, the sticky bit is another special permission that is
used on folders. In fact, it has no effect at all if it's set on a file.
</p><p>
Folders that have the sticky bit set add a layer of protection for files
created within them. Normally in a folder accessible by multiple people,
anyone can delete anyone else's files. (Even if they don't have write
access to the files!) With the sticky bit set, only the user who owns the
file can delete it. It seems like a subtle thing, but when you consider
a folder like the /tmp folder on a multi-user Linux system, you can see
how important the sticky bit can be! In fact, if it weren't for the sticky
bit, the /tmp folder on your system would be like the Wild Wild West, and
nefarious gunslingers could delete other people's files willy nilly. You
can see the sticky bit set on your system by typing <tt  >ls -l / |
grep tmp</tt>.

Assigning Special Permissions</b></span>
</p><p>
Applying the special permissions to a file or folder is exactly like
assigning regular permissions. You use the chmod tool&mdash;for example:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
<tt  >chmod u+s file.txt</tt> &mdash; adds the SUID permission
to file.txt.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >chmod g-s file.txt</tt> &mdash; removes the GUID
permission from file.txt.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >chmod o+t folder</tt> &mdash; adds the sticky bit to the
&ldquo;folder&rdquo; directory.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Special permissions can be assigned right alongside regular permissions
as well, so things like this are perfectly fine:

<pre     class="programlisting">
chmod ug+rw,u+s,ugo-x file.txt
</pre>
</p><p>
And just like standard permissions, it's possible (and often
preferable) to assign special permissions using octal notation. In order
to do that, you use the fourth field. When assigning permissions like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
chmod 755 file.txt
</pre>
</p><p>
there's a fourth field that if left off, is assumed to be zero. So this is
actually the same as the above example:

<pre     class="programlisting">
chmod 0755 file.txt
</pre>
</p><p>
That preceding zero is the field that assigns special permissions. If
you leave it off, it's assumed to be zero, and no special permissions
are assigned. Knowing it's there, however, should make it fairly easy to
understand how to use it. If you read last month's article on permissions
that included understanding octal notation, just apply that concept to
special permissions. Figure 1 shows how it breaks down.

Figure 1. Octal Notation
</p></div></div><p>
So in order to assign a folder read/write access for user and groups
along with the GUID bit, you would type:

<pre     class="programlisting">
chmod 2770 foldername
</pre>
</p><p>
And, the resulting permission string (seen by typing <tt  >ls
-l</tt>) would show the following (note the lowercase s&mdash;
remember what that means?):

<pre     class="programlisting">
drwxrws--- foldername 
</pre>
</p><p>
Just like standard permissions, if you want to set multiple special
permissions, you just add the values. In order to set SUID and sticky
bit, you would set the fourth octal field to 5. Usually, only a single
special permission is set on any particular file or folder, but with
octal notation, you have the option to set them in any way you see fit.
</p><p>
Hopefully these two articles clear up any misconceptions about Linux
permissions. More complicated access controls are available with
ACLs, but for most use cases, the standard permission strings are all
you need to control access to files and folders on your system.
