How to read, write and manipulate your database records in Django.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2664580.0x275c358"></a></h2></div></div><p>
In my last article, I continued looking at the Django Web framework,
showing
how you can create and modify models. As you saw, Django expects you
to describe your models using Python code. The model description is
then transformed into SQL and compared with any previous version of
the model that might have existed. Django then creates a
&ldquo;migration&rdquo;,
a file that describes how you can move from one version of the model
definition to the next. A migration is a fantastic tool, one that
allows developers to move their database forward (and backward) in
defined chunks. Migrations make it easier to collaborate with others
and upgrade existing applications.
</p><p>
The thing is, migrations have little or nothing to do with the
day-to-day application that you want to run. They are useful for the
creation and maintenance of your application's models, but in your
application, you're going to want to use the models themselves.
</p><p>
So in this article, I look at Django's ORM (object-relational
mapper). You'll see how how Django allows you to perform all the
traditional CRUD (create-read-update-delete) actions you need and
expect within your application, so that you can use a database to power
your Web application.
</p><p>
For the purposes of this article, I'll be using the &ldquo;atfapp&rdquo;
application within the &ldquo;atfapp&rdquo; project that I created in last
month's article. The model, of an appointment calendar, is defined as follows in
atfapp/models.py:

<pre     class="programlisting">
class Appointment(models.Model):
    starts_at = models.DateTimeField()
    ends_at = models.DateTimeField()
    meeting_with = models.TextField()
    notes = models.TextField()
    minutes = models.TextField()
    def __str__(self):
        return "{} - {}: Meeting with {} 
           &#8618;({})".format(self.starts_at,
                                self.ends_at,
                                self.meeting_with,
                                self.notes)
</pre>
</p><p>
As you can see, the above model has four fields, indicating when the
meeting starts, ends, with whom you are meeting and notes for before
the meeting starts. The first two fields are defined to be DateTime
fields in Django, which is translated into an SQL TIMESTAMP time in
the database.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2664580.0x275c7d0"></a>
Creating a New Appointment</h2></div></div><p>
The easiest and best way to get your hands dirty with Django models is
to use the Django interactive shell&mdash;meaning, the Python interactive
shell within the Django environment. Within your project, just type:

<pre     class="programlisting">
django-admin shell
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2664580.0x275c988"></a></h2></div></div><p>
and you'll be placed in the interactive Python interpreter&mdash;or if
you have it installed, in IPython. At this point, you can start to
interact with your project and its various applications. In order to
work with your Appointment object, you need to import it. Thus, the
first thing I do is write:

<pre     class="programlisting">
from atfapp.models import Appointment
</pre>
</p><p>
This tells Django that I want to go into the &ldquo;atfapp&rdquo;
package&mdash;and
since Django applications are Python packages, this means the
&ldquo;atfapp&rdquo;
subdirectory&mdash;and then import the &ldquo;Appointment&rdquo; class from the
models.py module.
</p><p>
The important thing to remember is that a Django model is just a
Python class. The ORM magic occurs because your class inherits from
models.Model and because of the class attributes that you use to
define the columns in the database. The better you understand Python
objects, the more comfortable you'll feel with Django models.
</p><p>
If you want to create a new appointment object, you can do what you
normally would do with a Python object:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;&gt; a = Appointment()
</pre>
</p><p>
Sure enough, if you ask &ldquo;a&rdquo; about itself, it'll tell you:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;&gt; type(a)
atfapp.models.Appointment
</pre>
</p><p>
The first thing you might try to do is save your new appointment to
the database. You can do this with the &ldquo;save&rdquo; method:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;&gt; a.save()
</pre>
</p><p>
However, as you'll quickly discover if you try to do this, you get an
exception&mdash;an <tt  >IntegrityError</tt>, as the exception is named, which looks
like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
    IntegrityError: NOT NULL constraint failed:
atfapp_appointment.starts_at
</pre>
</p><p>
Here, Django is mixing Python and SQL to tell you what went wrong. You
defined your model such that it requires a <tt  >starts_at</tt> column, which is
translated into a <tt  >NOT NULL</tt> constraint within the
database. Because you
have not defined a <tt  >starts_at</tt> value for your
appointment object, your
data cannot be stored in the database.
</p><p>
Indeed, if you simply get the printed representation of your object,
you'll see that this is the case:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&gt;&gt;&gt; a
&lt;Appointment: None - None: Meeting with  ()&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
The above output comes from the <tt  >__str__</tt> instance method, which you can
see was defined above. The new object has <tt  >None</tt>
values for <tt  >starts_at</tt>,
<tt  >ends_at</tt> and <tt  >meeting_with</tt>.
Note that you don't have <tt  >None</tt> values for
<tt  >meeting_with</tt> and notes. That's because the former are defined as
<tt  >DateTimeField</tt>, whereas the latter are defined as
<tt  >TextField</tt>.
</p><p>
By default, Django models are defined such that their columns in the
database are <tt  >NOT NULL</tt>. This is a good thing, I
think. <tt  >NULL</tt> values
cause all sorts of problems, and it's better to have to
name them explicitly. If you want a field to allow
<tt  >NULL</tt> values, you need to
pass the <tt  >null=True</tt> option, as in:

<pre     class="programlisting">
starts_at = models.DateTimeField(null=True)
</pre>
</p><p>
However, I'm not interested in <tt  >NULL</tt> values for starting and ending
times. Thus, if you want to store your appointment, you'll need to
supply some values. You can do that by assigning to the fields in
question:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;&gt; from datetime import datetime
&gt;&gt;&gt; a.starts_at = datetime.now()
&gt;&gt;&gt; a.ends_at = datetime(2015, 4, 28, 6,43)
</pre>
</p><p>
Once you've done that, you can save it:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;&gt; a.save()
</pre>
</p><p>
Another way to create your model would be to pass the parameters at
creation time:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;&gt; b = Appointment(starts_at=datetime.now(),
        ends_at=datetime.now(),
        meeting_with='VIP', notes='Do not be late')
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2664580.0x275dab8"></a>
Reading Your Appointment Back</h2></div></div><p>
Now that you have two appointments, let's try to read them back and
see what you can do with them. Access to the objects you have created in
the database is done through the &ldquo;objects&rdquo; attribute, known as a
&ldquo;manager&rdquo; in Django. The &ldquo;all&rdquo; method on objects
gives you all of your
objects back:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;&gt; len(Appointment.objects.all())
2
</pre>
</p><p>
You can use your column names as attributes on each object:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;&gt; for a in Appointment.objects.all():
    print "{}: {}".format(a.starts_at, a.notes)

2015-04-28 05:59:21.316011+00:00:
2015-04-28 07:14:07.872681+00:00: Do not be late
</pre>
</p><p>
<tt  >Appointment.objects.all()</tt> returns an object known in Django as a
QuerySet. A QuerySet, as you can see above, is iterable. And, if you call
<tt  >len()</tt> on it, or even if you ask for its
representation (for example, in the
Python shell), you'll see it displayed as a list. So you might think
that you're talking about a list here, which potentially means using a
great deal of memory.
</p><p>
But, the Django development folks have been quite clever about things,
and a QuerySet is actually an iterator&mdash;meaning that it tries as
hard as possible not to retrieve a large number of records into memory
at once, but to use &ldquo;lazy loading&rdquo; to wait until the information is
truly needed. Indeed, just creating a QuerySet has no effect on the
database; only when you actually try to use the QuerySet's objects
does the query run.
</p><p>
It's nice to be able to get all of the records back, but what's even
more useful and important is to be able to select individual records
and then to order them.
</p><p>
For this, you can apply the &ldquo;filter&rdquo; method to your manager:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;&gt; for a in Appointment.objects.filter(meeting_with='VIP'):
        print a.starts_at
</pre>
</p><p>
Now you know when your appointments with a VIP will be starting. But,
what if you want to search for a range of things, such as all of the
appointments since January 1st, 2015?
</p><p>
Django provides a number of special methods that perform such
comparisons. For each field that you have defined in your model,
Django defines <tt  >__lt</tt>, <tt  >__lte</tt>,
<tt  >__gt</tt> and <tt  >__gte</tt> methods that you can use to
filter query sets. For example, to find all of the appointments since
January 1st, 2015, you can say:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;&gt; Appointment.objects.filter(starts_at__gte=datetime(2015,1,1))
</pre>
</p><p>
As you can see, because you have a <tt  >starts_at</tt> field name, Django
accepts a <tt  >starts_at__gte</tt> keyword, which is turned into the
appropriate operator. If you pass more than one keyword, Django
will combine them with AND in the underlying SQL.
</p><p>
QuerySets can be filtered in more sophisticated ways too. For
example, you might want to compare a field with <tt  >NULL</tt>. In that case,
you cannot use the = operator in SQL, but rather, you must use the IS
operator. Thus, you might want to use something like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;&gt; Appointment.objects.filter(notes__exact=None)
</pre>
</p><p>
Notice that <tt  >__exact</tt> knows to apply the appropriate comparison, based
on whether it was given <tt  >None</tt> (which is turned into
SQL's <tt  >NULL</tt>) or
another value.
</p><p>
You can ask whether a field contains a string:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;&gt; Appointment.objects.filter(meeting_with__contains='VIP')
</pre>
</p><p>
If you don't care about case sensitivity, you can use
<tt  >icontains</tt>
instead:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;&gt; Appointment.objects.filter(meeting_with__icontains='VIP')
</pre>
</p><p>
Don't make the mistake of adding % characters to the front and back of
the string for which you're searching. Django will do that for you,
turning the <tt  >icontains</tt> filter parameter into an SQL
<tt  >ILIKE</tt> query.
</p><p>
You even can use slice notation on a QuerySet in order to get the
effects of <tt  >OFFSET</tt> and <tt  >LIMIT</tt>. However, it's important to remember that
in many databases, the uses of <tt  >OFFSET</tt> and
<tt  >LIMIT</tt> can lead to
performance issues.
</p><p>
Django, by default, defines an &ldquo;id&rdquo; field that represents a numeric
primary key for each record stored. If you know the ID, you can
search based on that, using the <tt  >get</tt> method:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;&gt; Appointment.objects.get(pk=2)
</pre>
</p><p>
If there is a record with this primary key, it'll be returned. If
not, you'll get a <tt  >DoesNotExist</tt> exception.
</p><p>
Finally, you also can sort the records that are returned using the
<tt  >order_by</tt> method. For example:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;&gt; Appointment.objects.filter
&#8618;(starts_at__gte=datetime(2015,1,1)).order_by('id')
</pre>
</p><p>
What if you want to reverse the ordering? Just preface the name of the
column with a - sign:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;&gt; Appointment.objects.filter
&#8618;(starts_at__gte=datetime(2015,1,1)).order_by('-id')
</pre>
</p><p>
You can pass multiple arguments to <tt  >order_by</tt> if you
want to order
(ascending or descending) by a combination of columns.
</p><p>
One nice feature of Django's QuerySets is that every call to
<tt  >filter</tt>
or <tt  >order_by</tt> returns a new QuerySet object. In this way, you can make
your calls to <tt  >filter</tt> all at once or incrementally. Moreover, you can
create one QuerySet and then use that as the basis for further
QuerySets, each of which will execute (when necessary) its query
independently.
</p><p>
A big problem with creating dynamic queries is that of SQL
injection&mdash;that users can, through the use of manipulation, force their own
SQL to be executed, rather than what you intended. Using Django's
QuerySets basically removes this threat, because it checks and
appropriately quotes any parameters it receives before passing their
values along to SQL. Really, there's no excuse nowadays for SQL
injection to be a problem&mdash;please think twice (or three times)
before trying to work around Django's safeguards.

Updating and Deleting</h2></div></div><p>
Updating the fields of a Django model is trivially easy. Modify one or
more attributes, as you would with any other Python object and then
save the updated object. Here, I load the first (unordered) record
from the database before updating it:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;&gt; a = Appointment.objects.first()
&gt;&gt;&gt; a.notes = 'blah blah'
&gt;&gt;&gt; a.save()
</pre>
</p><p>
Note that if you change the &ldquo;id&rdquo; attribute and then save your object,
you'll end up creating a new record in the database! Of course, you
shouldn't be changing the &ldquo;id&rdquo; of an object in any event, but now you
can consider yourself warned as well.
</p><p>
To delete an object, just use the <tt  >delete</tt> method on the instance.
For example:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;&gt; len(Appointment.objects.all())
2

&gt;&gt;&gt; a = Appointment.objects.first()
&gt;&gt;&gt; a.delete()

&gt;&gt;&gt; len(Appointment.objects.all())
&gt;&gt;&gt; 1
</pre>
</p><p>
As you can see, in the above example, I found that there is a total of
two records in my database. I load the first and then delete it.
Following that call&mdash;no need for saving or otherwise approving this
action&mdash;you can see that the record is removed.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
In my next article, I'll finish this series on Django with a discussion of
the different types of relationships you can have across different
models. I'll look at one-to-one, one-to-many and many-to-many
relationships, and how Django lets you express and work with each of
them.
