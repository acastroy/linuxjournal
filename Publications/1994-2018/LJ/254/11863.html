Three years ago, I wrote a series of articles titled &ldquo;Getting Started with
3D Printing&rdquo; that discussed the current state of the hobbyist 3D
printing market from both the hardware and software angles. This is an
incredibly fast-moving industry, and a lot has changed since I wrote
those columns. So much has changed in fact, that this first article
will serve just to introduce what likely will be a three- or four-part
series on the current state of 3D printing. In my next articles, I'll dive
deeper into particular 3D printing topics, so consider this article as
an overview and sneak peek to those topics. 3D printing is a big topic,
and this is <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>, so I'm going to approach this topic from a
Linux-using open-source perspective and stick to tools that work in Linux.

Open Source in 3D Printing</h2></div></div><p>
One of the things that has interested me most as I've followed the
3D printing industry is just how similar it is to the story of Linux
distributions. In my articles from three years ago, I discussed all of the
open-source underpinnings that have built the hobbyist 3D printing
movement,
starting with the RepRap 3D printer&mdash;an open-source 3D printer designed
to be able to build as many of its parts as possible. Basically every
other 3D printer you see today can trace its roots back to the RepRap
line. Now that commercial interests have taken the lead in the hobby
though, it is no longer a given that you will be able to download the
hardware plans for your 3D printer to make improvements, even though most
of those printers got their initial designs from RepRaps. That said,
you still can find popular 3D printers that value their open-source
roots, and in my follow-up article on hardware, I will highlight popular 3D
printers and point out which ones still rely on open hardware
and open-source software.
</p><p>
On the subject of open-source software, many 3D printers still depend on
open-source software to run. Open-source 3D printing software works
well, so I can see why many companies would prefer to focus on their
hardware and use the common, popular and capable open-source options. 
That said, some 3D printers on the market, particularly
those from larger companies, ship with their own proprietary software
that you must use with the printers.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16b4580.0x17ac7d0"></a>
The Hardware</h2></div></div><p>
The hardware side of the 3D printing world probably has changed the most
during the past few years. Three years ago, many of the popular 3D printers
still primarily were purchased in kit form, and in some cases, they required not
just assembly with screwdrivers, wrenches and calipers, but also might
have even required some soldering. Many of the printers also heavily followed
the RepRap approach of having many 3D-printed parts. Those printers that
veered from the RepRap approach still often used laser-cut wood. In either
case, the end result were 3D printers that looked and felt much more like a
hobbyist electronics project than a consumer product. These days, most of
the popular printers look more like a consumer appliance than a hobbyist
project. Wires and electronics are hidden. The cases themselves are made
of painted wood, metal or glass, and if there are any plastic parts on
the printer, they're more likely to be injection-molded than printed.

Calibration of 3D printers three years ago still was largely a manual
affair. Leveling the bed might have involved a pair of calipers or a feeler
gauge as you adjusted screws in each corner of the bed. Adjusting the Z
axis on the printer also typically involved adjusting a screw somewhere on
the printer. In some cases, you might even have had to adjust stepper motor
controls on your 3D printer electronics with a screwdriver to dial in
the proper voltage. As many printers were kits, a large part of the
assembly process involved squaring, centering and calibrating hardware
as you built the printer. These days, a lot of engineering effort has gone
into automating as much of the calibration as possible. Some printers
automatically sense the print bed and level it in software. Finer Z
axis adjustments often can be made in software along with more exotic
adjustments like stepper motor voltage. Most of the printers are sold
assembled these days, and most of the calibration already has been done.
</p><p>
Extruder design three years ago mostly was based on the Wade's extruder
design from Thingiverse, and it incorporated a number of 3D-printed parts,
including gears. Although everyone was eyeing the multiple extruder
support that commercial printers had, it still was at the prototype
phase at best. Most hot ends had .5mm tips, and .3mm layer heights were
the norm. These days, extruders have moved away from 3D printed parts with
large gears into machined parts that directly drive filament into the hot
end. A dual-extruder option now is available on many of the higher-end
hobbyist printers. That said, most hot ends these days still extrude
with .3mm to .5mm tips, although the average printer is expected to be
able to extrude at a .1mm or .2mm layer height.
</p><p>
The change in printable materials is one of the latest and most exciting
areas of innovation in 3D printing. Three years ago, ABS and PLA plastic
were your only real options. Now you have a huge variety of choices:
glow-in-the-dark PLA; water-soluble PVA; a number of different types
of nylon filament with different strength and flexibility profiles;
flexible Ninjaflex filament that behaves more like rubber than plastic;
metallic PLA filament with embedded copper, brass or bronze dust that
can be polished and finished much like the pure metal counterparts; and
even PLA filament with carbon fiber or bamboo. A cutting-edge category in
consumer 3D printers even has emerged that prints in liquid resin and
allows a new level of fine detail.

The Software</h2></div></div><p>
Although the improvements in 3D printing software during the past three years may
not be as dramatic as the hardware changes, that doesn't make them any
less interesting. The general software workflow three years ago involved
downloading or building a 3D model in STL format and then loading it in
a slicing tool, such as the open-source Slic3r software that you 
configured manually with your printer's capabilities, the filament you were using
and the overall settings for the print. The slicer would slice the model
into individual layers and then convert each layer into a series of GCODE
commands, such as stepper motor movements that the printer understood. That
GCODE then was loaded into a second piece of software, like the open-source Printrun software that was able to communicate with your printer,
provide you with manual controls and send your GCODE to the printer so
it could start printing. These tools worked, but they required quite a
bit of in-depth knowledge of your printer's individual quirks.
</p><p>
Although Slic3r and Printrun still exist, these days, other open-source
projects, such as Cura, are becoming the preferred open-source tools.
Cura
combines the slicing, communication and manual control of your
printer in one interface, and it also adds nice 3D visualizations of the
object so it's easier to rotate, manipulate and resize. It also ships
with printer profiles for quite a few popular printers along with a
wizard that runs the first time you start it, so it's much easier to
set up your printer the first time.
</p><p>
Another interesting innovation on the open-source software front is a
program called OctoPrint that provides a Web-based interface to control
your printer remotely. It can run on a regular computer but is geared
to run from a Raspberry Pi. It supports both the Raspberry Pi camera as
well as most modern Webcams that run in Linux, so you not only can watch
your printer print over the network, but you also easily can generate time-lapse
movies of your prints to watch over and over again.

As you can see, a lot has changed since the last time I discussed 3D
printing with Linux. In my next column, I'll discuss the hardware side
of 3D printing in more detail, followed by an article on open-source 3D
printing software. I'll finish the series with a column that walks
through setting up OctoPrint on a Raspberry Pi step by step. My
hope is that by the end of the series if you still were holding out on
buying a 3D printer, you'll be convinced that now is the time to get
started, and you'll have a good idea of what's out there so you can 
begin immediately.
