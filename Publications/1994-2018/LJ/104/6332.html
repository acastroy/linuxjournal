Development</h2></div></div><p>Multiple logical CPUs on a single physical CPU, or
<span   class="bold"><b>hyperthreading</b></span> (HT), is a
relatively new concept introduced with Intel's Pentium 4 Xeon that
lately has been getting a huge amount of support in the Linux
kernel. <span   class="bold"><b>Ingo Molnar</b></span> started it off
in late August 2002, with a patch to add HT-awareness to the
scheduler. Many patches have followed since then, and
hyperthreading has become quite the mainstream feature.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>khttpd</b></span> is finally going
away. After a long and bitter struggle from the moment of its
inclusion, the kernel-based web server is gone from 2.5 and will
not be back. In spite of the tremendous controversy surrounding
this feature, it was not the flame wars that eventually sealed its
doom, but the fact that user-space
<span   class="bold"><b>Tux2</b></span> is much faster. There is even
some talk of putting Tux2 into the kernel as a replacement for
khttpd, though many folks object to this on the same grounds that
they originally objected to khttpd. Some patent issues also are
holding up such an idea, and it looks as though no one really wants
to bother fighting it out.</p><p>Several new system calls found their way into the kernel in
August and September 2002. Among them,
<span   class="bold"><b>clone_startup()</b></span> on x86 boxes
reduces the number of system calls required for thread creation to
one. Glibc's fancy pthread code is one big user of this call. The
only problem is that the name has not quite been nailed down yet.
YMMV.</p><p>One cute little tidbit: the <span   class="bold"><b>PC
speaker</b></span> in post-2.5.31 kernels may now be used as a
microphone. This is new and weird. As <span   class="bold"><b>Jos
Hulzink</b></span> put it on the linux-kernel mailing list,
&ldquo;2.5.32 will go into the history books as the kernel that
implemented voice recognition for all AT class
computers....&rdquo;</p><p>The struggle for a new kernel configuration system is
ongoing. With CML2 apparently out of the running, several new
configuration systems have emerged. Among them,
<span   class="bold"><b>&ldquo;kernel conf&rdquo;</b></span> may be the most
likely to succeed. <span   class="bold"><b>Roman Zippel</b></span>
has been working on it steadily and claims his code is nearly
completely usable. The rumor is kernel conf is likely to go into
the main 2.5 tree, but no official announcement has come out
yet.</p><p>A new tool, called <span   class="bold"><b>devlabel</b></span>,
has surfaced from <span   class="bold"><b>Gary Lerhaupt</b></span>.
It allows consistent access to storage devices via dynamic
symlinks, with support for hot plugging. Simply plug in your
device, and a symlink appears that may be used to access the
device. Unplug the device and the symlink goes away.</p><p>&mdash;Zack Brown</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xacf580.0xbc78c8"></a><i  >LJ</i> Index&mdash;December

Identity</h2></div></div><p>Scott McNealy dropped the first shoe at LinuxWorld Expo in
August 2002. In his keynote address, Sun Microsystems' President
and CEO said the company would be announcing a new Linux desktop at
its SunNetwork conference in September. When the second shoe
dropped at SunNetwork, it didn't appear to match the first. Rather
than yet another Linux box, what the company announced was a
desktop strategy meant to take advantage of the huge enterprise
market for inexpensive and flexible no-name x86 PCs, and for cost
savings in general.</p><p>The code name for the strategy is Mad Hatter. Here is how
Curtis Sasaki, Sun's vice president of engineering, desktop
solutions, explains it:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>What we're announcing is a complete package, not
just a box. You get a combination of hardware, software, services
and back-end middleware as well. The hardware is a desktop with a
Linux kernel, GNOME GUI, integration of the Java 2 platform,
Mozilla, StarOffice and the Evolution application suite from
Ximian. The differentiating factor is integration. What you get
with one of our boxes is enterprise-ready and scalable, with
directory, calendar, messaging server and Java Cards for access
control as well. [Java Cards are Java-enabled smart cards.]</p></blockquote></div><p>Target customers are cost-conscious companies with large
populations of &ldquo;transaction workers&rdquo;. But rather than selling
droneware for cubicle hives, Mad Hatter's angle is all about
individual identity.
</p><p>&ldquo;Today CIOs want to know exactly what it costs per user to
have e-mail, calendar and a directory account&mdash;and what it costs
for security&rdquo;, Sasaki says. What Sun wants is for the enterprise
to populate itself with Linux PCs that are personalized at
authentication by the user's Java Card, and there appears to be a
demand for this. Sasaki says:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>While customers are extremely interested in
aggressively priced systems based on open standards, they are also
interested in the most unique hardware aspect of this offering: the
Java Card that allows the administrator to provision web sites and
applications-based user authentication.</p></blockquote></div><p>This brings us to a whole new classification and an acronym
to go with it. &ldquo;It's not a PC, it's an IdC&mdash;an identity
computer&rdquo;, Sasaki says. &ldquo;Identity is a big deal. It's about
getting access to your desktop no matter where you are, based on
your credentials.&rdquo;
</p><p>Eric Norlin, an analyst at Digital ID World, provides some
context:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Corporate IT has become almost a pure cost
center. Just about the only IT efforts actually saving money (while
increasing privacy and security) are in identity management. You
can expect identity to move forward while other services tread
water, because identity has the real promise of converting IT from
a cost center to a profit center. With Digital ID you have a real
possibility for ROI on IT investments.</p></blockquote></div><p>Sun's intent also is to make a single identity work outside
and between companies as well as inside the user's company. Sasaki
explains how:
<div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Liberty Alliance has an open spec developed by
115 companies from many industries. That spec answers the challenge
of creating a way for users to sign on once for multiple services.
You're going to see a lot of different Liberty-enabled services
being able to utilize your identity securely. When there is a
business relationship with an enterprise that also deploys
Liberty-enabled identity&mdash;say, United Airlines or American
Express&mdash;then you can actually move from one to another without
re-creating your identity.</p></blockquote></div>

Because Mad Hatter is about a stack that runs on Linux, it can
embrace a customer's existing x86 hardware, or it can respect the
interests of countries like China, which insist on domestic
manufacture. Hardware is solely one swappable component. Writes
Shahin Khan, Sun's chief competitive officer, &ldquo;It is set up so you
can delete and replace any components that you do not want.&rdquo;
</p><p>Why now? According to Sasaki, the Linux desktop software
stack is finally complete:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>In the last 12-18 months, LOTD (Linux on the
Desktop) technology has really matured. A year ago it wasn't real.
We couldn't deliver a complete desktop solution. Our office suite
wasn't there. GNOME and KDE weren't mature enough. Mozilla wasn't
at 1.0. Now GNOME 2.0 is pretty cool. StarOffice 6 is getting great
traction. You've got a pretty nice product in Evolution. Now we're
ready.</p></blockquote></div><p>Sun will be putting together the first prototypes at its
iForce centers before the end of the year and expects the first
IdCs to start shipping in the first quarter of 2003.

up.</p><p>&mdash;Mike Prince, CIO at Burlington Coat Factory, in
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Fortune</em></span>, explaining why he's asking for an IT
budget cut after converting to Linux.</p><p>Innovation makes enemies of all those who prospered under the
old regime, and only lukewarm support is forthcoming from those who
would proser under the new. Their support is indifferent partly
from fear and partly because they are generally incredulous, never
really trusting new things unless they have tested them by
experience.</p><p>&mdash;Nicolo Machiavelli</p><p>Microsoft has chosen to make the war against open source a
religious one. In doing so it has just managed to highlight it
further, meaning IT Directors who wouldn't have ever considered it
are now thinking of moving over.</p><p>&mdash;Dan Kusnetsky, International Data Corp.</p><p>Typically people think about things such as BIND and
Sendmail, which are very important; but there is a much more
practical sense in which both free and open code helped spread the
birth of the Internet. That's the decision made in architecting the
browser that reveals source. The source is constantly available.
People didn't learn HTML just by buying Tim (O'Reilly)'s books
first. What they did was steal each other's web pages, made the
tweaks they wanted and then bought Tim's books so they could figure
out how to do it better the next time around.</p><p>&mdash;Lawrence Lessig</p><p>I say to you that the VCR is to the American film producer
and the American public as the Boston strangler is to the woman
home alone.</p><p>&mdash;Jack Valenti, before Congress, 1983</p><p>Basically, all the commercial people have their own agenda,
and that's very healthy because you want to have these
often-conflicting agendas to push the system into something that
actually works for everybody.</p><p>&mdash;Linus Torvalds</p><p>If you know how the source code works, you are much more
likely to be able to sort out your problems. You will be able to
link the software with the OS better. You won't have to spend so
much on maintenance; the costs will be lower. It would also cost a
lot less to develop the software in-house and get it to work the
way you want.</p><p>&mdash;Retail CIO</p></div></div>
