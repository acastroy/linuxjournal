    No one could ever accuse our readers of backing down without
    a fight.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x297b580.0x2a73348"></a></h2></div></div><p>One of our goals as a web site news
source is to provide our contributors with a forum for sharing and
discussing business practices and corporate decisions that affect
Linux users. Adam Kosmin, author of &ldquo;The Toshiba Standoff&rdquo;
(<a href="../000/6318.html" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/6318</a>)
took us up on our offer. He wrote about his frustration with the
Toshiba Corporation and their refusal to grant him a refund for
returning the copy of Microsoft Windows that came pre-installed on
his laptop. He outlines well the runaround Toshiba's customer
service gave him; he couldn't get a laptop without Windows, and
they wouldn't give him a refund, even though the Microsoft End User
License Agreement offers one. They told him if he wanted to pursue
it, &ldquo;they'd see him in court&rdquo;. Excellent customer service,
indeed.
</p><p>More recently, Adam updated us about the creation of
WindowsRefund.net
(<a href="../000/6363.html" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/6363</a>),
his attempt to reorganize the operating system refund
movement.</p><p>Continuing with the activism theme, Doc Searls wrote about
his visit to Beverly Hills to attend the Digital Hollywood
conference
(<a href="../000/6360.html" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/6360</a>).
Perhaps the fact that he was almost the only attendee with a laptop
should have been a clue about who the rest of the crowd was. Are we
the only ones thinking that the industry most desperate to control
the Internet doesn't even <span   class="emphasis"><em>use</em></span> the Internet?
Like <span   class="emphasis"><em>Fast Food Nation</em></span>, Doc's article confirms
that, yes, it <span   class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> that scary behind corporate
doors. But he reaffirms the fact that the next generation of
Hollywood blockbusters are all being made on Linux farms. So how
long are the big guys going to fight the future when their own tech
teams have switched sides?</p><p>Moving on to some of the technical articles, Leon Goldstein's
review of Libranet 2.7 is titled, &ldquo;Debian on Steroids&rdquo;
(<a href="../000/6358.html" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/6358</a>).
A distribution based on Debian, Libranet's main appeal is it offers
all the security and upgrade convenience of Debian, but with an
easier installer.</p><p>Pat Shuff asks the important question, &ldquo;How Many Disks Are
Too Many for a Linux System?&rdquo;
(<a href="../000/6238.html" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/6238</a>).
In light of the trend to recentralize resources and facilities,
many system administrators are wondering exactly how big of a
server they need to efficiently handle network traffic. According
to Shuff, the answer to his title question depends on bandwidth,
latency and addressability much more than it does on the OS running
the show.</p><p>George Toft takes a look at &ldquo;Using Logical Volume
Management&rdquo;
(<a href="../000/5957.html" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/5957</a>),
tries the LVM support in SuSE and Mandrake and reports on attempts
to resize a ReiserFS partition on the fly. Now you don't have to
re-install if you made your /var too small to log all the hits your
web site is getting.</p><p>If you want to share your story of grassroots activism, or
explain how you managed to connect your garage-door opener to the
microwave to your office computer, send your article idea to
