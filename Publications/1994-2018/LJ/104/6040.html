    VariCAD is a serious, high-end 2-D and 3-D CAD tool for
    mechanical engineering design and competes favorably with
    tools costing substantially more.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11ad580.0x12a5558"></a></h2></div></div><p>VariCAD is well known as one of Central
Europe's strongest players for CAD tools for mechanical
engineering. Their software has been continuously improved under
industrial use for 14 years and has users in 40 countries around
the world. They are a friendly company, willing to interact with
you to solve a problem or glean feedback about their tool.
</p><p>The product reviewed here was VariCAD 8.2-02, which was
tested on a Red Hat Linux 7.3 system. VariCAD supports binaries for
Red Hat, Mandrake and SuSE Linux distributions, as well as for
Microsoft Windows.</p><p>Despite the low price (less than $400), VariCAD is a serious,
high-end 2-D and 3-D CAD tool for mechanical engineering design and
competes favorably with tools costing substantially more. In fact,
if you have a design team, discount pricing is also
available.</p><p>The tool capabilities include 3-D modeling and 2-D drafting,
support for metadata, such as title blocks, and linking libraries
of machine parts to designs. VariCAD is a fast GUI tool based on
OpenGL. High-performance graphics are vital to a mechanical CAD
tool, where a designer's time cannot be wasted on slow screen
redraws for changes in views. The 3-D interface is responsive on my
test system, a KDS Valiant 6480CiPTD laptop with an 800MHz Intel
PIII, 512MB of RAM and a Trident CyberBLADE Ai1 video
chipset.</p><p>However, due to the numerous GUI icons, there is a learning
curve to get up to speed on the iconic language within the tool.
VariCAD supports a nice on-line tutorial to help you familiarize
yourself with the menu flow for icons and available features. Going
through this really aids in understanding how the iconic language
works. The language makes a lot of sense, and screen real estate
for icons is well suited for providing control over a strongly
visual environment. This all seems appropriate for a tool in the
2-D/3-D field.</p><p>However, VariCAD does <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> have a
user-accessible scripting language. This is an important usability
feature for users who need to automate key design tasks, such as
making variations automatically given a starting or genus
mechanical design. The tool will not serve well for users who need
or already have large scripting applications for automating their
design tasks.</p><p>The supported capabilities <span   class="emphasis"><em>without</em></span>
scripting, however, are enormously powerful. In CAD tools, parts
libraries are everything, and VariCAD is well stocked with
libraries that can generate thousands of parts based on ANSI or DIN
industry standards. This feature greatly simplifies generating
components for designs. For instance, the components might be
fasteners, building blocks in large designs that incorporate custom
metal machined parts. It is convenient and fast to create screws,
keys, springs, bearings and numerous other types of parts. All of
the components used in a design may then be linked automatically to
a very convenient Bill of Materials (BOM) generator.</p><p>The file-locking feature supported by the tool is a rather
crude form of access control. If a user attempts to access a locked
file, typically for an in-use document, contact information is
displayed for the user desiring access. It certainly might make
sense within a design organization for maintaining access rights
for key drawings, but in this tool, it is only effectively operable
in limited contexts&mdash;during edits. Adding GUI features to the tool
to provide access using a minimal subset of a real version control
system like GNU CVS would have been much more effective. This would
have enabled significantly more capability for supporting access
rights as well as multiple-person design teams.</p><p>The general feel of the tool is that of working on the level
of a totally visual-oriented tool. The iconic hierarchies are
specific and work quickly. One gets used to automatically created
elements and working them into the design flow seamlessly.</p><p>

</p><p>One of the best features of VariCAD is being able to work
directly in 3-D to design an object. This mirrors experience in the
real world&mdash;objects have mass, dimension and textures. From here,
2-D drawings can be created automatically. This is where the
high-performance graphics shine in terms of usability. This
performance is most likely due to the use of OpenGL as an
infrastructure technology.</p><p>Also significant is the fact that VariCAD collaborates with
the OpenDWG alliance. Getting CAD data into both standard and
alternative digital forms is important for manufacturing, component
testing and numerous other unique situations in mechanical
engineering. The tool supports DWB, DWG, DXF and IGES data formats
for maximum interoperability of mechanical datasets to/from other
tools or manufacturing machines and to support Internet-based
manufacturing. VariCAD also conveniently supplies a multiplatform
drawing viewer free of charge.</p><p>The on-line (English) documentation supporting the project
ranges from fair to good. And though it does contain grammar and
spelling errors, the documentation generally allows you to grasp
what you need to know. It's based on HTML, so it runs on a browser.
Some professional users in North America might have preferred that
this information be contained in a PDF instead&mdash;it's common to
print a small number of relevant manual pages on paper, for working
alongside a large screen monitor. But with Linux, it is also easy
to have multiple desktops or a two-headed display. The company has
taken a somewhat conservative approach to platform issues with
their tool, supporting the KDE desktop only.</p><p>VariCAD is an impressive value proposition for a powerful
Linux desktop application that supports 3-D and 2-D mechanical CAD
engineering.</p><p><a href="6040s1.html" target="_self">Product
