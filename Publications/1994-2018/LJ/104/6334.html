    Getting into the sequences, byte types and math of the iPod
    MP3 player.

necessary on many Linux software projects, because many file
formats have no open specifications. Even if we have a
specification, we will probably have to reverse engineer certain
portions to learn all the details. Reverse engineering is a
rewarding experience. Not only do we learn something in detail, but
it is satisfying to offer Linux users access to previously
unsupported devices.
</p><p>This article discusses the specific example of reverse
engineering the iTunesDB file format used by the Apple iPod
portable MP3 player. Although this example covers a file format, we
can use similar techniques for device drivers and network
streams.</p><p>The key strategies for reverse engineering are hypothesis,
pattern recognition and validation. We use hypotheses to guess what
will be in the file. All files contain repeated patterns, and
recognizing those patterns is the key to reverse engineering.
Validation consists of developing software to check whether a file
conforms to a format. If we can tell that a file is valid, we
understand the format.</p><p>We need a hypothesis for the types of information an unknown
file format contains. We know that an iPod plays digital music and
the songs can be organized into playlists. Because we can't find
any other files on the iPod hard disk for storing this information,
we guess that it will be in the iTunesDB file. The goal of trying
to find song and playlist information narrows our search when we
look for patterns in the file.</p><p>Although every file format contains repeated patterns, the
trick is recognizing these patterns and learning how to parse them.
Opening a file in a hex editor allows us to examine the raw data
for patterns. Figure 1 contains the first 256 bytes of an iTunesDB
file as shown by Emacs in hexl-mode. The first column is the file
position; then there are eight columns, each column containing two
bytes. The final column is the ever-helpful ASCII representation of
the data.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6334f1.large.jpg"><img src="6334f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. First 256 Bytes of the iTuneDB File
</p></div></div><p>From only the first 256 bytes, a pattern emerges: three
5-byte sequences start with &ldquo;mh&rdquo; (0x6d68). When we scan the rest
of the file, we find it littered with 5-byte mh sequences (see
Figure 2). Based on the number of mh byte sequences we see in the
file, we hypothesize that these sequences are a marker for a data
structure. We don't know if the data structure has a fixed or
varying size. Perhaps it is only five bytes long and the
information between the mh sequences is composed of other data
structures. To help us determine this information, we will extract
the first 15 mh sequences from the file (Figure 3).</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6334f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. 5-Byte mh Sequences
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6334f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. First 15 mh Sequences
</p></div></div><p>The numbers 0x9c and 0x18 do not translate to &ldquo;.&rdquo; using
ASCII (the ASCII code for . is 0x2e). So, we follow the Emacs
example and use . for anything out of the range of standard ASCII
characters.</p><p>Although we have only a few data points, we find multiple
potential patterns. Certain sequences are repeated, such as
&ldquo;mhod.&rdquo; and &ldquo;mhit.&rdquo;. In fact, both of the mhit. sequences are
followed by mhod. sequences. Perhaps the patterns exist throughout
the file. Before sifting through hundreds of kilobytes in a hex
editor, it is a good idea to consider using the third reverse
engineering strategy: validation.</p><p>A great way to test out hypotheses is to write a validation
program, and the sooner the better. The goal of the validation
program is to parse the file and determine if it is valid using
various tests derived from pattern recognitions and hypotheses. The
first iterations of the validation program will have few tests (if
any) that are correct, but as we come to understand the format, the
program evolves into a compliance tester. It is then useful for
checking software that modifies files of this format, because we
can use it to ensure that our changes are valid.</p><p>Our first validation program will display information (shown
in Figure 4) about all the mh chunks in the file to help us find
patterns. The first glaring pattern we see pertains to the
difference between the file positions of the mh chunks. With the
exception of the mhod chunks, the fifth byte contains the number of
bytes until the next mh chunk. We can add code to our validation
program to check this pattern, and we find that this is almost the
case: there are a few chunks besides the mhod chunks that fail our
test. It is unlikely that the creators of the iTunesDB file format
would limit the size of a data structure to 256 bytes, thus we are
probably dealing with a multibyte number.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6334f4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Results of Validation Program
</p></div></div><p>As soon as the word &ldquo;multibyte&rdquo; crosses our mind, we must
consider the endianness of the file. If this first byte is part of
a multibyte number, it is the least significant byte, thus a little
endian number. If one number in the file is little-endian, the
whole file will be little-endian. Only a sadistic designer would
create a mixed-endian file format. Bytes six, seven and eight are
almost always zero, so we guess the chunk size is a 4-byte
number.</p><p>Figure 5 contains a diagram of our theory for the basic
building block of the file format. When we change our validation
program to use a 4-byte number for the chunk size, the test is
successful for all non-mhod chunks.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6334f5.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. Theory of File Format
</p></div></div><p>Reverse engineering requires us to oscillate between our
three strategies in order to decipher the file format. We will
continue to employ these strategies to discover more details. We
wrote software that can parse the file format into data chunks of
variable size and type. We would like to know what every byte in
the chunk signifies, and this requires more hypotheses, pattern
recognitions and validations.</p><p>We start at the top of the file and focus on the mhbd chunk.
Given its frequency and its location at the start of the file, it
probably contains header information for the whole file. We know it
is 0x68 bytes long, and we accounted for only eight of those bytes
with our standard tag and chunk length fields. Everything else thus
far consists of 4-byte numbers and we have a multiple of four bytes
left, so we will break up the remaining 96 bytes into 24 4-byte
numbers, as shown in Figure 6.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6334f6.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. The Remaining 96 Bytes
</p></div></div><p>The size in bytes of the example iTunesDB file is 571,616. We
can add a test to the validation program and verify that n1 is the
file size for all iTunesDB files. The n2, n3, n4 trio resembles a
version number (1.1.2). Looking at multiple iTunesDB files teaches
us that n2 through n4 changes to 1.2.2 for iTunesDB files from
newer iPods. n5 to n24 are always zero.</p><p>Storing the file size in the header is a curious action. We
determined a consistent pattern for the first eight bytes of an mh
chunk; perhaps bytes 9-12 are consistent for all mh chunks. We
modify our validation program to spit out the value of bytes 9-12
for all mh chunks (see Figure 7 for results).</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6334f7.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 7. Value of Bytes 9-12
</p></div></div><p>When we add n1 to the file position of the mhbd chunk, we get
to the end of the file. Adding n1 to the mhod chunk position is the
position of the next mh chunk. For mhsd, adding 0x73048 to 0x68 is
0x730b0. Going to that file position in our hex editor shows us
that at 0x730b0 is the start of another mhsd chunk.</p><p>The n1 plus file position value for mhit, mhyp and mhip
chunks is consistent with the one for mhbd, mhsd and mhod. Figure 8
contains an example of the relationship between these chunks. For
mhlt and mhlp, the position at n1 plus the mhlt/mhlp file position
is in the middle of a chunk. The n1 value for mhlt in this example
is 755, which is the number of mhit chunks in the file. The n1
value for mhlp is 4, which is the number of mhyp chunks. These
relationships suggest a nested data structure. If we use the n1
size to determine parent-child relationships between mh chunks, we
can create the tree diagram shown in Figure 9. The symmetry looks
too good to be wrong, so we'll stick with it as our theory unless
we find data later on that convinces us otherwise.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6334f8.large.jpg"><img src="6334f8.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

Figure 9. Parent-Child mh Chunks
</p></div></div><p>Going down the tree one level from mhbd, we have a pair of
mhsd nodes, each 104 bytes long. Breaking the data after the
initial 12 bytes into 4-byte numbers shows us that only the first
4-byte number contains any non-null data. It equals one when the
child node is mhlt and two when the child node is mhlp. Figure 10
contains a description of the mhsd chunk.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6334f10.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 10. The mhsd Chunk
</p></div></div><p>Continuing down to the next level, we find the mhlt and mhlp
nodes. We can verify that following the number of children they end
with 80 null bytes, as shown in Figure 11.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6334f11.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 11. The mhlt and mhlp Nodes
</p></div></div><p>The children of the mhlt node are mhit nodes. The number of
mhit nodes corresponds to the number of songs on the iPod. Dividing
the first mhit chunk into 4-byte unsigned integers yields the
diagram in Figure 12.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6334f12.large.jpg"><img src="6334f12.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 12. Dividing the First mhit Chunk into 4-byte Unsigned
Integers
</p></div></div><p>The only number that looks at all familiar simply by its
magnitude is n6. In UNIX, time is usually determined as the number
of seconds since the Epoch (00:00:00 UTC, January 1, 1970). In
Apple's HFS+ filesystem, however, time is stored as the number of
seconds since 00:00:00 UTC, January 1, 1904. Converting 3090924135
to a date yields December 11, 2001, 06:02:15. We can't make much
sense of the rest of these numbers yet, but by looking at many mhit
chunks we notice that n1 equals the number of mhod children, n3 is
always one, and n4 is always zero.</p><p>Perhaps by looking at the mhod children of the mhit chunks we
can learn what the unknown mhit values signify. Indeed, a cursory
look at some mhod chunks (see Figure 13) indicates they contain
variable-length text after them.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6334f13.large.jpg"><img src="6334f13.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 13. mhod Children of mhit Chunks
</p></div></div><p>We know that n1 of the mhod chunk (see Figure 14) tells us
how long the mhod chunk is including the text data. We need a
hypothesis for what the remaining 12 bytes contain.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6334f14.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 14. n1 of mhod Chunks
</p></div></div><p>By reading the text, we see the artist, album and title
strings are included, among others. The software needs to know what
type of string it is for the string to be useful. This information
could be provided by always having the strings in the same order:
album, title, artist, genre and so on, but what if a song didn't
have an album? It is more likely, then, that the type of string is
encoded in the chunk somewhere. n2 looks like a good candidate.
Looking at the strings and the n2 value, we determine the
relationship shown in Table 1.</p><p><a href="6334t1.html" target="_self">Table 1. The n2 Value and
Description</a></p><p>The text data is not pure ASCII because the letters (in this
example) are separated by a null byte. As there are two bytes for
every letter, we assume we are dealing with a multibyte
representation of text, most likely a Unicode encoding. There are
16 bytes before the text starts, however, that we haven't accounted
for them. Figure 15 contains the 16 unknown bytes for the four mhod
blocks shown in Figure 13.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6334f15.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 15. The 16 Unknown Bytes for the Four mhod Blocks Shown in
Figure 13
</p></div></div><p>We find a 4-byte number that is always one, a varying 4-byte
number and 64 bits of zero. On closer inspection, the second number
seems to vary with the length of the subsequent string and is, in
fact, its length in bytes. We will add a test to our validation
program to check if this is true for all mhod strings.</p><p>Our validation program finds text data chunks where the first
number is zero instead of one. These follow mhod chunks where the
type is 100, probably an empty string type. Figure 16 contains a
complete description of the mhod chunks.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6334f16.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 16. The Complete mhod Chunk
</p></div></div><p>We can use the mhod children of the mhit chunks to figure out
which songs relate to which mhit chunks. This helps us figure out
the rest of the mhit chunk: n5 changes based on the file type; n7
is the size of the song's file. n8 is the duration of the song in
milliseconds. n9 is the track number. n12 is the bit rate. See
Figure 17 for a diagram of the mhit data chunk.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6334f17.large.jpg"><img src="6334f17.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 17. The mhit Data Chunk
</p></div></div><p>Our analysis of the left side of the tree is complete, and
using it we can find the information for all the songs on the iPod.
Earlier we hypothesized that the other main use of the iTunesDB
file is for playlists, so we will look for playlist information in
the right side of the tree.</p><p>Hoping for symmetry, we want to find one mhyp chunk for each
playlist, as there was one mhit chunk for each song. Looking
around, we know this iPod has three playlists yet there are four
mhyp chunks. When we run our validation program on a variety of
iTunesDB files, we learn there is always one more mhyp chunk than
the number of playlists.</p><p>We will use our validation program to display information
about the children of the mhyp chunks. It shows us that every mhyp
chunk has a first child that is an empty string mhod chunk (type
100) with a mysterious extra 604 null bytes. Then it has an mhod
chunk with a string in it. For the first mhyp chunk, this is the
name of the iPod; for every other mhyp chunk it is the name of a
playlist.</p><p>After the name mhod chunk comes a series of mhip and mhod
pairs, until the next mhyp chunk. The mhod portion of the pair is
an empty string. The number of these pairs is equal to the number
of songs in the playlist. As far as the first playlist is
concerned, it has the same number of mhip/mhod pairs as there are
songs on the iPod. Thus, we can theorize that this first playlist
is a master playlist containing one entry for every song on the
iPod.</p><p>We know that a playlist is a named list of songs with a
title. We found the name already, but we need to figure out how the
list of songs is stored. We start by looking at the mhip chunk in
Figure 18. n5 is the same order of magnitude as the date we found
earlier. We saw n4 (2626) in the mhit data at n2. Thus, we can
guess that n4 is a song identification number and that the mhip
chunks use song identification numbers to specify which songs are
in the playlist. We can add a test to the validation program to
match n4 in the mhip chunks, with n2 in the mhit chunks to confirm
our theory.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6334f18.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 18. The mhip Chunk
</p></div></div><p>The remaining mhip mystery is that the n3 number is similar
in magnitude to the song key, n4. If we change our test program to
look for songs whose key is the number following the key we already
found, we won't find any songs with these identification numbers in
any iTunesDB file. We can deduce, then, that it is a unique
identification number for these chunks. Adding a test to our
validation program confirms they are indeed unique. Figure 19
contains a diagram of the mhip data chunk.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6334f19.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 19. The mhip Data Chunk
</p></div></div><p>The mhyp chunk (see Figure 20) is the final chunk we need to
evaluate. n1 is always 2. n2 is the number of songs in the
playlist. The master playlist has n3 set to 1; all other playlists
have it set to 0. n4 is a date, probably the date the playlist was
created. n5 and n6 are the same for every mhyp chunk, and 72 null
bytes always follow them.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6334f20.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 20. The mhyp Chunk
</p></div></div><p>Using the three reverse engineering strategies of hypothesis,
pattern recognition and validation, we deciphered the iTunesDB file
format. Hopefully the ideas presented here will help Linux users
reverse engineer more devices and file formats to make them
compatible with Linux.</p></div></div>
