    Replacing a visualization supercomputing platform driving a
    four-wall immersive display system with a PC commodity
    cluster.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x248c580.0x2584608"></a></h2></div></div><p>The cost per performance of PC clusters
is making them a viable alternative to traditional high-end
visualization supercomputers. Rapid evolution in commodity PC
hardware has both driven down costs and accelerated obsolescent
computing cycles. A general rule to follow for buying graphics
capability from SGI is to budget $250,000 US per graphics pipe. For
those who cannot afford to outfit an Onyx-class computer with four
graphics pipes, extra raster managers may be added to two pipes to
drive a four-wall display system. In contrast, our experimental
cluster costs less than $1,000 US per node. With the addition of a
video matrix switcher, the grand total was less than $15,000 US.
Even with the fast obsolescence cycles, the price difference is so
great that an organization could afford to replace or upgrade the
graphics clusters many times during the lifetime of one SGI system.
Another advantage of PCs is the wide availability of low-cost
parts. Overall, the PCs are cost effective, powerful and flexible.
</p><p>We present an experiment that integrates a commodity cluster
into an existing four-wall display system&mdash;a Surround-Screen
Visualization System (SSVR) from Mechdyne Corporation. The
objective is to attain active stereo visualization on multiple
walls using genlocking, swap-locking and data-locking
capabilities.</p><p>High-end visualization supercomputers offer multiwall, active
stereo visualization packaged together. Stereo presentation and
coordination of scene graph data is taken care of automatically by
the computer in hardware or by the invocation of proprietary
software libraries. The cluster was designed from the beginning to
attempt to replace aging SGI computing equipment used to drive our
current four-wall display system. We are finding ourselves taxing
the capabilities of an Onyx 2 system with Infinite Reality 2
graphics by demanding increasing numbers of polygons to be rendered
while needing a fixed frame rate for active stereo. When
implementing a cluster, these issues must be dealt with in order to
produce a coherent scene across many screens.</p><p>Communication between the cluster nodes is vital. Data such
as pixels, geometric primitives or even scene graph data is passed
among the nodes. The way data is handled and the type of data
passed greatly impacts the network bandwidth requirements of the
cluster. Two basic approaches for setting up a graphics clustering
communication software architecture are client/server and
master/slave.</p><p>In the client/server approach, a single node serves data to
the graphics rendering clients. The advantage to this arrangement
is many applications may embed a server that works with the same
rendering client nodes. This environment is very flexible. The
disadvantage is a higher consumption of network bandwidth. Most
client/server clusters rely upon relatively expensive Myrinet or
gigabit Ethernet hardware.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6294f1.large.jpg"><img src="6294f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Commodity Cluster Configuration Diagram
</p></div></div><p>The master/slave approach, used in this project, consists of
multiple nodes, where each node of the graphics cluster locally
stores and runs an identical copy of the graphics application.
Consequently, only a small amount of information is required to be
shared among the nodes, and network bandwidth becomes less of a
concern. This information may simply include input device data and
timestamps. In this configuration, the master node handles
application state changes.</p><p>All graphics clusters must satisfy the following three
requirements:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Genlocking: the process of synchronizing the video
frames from each node in a cluster so that they produce a fluid,
coherent image. Genlocking may be achieved through software or
hardware.</p></li><li><p>Swap Locking: the process of synchronizing the
frame buffer rendering and swapping. This is necessary because each
view of a scene contains different amounts of data and numbers of
polygons to render. These may produce different rendering times for
each frame for each node.</p></li><li><p>Data Locking: the process of synchronizing the
views to maintain consistency across the screens. This becomes an
issue since each node in the cluster renders its frames from
locally stored information.</p></li></ul></div><p>We used a set of standard PC configurations equipped with MSI
G4Ti4600 graphics adapters powered by NVIDIA's GeForce4 Ti graphics
processing unit (GPU) and 128Mb of DDR video memory. Although not
completely necessary, the PCs were identical, which made software
installation easier. The PCs communicated via 100BaseT networking
adapters and a 100BaseT switch.</p><p>The projectors of the SSVR are connected to an Extron
CrossPoint Plus 124 matrix video switcher. The switcher is capable
of accepting video input from 12 sources and output to four
sources.</p><p>Since genlocking and data locking are handled in software
through the parallel ports, a special box (Figure 2) was fabricated
to handle the signaling appropriately. This box was also built from
commercial off-the-shelf hardware for less than $20 US. Besides
controlling the switcher, this box also outputs a genlocking signal
to a set of Crystal Eyes infrared emitters.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6294f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

and scene synchronization needs of the cluster. The commodity
cluster was built upon a standard installation of Red Hat Linux
7.2, and the kernel was then patched to include the Real-Time
Application Interface (RTAI), which allows for low latency and task
completion timing.</p><p>SoftGenLock and RTAI are used in concert to provide a
software active stereo solution. The RTAI kernel module detects the
vertical refresh of the monitor and changes a pointer in the video
card memory that tells the video card what to draw on the screen. A
double-sized buffer is provided to the application by specifying a
virtual frame buffer in XFree86, which is twice the size of the
actual frame buffer being drawn to the screen. For example, if
displaying at a resolution of 1024 &times; 768 in active stereo,
the virtual desktop would need to be at a resolution of 2048
&times; 768. The RTAI kernel module splits the frame buffer in half
and alternatingly displays the scene in 1024 &times; 768 pieces. An
application draws in stereo by rendering to the right and left
sides of the X frame buffer for the right and left eye.</p><p>Genlock/data lock is achieved by synchronizing the machines
in the cluster over the parallel ports. The RTAI kernel module
writes to one pin on the parallel port and reads from another to
make sure that the other machines in the cluster have completed a
frame. The master tells all the other nodes in the cluster when to
draw, and the other nodes in the cluster report back when they are
ready for a new frame. Data lock is achieved by making sure that
the slave machines in the cluster are on the correct eye when the
parallel port is in a certain state.</p><p>SoftGenLock does not synchronize applications between the
nodes of a cluster; it provides data lock and stereo. It is the
responsibility of the application to synchronize the viewing
frustum and animations in the application. Lastly, since
SoftGenLock only uses VGA registers, it potentially can work with
any graphics card.</p><p>When installing a PC cluster, a lot of issues must be dealt
with before setup. Here are the important points and some
recommendations on how to set up the system properly:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Be sure to have adequate HVAC, power and network
access where the cluster will be set up.</p></li><li><p>Set up the cluster and display system in separate
rooms, because noise levels from fans, drives, etc., may be
distracting.</p></li><li><p>Prepare to deal with a lot of issues associated
with laying down the cables. The time taken at this stage to label
and check the cabling for proper size and lengths will save time
later. This will alleviate problems with signal degradation and
simply losing a cable in the &ldquo;nest&rdquo;.</p></li><li><p>Create a master power switch to turn off all units
at once.</p></li></ul></div><p>We constructed and installed a three-wall cluster in less
than two weeks. This cluster was configured to use active stereo
and has the ability to demonstrate swap locking and data
locking.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x248c580.0x25855d8"></a>Testing and Evaluation</h2></div></div><p>We tested the PC commodity cluster by implementing a simple
visualization software system. We utilized an interoperable
software architecture, VR Juggler, which provides a set of
programming abstractions for interfacing with a variety of display,
tracking and computing systems and a variety of interaction
devices. The software, which is used for visualizing terrain
information, has a variety of display modes including stereo. It
can be recompiled to work on different computing architectures and
reconfigured at execution time by including different default
device configuration files.</p><p>The application integrated smoothly with the cluster system
and performed better than expected. The quality of the displays and
stereo viewing was comparable to the same software running on three
walls using an SGI Onyx 2 with IR2 graphics. However, the cluster
was able to visualize the data with better performance. Figure 3
shows the cluster software running in the four-wall display system
on the three side walls.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6294f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

low-cost alternative to the use of single large visualization
supercomputers. The PCs and related video hardware are fairly
cheap, computationally powerful and flexible. There also is an
abundance of software available for them, such as VR Juggler, which
allow for applications to interface with a variety of display
systems and interaction devices easily. Our cluster experiment
explored the feasibility of phasing out and replacing existing
expensive single large computing hardware. The results show we can
make this kind of transition in the near future, and we believe our
experiences will be motivation for others to follow suit.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x248c580.0x25859f8"></a>Acknowledgements</h2></div></div><p>The author would like to thank the following people for their
