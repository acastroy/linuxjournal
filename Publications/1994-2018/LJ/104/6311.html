in February 2002. The system would lock up shortly after being
powered on. I pulled the cover off and saw that one of the CPU fans
was not spinning. LAC promptly sent out two new CPU fans with
instructions for installing them. I installed the new fans, but the
system was no more stable. Gary at LAC suggested that maybe a
processor had been damaged from overheating, and they asked me to
return the whole system. I received the system back shortly
thereafter and had been happy ever since&mdash;until around August 19,
that is. The system started locking up again. Larry started to
suspect the Tyan 2460 motherboard and recommended returning the
system to him so he could replace the board with an ASUS A7M266D.
They also put in a quieter case and CPU fans, with my approval,
again at no charge. I now have the system back, with a new
motherboard and all new case and CPU fans. It is so quiet now, I
can run it in the dining room and my wife does not mind. LAC truly
stood behind their product.</p><p>&mdash;Chris Hajer</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19fc580.0x1af42f0"></a>Hooray for AOLserver and ACS</h2></div></div><p>This series (beginning with &ldquo;Introducing AOLserver&rdquo;,

of the October 2002 issue: &ldquo;Turn That Thing Down!&rdquo;. I too was
terribly annoyed with the constant wind-tunnel sound coming from my
always-on PC and found the following solution. My first step was to
install LMsensors so I could read the temperature sensors on the
motherboard, an ABit VP6. Without any changes, the CPU temps were
about 95-98&deg;. I then underclocked the CPUs down to 466MHz and
reduced the CPU core voltage to only 1.30 volts. This reduced the
CPU temp to almost room temperature.</p><p>Then, I disconnected both CPU fans and watched the temp climb
up to 109-111&deg;. I then rewired the three-wire CPU fans to run
at 5 volts with the third wire disconnected. At this speed, the CPU
fans were dead silent and CPU temp dropped back to room
temp.</p><p>Next, I replaced my NVIDIA GeForce2 card and its noisy fan
with an older Diamond Viper V550 video card without any fan at all.
I'm a housewife, not a gamer, so I'm not missing anything
here.</p><p>Next, I rewired the power supply fan to use only 5 volts
instead of 12. This made the power supply fan dead quiet. To be on
the safe side, I added another fan wired to the 5 volt supply on
the bottom of the case to draw cool air into the case. Good 12 volt
fans running at 5 volts make practically no sound.</p><p>Running with the above mods, my computer is near dead silent,
and I can't hear anything unless I put my ear just a few inches
from the case. The CPU temp is a nice cool mid-80s even when
compiling or playing music. I run Apache with PHP, MySQL, cidd,
SSH, e-mail, Galeon and dozens of other off-the-net and custom
programs. I really don't notice any difference between running at
933MHz and 466MHz, and even in the dead of night, the only
indication the computer is running is the little light on the
front.</p><p>On a side note, I discovered with LMsensors, I can read the
status of the &ldquo;chassis intrusion switch&rdquo;. I'm not sure how I'll
use this yet, but you can be sure I'll come up with a more
interesting use for this than detecting &ldquo;chassis
intrusion&rdquo;.</p><p>&mdash;Mrs. Kim Genrich</p><p>Thanks for the tips. (Readers, remember that only people
trained in high-voltage safety should open or modify power
supplies.)</p><p>&mdash;Editor</p></div></div>
