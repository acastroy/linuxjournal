of the Stupid Network&rdquo;, a widely circulated internal document at
AT&amp;T
(<a href="http://www.rageboy.com/stupidnet.html" target="_self">www.rageboy.com/stupidnet.html</a>),
&ldquo;The Internet breaks the telephone company model by passing
control to the end user. It does this by taking the underlying
network details out of the picture.&rdquo;
</p><p>The document cost David his job at AT&amp;T. But he was
right. The Net's end-to-endedness supports countless new
efficiencies that go without notice because they happen in the
background. GE Global eXchange Services
(<a href="http://gxs.com" target="_self">gxs.com</a>), for example,
processes over a billion transactions worth over a trillion dollars
a year&mdash;all over the Net.</p><p>GXS President and CEO Harvey Seegers told me that the Net
evened the balance of power between supply and demand. In the past,
GE was in command of its relationships with its customers, he said;
but that ended with the Net. Now even giant companies like GE are
finding they can't muscle their customers anymore, and they're
liking it, because now they have much healthier relationships with
them.</p><p>After <span   class="emphasis"><em>Cluetrain</em></span>
(<a href="http://cluetrain.com" target="_self">cluetrain.com</a>) came out,
we heard the same kind of thing from a lot of other big companies,
including Wal-Mart, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Prudential and Ericsson.
But a conspicuous silence came from the companies that actually
carry the Internet. Verizon, AT&amp;T, Qwest, Time Warner Cable,
Comcast, Cox and SBC all try to talk Internet, but they still seem
to be dreaming about subscription valves on content spigots. This
dream has been a nightmare ever since carriers began to build
broadband services around the same power asymmetries established by
consumer marketing. To them, the Net was all big-to-small and
few-to-many, like television.</p><p>The big &ldquo;content&rdquo; companies from the entertainment industry
shared those fantasies. Unfortunately, they did get the Net's
founding clues&mdash;and hated them. The last thing they wanted to see
was billions of dumb consumers turned into smart customers&mdash;or
worse, smart suppliers.</p><p>But in the long run (and it might be very long), the Net will
beat big-to-small. When that happens, the question for the carrier
and content companies will be no different from what it was in
1995: How can I make money here?</p><p>Arguing about end-to-end isn't going to do the job with
Congress, and it probably won't do the job with business, either.
What we need is implementation. I suggest identity (ID). All kinds
of business opportunities open up once identity protocols are ready
to support business innovations based on them.</p><p>To gauge the importance of ID, consider the matter of your
own identities&mdash;those representations of yourself in the business
world. How many of them are granted to you by outside
organizations? How many are mostly beyond your control? Is it close
to 100% in both cases?</p><p>What new business possibilities would open if your suite of
identity representations were under your own control? What if your
identity operated in the networked world according to protocols
that granted your end as much power as the ones that make and
distribute products and the ones that process transactions?</p><p>What new businesses would be possible if your identity suite
had its own open APIs to let you choose what to do with your
personal information&mdash;your location, your destinations, your
interests, your preferences for anything and everything? What types
of existing businesses suddenly will find all kinds of productive
new ways to relate to customers? It's easy to imagine countless new
businesses&mdash;and a lot less unwanted advertising, PR, promotion,
junk mail and other annoying guesswork about what you, the
consumer, might want.</p><p>Making this happen is what PingID.com has been up to in the
year since it was founded by Andre Durand, who also cofounded
Jabber.com. Like Jabber, PingID has a .org counterpart (PingID.org)
that handles open-source development. (Disclaimer: I am on the
advisory boards of both Jabber.com and PingID.com.)</p><p>PingID.org is working on a peer-to-peer browser or thin
(embedded) client-based public digital identity infrastructure. It
makes heavy use of XML, SOAP, XML-RPC and other standards that
Jabber also trafficks in. At the helm of PingID.org's efforts is
Bryan Field-Elliot. I recently asked Bryan how it's going. Here's
what he told me:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Looking back over the history of protocols and
their implementations, I see two different routes we can take. One
is the Gnutella route, where we trailblaze a new protocol that
perfectly suits our vision of identity rollout. The other is the
Apache route, where we do practical implementations of protocols
that have already been developed. We're trying to balance both
routes and see what happens.
</p><p>Say that PingID.org trailblazes a new protocol putting
ultimate privacy control in the hands of the user&mdash;priorities,
which are secondary at best for Liberty and Passport. Can we
realistically expect any traction in the real world given the
momentum behind the other identity protocols? Or instead, should we
follow up on protocols developed by, say, the Liberty Alliance?
Right now those protocols are not especially friendly to the
individual, but someday they might be. There's a better chance of
that happening if we're in the conversation. This is the fine line
we're walking: a balance between idealism and pragmatism.</p></blockquote></div><p>The choice Bryan presents is about implementation. But
motivation to implement only comes when people start imagining all
the cool ways this stuff can be put to use. Here are eight that
have come up for Andre Durand, solely through his conversations
with businesses that have taken an interest in building out ID
infrastructure: 1) identity service providers (basically identity
hosting services); 2) identity verification/authentication services
(certificate/signatory services); 3) identity guardian services
(companies that protect/monitor the use of your identity
information); 4) identity interoperability services (companies that
help transport an identity in one system to an identity in another
system); 5) identity reputation companies (companies that help you
maintain and monitor your digital reputation to ensure it is clean
and accurate); 6) identity networks (this is what PingID Network is
building); 7) a branded, quality assured network that facilitates
business-to-business and business-to-consumer identity interaction;
and 8) identity registrars (companies that &ldquo;issue identities&rdquo;).
</p><p>There are also existing business categories that can make
extensive use of a public ID infrastructure: banks, cell-phone
companies, credit-card companies, retailers and our original two:
carriers and content providers.</p><p>With an end-empowering ID infrastructure in place, many new
carrier services to customers suddenly become imaginable, because
each customer is much more than a name, a number and an address.
Their identities are not only far more rich and detailed, but their
behavior is far more active and involves far more choice. Rather
than threatening carriers, it gives them an API to which they can
address far more granular and flexible services, including
bandwidth as symmetrical or asymmetrical as the customer
requires.</p><p>When preference-rich and fully empowered customers show up in
the content marketplace, eager to develop relationships with the
artists who make movies and recordings, all the DRM issues that hog
conversational airtime today get exposed as desperate attempts by
distributors to control &ldquo;consumer&rdquo; behavior.</p><p>A sufficiently end-empowering digital identity infrastructure
will make consumers evolve into customers. When that happens, all
arguments about controlling consumer behavior become moot, and the
end-to-end argument finally wins, big time.</p></div></div>
