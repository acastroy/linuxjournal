Welcome to the 2010 <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> Readers' Choice Awards.
We love doing these awards because we get to interact with you, our
readers, more than
usual. This year, more than 12,000 of you generously
took time to participate and share your perspectives on what tools are
helping you work and play. We always are fascinated
by your preferences and how your usage patterns change over time.
This year, we have more categories than ever, so let's get right to the
results. Here, ladies and gentlemen, Linux geeks of all kinds, are the
winners of your
2010 <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> Readers' Choice Awards.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1000580.0x10f8510"></a>
Best Linux Distribution</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Ubuntu</b></span>
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Honorable Mention:
PCLinuxOS</em></span>
</p><p>
Times they are a changin' (just a bit) in the distribution department
this year. Although Ubuntu in all its tasty flavors remains the Roger
Federer-esque champion of Linux distros, the dynamics of this category
have changed from the past two years. In 2008, Ubuntu was dubbed
the &ldquo;big distro that did&rdquo; for &ldquo;unexpectedly leaving its myriad 'rivals'
as mere dots in the rear-view mirror&rdquo;. Then in 2009, Ubuntu received
the &ldquo;Energizer Bunny Award&rdquo; for increasing its popularity and becoming
untouchable (for the time being). But what a difference a year can make
(just ask Tiger Woods). Ubuntu remains in the commanding lead, but it slipped a
considerable 13% from of your votes last year.
Meanwhile, a feisty, upwardly mobile distro, PCLinuxOS,
grew from the single digits to a full 15%,
meriting a worthy honorable mention recognition.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1000580.0x10f88d8"></a>
Best Distribution for Netbooks/Limited Hardware</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Ubuntu Netbook Remix</b></span>
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Honorable Mention:
Android OS</em></span>
</p><p>
New for the 2010 Readers' Choice Awards is the category Best
Distribution for Netbooks/Limited Hardware. This will be an interesting
category to monitor as time goes by, but the current leader is Ubuntu
Netbook Remix, which got a commanding 36% of your votes. The honorable
mention winner, Android OS, was far behind, but it
broke the 10% barrier. We predict that this category will become more
fiercely competitive in the future.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1000580.0x10f8b98"></a>
Best Mobile OS</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Google Android</b></span> 
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Honorable Mention:
MeeGo</em></span>
</p><p>
Last year, Android and the T-Mobile G1 smartphone took home Linux Product
of the Year honors, despite being absent from every other category
selected by us (point taken, dear readers). One year wiser, we 
present a new category for 2010, Best Mobile OS, and its logical winner is
Google's Android. But wait! Although Android's vote haul was impressive at
66%, the new MeeGo made a strong showing for honorable mention, which is
noteworthy in
its own right. The upstart MeeGo, a fusion of Nokia's Maemo and Intel's
Moblin projects, garnered 10% on its own. Then, add the 7% of you who selected
Maemo and 3% who selected Moblin individually to arrive
at a healthy 20%. Meanwhile, old-timer Symbian missed the cut.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1000580.0x10f8eb0"></a>
Best Desktop Environment</h2></div></div><p>
Tie: <span   class="bold"><b>GNOME</b></span> and <span   class="bold"><b>KDE</b></span>
</p><p>
The results from the Best Desktop Environment make more intuitive sense to
us (and to this KDE fan) than in the previous two bouts, when GNOME edged
out KDE by surprisingly healthy margins. In the 2010 battle royale, KDE
jiu-jitsued GNOME and gobbled 7% of its lunch (as well as 3% of Xfce's) to
even the desktop score from last year. No other desktop surpassed the 3% mark.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1000580.0x10f9118"></a>
Best Web Browser</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Firefox</b></span>
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Honorable Mention:
Chrome</em></span>
</p><p>
In the 2009 Readers' Choice Awards, 87% of you voted to seat the Mozilla Firefox
browser comfortably on the throne of Best Web Browser. Meanwhile, Google
Chrome was just making its debut on the Linux stage (most commonly in the
form of the CrossOver Chromium Project) and began appearing on your &ldquo;to tinker
with&rdquo; lists. We suggested last year that by awards time in
2010, 
you should &ldquo;look for an inevitable battle royale if Google can deliver
a polished Chrome for Linux in time for you to give it a test-drive&rdquo;.
Well, folks, that battle has ensued, and the era of unchallenged Firefox
supremacy is over. Chrome leaped from a barely perceptible 0.35% of
the vote in 2009 to 24% this year.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1000580.0x10f9488"></a>
Best E-mail Client</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Thunderbird</b></span>
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Honorable Mention:
Gmail Web Client</em></span>
</p><p>
In 2009, we suggested the apparently inevitable decline of the desktop
e-mail client in favor of Web-based clients like Gmail. It looks like the
official <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> Magic 8-Ball was in need of another shake, for Thunderbird
handily has won the Readers' Choice Award for Best E-mail Client for the
fourth consecutive year. Surprisingly, the previously upward trend for Gmail
hit a ceiling (at least for now), and it lost a few points from last year,
at the primary expense of Kmail, which came back onto your radar screens
to garner a healthy 14% of the vote.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1000580.0x10f97a0"></a>
Best IM Client</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Pidgin</b></span>
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Honorable Mention:
Skype</em></span>
</p><p>
Despite our redubbing of this category from Favorite Communications Tool
to Best IM Client, the results changed
only slightly. For the third year in a row, the no-protocol-left-behind
Pidgin Internet Messenger took top honors&mdash;with an identical 43% share
of your votes vs. last year to boot. In the honorable mention column,
the closed-source but so useful Skype took top honors, dropping a point
from 2009 (17% vs. 18%).

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1000580.0x10f9a60"></a>
Best IRC Client</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Pidgin</b></span>
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Honorable Mention:
XChat</em></span>
</p><p>
Although you have plenty of choices when it comes to IRC chat clients,
the overwhelming majority of you stay put on Pidgin or fire up the
multiplatform XChat for your IRC-based chats&mdash;39% of you prefer Pidgin
and 33% prefer XChat.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1000580.0x10f9cc8"></a>
Best Microblogging Client</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Gwibber</b></span> 
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Honorable Mention: 
Choqok</em></span>
</p><p>
This new category for 2010, Best Microblogging Client, also
would have the top five entrants in Best-Named Linux Application. The hands-down
winners would be Gwibber, Choqok, Nitwit and our personal favorite, Spaz.
Despite parity regarding the name-related coolness factor, the generalist and
GNOME-based Gwibber easily took the crown for Best Microblogging Client,
followed by the more specialist KDE-based Choqok. 

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1000580.0x10f0818"></a>
Best Office Suite</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>OpenOffice.org</b></span> 
</p><p>
No shake-ups here, gang. OpenOffice.org remains your uncontested choice
for Best Office Suite, and no program even passed the 10% threshold
to warrant honorable mention. Keep your eye on Google Docs though,
because it showed up this year for the first time with 8%
of the vote. In this as in most categories, cross-platform capability
appears to boost a program's popularity significantly. Are Web-based apps
going to take over, or will desktop apps remain dominant in this space?
This area will be interesting to watch.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1000580.0x10f0a28"></a>
Best Single Office Program</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>OpenOffice.org Writer</b></span>
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Honorable Mention:
AbiWord</em></span>
</p><p>
Given that there are many more office applications than office suites, we
created this new category (Best Single Office Program) to understand
the nuances of our community's work habits better. Although the OpenOffice.org apps
Writer and Calc both performed well, with Writer winning the category handily
with 39% of the vote. AbiWord from
GnomeOffice also
helps you get your work done quickly and effectively.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1000580.0x10f0ce8"></a>
Best Graphics/Design Tool</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>GIMP</b></span> 
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Honorable Mention:
Inkscape</em></span>
</p><p>
This year's plebiscite features identical award winners
in the Best Graphics/Design Tool category&mdash;GIMP for the win and
Inkscape for honorable mention. The only difference from last year is
that GIMP inched down a few points and Inkscape up a few points.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1000580.0x10f0fa8"></a>
Best Digital Photo Management Tool</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>digiKam</b></span>
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Honorable Mention:
Picasa</em></span>
</p><p>
The back-and-forth tussle between digiKam and Picasa is looking more and
more like a WWE SmackDown. In 2008, the two photo apps were tied for your
favorites in the crowded category of Best Digital Photo Management Tool.
Then last year, Picasa gave digiKam a royal piledriver and racked up
nearly triple the votes of its poor rival. But this year, digiKam had
a surprise Diving Bulldog up its sleeve and had enough energy left to
pin Picasa to the mat for the win. 

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1000580.0x10f1268"></a>
Best Audio Tool</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Audacity</b></span>
</p><p>
In the Best Audio Tool category, the program Audacity becomes more dominant
every year, winning the 2010 award with a resounding 81% of your
preferences, up 8% from last year. The popular cross-platform sound
recorder and editor has little competition&mdash;only 8% of you consider
Ardour your favorite audio tool.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1000580.0x10f1420"></a>
Best Audio Player</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Amarok</b></span>
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Honorable Mention:
Rhythmbox</em></span>
</p><p>
Your preferences for Best Audio Player this year are consolidating around
two favorites, namely the winner, Amarok, and the sole honorable mention,
Rhythmbox. Previously, this category was more crowded
with contenders. However, Amarok is one of those apps that is riding
the wave of resurgence we're seeing in KDE and its related applications.
It doesn't hurt that Amarok is one kick-butt music app too.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1000580.0x10f16e0"></a>
Best Media Player</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>VLC</b></span>
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Honorable Mention:
MPlayer</em></span>
</p><p>
After winning the Best Media Player award for 2009 by a single percentage
point, there's no looking back for VLC, which won again in 2010, this
time with more than triple the votes of its nearest rival, MPlayer.
VLC's attraction could be the fact that it plays nearly any audio
(or video) format you send its way, as well as its cross-platform
capabilities. If you happen to find yourself in front of a Mac or Windows
(or BeOS!) box, you're never far from &ldquo;the cone&rdquo;.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1000580.0x10f19f8"></a>
Best Bookmark Syncing Tool</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Xmarks</b></span>
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Honorable Mention: 
Delicious</em></span>
</p><p>
Nobody works on more machines than a Linux geek, so we're perfect
guinea pigs for rating the product in this new category, Best Bookmark
Syncing Tool. Your two favorites are Mitch Kapor's Xmarks (formerly
Foxmarks) and Yahoo!'s Delicious (er, deli.icio.us). Firefox's own Weave tool fared well, but
its Firefox-centricity may keep it from jousting at a higher level with
its multibrowser-capable rivals.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1000580.0x10f1cb8"></a>
Best On-line Collaboration Tool</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Google Docs</b></span>
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Honorable Mention:
Wikis</em></span>
</p><p>
On the surface, it's somewhat
counterintuitive how you love Google Docs as an on-line collaboration tool
but merely like it as an office suite. (See the results for Best Office
Suite above.) Perhaps it's because you use OpenOffice.org more for your
day-to-day work tasks but use Google Docs when the task specifically calls for
collaboration? Despite your penchant for Google's tools, a solid number
of you turn to wikis to share information with your dispersed colleagues.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1000580.0x10f1fd0"></a>
Best Cloud-Based File Storage</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Dropbox</b></span>
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Honorable Mention:
Ubuntu One</em></span>
</p><p>
For creating a redundant off-site backup copy of your important files,
your tendency is to choose the popular Dropbox and Ubuntu One services.
Knowing how we Linux geek cheapskates work, I bet you're signed up for
the free 2GB accounts&mdash;40 separate ones to back up your 80GB drive.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1000580.0x10f2290"></a>
Best Kid-Friendly Application</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Tux Paint</b></span>
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Honorable Mention:
GCompris</em></span>
</p><p>
The winner of the new category Best Kid-Friendly Application is Tux
Paint, a gleefully fun drawing program for kids.
Reading your comments, we also know good number of you have managed to
get Linux into your local school, so you've probably installed Tux Paint
free of charge for the students to use as a tool for art instruction. On
that same install, a sensible companion would be GCompris, a somewhat
more diverse set of educational applications for children.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1000580.0x10f2550"></a>
Best Game</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b><span class="emphasis"><em>Frozen Bubble</em></span></b></span>
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Honorable Mention:
<span class="emphasis"><em>Doom</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>Battle for Wesnoth</em></span> (tie)</em></span>
</p><p>
It is beginning to seem that no game will ever knock <span   class="emphasis"><em>Frozen
Bubble</em></span> from
its lofty perch as Best Game. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Bubble</em></span> has won the title every time.
Not only does <span   class="emphasis"><em>Frozen Bubble</em></span> lure you in with its pure simplicity, but
those penguins are just too darn cute! Take note though that the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Battle
for Wesnoth</em></span> has won honorable mention for the first time ever.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1000580.0x1406018"></a>
Best Database</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>MySQL</b></span>
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Honorable Mention: 
PostgreSQL</em></span>
</p><p>
We'll have to do something about the LAMP acronym if you ever give up
MySQL, which remains your choice for Best Database three years running.
Nevertheless, we've seen a bit of erosion in support for MySQL toward your
honorable mention pick of PostgreSQL, which has gained ground every year.
SQLite may soon find itself on the
board with the heavy hitters if it keeps climbing as well.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1000580.0x14062d8"></a>
Best Backup Solution</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>rsync</b></span>
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Honorable Mention:
tar</em></span>
</p><p>
Here's one case where we retrenched and reduced our categories, namely
combining Best Backup System and Best Backup Utility into a single
category called Best Backup Solution. Your choice for champion in this
category was rsync, the winner of Best Backup Utility in 2009, followed
by tar. Last year's winner
and honorable mention in the Best Backup System category, Amanda and
Bacula, respectively, also fared well in the votes.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1000580.0x1406598"></a>
Best Virtualization Solution</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>VirtualBox</b></span>
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Honorable Mention:
VMware</em></span>
</p><p>
If we had an award for Most Upwardly Mobile Linux Solution, it just might
be VirtualBox. You've been favoring VirtualBox more and more with each
passing year, such that a full 55% of you chose it as Best Virtualization
Solution this year, which is up an impressive 23% from last year and
more than double VMware's result of 23%.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1000580.0x14068b0"></a>
Best Monitoring Application</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Nagios</b></span> 
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Honorable Mention:
Zabbix</em></span>
</p><p>
When speaking of upwardly mobile Linux apps, we should include
Zabbix in the same breath, the classic monitoring application that could.
Coming out of the tiny country of Latvia, the enterprise-class monitoring
solution Zabbix went from also-ran last year to contender this year in
the category Best Monitoring Application. Of course, let's not forget that 34% of you still favor the
winner Nagios. However, Nagios is down 17% from last year's tally.
Zabbix definitely is worth keeping on your radar.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1000580.0x1406b70"></a>
Best Revision Control System</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>git</b></span>
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Honorable Mention: 
Apache Subversion</em></span>
</p><p>
Your two top picks for the Best Revision Control System
are this year's winner, git, and last year's winner (and this year's
sole honorable mention), Apache Subversion. In case you haven't done so already,
you might want to investigate the origins of git, which was created
by Linus Torvalds. The source of its name will give you a chuckle.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1000580.0x1406dd8"></a>
Best Programming Language</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Python</b></span> 
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Honorable Mention:
C++</em></span>
</p><p>
Despite the tough field of contenders, Guido van Rossum's Python won 
Best Programming Language
for the second straight year. Your votes came down nearly exactly the same
as last year, with C++ in second place.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1000580.0x1407098"></a>
Best Scripting Language</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Python</b></span>
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Honorable Mention:
PHP</em></span>
</p><p>
Two years ago, we tried to make our own distinction as to which languages
were programming languages and which were scripting languages. We set
up an elaborate set of criteria and attempted to justify our position.
Well, you didn't appreciate our micromanagement, so we scrapped that
idea for good. Now you decide which is which, and you have
decided that Python is both the best programming language and scripting
language out there. 
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1000580.0x1407300"></a>
Best IDE</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Eclipse</b></span>
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Honorable Mention:
KDevelop</em></span>
</p><p>
Eclipse is batting 1.000 in the Best IDE category, winning both of its
two years in existence. You've told us you like how Eclipse lets
you work in a lean environment and add and subtract an incredible array
of functionality via plugins. 

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1000580.0x14075c0"></a>
Best Open-Source Configuration Management Tool</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Puppet</b></span>
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Honorable Mention:
OpenQRM</em></span>
</p><p>
The new category Best Open-Source Configuration Management Tool turned out
to be one of the most crowded fields, yet Puppet Labs' Puppet application
managed to pull ahead of the pack. Perhaps it's
how Puppet considers each piece of infrastructure as code that has helped
you simplify new configurations and helped reduce the time you spend on
mundane tasks.

Best Platform for Developing Rich Internet Apps</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Adobe AIR</b></span>
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Honorable Mention:
JavaFX</em></span>
</p><p>
Adobe AIR seems to be solidifying itself as your choice for Best Platform
for Developing Rich Internet Apps, winning the category both this year and
last. AIR is trending upward, rising a few percentage points this year
vs. 2009.

Best Package Management Application</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>apt</b></span>
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Honorable Mention:
Synaptic</em></span>
</p><p>
Despite your continued overwhelming preference for Ubuntu and siblings,
the success of package managers typically associated with these distros
is a tad enigmatic. Let's parse it. You prefer Ubuntu's default apt as
Best Package Management Application but a full 10% less than last year.
At the same time, 8% more of you like Synaptic than last year to give
it honorable mention again, so it's reasonable to assume that a good
number of the Ubuntu-ite tribe are trying Synaptic and digging it. We can
comprehend all of that, but KPackageKit, Kubuntu's default package
manager, wasn't even on the radar despite KDE's surge to tie GNOME for
Best Desktop Environment. What's going on here?

Best Content Management System</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>WordPress</b></span>
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Honorable Mention:
Drupal</em></span>
</p><p>
Your narrator had a total blast building a sweet, slick Web site with
WordPress, so he's totally in agreement your decision to grant it
Best Content Management System for 2010. My experience was positive, and
I put together a great design despite nearly no skill in graphic design.
We at <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> also gave our vote to honorable
mention winner Drupal,
the platform we have used for the previous and the recently updated
LinuxJournal.com.

Best Linux-Friendly Web Hosting Company</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>GoDaddy.com</b></span>
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Honorable Mention:
Contegix</em></span>
</p><p>
Although we have a clear winner for the Best Linux-Friendly Web Hosting
Company for 2010, GoDaddy.com, the reality is that five companies
have been jockeying for the title. Although GoDaddy.com won in 2008, it
fell out of the winner's circle in 2009. Then, there's your honorable
mention pick, Contegix, which was the winner last year. Companies like
Dreamhost, Rackspace and 1&amp;1 also have been in contention every year.

Best Linux Laptop Vendor</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Dell</b></span>
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Honorable Mention:
Lenovo</em></span>
</p><p>
For years, Dell (at least in the US) avoided Linux-based PCs like
the plague. We kept hearing how the market wasn't ready yet. We kept
saying &ldquo;Sheesh, guys, build it and they will come.&rdquo; Well, now they've
built it, and we have come&mdash;in droves! Dell dips its influential toe in
the water and suddenly gets more votes than anyone for Best Linux
Laptop Vendor. We're very curious to know how many of you are buying
Dell laptops preinstalled vs. self-installation. Are we right to assume
you're doing more of the latter? Our own hats are tipped graciously to Lenovo, who
has taken arguably more risks than any other
Windows-dominant laptop maker to put out great Linux-based laptops and
make them mainstream. Also, we salute the Linux PC specialists who have
been configuring our machines since the Precambrian. We hope you don't
forget them.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1000580.0x1684320"></a>
Best Linux Desktop Workstation Vendor</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Dell</b></span>
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Honorable Mention:
Hewlett-Packard</em></span>
</p><p>
The world's two biggest PC makers, Dell and HP, are your two top choices
for Best Linux Desktop Workstation Vendor. This makes perfect sense,
as installing Linux on desktops remains more trouble-free than doing
so on laptops. Note that a spunky company,
System 76&mdash;which proudly peddles Linux machines and doesn't make you
enter through some backdoor link, only to find you've accidentally
ordered a Windows machine&mdash;also did well in the voting.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1000580.0x1684588"></a>
Best Linux Server Vendor</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>IBM</b></span>
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Honorable Mention:
Dell</em></span>
</p><p>
In the Big Iron category, Best Linux Server Vendor, you gave more
votes to IBM than any other company. It makes sense given IBM's long-term
business strategy involving Linux. In 2009, Dell was the winner here,
and this year, it placed a close second behind Big Blue. 

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1000580.0x1684848"></a>
Best Linux Book</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b><span class="emphasis"><em>Linux in a Nutshell</em></span></b></span>
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Honorable Mention:
<span class="emphasis"><em>Running Linux</em></span></em></span>
</p><p>
Given the hundreds of books on Linux-related topics, it was a
Herculean task for any single book to win the category Best Linux Book.
Nevertheless, we asked you to write in your favorite title, and the
classic work <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux in a Nutshell</em></span> (E. Siever, et al., O'Reilly) was
your top pick, acquiring more than double its nearest competitor,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Running Linux</em></span> (Dalheimer and Welsh, O'Reilly). We're wondering though,
why more of you didn't write in <span   class="emphasis"><em>Just for Fun: The Story of an Accidental
Revolutionary</em></span> (Torvalds and Diamond, Harper) or <span   class="emphasis"><em>The
Cathedral and the Bazaar</em></span>
(Raymond, snowballpublishing.com). Who needs another copy of the syllabus
for official Linux geeks?

Best <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> Column</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Hack and / by Kyle Rankin</b></span>
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Honorable Mention: Paranoid Penguin by Mick Bauer</em></span>
</p><p>
Choosing the winner for Best <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> Column is just as Herculean as
with Best Linux Book, except the problem is not the abundance of quantity
but rather extreme quality of each offering. 
Kyle Rankin's Hack and / column has become the page that more of
you flip to first than any other. (Incidentally, Kyle's column has been
trending upward for some time&mdash;he tied for winner last year.)

Best Brand of Video Chipset</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>NVIDIA</b></span>
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Honorable Mention:
ATI</em></span>
</p><p>
Before wrapping up, let's get back to some of your favorite gear.
This year, we introduced the new category Best Brand of Video Chipset,
which was won handily by NVIDIA. Although we as a
community are frustrated with NVIDIA's proprietary drivers, we can rejoice
in the performance and Linux support, which is better than most.

Best Linux Smartphone</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Nokia N900</b></span>
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Honorable Mention:
HTC Nexus One</em></span>
</p><p>
No <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> award show would be complete without a Nokia N-series
device, and the 2010 Readers' Choice Awards is no exception. The Nokia
N900 takes the award for Best Linux Smartphone. We're not too surprised
that you chose the N900 given that it's the most early-adopter phone out
there. That's us. The honorable mention in this category is
an Android: HTC Nexus One.

Best Linux-Based Gadget</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Amazon Kindle</b></span>
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Honorable Mention:
TomTom Navigation System</em></span>
</p><p>
The device that made reading an e-book a viable option is the Linux-based
Amazon Kindle, your winner for this year's Best Linux-Based Gadget.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1000580.0x1685920"></a>
Best New Open-Source Project (released in 2009 or 2010)</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>MeeGo</b></span>
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Honorable Mention:
OwnCloud</em></span>
</p><p>
For the category Best New Open-Source Project released in 2009 or 2010, we
asked you to write in your favorites without any prompting from us. Although the
responses were numerous, the winner is MeeGo! A little bit of Moblin in your Maemo, or
Maemo in your Moblin, this merger of two mobile operating systems is quite exciting.
It's fairly new, but will this open-source powerhouse become the next big thing?  Your
votes seem to imply it, we'll have to wait and see.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1000580.0x1685be0"></a>
Best New Commercial Application (released in 2009 or 2010)</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Fluendo DVD Player</b></span>
</p><p>
The race for Best New Commercial Application was neither as crowded
nor closely fought as the one for Best New Open-Source Project.
The hands-down winner was Fluendo DVD Player. Although we Linux geeks hate to pay, the product makes playing
any DVD possible, fully functional (and legal).

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1000580.0x1685df0"></a>
Product of the Year</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Android</b></span>
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Honorable Mention:
KDE</em></span>
</p><p>
We close with the category that requires a drumroll (drumroll, please):
the 2010 Linux Journal Readers' Choice Product of the Year. And, the
winner is Android! The open-source operating system from Google has proven
to be a formidable opponent in the mobile-phone world. Because it's
getting Linux into the hands of people who don't even realize they're
using Linux, we can see why it's your choice for Product of the Year.
We look forward to Android's 3.0 release, which Google claims will support
tablet computers as well. Perhaps when version 4.0 rolls around, we'll
have androids running Android!
