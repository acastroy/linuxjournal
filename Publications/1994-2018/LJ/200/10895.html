<span   class="bold"><b>Filesystem hints</b></span> are attributes that filesystems can pass down to
storage devices. The devices then use the hints to make decisions
about how to lay down their data most efficiently. <span   class="bold"><b>Matthew Wilcox</b></span> has
expressed interest in implementing this. Specifically, he wanted to
implement the <span   class="bold"><b>NVMHCI working group</b></span>'s recommended set of filesystem
hints. But, as <span   class="bold"><b>James Bottomley</b></span> pointed out, the filesystem and the
hardware had no real basis for agreement on what any given hint
actually meant. So the filesystem would make guesses about what kind
of hints to give the device, and the device would make guesses about
what those hints actually meant. As James said, one of the most
interesting things is that systems using filesystem hints seem to do
better than those that don't, in spite of the guesswork involved. But,
folks like <span   class="bold"><b>Alan Cox</b></span> remain unconvinced, saying he'd bet a beer on the
fact that filesystem hints would end up not being used, even if they
were fully implemented in the kernel. He didn't see enough benefit.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Robert P. J. Day</b></span> has started offering
<span   class="bold"><b>kernel programming classes</b></span>. See
<a href="http://www.crashcourse.ca/wiki/index.php/Online_beginner's_kernel_programming_course" target="_self">www.crashcourse.ca/wiki/index.php/Online_beginner's_kernel_programming_course</a>
for details. Some of the lessons are available for free; others are
available at what seems like a pretty low fee. I haven't taken the
class myself, and I'm not getting a kickback for mentioning it, but it
seems like an interesting way for folks to get started with kernel
hacking.
</p><p>
Using <span   class="bold"><b>kernel-level encryption</b></span> can be slow, but several folks,
including <span   class="bold"><b>Miloslav Trmac</b></span>, recently argued that it would protect
user-space applications from certain kinds of malicious attacks.
Miloslav submitted a patch implementing a user-space interface to the
kernel's encryption routines. This inspired a number of complaints.
<span   class="bold"><b>Theodore Y. Ts'o</b></span> felt the speed issues would be pretty significant,
and he wanted to make sure that potential users were made well aware
of the huge slowdown their code would experience if they used this API
instead of a user-space implementation of the same basic feature. <span   class="bold"><b>Arnd
Bergmann</b></span> also found Miloslav's code to be overly complex, but this was
explained by the fact that so many user requests had come in for
extensions to Miloslav's initial implementation. The complexity was
necessary to accommodate those requests. In spite of the general
complaints against this code, it does seem as though the security
reasons do justify it, so none of the critics seem to be objecting
too loudly. I'd expect a clean implementation to make it into the
kernel.
</p><p>
There was a bit of a scare recently when <span   class="bold"><b>Linus
Torvalds</b></span> received a set
of patches that appeared not to have been compiled or tested at all,
in spite of the long &ldquo;Signed-Off-By&rdquo; chain listed in the patch
e-mail messages.
One of the main values of the &ldquo;lieutenant&rdquo; system is that patches are
vetted through a series of trusted people who understand what Linus
wants and can give it to him. If that system ever broke down, Linus
probably would have to fall back on the &ldquo;maintainer&rdquo; system, which
would be less good, because maintainers often are selected based solely
on their willingness to do that job, and not on their specific
reliability as producers of Linus-worthy code. The lieutenant system,
in part, helps communicate various requirements to the maintainers.
In this particular case, <span   class="bold"><b>Len Brown</b></span> had done an incorrect merge 
between some ACPI branches and then fed the wrong branch of
his tree into his test suite. It's a very unusual confluence of
errors, but the result was that some patches made it to Linus without
the proper testing&mdash;just one of those things that happens and gets
fixed.

<h2 class="title">Networking on the Command Line</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Joey Bernard</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #200, December 2010</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Lots of GUI tools exist to help set up and maintain
network connections. Two common ones are NetworkManager and wicd. But,
because the focus here is doing things on the command line,
how can you configure your network connections and be sure they are
behaving correctly?
</p><p>
The first utility to cover is ifconfig, which lets you learn about and set
all kinds of parameters for network interfaces. When you simply run
it with no options, you get a list of all the network interfaces
on your machine along with details for each. It looks a bit like this:


<pre     class="programlisting">
eth0   Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:1e:8c:71:d4:1f  
       UP BROADCAST MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1
       RX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0
       TX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:1
       collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000 
       RX bytes:0 (0.0 B)  TX bytes:0 (0.0 B)
       Memory:fbfc0000-fc000000 

lo     Link encap:Local Loopback  
       inet addr:127.0.0.1  Mask:255.0.0.0
       inet6 addr: ::1/128 Scope:Host
       UP LOOPBACK RUNNING  MTU:16436  Metric:1
       RX packets:264 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0
       TX packets:264 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0
       collisions:0 txqueuelen:0 
       RX bytes:19232 (19.2 KB)  TX bytes:19232 (19.2 KB)

       inet addr:192.168.2.101  Bcast:192.168.2.255  
       &#8618;Mask:255.255.255.0
       inet6 addr: fe80::215:afff:fe6b:59ec/64 Scope:Link
       UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1
       RX packets:3228 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0
       TX packets:1639 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0
       collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000 
       RX bytes:2994761 (2.9 MB)  TX bytes:205416 (205.4 KB)
</pre>
</p><p>
You can set all kinds of options for your network interfaces with
ifconfig. These are applied to the interface you use on the command
line. In the examples below, I use eth1. You can set the usual things,
like the netmask:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ifconfig eth1 netmask 255.255.255.0
</pre>
</p><p>
Or, the MTU:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ifconfig mtu 1500
</pre>
</p><p>
You can set a network device to promiscuous mode so that it receives all
packets on the network, not just the ones addressed for your machine:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ifconfig promisc
</pre>
</p><p>
Setting the address is as simple as:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ifconfig eth1 192.168.4.4
</pre>
</p><p>
Several other more esoteric options are available, but they usually
apply only to specific hardware. Check the man page for more details.
</p><p>
Now that you can get your network interfaces configured on the command
line, you probably want to be able to have this configuration applied
on each reboot. This is where the file /etc/network/interfaces comes
in. You define each interface and whether each interface should
be brought up at boot time. The most basic entry would be for a wired
network interface that is using DHCP. In that case, it would look like
this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
iface eth1 inet dhcp
</pre>
</p><p>
Be sure to replace <tt  >eth1</tt> with the label for the specific interface you
want to configure. If your interface is static, you can set the
address, network, netmask and broadcast values. If you want this
interface to come up automatically at boot time, simply add
<tt  >auto eth1</tt> to the interfaces file. A full example
looks like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
auto eth1
iface eth1 inet static
    address 192.168.2.34
    network 192.168.2.0
    netmask 255.255.255.0
    broadcast 192.168.2.255
</pre>
</p><p>
More options are involved when you want to configure a wireless
network interface. These extra options begin with
<tt  >wireless-</tt>. In these
cases, you probably want to set the SSID of the wireless network to which you
actually want to connect. Also, if you need any security settings
to make your connection, you also can add them here by
using the option <tt  >wireless-key xxxxxxxxx</tt>. Here's a basic example, consisting
of an unsecured Wi-Fi connection using DHCP:

<pre     class="programlisting">
iface wlan0 inet dhcp
    wireless-essid "mynetwork"
</pre>
</p><p>
If you are a bit more safety-conscious and have chosen to use WPA, you
can enter your credentials with <tt  >wpa-</tt> options. This tells the network
subsystem to start up wpa_supplicant in the background to handle these
parts. A simple example looks like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
iface wlan1 inet dhcp
    wpa-ssid mynetwork
    wpa-psk mysecretpassphrase
</pre>
</p><p>
More complex examples, like those using EAP-TLS, can use an external
configuration file to handle authentication, for example:

<pre     class="programlisting">
auto wlan0
iface wlan0 inet dhcp
    wpa-conf /etc/wpa-supplicant/wpa-supplicant.conf
</pre>
</p><p>
In the above example, all the extra parameters needed to connect are located in the
named file. For more details on what you can put in this file, 
see the man page for wpa_supplicant.conf.
</p><p>
Once you have all this configured, how can you activate and deactivate
the various network interfaces? Use the utilities
ifup and ifdown. These use the network interfaces you defined in the file
/etc/network/interfaces. When you want to bring up a particular interface,
it's as simple as <tt  >ifup eth1</tt>. To bring down an
interface, 
do <tt  >ifdown wlan0</tt>. If you aren't sure whether a particular interface
is up, use <tt  >ifstatus eth0</tt> to check the status of
the network interface eth0. If you get your IP address through DHCP,
you may need to renew your lease, which you can do with <tt  >ifrenew
eth1</tt>. This accomplishes the DHCP renewal without actually cycling your
network interface. Now you should be able to get your network up
and running without having to resort to a GUI at all.

Microsoft may be public enemy number one to many in the Open Source
world, but Apple is certainly number two with a bullet.
Of course, that doesn't stop open source from existing in the Mac world.
One such open-source program is Cyberduck, an FTP client for Mac OS X.
</p><p>
Cyberduck supports an alphabet soup of file transfer protocols:
FTP, FTP/TLS, SFTP, WebDAV, Amazon S3, Amazon CloudFront,
Google Docs and Rackspace Cloud Files.
It integrates with external editors, file viewers, Web browsers,
the system Keychain, Spotlight, Bonjour and Growl.
It supports synchronizing local and remote directories with
a preview of the affected files.
Cyberduck can resume interrupted downloads and uploads.
</p><p>
Cyberduck is written mostly in Java.
The latest version of Cyberduck is 3.5.1, and it requires Mac OS X 10.5 or later.
For the non-Macified out there, the Cyberduck Trac roadmap refers to
a port to Windows, and the repository looks like progress is being made toward that end.
And, don't worry, Cyberduck can quack in your language,
with more than 30 supported translations.

<h2 class="title">Power Supplies</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #200, December 2010</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
One hundred forty-seven dollars and thirty-nine cents&mdash;that is the cost
for replacing a power supply for an old MiniITX computer system I found
in my office. Mind you, the entire unit cost about $199, and that was five
years ago, but still, the cost for a replacement power supply is absurd.
</p><p>
Thankfully, a quick search on the Internet found a universal power adapter
that fit my requirements for about $18. How can you find inexpensive
replacements for your missing power supplies, without frying your vintage
arcade cabinet computer? There are a few important things to watch for:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Voltage: most universal power adapters have several voltage selectors;
make sure that they match your needs. (For example, laptop power supplies
generally require more voltage and, unfortunately, are more expensive.) The
device should say near the power adapter how much voltage it requires.
The network switch in Figure 1 shows a need for 7.5V of DC current.
Some devices require AC voltage as opposed to DC, so be sure to look for
&ldquo;DC&rdquo; on the device.
</p></li><li><p>
Amperage: your device generally will say near its power port the
amperage it requires along with the voltage. Amperage is a little
different from voltage, and you want to make sure your power supply
supplies <span   class="emphasis"><em>at least</em></span> as much amperage (usually measured in milliamps)
as your device requires. The device will draw as much amperage as it
requires, but there's no concern if the power supply gives more than
it requires. The network switch in Figure 1 shows a 1 amp minimum
requirement.
</p></li><li><p>
Polarity: your device most likely will have a drawing that shows whether
the tip of the plug is positive and the jacket negative, or vice versa.
Most universal power supplies will have a selector that looks similar.
Make sure polarity is lined up! It's just like putting batteries in
backward if you flip the polarity.
</p></li><li><p>
Plug: I wish there were a standard for the various types of plugs
you might face, but sadly, there's not. Most universal adapters come
with a selection of plugs that will fit most devices, but unfortunately,
not all. It is possible, if you feel a bit adventurous, to cut the end
off your old power adapter (assuming you have it) and solder or tape the
correct plug on the wire of the universal adapter. Be warned, however,
that it's easy to mess up polarity when you do that.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
There are some other factors to weigh in as well. Some cheap universal
power supplies are not regulated, which means they can vary in voltage
depending on the load they're put under. If your device is particularly
sensitive, you may want to watch for that. In the end, if you're worried
you might mess up and ruin your prized powerless device, you always
can shell out the $147.39 and get a new one. For me though, $18
was more in my budget.

<h2 class="title">Just Keep Rolling</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #200, December 2010</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Linux Mint recently came out with a version of its operating system
based on Debian rather than Ubuntu. For the life of me, I couldn't see
the advantage over the Ubuntu-based version. Then, in an IM chat with
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> reader &ldquo;Topher&rdquo;, I finally understood. Rolling releases.
</p><p>
That may not sound significant, but if you are (or ever have been)
a Debian user, it's possible you use the &ldquo;testing&rdquo; release of
the
distribution. It's been so many years since I've been a Debian user,
I forgot about the beauty of the concept. See, when the Debian folks decide
to make a &ldquo;release&rdquo; of their distribution, they'll take a snapshot of
the &ldquo;testing&rdquo; branch and stabilize it from there. The testing branch
continues to roll along, never getting finished, and yet never getting
long in the tooth.
</p><p>
So although the idea of a rolling distribution isn't new by any means, if
you've been lulled into the Ubuntu release schedule but hate upgrading
every six months, perhaps a flavor of Linux that is always up to date
will appeal to you. If you don't like it, you always can update to
something else!

I am an EE by degree but have been writing software for 20+ years using FORTRAN,
Ada, C, C++, ASP, PHP, MySql, etc. I started at a large company then went into
the startup/consulting world for about seven years and am back at a larger
organization. I have been using Linux since 1995. Here is the story of my entry
into &ldquo;the penguin zone&rdquo;: I left a big company to work at a startup and moved
from using SGI Irix to Sun systems. I was still using Win98 at home but
wanted to learn more about *nix internals, admin, etc. A co-worker said &ldquo;get a
stack of diskettes and come with me.&rdquo; 30+ floppies later, I had Slackware and X
ready to load on my system at home.

Although I had already
been using Linux for a while before <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> started, I didn't hear about the
new magazine until the first issue was sold out. My first &ldquo;proper&rdquo;
issue was #2, but the <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> staff was kind enough to
photocopy issue #1 for me so I would not miss any issues. 
</p><p>
I started playing with Linux using a set of Yggdrasil disks with a 0.99
kernel in 1993. By the way, I just looked at my #1
issue and was amused to see articles on the kernel 1.0 code freeze
(written by Linus) and on Linux vs. Windows NT and OS/2 on the front page.
</p><p>
Over the years (16+), <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> has helped me stay abreast of
developments in the Linux community, and at times has helped to keep up
my enthusiasm for the platform when work or school pressures forced my
attention in other directions.
</p><p>
I have been programming computers for 40 years (just about every
kind imaginable). I have a PhD in Computer Engineering from UC
Santa Cruz, where I am currently an Adjunct Professor in the CE
department, and I am a researcher and manager at IBM's Almaden
Research Center in San Jose, California. I am also pleased to say that I
started the first Linux-based research project at IBM in 1996, several
years before IBM officially embraced the Linux platform. Some years ago,
I converted all of my systems (work and home, servers and laptops) to
Linux (and am Microsoft-free!).

I was an early leader in the adoption and implementation of
Linux and free and open-source software in Philadelphia. 
Through
my leadership position in the Philadelphia Area Computer Society (PACS),
I began introducing Linux to organizations in the Greater Philadelphia
region. At PACS, I organized monthly presentations on Linux and FOSS and
wrote 29 columns in the organization's print periodical, <span   class="emphasis"><em>The
Databus</em></span>. I
then founded and helped build Philadelphia's premiere Linux user group,
the Philadelphia-area Linux User Group (PLUG), where I continue to
facilitate its first Wednesday meetings. After helping establish a
community and culture for Linux and FOSS in Philadelphia, I started
building my first company, LinuxForce (<a href="http://www.LinuxForce.net" target="_self">www.LinuxForce.net</a>), to
be the &ldquo;go-to&rdquo; firm for organizations wanting to realize the promise
and power of Linux. 
I contribute to a blog on managing FOSS 
for business results (<a href="http://blog.RemoteResponder.net" target="_self">blog.RemoteResponder.net</a>).

needed help. <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> still helps. It gives me ideas of things I could/can

I've been in the fix-and-repair computer business for about 20 years.
I started out with Microsoft/DOS. I was a business guru, and then went
for my certifications and began building computers for a company that
made special-order hardware and software. Then, I moved into freelancing
with the fix-and-repair part. After that, I moved into a large school
district where I took care of the networking, computer repair and
software replacement at one of their high schools. These days, I'm
retired, but I still do some work for friends and family.

I live in Trento (Italy) and co-founded the local LUG in May 1998. I am active as

I'm actually the main Italian GIMP translator (program and user manual).

As of last month, I am a Jr Systems Administrator in the Bay Area (recently moved

I had a part-time job writing educational physics software in high school (1970s)
on an Apple ][. I joined the Air Force, where I became a system programmer on
Sperry Univac systems; the military wasn't afraid to give amazing
responsibilities to young punks. I went full-time Linux at home in 1994 with Yggdrasil,
started subscribing with issue #3 and got the back issues for 1 and 2. Became a
full-time Unix/Linux admin in the mid-1990s.

I love airplanes, aviation and airplane people. I'm a full-time volunteer on

instrument than the minimum required by law, and I've never used that one.

I'm a software developer currently working on multiplatform projects on

digital rights. With my association, I'm involved in a project to spread the

I like a monthly magazine, because despite reading a lot on the Internet,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>
always surprises me with things I have missed. It's great to read away from the

keyboard and jump on it.
I've been a subscriber since the stapled issue #1 and still have them all, and
it's great fun to flip back some pages from time to time.

I do research and programming in astronomy, and we have pretty much 100% migrated
to Linux during the past 10 years. I've built a number of boxes and RAID arrays, even
tinkered with real-time Linux for an instrument, but for programming work, I have
been a laptop user for the longest time.

I don't really know how long I've been a subscriber, but it'll
take more than your disastrous format change a couple of years ago to get me to

important piece of the OS) to my boss and slash our licensing costs.

I have been using Linux/open-source software since 1997. It was first

uses.
</p><p>
I have been programming since 1970. My first paid programming job was in the
summer of 1971 at the University of Illinois on the PLATO Project when I was in
high school. I have pretty much been programming ever since.
I still remember reading
Linus' e-mail about Linux in the Minix newsgroup while I was working for Apple and
thinking, &ldquo;Those guys are going to have a lot of fun. I wish I had time
to help.&rdquo;
Between work and family, I really didn't have free time to get involved. I also
thought that Linux would never really be important. Boy was I wrong about that!
My first exposure to Linux came in 1996 when I worked for an employer that used
Linux to host the company's main server that also served as the company's main
Internet connection. Initially, it was only dial-up access, but by 1997, it was
upgraded to ISDN. I don't remember the kernel version it was running, but that server
seemed more stable than the ISP it was connecting to.
Still programming after all these years, and mainly using Linux and Mac OS X.

I started using UNIX with Ultrix back in 1983. My first software contributions
were made to assembler language programs written for CP/M and were published on
RBBS (a popular bulletin-board system). I programmed in everything from Turbo
Pascal, to C, LISP and even Cobol. I have many years of experience as a software
release manager. I have been an adjunct professor teaching UNIX using Linux for
both continuing education and credit side colleges. I currently serve as a Sr
UNIX sysadmin specializing in Linux and Windows integration. I'm also
President of the North Texas Linux Users Group. Putting Linux distributions to
use in real-world situations is one of my passions.

Telecommunications Industry who felt extremely satisfied (and justified) when
the company I work for finally made the shift to a Linux-based OS in the mobile
phones it produces. My colleagues and I had been discussing this for years and
seeing it finally happen was vindication at an unprecedented level! Now, of
course, I have my work cut out for me since there is a huge demand for everything

My favourite aspect of <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> is the &ldquo;Things that make

articles are very useful, as are the product tests and comparisons. But it's
highlighting all those quirky/odd/crazy/utterly bizarre things that people are
out there doing, that Linux is a part of, that makes me look forward to the
magazine dropping into my mailbox every month. The latest issue always has pride

I guess I'm a life-long techie, having started out by learning BASIC on a
Sinclair ZX80 in 1980 at the age of 8. I've essentially grown up with the
personal computer industry, and have worked with so many different technologies
over the years, I can't even remember them all now. It appears that my brain is
prematurely full.
I started with Linux in 1993 as a way of keeping up the UNIX knowledge and skills
I had acquired while working in Germany. 
My first distro was Yggdrasil Linux, and I bought myself a video
card off their compatibility list and a 2.2X CD-ROM drive so I wouldn't have to
load up an insane amount of floppies. I got it all working, but it didn't really
do a lot. But it was a start, and it did keep me interested, and while I was
never able to make Linuxing a major part of my career, it has certainly been very
useful from time to time in a minor capacity.

My field is System Design and Software Architecture of mobile devices, and I
have
a long-term engagement with ST-Ericsson. I help asserting that the ST-Ericsson
dual-core ARM-based mobile platforms become attractive for use with open-source

Because everything is more awesome on-line, you'll find even more
great information about our 2010 Readers' Choice Awards at
<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/rc10" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/rc10</a>. There you'll see the runners-up and get a
more in-depth look at the survey results. Save yourself some typing
too, as we'll have links to all the winners and runners-up. It
was a tough race, and there were some great projects and products
represented, so check out all the top vote-getters at
LinuxJournal.com.
</p><p>
You'll also notice that this issue is our 200th! That's a lot of
Linux over the years, and I encourage you to get nostalgic and check
out some goodies from our archives. Our May 1995 &ldquo;World Wide
Web&rdquo;
focused issue is a favorite of mine
(<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/issue/13" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/issue/13</a>), as is a recent Linux
troubleshooting series by Kyle Rankin
(<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/10688" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/10688</a>). With so much information
compiled in our 200 issues, you'll see where we've been, where we
are, and where we're going in the Open Source community. Here's to
issue 300!
