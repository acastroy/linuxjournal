Find out whether I can port my beer fridge controller from a
laptop to a Pogoplug without losing my temper.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1caa580.0x1da2408"></a></h2></div></div><p>
In my August 2010 column, I wrote about how I used an old laptop, some
spare X10
devices I had and a TEMPer USB thermometer to control my fridge
so I could ferment beer in a nice, controlled environment. Since then,
I've received a number of e-mail messages from <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span> readers talking about
their own projects to create the perfect beer fridge. After reading about
Arduino-powered fridges and other hardware-hacking solutions, I became jealous
and began to think that my laptop solution, although simple, was overkill. My
hardware-hacking skills aren't quite to Arduino levels yet, so I ultimately
decided to look at other, lower-powered Linux devices I had around
(it turns out I had quite a few) to see if I couldn't coax one of them
into controlling my fridge.
</p><p>
The kind of device I needed had to meet a few criteria. One, it should
be able to run Linux. Second, it ideally would have at least one USB port
that I could use (with a hub if necessary) to connect my USB thermometer,
and if it didn't have a serial port, also connect a USB serial adapter
so I could use my X10 serial dongle. Sorry, Spykee robot, but my final
choice was a pink Pogoplug (Figure 1). The Pogoplug is a nifty little
Linux-powered appliance that allows you to connect your own USB hard
drives and then provide that data to you wherever you are, as long as
you have an Internet connection. Think of it somewhat like a personal
Dropbox, except you have full control of the storage and data. There's also
a good-size community around the Pogoplug that provides third-party
applications and even a custom Linux distribution based on Arch Linux.

Plugbox Linux Installation</h2></div></div><p>
The best things about the Pogoplug for my purposes were that it was small,
low-powered, had a custom Linux distribution with package management,
and most important, it had four USB ports. Once I decided to use it
instead of my laptop, the next step was to get the Arch Linux-based
Plugbox Linux installed on it. This distribution is hosted on
<a href="http://www.plugapps.com" target="_self">www.plugapps.com</a>, and the site provides all sorts of third-party
applications and packages for Pogoplug, DockStar and SheevaPlug
devices. I simply followed the install document for Plugbox Linux
verbatim, so instead of reposting it here, just follow the steps at
<a href="http://www.plugapps.com/index.php5?title=PlugApps:Pogoplug_Setboot" target="_self">www.plugapps.com/index.php5?title=PlugApps:Pogoplug_Setboot</a>. Be
sure to follow the advice about setting up openntpd; otherwise, Plugbox's
time will be way off, and you'll get strange warnings and errors as you
try to install and compile software.
</p><p>
Essentially, Plugbox Linux installs itself on an external USB drive that
you provide and then sets up the bootloader so that if the drive
is inserted, it will attempt to boot from it; otherwise, it will boot
from the native Pogoplug firmware. This provides a simple, relatively
low-risk way to modify the device to do what you want while still being
able to go back to defaults. Although I might have been able to get the
native Linux install to do what I wanted, Plugbox has simple package
management using Arch Linux's pacman, so I also could go back
to the standard Pogoplug firmware at any time. In my case, I used a spare
1GB thumbdrive for the OS, and that seemed to be plenty.

Bottlerocket Is a Breeze</h2></div></div><p>
After the Plugbox installation completed, I was able to boot in to the
environment and configure everything over SSH. Now, all I needed to do
was repeat my steps to get the CPAN modules my TEMPer device needed,
install bottlerocket, and I should be done. I guess I'm spoiled by all the
packages available in Debian, but then again, I didn't expect bottlerocket
to be packaged for this custom distribution. I figured I'd be able to
get the CPAN modules I needed, but the real question was whether I could
get bottlerocket to compile. Without it, this project would be over. It
turns out it wasn't too difficult. I just used pacman to install my
build environment and then downloaded and compiled bottlerocket like
you would in the old days:


<pre     class="programlisting">
# pacman -S gcc make
# wget http://www.linuxha.com/bottlerocket/bottlerocket-current.tar.gz
# tar xvfz bottlerocket-current.tar.gz
# cd bottlerocket-0.04c/
# ./configure
# make
# make install
</pre>
</p><p>
When I tested bottlerocket, I noticed something interesting. The USB-to-serial
adapter I plugged in was detected and appeared to work; however,
after I ran bottlerocket the first time, any subsequent execution would
result in an error for /dev/ttyUSB0. I had to unload and reload that
particular USB-to-serial module between each bottlerocket execution for
it to work properly. I know from experience that not all USB-to-serial
adapters are created equal and that some do a better job, for instance,
with sending break signals to your console, so I figured this was just a
case of a cheap serial adapter without full serial port support. Instead
of just living with the kludge of reloading the module each time, I
replaced this adapter with another one I had that I knew had excellent
support for break signals and overall had better compatibility. With
this new adapter, I was able to power my fridge on and off without issues.

Note: a Quick Rant about Pacman</h2></div></div><p>
I have to admit that Plugbox was my first foray into the Arch Linux
distribution. I know a number of people who really like Arch, and I
don't really have an opinion one way or the other about the distribution
itself, but I wanted to say a few words about pacman. First, I love the
name. Second, who came up with the command arguments? In my experience,
capital letters in arguments always are reserved for when you run out
of lowercase arguments (or alternatively, to do the opposite of what
the lowercase argument does), and although sometimes arguments have no
relation to the action you are performing, at least for most programs, the
most commonly used actions are the ones with the intuitive arguments. For
instance, I fully expected pacman to use -i to install a package or
possibly to use a longhand --install. The -S argument it does use simply
makes no sense (I know it stands for &ldquo;Sync&rdquo; but that's a long way from
&ldquo;install&rdquo;), and the -Ss argument to search for packages that match a
keyword makes even less sense. I know it takes only a second to get used
to it, but I'd still argue there are a number of more intuitive letters
to choose.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1caa580.0x1da2eb0"></a>
CPAN Is a Harsh Mistress</h2></div></div><p>
Because it was so easy to build bottlerocket, I assumed it would be
a relative cakewalk to install all the Perl modules I needed using
CPAN. For those of you who aren't Perl hackers, Perl provides a vast
repository of extra modules on-line at <a href="http://www.cpan.org" target="_self">www.cpan.org</a>. If there is a particular
Perl module you need, you can use the cpan binary on your local system
to pull down and build those modules for your system much like a modern
package manager. I figured that even if Plugbox didn't include a lot of
Perl modules, I would identify the modules I needed and install them
one by one, like in my previous TEMPer column. The reality was that although
Plugbox did include Perl and even included the cpan binary, it didn't
include a lot of the necessary modules you need for CPAN actually to work.
</p><p>
Honestly, everything else about this project was simple once I got CPAN
working, but this part of the process took the most time and effort, and
it really reminded me of what Linux was like back in the day when you
would find a cool project on Freshmeat, download the source and then
spend the next two days tracking down all the dependencies. I finally
found the magic list of packages and libraries I needed, and in this
case, I had to install a few packages from Plugbox along with a manual
module compilation:


<pre     class="programlisting">
# pacman -S perl-yaml perl-xml-libxml 
# pacman -S perl-text-query perl-text-diff perl-text-reform
# wget http://search.cpan.org/CPAN/authors/id/R/RC/RCLAMP/
 &#8618;Text-Glob-0.08.tar.gz
# tar xfvz Text-Glob-0.08.tar.gz
# cd Text-Glob-0.08
# perl Build.PL
# perl Build test
# perl Build install
</pre>
</p><p>
From this point, I was able to get the cpan binary to function, and I
could follow the installation steps I laid out in my previous column
to finish the process (I was glad I had that nicely documented for
myself). Afterward, all I had to do was edit my temper.pl script so that
it referenced /dev/ttyUSB0 instead of a local serial port and created a
file called /etc/cron.d/temper that contained the following data:

<pre     class="programlisting">
* *  * * *   /usr/local/sbin/temper.pl
</pre>
</p><p>
After I restarted cron (<tt  >/etc/rc.d/crond restart</tt>), I was able to check my
logs and see that the script was, in fact, reading the temperature and
controlling the fridge just like my laptop. In case you'd like to do
something similar with your Pogoplug, Listing 1 is the current iteration of
the script.

Now that I've had this running without issues for a few weeks, I do like how
quiet and low-power the device is. Plus, it takes up less space on the top
of my fridge. The only real drawback I've seen is that there is no screen
on the device. On my laptop if I wanted to check the temperature,
I just had to open the lid; now, I have to <tt  >ssh</tt> in to
the Pogoplug. Although
I used a Pogoplug for this, I imagine you could translate these steps for a
number of other small Linux devices that have USB ports, like the NSLU2&mdash;provided it included Perl and a gcc build environment. Now I can use my
old laptop for nobler pursuits&mdash;like maybe some day powering my smoker.
