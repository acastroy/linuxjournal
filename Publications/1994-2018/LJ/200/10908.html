<span   class="bold"><b>Readers:</b></span>
best Linux distribution: Ubuntu; honorable mention: PCLinuxOS.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> I've got to give kudos to Ubuntu. These folks continue to be
the one to beat, year after year. I've been using Ubuntu since it was
no-name-yet.com, and it's just gotten better with each release.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> I have to agree with the readers on
this one too. Despite the hype
and anti-hype, Ubuntu still is a fine overall distribution both on the
desktop and as a server, and it's the one I generally recommend.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Readers:</b></span>
best mobile OS:
Google Android; honorable mention: MeeGo.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> Android really is the heavy hitter in the Linux mobile space
today. More and more phones are shipping with Android. I never
thought I'd see the day when my sister used a Linux device daily&mdash;pretty
cool stuff.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> Even though I'm not a huge fan of Android myself, I do have to
agree with the readers here at least on the point that Android has gotten
Linux into way more people's hands (and pockets) than just about
anything else. That said, I still prefer the extra flexibility and power
that Maemo (and hopefully MeeGo) brings to mobile devices.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Readers:</b></span>
best desktop environment: GNOME and KDE (tie).
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> GNOME wins here for me, hands down. Part of it is just sheer muscle
memory, but the simplified elegant interface of GNOME appeals to me more
than all the knobs and switches of KDE.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> I thought it was very interesting that this landed as a tie this
year, and honestly I think I'm with the readers on this, except that to me,
the actual desktop environment doesn't really matter very much anymore. I
do use GNOME at the moment, but mostly because it was the default desktop
environment on my system. I generally disable or just plain don't use
most of the GNOME features on my desktop. I use terminals and a Web
browser for everything I need, so if Ubuntu decided tomorrow it would
default to KDE, I suppose I'd be a KDE user then.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Readers:</b></span> best Web browser:
Firefox;
honorable mention: Chrome.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> I've got to side with the crowd here, Firefox still beats Chrome
and every other browser for me. The plethora of plugins, ubiquity
and the fact that I've been using it forever make it my go-to browser.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> It turns out I agree with Bill here. I still prefer Firefox
myself. I know that vimperator-like plugins do exist for Chrome; however, I
not only like the wide variety of plugins that Firefox has, but I also think
it's important for a company like Google to have a viable open-source
competitor, especially when you consider all the valuable marketing
data that can be had in a user's browser history.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Readers:</b></span>
best e-mail client: Thunderbird;
honorable mention: Gmail Web client.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> Thunderbird wins&mdash;awesome. I don't
even see mutt on the list.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span>
I won't rehash our past column on mutt vs. Thunderbird, but I have to admit I was
disappointed not to see mutt make the list. I mean, I don't even count
Gmail as a Linux e-mail client any more than I would count Yahoo or
Hotmail. It should be no surprise to anyone who has read my column that
I think mutt beats all of these clients hands- (and mice-) down.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Readers:</b></span>
best IM client:
Pidgin; honorable mention: Skype.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> I'm glad to see Pidgin beat Skype.
I've got an allergy to Skype&mdash;Kyle's seen it: hives, itching, the
whole bit. Seriously though,
Pidgin's open-source, cross-platform, modular approach to IM makes it
a winner for most of us.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> Skype, the Sun&mdash;Bill has a lot of allergies it turns out. I
understand why Pidgin got the win in this category, but I have to say I
prefer BitlBee for all my IM needs. Really nothing compares to being
able to treat IM like just another IRC channel inside my favorite IRC
client (more on that next).
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Readers:</b></span> best IRC client:
Pidgin; honorable mention: XChat.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> Here's where I disagree with the
crowd. Pidgin's IM-style
interface really gives me fits when I try to use it as an IRC
client. I'd
much rather use XChat or Irssi, and I do, in fact, use both, although I
spend more time on Irssi as I can leave it running in a screen session.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> Wow, Bill agrees with me on a console application over a GUI
one! Like with mutt, once you get over the initial learning curve,
Irssi really is the best IRC client. Like Bill, I leave Irssi running
inside a screen session, so I can reconnect to it from wherever I happen
to be. The fact that an IM client like Pidgin can connect to IRC is neat,
I guess, but I think all the other straight IRC clients do it better.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Readers:</b></span>
best audio player: Amarok; honorable mention: RhythmBox.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> Where's the love for XMMS? Seriously, the last time I actually
listened to music on the computer instead of a mobile MP3 player, I
was using XMMS. I guess I'm becoming a greybeard in some things.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> I'll be honest, I don't really listen to music from apps on my computer
anymore. For years, I've used either a portable media player (which
is now my N900) or possibly my home XBMC machine to play music. That
being said, despite its complexity, I still prefer Amarok over
RhythmBox. I keep a very tidy nested directory structure for my music,
and I like it when it's simple to browse an actual directory structure
instead of relying on fickle ID3 tags.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Readers:</b></span>
best media player:
VLC; honorable mention: MPlayer.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> I side with the MPlayer crowd here. I've traditionally just had
better success with it, and it's kind of the Swiss Army knife of media.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> VLC always has seemed needlessly complex when you want to do more
than play an .avi. It's nice to have around as a sanity check if a video
doesn't play on something else, but to me, it's hard to beat the power
and speed of MPlayer. It plays just about anything I've thrown at it
and always seems to make the most of my resources.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Readers:</b></span>
best on-line collaboration tool:
Google Docs;
honorable mention: wikis.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> I'm torn here. I like the cloud-based stuff, but I'd never dream
of putting my business' documentation on Google Docs. I'd have to make
this a split decision: Google Docs for personal documentation, and
wikis for business documentation.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> Wow, this category made Bill question his long-held love affair
with the cloud. I suppose I prefer wikis over Google Docs. I just don't
use a lot of cloud offerings, Google or otherwise, so I'd prefer to use
tools that I can conceivably run and control 100% myself.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Readers:</b></span>
best cloud-based file storage:
Dropbox;
honorable mention: Ubuntu One.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> I'm a huge fan of Dropbox and use it
daily. So for personal use,
I'd definitely say it's the best solution. However, if I were running a
business and needed cloud storage, I'd look at Amazon's S3.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> My favorite cloud-based file storage is my own file server. If
you have Linux and a few disks, it's trivial to rsync files around
to whatever machine you are in front of. Granted, some of these other
offerings might have more automated features, but I'd like to see the
Open Source community provide something that made it easy for people to
have these same capabilities on their own machines without relying on
some third-party outside their control.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Readers:</b></span>
best game:
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Frozen Bubble</em></span>;
honorable mention: <span   class="emphasis"><em>Doom</em></span> and <span   class="emphasis"><em>Battle for
Wesnoth</em></span> (tie).
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> This is a tough one, as I don't play
many games, but I'd have to
side with <span   class="emphasis"><em>Doom</em></span>, simply because of nostalgia. 
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> This is a tough one
for me too, because I'm torn between <span   class="emphasis"><em>Frozen Bubble</em></span> and
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Quake 3</em></span>. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Doom</em></span> is fun,
but these days, it's become the game version of Hello World that
everyone ports to a new Linux device. I guess I'll go with <span   class="emphasis"><em>Quake
3</em></span>. Yes,
it's an old FPS, but it's still my favorite.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Readers:</b></span>
best database:
MySQL;
honorable mention: PostgreSQL.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> MySQL wins for me. It's just too easy to get a database up and
running with it.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> Although MySQL is nice, I prefer PostgreSQL both for its power
and the fact that it's still nice to have <span   class="emphasis"><em>some</em></span> sort of
alternative to Oracle. These days, it really isn't any more difficult to
manage MySQL than PostgreSQL
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Readers:</b></span>
best backup solution:
rsync;
honorable mention: tar.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> I have to go with tar on this one,
because when I hear &ldquo;backup&rdquo;,
I think &ldquo;tape&rdquo;, and tar stands for Tape Archive. rsync's got
its place,
and I use it a lot to copy data from point A to B, but it feels like
more of a copy utility rather than a backup solution.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> I'm going to have to go with BackupPC here. It's relatively easy
to set up, easy to manage and works well. Plus, you have the option to use
either rsync or tar for your backups. It seems like a win-win to me.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Readers:</b></span>
best virtualization solution:
VirtualBox;
honorable mention: VMware.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Bill</b></span>: I did a virtualization shootout last year, and VMware came out
on top at the time. Now, I'm not so sure. VirtualBox has come a long way. I'm
split on this one.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> I think the main thing VirtualBox has going for it is the ease at
which it installs within distributions like Ubuntu. I just hope Oracle
doesn't kill it. On the enterprise end, I favor VMware's enterprise
products first and probably KVM second.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Readers:</b></span>
best content management system:
WordPress;
honorable mention: Drupal.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> WordPress: it's ubiquitous, easy to
install and maintain, and it gets
out of your way and lets you create content. What can be better than that?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> I'm with Bill on this one. Drupal is powerful but has a significant
learning curve. It's dead simple to set up a site on WordPress, and
plenty of support and packages are available to make it easy to
maintain long-term.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Readers:</b></span>
best Linux laptop vendor:
Dell;
honorable mention: Lenovo.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Bill:</b></span> I own quite a few laptops, both Dell and Lenovo, but when I spec
a new machine, it's always a Lenovo system. The build quality still
is a cut above Dell, despite the leaps and bounds that Dell has improved in
the past few years. Besides, how many laptops have holes in the lower
case to allow Mountain Dew to drain out?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> This is tough, because although Lenovo doesn't do the best job of
championing Linux as a pre-installed option like some of the other
vendors, I've found its Linux support (especially for the ThinkPad
series) is very solid. I've said for a while now that if you want good
Linux support, you should get the same hardware the developers use,
and it seems there are plenty of Linux developers on ThinkPads.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Readers:</b></span>
best brand of video chipset:
NVIDIA;
honorable mention: ATI.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Bill:</b></span> It's rare that I do any 3-D at all, so graphics simply need to be
there, have stable drivers and not use a lot of power. That's why I
like the Intel graphics chipsets.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> Although like Bill, I can
handle my 3-D acceleration needs with
my onboard Intel graphics card, the VDPAU support in the NVIDIA cards
that allows you to offload decoding of HD video content to your graphics
card pushes NVIDIA to the top of my list.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Readers:</b></span> best Linux smartphone:
Nokia N900;
honorable mention: HTC Nexus One.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> I've spent time with the Motorola
Droid, and
it was a very pleasant experience. I don't run a Droid as my daily phone,
but if I were stuck with one, I wouldn't mind terribly. It's a nice unit.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> The readers are right on with this one. The N900 is the phone I
carry with me, and I'd argue is definitely the best Linux smartphone out
there. Sure, some phones have more processing power these days,
but it's hard to beat the openness and variety of development languages
that the Maemo platform has on the N900.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Readers:</b></span>
best Linux-based gadget:
Amazon Kindle;
honorable mention: TomTom Navigation System.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> The Kindle is the gadget to beat in this space. They're very nice,
though the unmentioned Barnes &amp; Noble's Nook is a good alternative (see my
review of the Nook on page 48).
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> This is tough for me, as I look at all the Linux-based gadgets
around my house. I think the Spykee, the Pogoplug, the N900 and the
Parrot AR drone are all very interesting Linux-based gadgets. But, I still
think I'm going to have to go with my N900.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Readers:</b></span>
product of the year:
Android;
honorable mention: KDE.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> I have to agree with the readers:
Android deserves product of the year. Not only are countless people now
running Linux, but also Android's technical achievements can make their way
back into mainline Linux over time and improve the entire Linux ecosystem.
I'm looking forward to seeing ARM-based, Android-powered Netbooks in the
next year.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> As I mentioned previously, I'm not a
big Android fan, but I do agree that it should be product of the year. It
has dramatically increased the number of people using Linux, even if they
don't know it, and it has great potential to increase Linux's reach in the
future.
