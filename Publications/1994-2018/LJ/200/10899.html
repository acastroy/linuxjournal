Arm your stealth firewall with a custom iptables script.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1909580.0x1a01408"></a></h2></div></div><p>
I've been writing a multipart series on building a transparent (bridging)
firewall using Linux. Specifically, I'm using the distribution OpenWrt
running on a Linksys WRT54GL broadband router, a hardware choice driven
mainly by my curiosity about the WRT54GL's built-in five-port Ethernet
switch and its ability to run OpenWrt Linux.
</p><p>
So far I've covered installing OpenWrt, recompiling a new OpenWrt image
with iptables' bridging functionality enabled and configuring networking
using OpenWrt's uci (Unified Configuration Interface) command.
</p><p>
This month, I review the example network topology and finally begin
configuring iptables, the heart of the whole undertaking. Before I do
so, however, there are a few OpenWrt housecleaning tasks to get out of
the way: tweaking the kernel and network configurations, and disabling
OpenWrt's native firewall system.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1909580.0x1a01670"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
OpenWrt Performance as a Transparent Firewall</b></p><p>
In researching this article, I had a nasty surprise. Although in the
past I had seen articles and how-tos on making transparent firewalls
with OpenWrt, this mode of operation is not supported by default in the
Kamikaze and Backfire releases. Reportedly, running iptables in bridging
mode under OpenWrt reduces overall system performance by a whopping 40%!
</p><p>
I proceeded writing this series anyhow, because I wanted to see for
myself just how big an effect this is, and it seemed to me that
the series still would be useful just for the sake of explaining how
to install and use OpenWrt, and for explaining how to write iptables
rules for transparent firewalls. However, at several points, I've
written of my doubts as to the example OpenWrt/WRT54GL's suitability
for high-bandwidth/high-availability settings.
</p><p>
Also, hopefully without sounding <span   class="emphasis"><em>too</em></span> grandiose, I hoped that by
spurring greater interest in OpenWrt's flawed capability, I might
encourage someone to get to the bottom of <span   class="emphasis"><em>why</em></span> OpenWrt performance
plunges when run with iptables in bridging mode. Surely there's a reason
that this not terribly new kernel feature is problematic in OpenWrt!
</p><p>
I say all this because I want to be clear that although transparent Linux
firewalls in general constitute an interesting and useful technology,
the specific combination of a $65 broadband router plus OpenWrt running
in this mode is probably suitable <span   class="emphasis"><em>only</em></span> in a home or lab setting,
not for any situation where you need to move large volumes of packets
very quickly and very reliably (which is hopefully unnecessary for me
to say, given that the WRT54GL is marketed to home users in the first
place). I say it also so you understand why you have to go through the
hoops of recompiling the OpenWrt image and editing /etc/sysctl.conf to
get iptables bridging working in OpenWrt.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1909580.0x1a01a90"></a>
Kernel Parameters and a Network Tweak</h2></div></div><p>
Recompiling the OpenWrt image with CONFIG_BRIDGE_NETFILTER=y set in the
Linux kernel is the first of two steps in enabling iptables' bridging
mode in OpenWrt. The second step is either to delete the following
parameters in /etc/sysctl.conf or set each of them to &ldquo;1&rdquo;
rather than &ldquo;0&rdquo;:

<pre     class="programlisting">
net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-arptables=0
net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-ip6tables=0
net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables=0
</pre>
</p><p>
In addition, I need to correct an error I made in the OpenWrt network
configuration I showed you last time. You may recall that I changed
OpenWrt's default configuration, such that all Ethernet ports were
assigned to a single VLAN and bridge.
</p><p>
But possibly due to the way the Linux kernel interacts with the bridge
hardware on my Linksys WRT54GL, with that configuration, I find that
iptables ignores inter-VLAN traffic&mdash;that is, traffic between ports
on the same VLAN. In order to get iptables to work properly on this
hardware and on OpenWrt, I actually need two VLANs: one corresponding
to my &ldquo;uplink&rdquo; (the Ethernet port connected to the outside world) and my
&ldquo;LAN&rdquo; (everything else). These two VLANs, however, are still associated
with the same bridge interface.
</p><p>
To create a separate VLAN for my uplink port, which is my WRT54GL's
&ldquo;WAN&rdquo; port (or &ldquo;port 4&rdquo; to OpenWrt), I issue these commands on my router:


<pre     class="programlisting">
root@sugartongs:/etc/config# uci set network.eth0_1=switch_vlan
root@sugartongs:/etc/config# uci set network.eth0_1.device="eth0"
root@sugartongs:/etc/config# uci set network.eth0_1.vlan="1"
root@sugartongs:/etc/config# uci set network.eth0_1.ports="4 5"
</pre>
</p><p>
(Port 5, you'll recall, is a virtual port associated with the kernel,
that must be included in <span   class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span> &ldquo;ports&rdquo; statements in OpenWrt network
configurations, which is why our &ldquo;...ports&rdquo; statement is set
to &ldquo;4 5&rdquo;
rather than just &ldquo;4&rdquo;.)
</p><p>
To remove the WAN port from the other VLAN (eth0_0) I set up last time,
I use this command:


<pre     class="programlisting">
root@sugartongs:/etc/config# uci set network.eth0_0.ports="0 1 2 3 5"
</pre>
</p><p>
Next, in my bridge configuration, for the network I named
&ldquo;lan&rdquo;, I
associate both VLANs with the bridge:

<pre     class="programlisting">
root@sugartongs:/etc/config# uci set 
 &#8618;network.lan.ifname="eth0.0 eth0.1"
</pre>
</p><p>
And finally, I list my new network configuration to make sure everything's
correct, commit the changes and reboot:

<pre     class="programlisting">
root@sugartongs:/etc/config# uci show network
root@sugartongs:/etc/config# uci commit
root@sugartongs:/etc/config# reboot
</pre>
</p><p>
Listing 1 shows what the resulting /etc/config/network file looks like.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1909580.0x1a02850"></a>
Disabling OpenWrt's DHCP and Firewall System</h2></div></div><p>
You also have to disable OpenWrt's native DHCP
and iptables systems. The
need for disabling DHCP services is obvious: acting as a DHCP server
wouldn't be very &ldquo;transparent&rdquo; behavior! So, disable it with these
two commands:

<pre     class="programlisting">
root@sugartongs# /etc/init.d/dnsmasq disable
root@sugartongs# /etc/init.d/dnsmasq stop
</pre>
</p><p>
OpenWrt's native iptables script (/etc/init.d/firewall) is fine if you
want to use OpenWrt as a standard &ldquo;Layer 3&rdquo; (routing) firewall. Leaving
this script enabled allows you to use the uci command and the file
/etc/config/firewall to manage iptables in a manner very similar to how
you manage network configuration and other OpenWrt system settings.
</p><p>
However, this system doesn't lend itself very well to running iptables
in bridging mode&mdash;to use it that way, you'd need to hack the
script extensively, which would be a bewildering task given the large number of custom
tables it uses beyond &ldquo;INPUT&rdquo;, &ldquo;OUTPUT&rdquo; and
&ldquo;FORWARDING&rdquo;. Therefore,
disable it like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
root@sugartongs# /etc/init.d/firewall disable
root@sugartongs# /etc/init.d/firewall stop
</pre>
</p><p>
Now you can create a custom iptables script more suitable for a transparent
firewall.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1909580.0x19f95b0"></a>
Example Network Topology</h2></div></div><p>
In order to write a firewall script, you need to consider your network's
topology and how the transparent firewall fits in. Figure 1 shows the
example home network I sketched out in Part II of this series, with a
firewall cabled between the network's Internet uplink (via DSL router
or cable modem) and its backbone (which collapses back to a wireless
broadband router configured with Internet uplink and LAN on the same
logical subnet).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10899f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Example Home Network
</p></div></div><p>
You could use a number of topologies instead. If you have
only a few hosts on your internal network, and your Internet uplink device is
already providing DHCP services, you could use your transparent firewall
as your broadband router (though configuring WLAN on OpenWrt is outside
this series' scope). If your cable modem or DSL router includes a switch
and/or wireless LAN access point, you could connect some of your network
nodes directly to that and use your transparent firewall to protect
other devices.
</p><p>
I'm going to stick with the topology in Figure 1, however, for
simplicity's sake. It should be clear enough how to customize my sample
iptables script for whatever topology you choose. Let's take a closer
look at Figure 1.
</p><p>
The first thing you should notice is that everything on this network
resides on the same logical subnet (10.0.0.0/24) except, of course, for
the cable/DSL modem's WAN interface (the one connected to the Internet),
which has the Internet-routable address 4.3.2.1. That WAN address is
strictly illustrative; in actual practice, WAN IP addresses in
<span   class="emphasis"><em>any</em></span>
residential Internet scenario are assigned by your Internet service
provider, often automatically, so please don't attempt to set yours
to 4.3.2.1!
</p><p>
Another important point is that on this example network, client PCs
are assigned IP addresses via DHCP from the pool 10.0.0.2 through
10.0.0.100. My diagram doesn't indicate which host is providing DHCP
services. Is it the cable/DSL modem, the broadband router or 
the Web proxy?
</p><p>
As a matter of fact, it doesn't matter! Because this entire network fabric
is switched, DHCP requests will propagate freely, including through
the transparent firewall. However, if the cable/DSL modem acts as the
DHCP server, you will need to write rules on the firewall to allow DHCP
through in both directions.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1909580.0x19f9ad8"></a>
Logical Firewall Design</h2></div></div><p>
Now that you understand what the network looks like, let's decide how to
manage its dataflows. In my example scenario, the firewall will have
a &ldquo;deny by default&rdquo; policy, as any good firewall should. The task,
therefore, will be one of anticipating and allowing the dataflows you
need the firewall to allow.
</p><p>
First, assuming the LAN's DHCP server is upstream of the firewall, you
need to allow DHCP traffic between UDP port 67 (the DHCP server port)
and UDP port 68 (the DHCP client port).
</p><p>
Next, you don't want to lock yourself out of the firewall itself! You
need to allow traffic from the LAN to TCP port 22 on the firewall.
</p><p>
As you can see in Figure 1, the example network has an outbound Web
proxy. Because one of the best uses of a firewall is to enforce use of
a Web proxy, you'll for sure want to allow only outbound Web traffic
originating from the Web proxy. You'll also allow outbound DNS queries
(and corresponding replies).
</p><p>
That's it! Things downstream of the firewall&mdash;that is, transactions
between hosts connected to the broadband router shown in Figure 1&mdash;don't need to be allowed by the firewall. For example, print jobs sent
from wired and wireless DHCP clients to the network printer don't need an
&ldquo;allow LPR&rdquo; rule, because those packets should never reach the transparent
firewall in the first place.
</p><p>
(If, however, you have only a few hosts on your LAN and elect to omit
the downstream switch or broadband router and cable them directly to
the transparent firewall, this will not be the case. You
<span   class="emphasis"><em>will</em></span>
need to allow for &ldquo;LAN-to-LAN&rdquo; transactions of that type.)
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1909580.0x19f9ef8"></a>
Creating a Custom Firewall Script</h2></div></div><p>
Now, finally, you're ready to write a custom firewall script! You could,
of course, simply edit the file /etc/init.d/firewall. But, that would make
it harder to revert to OpenWrt's native uci-driven firewall
system later&mdash;better to leave that script alone. I prefer to create a new
script from scratch, arbitrarily named /etc/init.d/iptables.custom.
</p><p>
Listing 2 shows what /etc/init.d/iptables.custom needs to look like
in order to implement the firewall policy we arrived at in the previous
section. Let's dissect it.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1909580.0x19fa0b0"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>

}
</pre></div><p>
First, note the includes file /etc/rc.common at the top: this provides
functions like enable, disable and other
housekeeping functions
that OpenWrt uses to manage startup files.
</p><p>
Next, <tt  >START=46</tt> specifies the priority/order for running this script
at startup. <tt  >46</tt> is the same slot that the default
OpenWrt &ldquo;firewall&rdquo;
startup script uses, which is to say, after networking is enabled but
before the DropBear SSH server and other network services are started.
</p><p>
Next come some &ldquo;shorthand&rdquo; variables we'll use throughout the
script. <tt  >IPTABLES</tt>, obviously enough, specifies the full path to the
local iptables command. <tt  >LOCALIP</tt> is the firewall's bridge IP address;
<tt  >LOCALLAN</tt> is the network address of the local LAN,
and <tt  >WEBPROXY</tt>
gives the IP address of the Web proxy.
</p><p>
The &ldquo;stop&rdquo; function (as in <tt  >./iptables.custom
stop</tt>) causes the script to
flush all iptables rules from kernel memory and to load default
<tt  >ACCEPT</tt>
policies for all three default firewall tables,
<tt  >INPUT</tt>, <tt  >FORWARD</tt> and
<tt  >OUTPUT</tt>. This does <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span>
&ldquo;stop all traffic&rdquo;; rather, it stops all
<span   class="emphasis"><em>restrictions</em></span> on traffic (thus, the warning message).
</p><p>
Now we come to the heart of the script: the &ldquo;start&rdquo; function,
containing the firewall policy in the form of a list of iptables commands.
</p><p>
First, flush any active rules and delete any custom tables, so
you begin with a clean slate (<tt  >$IPTABLES --flush</tt> and
<tt  >$IPTABLES
--delete-chain</tt>). Next, set default deny policies for the INPUT,
FORWARD and ACCEPT chains. (You could just as easily choose
<tt  >REJECT</tt>
as the default policy, but because this involves sending ICMP replies to
jilted clients, versus DROP's simply ignoring them, there's a slight
performance benefit to DROP.)
</p><p>
Next come two rules to allow interprocess communication on the
firewall itself, by allowing all packets arriving from and destined
for the &ldquo;loopback&rdquo; interface. This is followed immediately, however,
by an antispoofing rule that blocks traffic addressed to the firewall
<span   class="emphasis"><em>from</em></span> the firewall's own IP address.
</p><p>
Next are two rules allowing DHCP requests&mdash;that is, packets from UDP
port 68 sent to UDP port 67&mdash;and DHCP responses&mdash;that is, packets from
UDP port 67 to UDP port 68. These two rules are necessary only if your
DHCP server is on the other side of your firewall from your DHCP clients.
</p><p>
You may have noticed that these two DHCP rules and the subsequent
rules for SSH, HTTP proxying and DNS are &ldquo;stateless&rdquo;. Rather than
invoking the iptables &ldquo;state&rdquo; module, which lets you allow, for example,
outbound DHCP queries while letting the kernel decide what constitutes
a valid response, you're explicitly allowing the reply traffic. This is
an admittedly archaic way to write iptables rules.
</p><p>
However, as I mentioned in the sidebar, OpenWrt has significant
performance issues when used as a bridging firewall. Because the
&ldquo;state&rdquo;
module imposes still more of a performance hit, and because this firewall
policy is simple to begin with, I'm doing it the old-fashioned way. For
a bridging firewall on a better-performing distribution/hardware
combination, I definitely would take advantage of Linux's state-tracking
features!
</p><p>
The next pair of rules in Listing 2 allows SSH connections to the firewall
itself, but only from the local LAN. Note that the &ldquo;incoming&rdquo; leg of
SSH transactions is handled in the INPUT table, whereas the
&ldquo;outbound&rdquo;
leg is processed in the OUTPUT table. If you were using <tt  >-m
state</tt>,
the OUTPUT leg would be implicit.
</p><p>
Next come two pairs of rules allowing only the Web proxy to send and
receive traffic to/from TCP ports 80 and 443, which, of course, correspond
to HTTP and HTTPS, respectively.
</p><p>
This wouldn't work unless DNS did also, so next are rules allowing DNS
queries to TCP and UDP ports 53 (ordinarily, DNS queries just use UDP,
but once in a while they can occur over TCP as well).
</p><p>
Finally, the script ends with three &ldquo;cleanup&rdquo; rules that place a
&ldquo;drop all&rdquo; rule at the bottom of each of the default tables. These are,
of course, redundant with the default &ldquo;DROP&rdquo; policies I set near the
beginning of the <tt  >start()</tt> function, but specifying
such cleanup rules
are a firewall best practice; sometimes redundancy is desirable!
</p><p>
When you type in any firewall script, be careful! At the very least,
double- and triple-check the SSH rules that allow access to the firewall.
If there's any problem with those rules, you'll be locked out once
you run the script, and you may even need to re-flash your firewall to
recover. You can fix other things if SSH works, but if SSH doesn't work,
you'll be stuck.
</p><p>
Once you're confident enough to test your rules, save the new script. Be
sure to set the &ldquo;execute&rdquo; bit on it like so:


<pre     class="programlisting">
root@sugartongs:/etc/init.d# chmod a+x ./iptables.custom
</pre>
</p><p>
And, enable the script at startup, like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
root@sugartongs:/etc/init.d# ./iptables.custom enable
</pre>
</p><p>
Now for the moment of truth&mdash;load the rules:

<pre     class="programlisting">
root@sugartongs:/etc/init.d# ./iptables.custom start
</pre>
</p><p>
Test the rules by making sure the things you want to work still do
(connecting back to the firewall via SSH, surfing the Web via your
Web proxy and so forth). Also, be sure to test some things
you don't expect to work, such as surfing the Web
<span   class="emphasis"><em>without</em></span> going
through the proxy or connecting to an FTP server using an FTP client
application. In my own experience, the challenge with OpenWrt is getting
iptables to &ldquo;see&rdquo; and act on traffic; the real test is ensuring that
it's blocking <span   class="emphasis"><em>anything</em></span>!

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
And with that, I've completely filled up this month's allotted space. I'll
wrap up the series next month with some tips and tricks, and a suitably
flowery &ldquo;Conclusion&rdquo; paragraph that I promise will be much more worthwhile
than this one. For now, I'll simply say, &ldquo;good luck!&rdquo;
