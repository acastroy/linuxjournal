modem. From a business point of view, it was just about useless.
Our local BBS sysop, Greg Corson of &ldquo;The Connection&rdquo;, offered
turnkey BBS systems to businesses, so that employees could have
mail, discussion and file transfer, but he was way ahead of his
time. Businesses took a pointless detour to fax machines before
they understood the power of offering BBS-like services to
everyone.
</p><p>Like that old modem, all new networking technologies look
useless&mdash;until enough people get on them. Then, well, it's called a
&ldquo;network effect&rdquo; for a reason.</p><p>So what's the &ldquo;useless&rdquo; technology to play with today?
IPv6, the next version of the Internet Protocol. You won't find
news and business sites using it; you can't send most people mail
on it; you can't call up the phone or cable company and get it, and
if you put up an IPv6 web site, Google won't crawl it. On the other
hand, IPv6 has enough unique IP addresses (2128 of them) that no
matter what kind of internet service you have, you can have a
static address of your very own.</p><p>You can really get that address and do something with it,
too. Viag&eacute;nie, a Canadian company, sponsors freenet6.net, an
easy-to-use service to tunnel IPv6 over your existing net
connection. I worked through Peter Todd's article on page 64, and
it took me less time to finish and &ldquo;ping6&rdquo; his IPv6 box, than to
read the article. And I read fast.</p><p>You can do more with IPv6 than just ping Peter's box&mdash;Ibrahim
Haddad and David Gordon take a look at how well Apache handles IPv6
traffic on page 86. And once you're on IPv6 with a static address
that's all yours, you can start to learn more.</p><p>Another great network project is a VPN to link sites securely
over an existing connection. Be a hero at work when you replace an
expensive leased line or proprietary VPN box with FreeS/WAN, using
Mick Bauer's instructions on page 30. How much did you pay for
<i  >Linux Journal</i> again? We're such a
bargain.</p><p>Software you write probably calls read() and write() to get
data from disk and send it to the network, or vice versa. But
behind the scenes, the kernel is copying the data for you. Can you
speed things up? Dragan Stancevic takes you along the path to zero
copies and explains the sendfile() system call along the way, on
page 48.</p><p>Guylhem Aznar has written two articles for our web site on
hot new apps for the Linux-based Zaurus PDA, and this month he's on
page 38 with recommended software, and some key hardware, to make
your Zaurus (you <span   class="emphasis"><em>do</em></span> have one, right?) more
useful than ever.</p><p>There's plenty of other good stuff this month too. Java
doesn't have to be just a bytecode language&mdash;you can compile it
like C (page 74). And when I make an SSH connection across a flaky
network, I want to be able to pick up where I got thrown off. The
<span   class="bold"><b>screen</b></span> program lets you do that
and more, on page 80.</p><p>Finally, the cover. Robin Rowe has written us another Linux
movie article, this one about the latest <span   class="emphasis"><em>Star
Trek</em></span> movie. <i  >Linux Journal</i> doesn't
get to see the Linux movies before everyone else, but do you really
think Starfleet gets by with only 232 IP addresses?</p></div></div>
