    To restart a telecom server quickly, you need a journaled
    filesystem. Here's how you can move to IBM's AIX-derived
    JFS.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xae6580.0xbde8c8"></a></h2></div></div><p>New features are constantly being added
to the Linux kernel; one of them is the support for journaling
filesystems. JFS from IBM is one of the many journaling filesystems
available now for Linux. This article explains JFS internals and
characteristics, how to install and configure it on a Linux server
and the operational experience of JFS at the Ericsson Research Lab
in Montr&eacute;al.
</p><p>A filesystem is used to store and manage user data on disk
drives. It ensures that the integrity of the data written to the
disk is identical to the data that is read back. In addition to
storing data in files, a filesystem also creates and manages
information, such as free space and inodes, about the filesystem
itself. Filesystem structures commonly are referred to as metadata,
everything concerning a file except the actual data inside the
file. Elements of the file, such as its physical location and size,
are tracked by metadata.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xae6580.0xbdea28"></a>Journaling vs. Non-Journaling
Filesystems</h2></div></div><p>A journaling filesystem provides improved structural
consistency and recoverability. It also has faster restart times
than a non-journaling filesystem.</p><p>Non-journaling filesystems are subject to corruption in the
event of a system failure. This is because a logical file operation
often takes multiple media I/Os to accomplish and may not be
reflected completely on the media at any given point in time. For
example, the simple task of writing data to a file can involve
numerous steps:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Allocating blocks to hold the data.</p></li><li><p>Updating the block pointers.</p></li><li><p>Updating the size of the file.</p></li><li><p>Writing the actual data.</p></li></ul></div><p>If the system is interrupted when these operations are not
fully completed, the non-journaling filesystem ends up in an
inconsistent state. In this case, these filesystems rely on their
fsck utility to examine all of the filesystem's metadata (for
example, directories and disk addressing structures) to detect and
repair structural integrity problems before restarting.
<span   class="bold"><b>fsck</b></span> can be rather time consuming,
with the amount of time being dependent on the size of the
partition, the number of directories and the number of files in
each directory. In the case of a large filesystem, journaling
becomes crucial. A journaling filesystem, on the other hand, can
restart in less than a second.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xae6580.0xbdef50"></a>JFS Introduction</h2></div></div><p>JFS was designed to support fast recovery from system
outages, large files and partitions and a large number of
directories and files. To meet these requirements, JFS provides a
sub-second filesystem recovery time, achieved by journaling only
the metadata. JFS also provides 64-bit scalability, with petabyte
ranges for files and partitions. In addition, B+tree indices are
used on all filesystem on-disk structures. For better performance,
B+trees are used extensively in place of traditional linear
filesystem structures.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xae6580.0xbdf058"></a>Filesystems</h2></div></div><p>A file is allocated in sequences of extents. An extent is a
sequence of contiguous aggregate blocks allocated to a JFS object
as a unit. An extent is contained wholly within a single aggregate
(and therefore, a single partition). Large extents, however, may
span multiple allocation groups. An extent can range in size from 1
to 224 - 1 blocks. JFS, for example, uses a 24-bit value for the
length of an extent. The maximum extent, if the block size is 4K,
would be 4K * 224 - 1 bytes and is equal to (~64G). Note that this
limit applies only to a single extent; in no way does it limit the
overall file size. Extents are indexed in a B+tree for better
performance in inserting new extents, locating particular extents
and so forth.</p><p>In general, the allocation policy for JFS tries to maximize
contiguous allocation by allocating a minimum number of extents,
with each extent as large and contiguous as possible. This allows
for larger I/O transfers, resulting in improved performance.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xae6580.0xbdf1b8"></a>History of JFS</h2></div></div><p>IBM introduced its UNIX filesystem as the Journaled
Filesystem (JFS) with the initial release of AIX Version 3.1. This
filesystem is now called JFS1 on AIX. It has been the premier
filesystem for AIX for the past ten years and has been installed in
millions of customers' AIX systems. In 1995, work began to make the
filesystem more scalable and to support machines with more than one
processor. Another goal was to have a more portable filesystem
capable of running on multiple operating systems.</p><p>Historically, the JFS1 filesystem is closely tied to the
memory manager of AIX. This design is typical of a closed-source
operating system or a filesystem supporting only one operating
system.</p><p>The new Journaled Filesystem, on which the Linux port was
based, was first shipped as part of the OS/2 Warp Server for
eBusiness in April 1999, after several years of designing, coding
and testing. It also shipped with OS/2 Warp Client in October 2000.
Parallel to this effort, some of the JFS development team returned
to the AIX Operating System Development Group in 1997 and started
to move this new JFS source base to the AIX operating system. In
May 2001, a second journaled filesystem, Enhanced Journaled
Filesystem (JFS2), was made available for AIX 5L. Meanwhile, in
December 1999, a snapshot of the OS/2 JFS source was taken, and
work was begun to port JFS to Linux.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xae6580.0xbdf370"></a>Experience as an Open-Source Project</h2></div></div><p>In December 1999, three potential journaling filesystems were
begun or were in the process of being developed or ported to Linux.
Ext2 was adding journaling to its filesystem under the name of
ext3. SGI began to port their XFS filesystem from IRIX. The third
filesystem was being developed by Hans Reiser and came to be called
ReiserFS. But none of these filesystems were fully functional on
Linux in 1999. IBM believed that JFS was a strong technology and
could add value to the Linux operating system.</p><p>Contacts were made with the top Linux filesystem developers
and the possibility of adding yet another journaling filesystem was
explored. One of the basic underlying philosophies of Linux is that
choice is good, so the idea of another journaling filesystem was
accepted.</p><p>IBM started moving JFS to Linux in December 1999, and by
February 2000, they had released the first source code. This
initial release contained the reference source code, the
mount/unmount function and support for the ls command on a JFS
partition.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xae6580.0xbdf528"></a>Installing JFS on a Separate Partition</h2></div></div><p>JFS has been incorporated into the 2.5.6 Linux kernel and
also is included in Alan Cox's 2.4.X-ac kernels, beginning with the
February 2002 release of 2.4.18-pre9-ac4. Alan's patches for the
2.4.x series are available from
<a href="http://kernel.org" target="_self">kernel.org</a>. You also can
download a 2.4 kernel source tree and add the JFS patches to this
tree. JFS comes as a patch for several of the 2.4.x kernels, so get
the latest kernel from
<a href="http://kernel.org" target="_self">kernel.org</a>.</p><p>At the time of this writing, the latest kernel is 2.4.18 and
the latest release of JFS is 1.0.20. We use them in the following
section. The JFS patch is available from the JFS web site. You also
need both the utilities (jfsutils-1.0.20.tar.gz) and the filesystem
(jfs-2.4.18-patch and jfs-2.4-1.0.20.tar.gz) patches. Several Linux
distributions are already shipping JFS: Turbolinux, Mandrake, SuSE,
Red Hat and Slackware all ship JFS in their latest releases.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xae6580.0xbdf738"></a>Patching the Kernel to Support JFS</h2></div></div><p>If you use any of the previously named distributions, you do
not need to patch the kernel for the JFS code. You need only to
compile the kernel to support JFS (either as built-in or as a
module).</p><p>First, download the standard Linux kernel. If you have a
/usr/src/linux directory, move it, so it won't replaced by the
linux-2.4.18 source tree. After you download the kernel, named
linux-2.4.18.tar.gz, save it under /usr/src and untar it. This
operation will create a new /usr/src/linux directory.</p><p>The next step is to get the JFS utilities and the appropriate
patch for kernel 2.4.18. Create a directory for JFS source,
/usr/src/jfs1020, and download to that directory the JFS kernel
patch, the jfs-2.4-18-patch and the JFS patches,
jfs-2.4-1.0.20.tar.gz. At this point, you have all the files needed
to patch the kernel.</p><p>Next, change to the directory of the kernel 2.4.18 source
tree to apply the JFS kernel patch:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
% cd /usr/src/linux
% patch -p1 &lt; /usr/src/jfs1020/jfs-2.4-18-patch
% cp /usr/src/jfs1020/jfs-2.4-1.0.20.tar.gz .
% tar zxvf jfs-2.4-1.0.20.tar.gz
</pre><p>Configure the kernel and enable JFS by going to the
Filesystems section of the configuration menu and enabling JFS
support, <b  >CONFIG_JFS_FS=y</b>. You also have the
option to configure JFS as a module. In this case you need only to
recompile and re-install kernel modules:
<pre     class="programlisting">
% make modules &amp;&amp; make install_modules
</pre>


Otherwise, if you configured the JFS option as kernel built-in, you
need to recompile the kernel (in /usr/src/linux):
<pre     class="programlisting">
% make dep &amp;&amp; make clean &amp;&amp; make bzImage
</pre>


Then, recompile and install modules (only if you added other
options as modules):
<pre     class="programlisting">
% make modules &amp;&amp; make modules_install
</pre>


Finally, install the new kernel:
<pre     class="programlisting">
% cp arch/i386/boot/bzImage /boot/bzImage-jfs
% cp System.map /boot/System.map-jfs
% ln -s /boot/System.map-jfs /boot/System.map
</pre>


Don't forget to run lilo. (If you have never recompiled the kernel,
read the Kernel-HOWTO to learn how.)
</p><p>After you compile and install the kernel, you should compile
and install the JFS utilities. Save the jfsutils-1.0.20.tar.gz file
into /usr/src/jfs1020 and then:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
% tar zxvf jfsutils-1.0.20.tar.gz
% cd jfsutils-1.0.20
% ./configure
% make &amp;&amp; make install
</pre><p>Having built and installed the JFS utilities, the next step
is to create a JFS partition. In the following example, we use a
spare partition; the next section will demonstrate how to migrate
an existing partition into JFS.
</p><p>If there is unpartitioned space on the disk, you can create a
partition using fdisk. In our test system, we had /dev/hdb3 as a
spare partition, so we formatted it as a JFS partition. After the
partition is created, reboot the system to make sure the new
partition is able to create the JFS.</p><p>To create the JFS, apply the following command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
% mkfs.jfs /dev/hdb3
</pre><p>After the filesystem has been created, you need to mount it.
To get a mount point, create a new empty directory, such as
/mnt/jfs, and use the following mount command:
<pre     class="programlisting">
% mount -t jfs /dev/hdb3 /mnt/jfs
</pre>


When the filesystem is mounted, you are ready to try out JFS.
</p><p>To unmount JFS, simply use the umount command with the same
mount point as before:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
% umount /mnt/jfs
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xae6580.0xbd67b0"></a>Migrating Your Partition from ext2 to
JFS</h2></div></div><p>In the previous section, we explained how to create a JFS
filesystem using an existing spare partition. Now, we demonstrate
how to migrate your current system from another filesystem, such as
ext2, to JFS. We look at how to introduce a JFS partition to your
Linux configuration. In a second step, we make that partition the
root filesystem.</p><p>What partition scheme do you need to create a JFS root
partition? The migration process requires an empty partition. Let's
assume that /dev/hda5 is the current root partition and that it
uses ext2. We use /dev/hda6, which is our empty partition, as our
JFS root partition. This partition needs to be of equal or larger
size than the current root partition. The ext2 partition will be
duplicated on the JFS partition. Afterward, if you do not wish to
keep the ext2 partition, you can reformat it without losing your
Linux system.</p><p>In order to create a root JFS partition on /dev/hda6, follow
the instructions mentioned earlier to get support for JFS in the
kernel. To make this partition a bootable partition for Linux, you
need to reproduce a complete Linux installation. A simple way of
doing so is to copy all the files to the JFS partition. First,
mount the filesystem:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
% mount -t jfs /dev/hda6 /jfs
</pre><p>Then, copy all files from ext2 filesystem to the JFS
partition:
<pre     class="programlisting">
% cd /
% cp -a bin etc lib boot dev home usr var [...] /jfs
  You need special handling for /proc and /tmp:
        % mkdir /jfs/proc
        % chmod 555 /jfs/proc
        % mkdir /jfs/tmp
        % chmod 1777 /jfs/tmp
</pre>


It is important to create /proc and /tmp with the correct
permissions. Permission 1777 means the only people who can rename
or remove any file in that directory are the file's owner, the
directory's owner and the superuser. The last steps involve
changing /etc/lilo.conf and /etc/fstab. First, we change lilo.conf
to boot using the kernel on our JFS partition. Notice that root is
different from the first entry we made as well as from the label.
Thus, the image to be booted will not be found in /dev/hda5/boot,
but in /dev/hda6/boot:
<pre     class="programlisting">
image=/boot/vmlinuz-jfs
        label=jfs-kernel
        read-only
        root=/dev/hda6
</pre>


Finally, we need to change /jfs/etc/fstab to tell the Linux system
what filesystem it is using. Change the following line:
<pre     class="programlisting">
LABEL=/         /       ext2    defaults        1 1
</pre>


so that it says:
<pre     class="programlisting">
/dev/hda6       /       jfs     defaults        1 1
</pre>


Now, you can reboot and choose jfs-kernel. This will start Linux
with the JFS root filesystem.
</p><p>After a crash, the log replay occurs automatically. Instead
of the usual fsck messages, you should see JFS journaling messages.
Replaying the log is necessary when a filesystem becomes
unstable.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xae6580.0xbd6bd0"></a>The JFS Experience at the Ericsson Research Lab
in Montr&eacute;al</h2></div></div><p>One of the responsibilities of the Open Systems Lab at
Ericsson Research is to design, implement and benchmark
carrier-class platforms that run telecom applications. These
carrier-class platforms have strict requirements regarding
scalability, reliability and high availability. They must operate
nonstop, regardless of hardware or software errors, and they must
allow operators to upgrade hardware and software during operation
without disturbing the applications that run on them. As a result,
they must offer extreme reliability and high availability, often
referred to as a five-nines availability (99.999% uptime).</p><p>To maintain such availability, these carrier-class platforms
were designed with many features that allow software to be upgraded
while the system is running and providing service. These features
include fault tolerance implemented in the software, network
redundancy to handle catastrophic situations such as earthquakes
and in-service upgrade features.</p><p>Although many precautions have been taken to protect the
system, there is always a remote chance that the processor (or
server node) will fail. Thus, as a last resort, we need to reboot
the processor. In this extreme case, we need to be able to reboot
the processor and bring it to normal status, serving requests as
soon as possible, with a minimal downtime.</p><p>Our interest in journaling filesystems for the carrier-class
Linux platform came from the fact that these filesystems provide a
fast filesystem restart. In the case of a system crash, a
journaling filesystem can restore a filesystem to a consistent
state more quickly and more reliably than other filesystems.</p><p>Initially, we started to experiment with the IBM JFS in early
2000. The JFS team was helpful and supportive, and their
representative, Steve Best, visited our lab in January 2001. Since
then, we have been following JFS development closely and upgrading
our servers to support the latest versions.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6268f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. 1U Rackmount Units Used to Test JFS
</p></div></div><p>The first installations of JFS were done on 1U rackmount
units with Celeron 500MHz processors, 256MB of RAM and 20GB IDE
disks. These units provided us with a working environment to test
JFS and to experiment with its features using some of our
applications. Since JFS version 1.0.0 was released in June 2001, we
decided to install JFS on our test Linux platform, shown in Figure
2.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6268f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Telecom-Grade HW Used to Test JFS on Linux
</p></div></div><p>Our Linux systems are designed to serve short
transaction-based requests. JFS provides a log-based, byte-level
filesystem targeted for transaction-oriented systems, which makes
it quite suitable for our type of systems.</p><p>The advantages of JFS from a telecom point of view are that
it provides improved structural consistency, recoverability and
much faster restart times than non-journaling filesystems, such as
traditional UNIX filesystems. In most cases, the other filesystems
are subject to corruption in the event of a system crash. They rely
on restart-time utilities like fsck, which examines all of the
filesystem's metadata to detect and repair structural integrity
problems. This is a time-consuming and error-prone process; in a
worst-case scenario, it can lose or misplace data. Telecom
platforms cannot afford a process that prolongs a system's
downtime.</p><p>With JFS, in case of a system failure, a filesystem is
restored to a consistent state by replaying the log and applying
log records for the appropriate transactions. The recovery time
associated with this log-based approach is much faster, because the
replay utility examines only the log records produced by recent
filesystem activity, rather than examining all filesystem
metadata.</p><p><a href="6268s1.html" target="_self">Requirements for a Journaling

filesystem restart times in the event of a system crash. The JFS
team's most important goal is to create a reliable,
high-performance filesystem. The JFS team is making great progress
in porting JFS to Linux. From a performance point of view and based
