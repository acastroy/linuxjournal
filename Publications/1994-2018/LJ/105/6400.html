    Can anyone rely on the government to be at the forefront of
    technological innovations?
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb25580.0xc1d348"></a></h2></div></div><p>The theme of our November 2002 issue was
internationalization, and we were fortunate to receive quite a few
interesting articles on the subject. One story in particular, Wayne
Marshall's &ldquo;Radio E-Mail in West Africa&rdquo;, gave insight into how
much we can accomplish when we are willing to shift our
perspectives a bit and work with the tools available&mdash;in Wayne's
case, HF radios capable of long ranges but little bandwidth.
Unfortunately, space constraints in our print edition forced us to
cut some of the details of the e-mail configuration used from the
article. The long version, however, is available on our web site at
<a href="../000/6299.html" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/6299</a>.
If you're interested in the details of how Wayne's radio e-mail
project came about or how the setup differs for incoming as opposed
to outgoing mail, be sure to read &ldquo;Radio E-Mail in West Africa:
the Complete Version&rdquo;. And be sure to check out the readers'
comments at the end; a lot of people are sharing their unique
communication setups.
</p><p>On the topic of internationalization, Fred Noronha has been
providing us with Linux and open-source news from India and
neighboring countries. The grassroots support for software libre is
strong, and even the government has expressed interest in moving
their systems to open source. But are they serious? In a follow-up
web article, &ldquo;Indian Government's Reported Move Makes News, Then
Fuels Skepticism&rdquo;
(<a href="../000/6389.html" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/6389</a>),
Fred reports that many speculate the Indian government is simply
using free software as a threat to get Microsoft to lower license
fees or make a local investment. As one reader states, India cannot
rely on the government to lead the Free Software movement. &ldquo;So we
the people will adopt free software and eventually the government
will have no choice but [to] follow the people.&rdquo;</p><p>Finally, we're certainly not opposed to stirring up some
trouble; we just don't always know where it's going to come from.
So quite innocently we announced the winners of the 2002 Readers'
Choice Awards on our web site in mid-November in the form of a
press release
(<a href="../000/6380.html" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/6380</a>).
We certainly weren't expecting the amount of reader comments we
received&mdash;42 comments, to be exact, as I write this. So who
comments on a press release? People who agree on one thing: our
voters/readers are idiots because they didn't choose the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>correct</em></span> winners. Some days it feels like we
are all back in the sandbox, ready to hit each other on the head
with our toy trucks if we don't get our way. So jump on to the
article's web page and throw some sand yourself.</p><p>If you want to share the details of a unique system you've
