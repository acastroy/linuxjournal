Who knew that Raspberry Pis would make such a great redundant Web
cluster?
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdd6580.0xece3b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
In my last column, I talked about how even though an individual Raspberry
Pi is not that redundant, two Pis are. I described how to set up two Raspberry
Pis as a fault-tolerant file server using the GlusterFS clustered
filesystem. Well, now that we have redundant, fault-tolerant storage shared
across two Raspberry Pis, we can use that as a foundation to build other
fault-tolerant services. In this article, I describe how to set up a
simple Web server cluster on top of the Raspberry Pi foundation we already
have.
</p><p>
Just in case you didn't catch the first column, I'll go over the setup from
last month. I have two Raspberry Pis: Pi1 and Pi2. Pi1 has an IP address of
192.168.0.121, and Pi2 has 192.168.0.122. I've set them up as a GlusterFS
cluster, and they are sharing a volume named gv0 between them. I also
mounted this shared volume on both machines at /mnt/gluster1, so they 
each could access the shared storage at the same time. Finally, I performed some
failure testing. I mounted this shared storage on a third machine and
launched a simple script that wrote the date to a file on the shared
storage. Then, I experimented with taking down each Raspberry Pi individually
to confirm the storage stayed up.
</p><p>
Now that I have the storage up and tested, I'd like to set up these Raspberry
Pis as a fault-tolerant Web cluster. Granted, Raspberry Pis don't
have speedy processors or a lot of RAM, but they still have more than
enough resources to act as a Web server for static files. Although the example
I'm going to give is very simplistic, that's intentional&mdash;the idea is that
once you have validated that a simple static site can be hosted on
redundant Raspberry Pis, you can expand that with some more sophisticated
content yourself.

Install Nginx</h2></div></div><p>
Although I like Apache just fine, for a limited-resource Web server serving
static files, something like nginx has the right blend of features, speed
and low resource consumption that make it ideal for this site. Nginx is
available in the default Raspbian package repository, so I log in to the
first Raspberry Pi in the cluster and run:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install nginx
</pre>
</p><p>
Once nginx installed, I created a new basic nginx configuration at
/mnt/gluster1/cluster that contains the following config:

<pre     class="programlisting">
server {
  root /mnt/gluster1/www;
  index index.html index.htm;
  server_name twopir twopir.example.com;

  location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
  }
}
</pre>
</p><p>
Note: I decided to name the service twopir, but you would change this to
whatever hostname you want to use for the site. Also notice that I set the
document root to /mnt/gluster1/www. This way, I can put all of my static
files onto shared storage so they are available from either host.
</p><p>
Now that I have an nginx config, I need to move the default nginx config
out of the way and set up this config to be the default. Under Debian,
nginx organizes its files a lot like Apache with sites-available and
sites-enabled directories. Virtual host configs are stored in
sites-available, and sites-enabled contains symlinks to those configs that
you want to enable. Here are the steps I performed on the first Raspberry
Pi:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ cd /etc/nginx/sites-available
$ sudo ln -s /mnt/gluster1/cluster .
$ cd /etc/nginx/sites-enabled
$ sudo rm default
$ sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/cluster .
</pre>
</p><p>
Now I have a configuration in place but no document root to serve. The next
step is to create a /mnt/gluster1/www directory and copy over the default
nginx index.html file to it. Of course, you probably would want to create
your own custom index.html file here instead, but copying a file is a good
start:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo mkdir /mnt/gluster1/www
$ cp /usr/share/nginx/www/index.html /mnt/gluster1/www
</pre>
</p><p>
With the document root in place, I can restart the nginx service:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo /etc/init.d/nginx restart
</pre>
</p><p>
Now I can go to my DNS server and make sure I have an A record for twopir
that points to my first Raspberry Pi at 192.168.0.121. In your case, of
course, you would update your DNS server with your hostname and IP. Now I
would open up http://twopir/ in a browser and confirm that I see the default
nginx page. If I look at the /var/log/nginx/access.log file, I should see
evidence that I hit the page.
</p><p>
Once I've validated that the Web server works on the first Raspberry Pi,
it's time to duplicate some of the work on the second Raspberry
Pi. Because
I'm storing configurations on the shared GlusterFS storage, really all I
need to do is install nginx, create the proper symlinks to enable my custom
nginx config and restart nginx:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install nginx
$ cd /etc/nginx/sites-available
$ sudo ln -s /mnt/gluster1/cluster .
$ cd /etc/nginx/sites-enabled
$ sudo rm default
$ sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/cluster .
$ sudo /etc/init.d/nginx restart
</pre>

Two DNS A Records</h2></div></div><p>
So, now I have two Web hosts that can host the same content, but the next
step in this process is an important part of what makes this setup
redundant. Although you definitely could set up a service like heartbeat with
some sort of floating IP address that changed from one Raspberry Pi to the
next depending on what was up, an even better approach is to use two DNS A
records for the same hostname that point to each of the Raspberry Pi IPs.
Some people refer to this as DNS load balancing, because by default, DNS
lookups for a hostname that has multiple A records will return the results
in random order each time you make the request:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ dig twopir.example.com A +short
192.168.0.121
192.168.0.122
$ dig twopir.example.com A +short
192.168.0.122
192.168.0.121
</pre>
</p><p>
Because the results are returned in random order, clients should get sent
evenly between the different hosts, and in effect, multiple A records do
result in a form of load balancing. What interests me about a host having
multiple A records though isn't as much the load balancing as how a Web
browser handles failure. When a browser gets two A records for a Web host,
and the first host is unavailable, the browser almost immediately will fail over to the next A record in the list. This failover is fast enough that in
many cases it's imperceptible to the user and definitely is much faster
than the kind of failover you might see in a traditional heartbeat cluster.
</p><p>
So, go to the same DNS server you used to add the first A record and add a
second record that references the <span   class="emphasis"><em>same</em></span> hostname but a
<span   class="emphasis"><em>different</em></span> IP address&mdash;the IP address of the second host in the
cluster. Once you save your changes, perform a dig query like I performed
above and you should get two IP addresses back.
</p><p>
Once you have two A records set up, the cluster is basically ready for use
and is fault-tolerant. Open two terminals and log in to each Raspberry Pi, and
run <tt  >tail -f /var/log/nginx/access.log</tt> so you can watch the Web server access
then load your page in a Web browser. You should see activity on the access
logs on one of the servers but not the other. Now refresh a few times, and
you'll notice that your browser should be sticking to a single Web server.
After you feel satisfied that your requests are going to that
server successfully, reboot it while refreshing the Web page multiple times. If you see
a blip at all, it should be a short one, because the moment the Web server
drops, you should be redirected to the second Raspberry Pi and be able to
see the same index page. You also should see activity in the access logs.
Once the first Raspberry Pi comes back from the reboot, you probably
will not even be able to notice from the perspective of the Web browser.
</p><p>
Experiment with rebooting one Raspberry Pi at a time, and you should see
that as long as you have one server available, the site stays up. Although
this is a simplistic example, all you have to do now is copy over any other
static Web content you want to serve into /mnt/gluster1/www, and enjoy your
new low-cost fault-tolerant Web cluster.
