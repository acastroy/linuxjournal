Porting Android to new hardware? You <span   class="emphasis"><em>must</em></span> read this!
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1174580.0x126c2a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Imagine having a refrigerator in your kitchen that could give you the nutritional contents
and shelf life of the food you keep inside, or an automatic room
cleaner that could take your commands via a chat app or SMS and clean your
house in your absence. A few years ago, such devices were only dreamed of, but with rapid advancement in mobile operating systems and the
ecosystem around them, such devices will be a reality soon.
</p><p>
Android specifically has an edge here. Because it is an open-source OS,
developers all over the world are free to contribute, improve or even adapt
it specifically to their needs (read: hardware requirements), and with the
community growing larger by the day, much innovation is happening. But,
this freedom to change the OS and adapt it to different hardware has
to be managed somehow. There must be a mechanism to ensure that all the
devices running Android provide the same experience to end users.
Although developers get a chance to port Android to their hardware, users
should not need to know about the underlying changes. 
</p><p>
As per Google,
Android compatibility consists of three key components:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Android source code: the source code itself serves as a specification
for the developers aspiring to port it to new hardware, and anyone who
understands the code, will learn about the platform, APIs and their
behavior. 
</p></li><li><p>
CDD (compatibility definition document): CDD serves as the policy for
Android compatibility. It is a document that aims mainly to clarify and
remove ambiguity in the implementation. So if you want to port Android to
new hardware, you should read the CDD and follow all the
guidelines mentioned there.
</p></li><li><p>
CTS (compatibility test suite): this is the mechanism for Android
portability. Because it is difficult&mdash;rather, impossible&mdash;to test hardware
behavior via software, CTS helps with testing the APIs and the platform
functionality. So, where CDD tells you what to do, CTS helps you check
whether you have done it properly.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
In this article, I discuss the CTS (Compatibility Test Suite),
an application that allows you to validate your Android porting. CTS
helps you check that the app developers get the same set of APIs (and
that those APIs will behave properly) and that users get the same overall
Android experience in you new device. The testing is as easy as running test
cases and generating a report and logs. Looking at the report will tell you
whether
everything is okay with your implementation. If that's not enough, you can
send the report to Google to claim entry to Google play.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1174580.0x126c828"></a>
Overview</h2></div></div><p>
CTS, like Android, is an open-source tool, and the code for CTS is
available with the Android source code. CTS also is available separately as an
installable file on the Android developer Web site. So if you just want to run
the tool without modifications, you can download it from the Web site.
But, if you want to add or delete some test cases, or change a test case, you
need to use the source code available with the Android source code, change it
and then run the test cases. It is worth mentioning here that for every
version of Android released, a corresponding CTS version
is available.
It's best to use the same versions of Android and CTS for testing. I use
the latest CTS version 4.2_r1 for this article. 
</p><p>
CTS is composed of two major components: 1) the application that runs
on your desktop and manages the test execution, and 2) the test cases
that actually are executed on the mobile device or emulator. The test
cases are written in Java as JUnit tests and packaged as .apk files, so
that they can be run on the target Android device. Once the testing starts,
the test application loads each of the .apk files (in the test scenario
that is run) to the target, executes it, records the test result and,
finally, removes it from the target device.
</p><p>
In this article, I provide a step-by-step guide to configure, run and
generate the test reports. I also show how to add or remove test cases
from the test harness. As a open-source enthusiast, I have an inclination
toward the Linux OS, so I explain the CTS configuration on a Linux system
first. But, Windows users need not worry, because I explain the configuration
of Android on Windows also. Configuring it on a Mac machine shouldn't 
be much different, and once you configure it, running CTS is the same for all
three platforms.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1174580.0x126c9e0"></a>
Prerequisites</h2></div></div><p>
To run CTS, you must have the CTS build downloaded from the Android
developer Web site. If you are planning to add or remove test cases, you
need the CTS source code also, which is available with the Android source
code. When you change the CTS source code, it has to be built again, and
you will need a compiler for that, depending on your personal preference.
</p><p>
Along with the CTS, you also need to download the Android SDK available on
the Android Web site. The SDK has the adb (android debug bridge) utility,
which is required for CTS to run. Also, using the SDK lets you create virtual
devices on which to run your CTS test cases if you don't want to use a real
Android device.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1174580.0x126cb98"></a>
Initial CTS Configuration</h2></div></div><p>
Here are the steps for configuring your Linux system to run CTS.
</p><p>
Ensure that adb is in the system path. This can be done with the
command: 


<pre     class="programlisting">
export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/android-sdk-linux_x86/platform-tools
</pre>
</p><p>
Once the path is set, you can launch the CTS console by running the
cts-tradefed script. To run the script, browse to the folder containing the
android-cts folder and run the command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
./android-cts/tools/cts-tradefed
</pre>
</p><p>
This takes you to the cts command prompt. Now you can run the test cases
for your device using the cts commands. The commands are discussed below,
but
more details on configuring and running CTS are available in the official
CTS documentation at
<a href="http://source.android.com/compatibility/downloads.html" target="_self">source.android.com/compatibility/downloads.html</a>.
</p><p>
If you use Windows, here are the steps to configure CTS on your computer.
</p><p>
Put the CTS prebuilt package downloaded from the Android developer site
in a suitable location on your PC. Next, create a .bat file with the
following
contents and put it in the tools folder inside the CTS folder:


<pre     class="programlisting">
SET SDK_ROOT=&lt;Path to the Android developer tools folder&gt;
SET CTS_ROOT=&lt;Path to the CTS folder&gt;
if not exist %SDK_ROOT% GOTO showError
if not exist %CTS_ROOT% GOTO showError
SET PATH=%PATH%%SDK_ROOT%\platform-tools;
if not exist %SDK_ROOT% GOTO showError
java -cp
ddmlib-prebuilt.jar;tradefed-prebuilt.jar;
&#8618;hosttestlib.jar;cts-tradefed.jar
-DCTS_ROOT=&lt;Path to the CTS folder&gt;
com.android.cts.tradefed.command.CtsConsole
:showError
Echo.
Echo "SDK_ROOT/CTS_ROOT not configured properly;
</pre>
</p><p>
Remember to change the values of <tt  >SDK_ROOT</tt>,
<tt  >CTS_ROOT</tt> and the <tt  >-DCTS</tt> root.
This batch file sets the required environment variables and prepares your
system to run the CTS.
</p><p>
Next, run the .bat file you created in the above step. This should
create a cts-tf command prompt. Start your Android virtual device (not
required for real devices), and run the command <tt  >list
devices</tt> at the cts-tf
command prompt. This will list the Android devices that are available
currently on your computer. If it doesn't, you may want check whether the
previous steps
were followed properly.
</p><p>
That's it for the CTS configuration, but if you are planning to use the
virtual Android device, you need to configure it. To do that, just run
the SDK manager.exe in the adt folder. This tool helps you manage the
Android packages and the Android virtual devices. You can install your
(modified) Android package and then create a virtual device with a target as
your Android package. So, you can have a virtual device with your Android
code loaded. (Skip this step if you plan to use an actual device, and just
plug in your Android device to your computer via USB cable. CTS should be
able to identify the device.) 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11469f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

Running CTS</h2></div></div><p>
The CTS testing mechanism is arranged as test cases, test packages and test
plans. As the names suggest, test cases test a particular class, while the
test packages are used to test functionality, which can be a combination of
several APIs. Test plans are comprehensive testing schemes where features
of the OS, such as signature and appSecurity, are tested. Now as you know, CTS
is a combination of all these test cases and the application that manages
these tests. So, to run a CTS test case, you need to communicate with the
application, which internally will start running the tests.
</p><p>
The CTS application can be run via the cts-fd command prompt (which you get
after running the .bat file mentioned previously). It has its own set of
commands, and you need to use these commands to interact with it. The
following are a few of the most important CTS commands:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
<tt  >help</tt>: lists all the available commands and their options&mdash;type this
command if you are stuck somewhere.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >list</tt>: the list command can be used with different
options to list the
test packages, test plans, test results, devices and so forth on the command prompt.
For example, if you want to list all the test plans, type <tt  >list
plans</tt>. 
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >run cts</tt>: this command runs the test cases in CTS. You can use
it to run test packages, test plans and so on. For example, if you want to run the
android.view package, type <tt  >run cts -p android.view</tt>.
</p></li></ul></div><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11469f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11469f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div><p>
Now that you know the important CTS commands, you can start running the CTS
test cases to verify your android implementation.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1174580.0x1666020"></a>
Report Generation</h2></div></div><p>
Once you run the CTS test case/package/plan, you need to wait for the test
to finish running. Once the test is finished, CTS automatically generates the reports
and logs. The reports generated by CTS are quite comprehensive with clear
information about the passed/failed cases. If there are any failures in the
test, the report shows it on the top along with the failure details to help
you analyze the failed test cases. You can access the report in the folder
android-cts\repository\results\&lt;Time-Stamp&gt;\testResult.xml. CTS also
generates detailed logs of the test case execution, which can help you
if you need to troubleshoot issues. The log is available for both the
device and the host system. The logs are available in the folder
android-cts\repository\logs\&lt;Time-Stamp&gt;.

Adding Tests to CTS</h2></div></div><p>
Thus far, I've been discussing how to run the default test cases available with CTS, but
CTS is open source, so where is the fun if we don't play around with the
code and add something extra? Let's look at how to write test cases for CTS
and then integrate them with the framework.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1174580.0x16665a0"></a>
Getting Started</h2></div></div><p>
Probably the best way to get started with adding a test case to the CTS is
to look at the existing test cases present in the framework source code.
(The CTS source code is available with the Android source code, so you need
to download the Android source code.) As you go through the folder
structure and the test cases, you will get an idea of how the test cases are
written and organized in the framework. 
</p><p>
You can see that the default test cases included with CTS in the cts/tests/
folder are
segregated according to the different features they are meant to test. There are
folders for processtest, signaturetest, accessibility and so on, which correspond
to the various features. The folder cts/tests/tests has the general test
cases, and most of the time, this is where you can add your own test
case. If you go to a folder inside the cts/tests/tests folder, say the
bluetooth folder, you can see it has an AndroidManifest file along with a
make file. So, these tests essentially are Android apps written based on
JUnit.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1174580.0x1666700"></a>
JUnit Introduction</h2></div></div><p>
JUnit is an open source,
unit-testing framework for the Java language, which aims at testing the code
and then its implementation. So, with JUnit, developers can add the
test cases in their code and get feedback while developing the
code.
The Android CTS uses features like assertion and annotations in the
test cases, so I primarily focus on these features here.
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Assertion: using assertion, you can test whether a given condition is
true or false. JUnit provides an assertion method for all the primitive types and
objects. So, you can use assertion in your test case to check whether things are
as they should be. There also is an optional field for a string message that
is output on failure. Assertion methods available in JUnit are assertTrue,
assertFalse, assertEquals, assertNull, assertNotNull, assertSame,
assertNotSame and so on.
</p></li><li><p>
Annotations: annotations are used before a method definition to identify
whether it is a test method. They also are used to define the execution order of
the test case or even ignore a test case. The annotations available in
JUnit are @Test, @Before, @After, @Ignore, @BeforeClass, @AfterClass and so
on.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Enough theoretical knowledge, let's look at a 
working sample! Let's take a working test case based on JUnit and see
how it works. 
Below is a small code snippet from the CTS source to show how
assertions are used in the test cases (you can see the full code here:
cts/tests/tests/bluetooth/src/BasicAdapterTest.java):

 
<pre     class="programlisting">
public class BasicAdapterTest extends AndroidTestCase {
private static final int DISABLE_TIMEOUT = 8000;  // ms timeout for BT
disable private static final int ENABLE_TIMEOUT = 10000;  // ms timeout 
                  &#8618;for BT enable
private static final int POLL_TIME = 400;         // ms 
                  &#8618;to poll BT state
private static final int CHECK_WAIT_TIME = 1000;  // ms 
                  &#8618;to wait before enable/disable
    private boolean mHasBluetooth;
    public void setUp() throws Exception {
        super.setUp();
        mHasBluetooth = 
        &#8618;getContext().getPackageManager().hasSystemFeature(
                PackageManager.FEATURE_BLUETOOTH);
    }
    public void test_getDefaultAdapter() {
        /*
         * Note: if the target doesn't support Bluetooth at all, 
         * then this method should return null.
         */
        if (mHasBluetooth) {
            assertNotNull(BluetoothAdapter.getDefaultAdapter());
        } else {
            assertNull(BluetoothAdapter.getDefaultAdapter());
        }
    }
}
</pre>
</p><p>
As you can see, the <tt  >BasicAdapterTest</tt> extends the
<tt  >AndroidTestCase</tt>. The
first method in this class, the <tt  >setUp</tt> method, sets a variable as true or
false based on whether the device has a Bluetooth feature available.
The second method, <tt  >test_getDefaultAdapter</tt>, tests whether an application can
access the default Bluetooth adapter using the assert function available in
JUnit. Similar methods to test different features are written. 
Additionally, you can use Eclipse to write new JUnit test cases&mdash;just
select JUnit test case in the new Eclipse project window.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1174580.0x1666cd8"></a>
Integrate the New Test Case with CTS</h2></div></div><p>
Now that you know how to write a test case and where the files are
stored, let's look at how to integrate these newly written tests to the CTS
framework so they can be executed as the default tests. Following are
the steps to add a test case to the CTS:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Develop the test case as a JUnit Android application. Add the folder to
the cts/tests/tests folder.
</p></li><li><p>
Add the line <tt  >LOCAL_PACKAGE_NAME: =
&lt;TestPackageName&gt;</tt> to the Android.mk
file present in the application folder. Here,
<tt  >TestPackageName</tt> is the name of
test package you just created.
</p></li><li><p>
Add the name of the test package to the
<tt  >CTS_CASE_LIST</tt> variable in
the android/build/core/tasks/cts.mk file.
</p></li><li><p>
Open the command prompt and change the current directory to the Android
source folder. Now you can build the CTS by running the command <tt  >make
cts</tt> at the command prompt. (To run the
<tt  >make</tt> command on Windows, you need a
compiler toolchain installed.)
</p></li></ol></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1174580.0x16672b0"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
That's pretty much everything about the Android CTS tool. Use it whenever you
are making changes to the Android source code, so that you can be sure of
being inline with the original Android code. Happy coding!
