MSC Embedded Inc.'s Qseven Starter Kit</h2></div></div><p>
The new Qseven Starter Kit with AMD embedded G-Series APU, says its
producer MSC Embedded Inc., frequently will be used to drive an LCD output.
The MSC Q7-SK-A50M-EP4 Starter Kit consists of MSC's 3.5" Qseven baseboard
Q7-MB-EP4 with heatspreader and heatsink and an integrated power supply
with cable kit. The kit comes with a ready-to-run Linux installation in
Flash Disk to enable an out-of-the-box functional experience. An optional
TFT kit is available, which provides for a 12.1" LCD panel with XGA
resolution (1024 x 768), the appropriate cable kit for operation off the
Qseven baseboard and full implementation in the Qseven module's Graphics
BIOS. Users can select the Qseven module with the most suitable processor
and clock speed from the MSC range of Q7-A50M modules: AMD G-T40E Dual-Core
APU or AMD G-T40R Single-Core APU with optional 7.2GB Flash Disk or AMD
G-T16R Single-Core APU.

Peter Gasston's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Modern Web</em></span> (No Starch Press)</h2></div></div><p>
Today's Web technologies are evolving at near-lightspeed. When
users can browse the Web on a 3" phone screen as easily as on a
50" HDTV, what's a developer to do? Well, flummoxed friends,
there is a new book designed to answer just that question, namely Peter
Gasston's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Modern Web: Multi-Device Web Development with HTML5, CSS3, and
JavaScript</em></span>. Gasston's book will guide readers through the latest and
most important tools for device-agnostic Web development, including HTML5,
CSS3 and JavaScript. His plain-English explanations and practical examples
emphasize the techniques, principles and practices one needs to
transcend individual browser quirks easily and stay relevant as these
technologies are updated. After reading the book, claims publisher No Starch
Press, one will be equipped to design content that displays fluidly across
multiple devices as well as turn outdated Web sites into flexible,
user-friendly ones that take full advantage of the unique capabilities of
any device or browser.

Exablox's OneBlox</h2></div></div><p>
After two years in stealth development mode, Exablox has burst out of the
lab to debut its OneBlox flagship solution, an affordable storage appliance
that combines a paradigm-shifting architecture design with integrated,
enterprise-grade software features. The two-year development phase,
complete with extensive customer and partner research, chipped away at
businesses' most common storage pain points, including runaway costs,
complicated installation, cumbersome data management and a lack of data
security. The 100% cloud-based OneBlox's key product highlights include
initial installs in less than five minutes and subsequent configurations in
less than three, HTML5 storage management and control that graphically
depict storage use and performance, automatically enabled deduplication and
compression, dynamic and automatic capacity and performance expansion with
new drives or nodes, instant data recovery from any desktop and an
encrypted local copy of all data.

xTuple ERP</h2></div></div><p>
Distribution companies have three problems: items, items and items.
Managing all the inventory in distribution-heavy industries, such as
electrical, HVAC/R, PVF, office products and automotive, can be a management
nightmare. These sectors are potential target customers for the updated
xTuple ERP, which includes the new xWD extension for sophisticated,
enterprise-class inventory control. One feature of xTuple's xWD is the
external catalog that allows distribution companies to merchandise
non-stock products readily for immediate sales fulfillment and generation of a
corresponding purchase order. The xWD module complements the open-source
xTuple's existing functionality in sales, accounting and operations&mdash;including customer and supplier management, inventory control,
manufacturing and distribution. xTuple gives customers the ability to
tailor solutions with multiplatform support for Linux, Windows, Mac and
mobile.

6WIND's 6WINDGate</h2></div></div><p>
Readers interested in virtualization and enterprise networking solutions
will want to read on about improvements to the 6WINDGate networking
software from 6WIND. 6WINDGate solves critical performance and scalability
challenges for virtual switches while retaining full compatibility with
standard virtual switch software, such as Open vSwitch. The company claims
that 6WINDGate provides an optimized data plane solution that delivers more
than a 10x acceleration for the baseline switching functions and delivers
high performance for secure tunneling protocols, such as IPsec, GRE, NVGRE,
VLAN and VxLAN. This enables service providers, such as cloud and
telecom data centers, to achieve significant CAPEX and OPEX 1 improvements
that are not possible without data plane acceleration. The virtual switch
acceleration delivered by 6WINDGate is transparent to the applications
running on the platform, which do not need to be recompiled or re-verified
in order to work
with this high-performance solution.

Wind River Linux Carrier-Grade Profile</h2></div></div><p>
Although carrier-grade functionality isn't new for Wind River, the new
Wind River Linux Carrier-Grade Profile for the latest version of Wind River
Linux delivers these capabilities on top of a Yocto Project-compatible
product. Formally registered for the CGL 5.0 specification with the Linux
Foundation, the profile is the first delivery of carrier-grade Linux
functionalities on top of a Yocto compatibility, says the company. The
Yocto Project is a multivendor, open-source project that provides
templates, tools and methods for creating custom Linux-based systems for
embedded products, regardless of the hardware architecture. The net result
of this combination of features, says Wind River, is a decrease in
complexity and costs, an increase in the portability of Linux
implementations and improved cross-platform compatibility and component
interoperability. Carrier-grade products typically require up to 5 nines or
6 nines (99.999% to 99.9999%) availability, translating to downtime
as low as 30 seconds a year.
