No one who isn't lazy writes scripts. Scripts save valuable system
administrator time. In this article, I introduce the Sleep scripting
language, which is
a Perl-inspired language built on the Java platform. Although Java is
sometimes a bad word in our community, Sleep can help you, because a Java-based
language has several benefits. Scripts work on different platforms, data
has the same form everywhere, and tools to solve any problem are available
through the Java class library or open-source extensions.
</p><p>
With Sleep, you can save time on task automation and
distributed computing. Sleep can help, whether you have one box or 10,000.
Here, I
introduce the language and its syntax, accessing the filesystem, talking
to local and remote processes, and distributed computing with mobile
agents.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20e9580.0x21e1510"></a>
Getting Started</h2></div></div><p>
You can use Sleep right away if you already have Java installed. Make sure
the Java you use is the Sun Java. Any version 1.4.2 or later will do. Sleep
does not run with the GNU Java that some Linux distributions use by
default:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ java -version
java version "1.5.0_13"
Java(TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition
</pre>
</p><p>
Installation is easy. Visit the home page (see Resources), and download the sleep.jar file.
This file has everything you need to execute Sleep scripts:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ wget http://sleep.dashnine.org/download/sleep.jar
</pre>
</p><p>
You can execute a script on the command line with the following:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ cat &gt;tryit.sl
println("I am $__SCRIPT__ with " . @ARGV);
$ java -jar sleep.jar tryit.sl "hello icecream" 34
I am tryit.sl with @('hello icecream', '34')
</pre>
</p><p>
Sleep scripts also are happy to exist as UNIX script files:

<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/path/to/java -jar /path/to/sleep.jar
println("Hello Icecream!");

$ chmod +x script
$ ./script
Hello Icecream!
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20e9580.0x21e18d8"></a>
Sleep Basics</h2></div></div><p>
Sleep and Perl have a lot in common. Variables are scalars, and scalars store
strings, numbers, functions or Java objects:

<pre     class="programlisting">

# Set some variables
$w = "foo";
$x = 3.14 * 12;
$y = &amp;someFunction;
$z = [java.awt.Color RED];

</pre>
</p><p>
Like Perl, Sleep comments begin with a # and end with a newline.
</p><p>
Variable names inside double-quoted strings are replaced with their
value at runtime. For example, <tt  >"this is a $x"</tt> will use the current value of
$x. To avoid this behavior, prefix a variable with a backslash.
Double-quoted strings can format variables to a small degree. Use
<tt  >"$[20]x"</tt> to pad
the value of $x with spaces until it is 20 characters wide. A negative
number prefixes the value with spaces. The <tt  >$+</tt> operator brings together the
left and right values in a string. For example, <tt  >"a $+
b"</tt> is <tt  >"ab"</tt>.
</p><p>
Like Perl, Sleep has arrays and hashes. An array refers to values by a
numerical index:

<pre     class="programlisting">
@a = @("a", "b");
@a[2] = "c";
push(@a, "d");

println(@a);

@('a', 'b', 'c', 'd')
</pre>
</p><p>
Hashes store and get values with a string key. Think of these as a
dictionary. The keys are not kept in order:

<pre     class="programlisting">
%b = %(a =&gt; "apple", b =&gt; "bat");
%b["c"] = 'cat';

println(%b);

%(a =&gt; 'apple', c =&gt; 'cat', b =&gt; 'bat')
</pre>
</p><p>
Scripts can create hashes of hashes, arrays of hashes, arrays of arrays,
and any other combination you can imagine. These data structures offer a
flexible way for storing data. And, these structures are more than hashes
and arrays. Scripts can use arrays as sets, stacks, queues and lists.
Combinations of arrays and hashes can make finite-state machines, graphs
and trees. You can make nearly any data structure you'll need.
</p><p>
Sleep provides a gamut of flow control options. The for loop, while loop
and foreach loop are all here. If statements work as you would expect.
Sleep differentiates strings and numbers for comparisons. Here, I use the
Sleep console to show the difference:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ java -jar sleep.jar
&gt;&gt; Welcome to the Sleep scripting language
&gt; ? "3" eq 3.0
false
&gt; ? "3" == 3.0
true
</pre>
</p><p>
The assignment loop is found a lot in Sleep scripts. This loop evaluates a
statement and assigns the result to a variable before executing the loop
body. The loop keeps going while the result is not $null, which is the
empty value&mdash;it is equal to an empty string, the number zero and a NULL
reference all at once. Most functions return $null when they are finished.
This script iterates over each line of a file:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$handle = openf("/etc/passwd");

while $entry (readln($handle))
{
   println($entry);
}
</pre>
</p><p>
Sleep uses the same functions to work on files, processes and sockets. A
scalar that holds a file, process or socket is a handle. The &amp;readln
function reads a line of text from a handle. The &amp;println function prints a
line of text. Likewise, &amp;readb reads some bytes from a handle. And, &amp;writeb
writes bytes. The following is a Sleep version of the UNIX copy command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
global('$source $dest $handle');

($source, $dest) = @ARGV;

$handle = openf($source);
$data = readb($handle, -1);
closef($handle);

$handle = openf("&gt; $+ $dest");
writeb($handle, $data);
closef($handle);

$ java -jar sleep.jar cp.sl a.txt b.txt
</pre>
</p><p>
Notice the value @ARGV. This array holds the script's command-line
arguments. The &amp;closef function closes a handle.
</p><p>
Scripts declare named functions with the sub keyword. Arguments are
available as $1 to $n:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sub foo
{
   println("$1 and $2");
}

foo("bar", "baz");

bar and baz
</pre>
</p><p>
Sleep functions are first-class types. This means you can assign them to
variables and pass them as arguments to functions. A script can refer to a
named function with &amp;functionName. Scripts also can use anonymous
functions&mdash;anonymous functions? Yes. An anonymous function is a block of
code enclosed in curly braces:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$var = { println("hi $1"); };

# call the function in $var
[$var: "mom"];

# call an anonymous function
[{ println("hi $1"); }: "dad"];

hi mom
hi dad
</pre>
</p><p>
Sleep invokes functions and talks to Java through object expressions. An
object expression encloses an object, an optional message and arguments in
square brackets:

<pre     class="programlisting">
[$object message: arg1, arg2, ...];
</pre>
</p><p>
The example below shows nested object expressions:

<pre     class="programlisting">
[[System out] println: "Hello World"];
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20e9580.0x21e23d8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
which is equal to this Java statement:

<pre     class="programlisting">
System.out.println("Hello World");
</pre>
</p><p>
When calling into Java, the message is the name of a method or field that
belongs to the object. Arguments are converted to Java types as necessary,
and some conversions are automatic. Nearly anything will convert to a string.
However, a string will not convert to an int. Casting is possible, but I
don't cover that topic here.
</p><p>
Now that you know a little about the Sleep language, it helps to see it in
action. Next, I present several scenarios and Sleep-based solutions to
them.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20e9580.0x21e25e8"></a>
Filesystem Fun (the Biggest File)</h2></div></div><p>
My home directory has many files. I'm a digital packrat, and I'm always low
on disk space. I really have no idea what is on my disk. To help, I wrote a
script to find the largest files within a directory and its subdirectories:

<pre     class="programlisting">
global('$size $file @files %sizes');

sub processFile
{
</pre>
</p><p>
This script creates a data structure of files and their sizes, sorts it,
and presents the results to the user. The &amp;processFile function does most of
the work, and it expects a file as an argument:

<pre     class="programlisting">

   if (-isDir $1)
   {
      filter(&amp;processFile, ls($1));
   }

</pre>
</p><p>
If the argument is a directory, the &amp;ls function will provide the contents
of the directory as an array. &amp;filter expects a function and an array as
arguments. &amp;filter calls the function on each item in the array. I use
&amp;filter to call &amp;processFile on the argument's subdirectories and
files:

<pre     class="programlisting">

   else if (lof($1) &gt; (1024 * 1024))
   {
      %sizes[$1] = lof($1);
   }
}

</pre>
</p><p>
The hash %sizes stores each filename and size. The key is the filename, and
the size is the value. The &amp;lof function returns the length of a file in
bytes. I ignore files smaller than 1MB in size. I have so many files that
this script exhausts the memory of Java before finishing. I could set Java
to use a larger heap size with <tt  >java -Xmx1024M -jar
sleep.jar</tt>. Below, I chose
to fix my script:

<pre     class="programlisting">
processFile(@ARGV[0]);
</pre>
</p><p>
I call &amp;processFile on the first command-line argument to kick off the
script. When this function returns, the %sizes hash will contain an entry
for each file in the specified directory and its subdirectories:

<pre     class="programlisting">

@files = sort({ return %sizes[$2] &lt;=&gt; %sizes[$1]; },
                                  keys(%sizes));

</pre>
</p><p>
The &amp;sort function processes the keys of %sizes and places them in order
from largest to smallest size. Much like Perl, Sleep's &amp;sort can use any
criteria given by an anonymous function:

<pre     class="programlisting">
foreach $file (sublist(@files, 0, 50))
{
   $size = lof($file);
   println("$[20]size $file");
}
</pre>
</p><p>
This script ends with a foreach loop to print out the 50 largest files.
</p><p>
And, lo and behold! I solved my problem. I found four copies of a Christmas
movie I made on my Macintosh three years ago. Thanks to the script, I
recovered several gigabytes of disk space.

Local Processes (PS. I Love You)</h2></div></div><p>
Recently, I had to watch this movie about a guy who sent letters to his
wife after he passed away. I'm not really into the romantic-morbid genre;
however, I thought I could show the people in my life how much I care about
them. Here is a script that sends a random fortune to someone every 24
hours:

<pre     class="programlisting">
include("sendemail.sl");

while (1)
{
   sendemail($to =&gt; "rsmudge@gmail.com",
      $from =&gt; "raffi@hick.org",
      $subject =&gt; "P.S. I love you",
      $message =&gt; "This made me think of you:\n\n" .
                  join("\n", `fortune`)
   ); 

   # sleep for 24 hours
   sleep(24 * 60 * 60 * 1000);
}
</pre>
</p><p>
I use <tt  >`fortune`</tt> to execute the fortune command and collect its output into
an array. Then, I combine this with the rest of the message body to make a
thoughtful message. This script uses the $variable =&gt; value syntax to pass
named arguments to &amp;sendemail.
</p><p>
Backticks are one way to execute a process. I show the other way in the
sendemail.sl code.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20e9580.0x21d96b8"></a>
Sending E-Mail</h2></div></div><p>
I use the sendmail program to send e-mail. The sendemail.sl file contents
are:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sub sendemail
{
   local('$handle');
   $handle = exec("/usr/sbin/sendmail -t $to");
</pre>
</p><p>
Sleep executes processes with the &amp;exec function. Scripts interact with
processes as if they were files. As an aside, you can pass arguments with
spaces to &amp;exec. Use an array instead of a string. For example,
<tt  >exec(@("/usr/sbin/sendmail", "-t", $to))</tt> would work
in this example:

<pre     class="programlisting">
   println($handle, 
"TO: $to
FROM: $from
SUBJECT: $subject
$message");
</pre>
</p><p>
Here, I send the e-mail message to the sendmail process over STDIN. Later in
this article, I cover how to use Sleep for distributed tasks.
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Don't</em></span>
combine this e-mail example with that&mdash;I don't like spammers:

<pre     class="programlisting">
   closef($handle);
}
</pre>
</p><p>
The last step is to close the handle. Having successfully automated my
personal life, let's turn our attention to work matters.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20e9580.0x21d9a80"></a>
Remote Processes (Automate SSH)</h2></div></div><p>
System administration is all about reaching out and touching everything.
And, doing that requires automation. Sleep can automate SSH sessions with ease. Here
is the &amp;ssh_cmd function in action:

<pre     class="programlisting">
debug(7);

include("ssh.sl");

global('@output');

@output = ssh_cmd($user =&gt; "root",
                  $pass =&gt; "123456",
                  $host =&gt; "foo.example.com",
                  $command =&gt; "cat /etc/shadow");

printAll(@output);
</pre>
</p><p>
This script authenticates to foo.example.com via SSH, executes
<tt  >"cat
/etc/shadow"</tt>, and prints the result on the local machine. Before we go
further, there is something you should know. Sleep doesn't have an &amp;ssh_cmd
function. We have to build it.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20e9580.0x21d9c90"></a>
Adding SSH to Sleep</h2></div></div><p>
Perl has the CPAN for modules. Sleep scripts can take advantage of the Java
class library to add functionality. Here, I walk you through the code
for ssh.sl:

<pre     class="programlisting">
import com.trilead.ssh2.* from: 
                          trilead-ssh2-build213.jar;
</pre>
</p><p>
Sleep uses import to get access to classes in another package. Unlike Java,
Sleep can import directly from a third-party Java archive file at runtime.
This is useful for trying things out quickly. Here I use the Trilead SSH
for Java library to add SSH to Sleep:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sub ssh_cmd
{
   local('$conn $sess $data $handle @data');

   # create a connection
   $conn = [new Connection: $host, 22];
   [$conn connect];
</pre>
</p><p>
This code creates a new com.trilead.ssh2.Connection object. Next, I call the
connect method on this object to set up an SSH connection:

<pre     class="programlisting">
   # authenticate
   [$conn authenticateWithPassword: $user, $pass];
</pre>
</p><p>
Then, I call the authenticateWithPassword method on the connection. The Java
library expects two string parameters. Sleep is smart enough to convert
scalars to Java types as necessary:

<pre     class="programlisting">
   # execute the command
   $sess = [$conn openSession];
   [$sess execCommand: $command];
</pre>
</p><p>
Here, I create an SSH session from the connection with the openSession
method. This method returns a com.trilead.ssh2.Session object. Sleep
places the object into a scalar variable. If you want to execute more than
one command, create a session for each command as I've done here:

<pre     class="programlisting">
   # wire up a Sleep I/O handle for STDOUT
   $handle = [SleepUtils getIOHandle: 
                      [$sess getStdout], $null];
</pre>
</p><p>
The next thing to do is get the output from the session. Sleep has a class
called SleepUtils with useful functionality. One of the methods constructs
an I/O handle from Java input and output stream objects. Here, I made a
readable I/O object from [$sess getStdout]. To write values, replace $null
with the STDIN value for the session. This is available as [$sess
getStdin]:

<pre     class="programlisting">
   # read output into an array
   @data = readAll($handle);
</pre>
</p><p>
From this point, you can manipulate the remote process like any other
handle. Below, I read the entire contents of the handle into the array
@data:

<pre     class="programlisting">
   # close it all down
   closef($handle);
   [$sess close];
   [$conn close];

   return @data;
}
</pre>
</p><p>
The last step is to close down the session and connection. The &amp;ssh_cmd
function returns the contents of @data.

Run This Example</h2></div></div><p>
To execute this code, create ssh.sl from the example above, download
trilead-ssh2-build212.jar, and re-use the SSH automation code for your own
purposes. Place all these files in the same directory. Then, type:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ java -jar sleep.jar yourscript.sl
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20e9580.0x21da3c8"></a>
Distribute Tasks with Mobile Agents</h2></div></div><p>
Programs that move from computer to computer are mobile agents. Agent
programming is a way of thinking about distributed computing. Some tasks
fit very well into the mobile agent paradigm. For example, if you have to
search all files in a network for some string, it makes no sense to
download every single file and search it. It is much more efficient to move
the search code to each computer and let the searching happen locally.
Mobile agents make this possible.
</p><p>
Mobile agents also save you from the need to define a client and server
protocol. You can place the entire interaction between two or more
computers into a single function and let it start hopping around to
complete the task.
</p><p>
So, what does a mobile agent look like? A mobile agent is a function that
calls &amp;move to relocate itself. Here is a syslog patrol agent. This agent
patrols your network, checking the syslog d&aelig;mon on each box. If the
d&aelig;mon
is down, it tries to restart it. After each patrol, the agent starts over
again:

<pre     class="programlisting">
debug(7);

include("agentlib.sl");
</pre>
</p><p>
Before this script can do anything, I include the agent library file (I
dissect this file in the next section):

<pre     class="programlisting">
sub syslog_patrol
{
   local('$host @computers @proc $handle');

   $handle = openf("computers.txt");
   @computers = readAll($handle);
   closef($handle);
</pre>
</p><p>
The first task is to get a list of all computers. For this, I read in the
contents of computers.txt. I assume each line has the hostname or IP
address of a computer ready to receive my agents:

<pre     class="programlisting">
   $handle = $null;
</pre>
</p><p>
When an agent moves, it takes its variables, call stack and program
counter with it. Sleep has to serialize this data to move a function.
Serialization is the process of converting data to bytes. Scripts cannot
serialize I/O handles. To prevent a disaster, I set the handle to $null
before moving:

<pre     class="programlisting">
   while (size(@computers) &gt; 0)
   {
      $host = @computers[0];
</pre>
</p><p>
The next task is to loop through each host. In this script, I use a list
iteration approach. This approach removes the first item from @computers
with each execution. @computers gets smaller and smaller until nothing is
left. The item we want to work with always is at the front. I use list
iteration here because foreach loops are not serializable:

<pre     class="programlisting">
      move($host);	
</pre>
</p><p>
This one function call is all it takes to relocate the agent. The statement
after this function will execute from $host with its variables and state
intact. In this example, I don't have any error handling. I assume the host
is up and that the agent can move itself there. Error handling isn't hard
to add, and the Sleep documentation provides more on this topic:

<pre     class="programlisting">
      @proc = filter({ 
              return iff("*syslogd" iswm $1);
           }, `ps ax`); 
</pre>
</p><p>
This code gets a list of all processes that match the wild card
<tt  >"*syslogd*"</tt>.
&amp;filter applies the anonymous function to each item in the array given by
<tt  >`ps ax`</tt>. And, &amp;filter collects the non-$null return values of these operations
and puts them into an array. This is Sleep's version of grep. I can use the
size of the @proc array to check whether syslog is running:

<pre     class="programlisting">
      if (size(@proc) == 0)
      {
         chdir('/etc/rc.d/init.d');
         `./syslog start`;
      }
</pre>
</p><p>
Here, I check whether syslog is running. To start it, I change directories, and
execute the syslog d&aelig;mon:

<pre     class="programlisting">
      @computers = sublist(@computers, 1);
   }
</pre>
</p><p>
The last step of the loop is to remove the first item from @computers. 
I use &amp;ublist to do this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
   sendAgent($home, lambda($this, \$home));
}
</pre>
</p><p>
At the end of the patrol, I send the agent back to the starting computer. I
use &amp;lambda to make a fresh copy of the agent function with no saved state.
I pass the $home variable into the copy so it knows where to go when it
restarts:

<pre     class="programlisting">

sendAgent(@ARGV[0], lambda(&amp;syslog_patrol, 
                               $home =&gt; @ARGV[0]));

</pre>
</p><p>
This code launches the agent into the system. I assume @ARGV[0] is the
hostname of the home system with the computers.txt file.

Adding Agent Support</h2></div></div><p>
It should be no surprise that Sleep doesn't have &amp;move. Again, we have
to build it. Isn't that
half the fun? The agentlib.sl file has two functions: &amp;move and
&amp;sendAgent:

<pre     class="programlisting">
inline move 
{ 
   callcc lambda({
      sendAgent($host, $1); 
   }, $host =&gt; $1); 
}
</pre>
</p><p>
&amp;move is an inline function. An inline function executes with the
parent's
variable scope, and commands, such as return, callcc and yield affect the
parent. They are useful for hiding flow control tricks made possible with
callcc. callcc is like a goto. It pauses the current function and calls the
specified anonymous function with the current function as an argument. A
paused function resumes execution the next time a script calls it. So, why
is this exciting to us? Sleep's paused functions are serializable. This
means a script can write a paused function to a socket or a file:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sub sendAgent 
{ 
   local('$handle'); 
   $handle = connect($1, 8888); 
   writeObject($handle, $2); 
   closef($handle); 
} 
</pre>
</p><p>
For example, the &amp;sendAgent function writes a paused function to a socket.
This function expects a hostname and a function as arguments. It connects
to the host with &amp;connect, writes the function with &amp;writeObject, and
closes the handle. One piece of magic is missing. It makes no sense to send
agents without receiving them.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20e9580.0x21dafd0"></a>
Receiving Agents</h2></div></div><p>
Middleware is software that receives agents. It sits between the operating
system and the agents. The following code makes up middleware.sl:

<pre     class="programlisting">
include("agentlib.sl");
</pre>
</p><p>
The agent middleware must include the agentlib.sl file. This gives it and
the agents it executes access to &amp;sendAgent and &amp;move:

<pre     class="programlisting">
while (1) 
{ 
   local('$handle $agent');

   $handle = listen(8888, 0); 
</pre>
</p><p>
The middleware executes in an infinite loop listening for connections on
port 8888. The &amp;listen function waits for a new connection:

<pre     class="programlisting">
   $agent = readObject($handle); 
   closef($handle); 
</pre>
</p><p>
The &amp;readObject function reads an object in from a handle. Here, I assume I
am reading a function from the handle:

<pre     class="programlisting">
   fork({ [$agent]; }, \$agent); 
}
</pre>
</p><p>
The last step is to execute the agent itself. &amp;fork executes code in an
isolated thread. I make the agent available in the thread by giving it to
&amp;fork. The code I use here executes the agent. When the thread starts, the
agent resumes execution from where it left off.

Run This Example</h2></div></div><p>
To execute this example, place a copy of middleware.sl and agentlib.sl on
each computer. Then, execute the middleware with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ java -jar sleep.jar middleware.sl
</pre>
</p><p>
On the first computer, make a script with the &amp;syslog_patrol agent. Create
a computers.txt file that lists each IP address with the agent middleware.
Then, run your script with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ java -jar sleep.jar syslog_agent.sl [local ip address]
</pre>
</p><p>
Now you have a syslog agent patrolling your network. Don't you feel safe?

What's Next?</h2></div></div><p>
Sleep is a language for the Java platform built with the UNIX programming
philosophy. Sleep allows you to use existing tools to create solutions to
problems. I've shown you how to solve a few system administration problems
with Sleep. These examples offer a starting point for you to use the
language.
</p><p>
When evaluating a new language, I look for how easily I can bring in
external functionality, solve a problem or two and process data. Sadly, I
wasn't able to cover data parsing in this article. But, that's okay, Sleep
supports all this stuff. You can read the documentation to get a feel for
regular expressions, pack and unpack, and &amp;parseDate.
</p><p>
To make the most of these examples, I recommend you run them. Links to the
documentation and examples are available in the Resources section.
Good luck, and enjoy the language.
