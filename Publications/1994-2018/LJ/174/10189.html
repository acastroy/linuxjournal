Some of the most dangerous closed and proprietary systems are the ones you
trust to save your life.

My mother died five years ago of a stroke following an endoscopic procedure
to remove a gallstone. The procedure perforated her duodenum, and digestive
fluids leaked into her abdomen. She spent the next week in the Intensive
Care Unit, fighting for her life. She was tough and lived through it, but
the stroke got her a few days later.
</p><p>
The stroke probably was due
to a blood clot, which probably formed because she was off her blood
thinners. That was a medical error that might have been prevented
had her gastroenterologist and her cardiologist been communicating with
each other. My sister and I blame ourselves for not making sure those guys
were talking. But, I also blame the hospital's IT system, which
failed to keep both doctors in their shared patient's loop.
</p><p>
I also should have suspected the IT system of suckiness, because I brought
it down myself one day while visiting Mom by using
a browser on one of the nursing workstations there. I was surfing for about
ten seconds when every screen in sight went blue. Shocked and concerned, I
asked a nurse if this happened often. &ldquo;Happens all the time&rdquo;, she said.
&ldquo;It's a new system.&rdquo;
Of course, it ran on Windows.
</p><p>
This year, I had my own encounter with sucky systems. It started in April
after I had a pulmonary embolism (a blood clot) in my right lung. While
looking for the clot's possible sources, a CAT scan showed a cystic lesion
on my pancreas. My gastroenterologist ordered an MRI, which showed more
cysts. Radiologists said it wasn't clear if one of the cysts was
communicating with the pancreatic duct, so my gastroenterologist recommended
an endoscopic procedure to look up the duct and see what was going
on&mdash;the same procedure that put Mom in the hospital.
</p><p>
The doctor told me before the procedure that there was only a 5% chance of
getting pancreatitis from it. I said okay, and we went ahead with it. The
next morning pancreatitis struck, and I spent the next nine days in the
hospital taking no food or water while massive quantities of fluids were
dripped into my veins. Pain was addressed with enough Demerol, Morphine and
Dilaudid to satiate a junkie.
</p><p>
As I write this, I'm still recovering&mdash;and still in a state of mystery
about my pancreas. The procedure did not see a cyst communicating with the
duct. Neither did a second team of radiologists that viewed the same MRI.
That team said I didn't need the procedure. But the word came too late,
when I was already in the hospital.
</p><p>
One reason we couldn't get the MRI CD to the second team earlier was that
we couldn't find a machine to read it. It wouldn't load on my
gastroenterologist's Windows machine or on either of my Linux
or my Mac machines. All I could see was a pile of Windows
binaries and files.
</p><p>
So, although it was our error to hasten a procedure I didn't need, I also
blame a system in which too much tech doesn't work, doesn't communicate
with other tech, or doesn't use standard image and text file formats that
any machine can read.
</p><p>
Among the many doctors I met in the hospital, one stood out, because he
alone addressed the problems of bad data and bad communications. He said
that the whole medical system is corrupted by collusion between equipment
makers, software suppliers and institutional customers. The result is many
closed systems, all lousy at communicating with each other. He said we
need open systems, with data built around patients rather than locked
inside closed silos. He liked Google Health, because at least it
was trying to solve the problem from the patient's side, by making the
patient the point of integration for health-care data from many different
sources. (Microsoft also seems to be doing something similar with
HealthVault.)
</p><p>
The whole matter of Personal Health Records (PHRs) is a complicated one.
There are many open-oriented efforts going on there, and I hope one or more
of them succeeds. Meanwhile, countless thousands of people die every year in
the US alone from bad data and poor communications among health-care
providers. This problem cannot be fixed from the top down, no matter how
open its code.
</p><p>
It has to be fixed from the bottom up&mdash;by hackers and patients. Hackers
need to build (or help health-care software companies build) new systems
using free software and open-source code, so those systems can be improved
and made more compatible on an ongoing basis. Plenty of
money can be made selling systems and servicing them. You don't need closed
code for that. Patients need to become platforms. Each of us needs to be
able to gather, control and share our own health-care data, on our own
terms&mdash;quickly, easily and securely. So services can be based on what
makes each of us unique.
</p><p>
When I suggested this in a post on the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> Web site, some skeptical comments followed, especially
from veterans of The System. But, their arguments were the same kind I heard
30 years ago against personal computing and open networking&mdash;that they
were a cool idea, but that the Big Boys would never let it happen.
</p><p>
We know how that story turned out. I'd like the health-care story to turn
out the same way. We need open-source hackers to make that happen.
Preferably while I'm still alive.
