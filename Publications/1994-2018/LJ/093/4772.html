    How to install and run an IPSec-based VPN gateway with a firewall using a single bootable Linux diskettedistribution.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19d8580.0x1ad06b8"></a></h2></div></div><p>A virtual private network (VPN) is a tool
that enables the secure transmission of data over untrusted
networks such as the Internet. VPNs commonly are used to connect
local area networks (LANs) into wide area networks (WANs) using the
Internet. Perhaps you need to build a VPN between two offices but
are not sure if the large infrastructure costs associated with an
enterprise-level VPN solution are justifiable. The performance of
applications that are intended for use over LANs (for example those
that use network file sharing) seriously can be degraded over WAN
connections. Likewise, lower bandwidth and longer latency in WAN
connections can affect adversely the reliability and performance of
groupware and thin-client applications. Perhaps you have a home
office and would like to use your high-speed internet access to
connect seamlessly and securely to your office LAN through an
IPSec-capable router. Or perhaps you are just curious about VPNs
and IPSec in general and want to experiment.
</p><p>The VPN firewall discussed in this article will run on just
about any 486-or-better PC that has 16MB or more main memory and
two Linux-compatible Ethernet network cards. The idea is to provide
a starting point from a single, self-contained package that will
allow you to create robust, secure, scalable and highly
configurable VPNs that also are interoperable with many common
commercial VPN implementations. If you wish to experiment on a
low-maintenance firewall-VPN gateway, then the package discussed
here might be ideal for you.</p><p>This article shows you how to set up, at minimal expense, a
working VPN gateway that uses the IETF's (Internet Engineering Task
Force) IPSec (internet protocol security) specification. IPSec is
an open standard and is supported by virtually all major firewall
software and hardware vendors, such as Lucent, Cisco, Nortel and
Check Point. This package will give you a widely interoperable
IPSec that uses the de facto standard 3DES encrypted,
MD5-authenticated site-to-site or point-to-site VPN. You should be
able to do this without resorting to a full Linux distribution or
recompiling a standard Linux kernel with a kernel IPSec
module.</p><p>The VPN system we examine here is based on FreeS/WAN
(<a href="http://www.freeswan.org" target="_self">www.freeswan.org</a>), a
portable, open-source implementation of the IPSec specification.
FreeS/WAN has been demonstrated to interoperate, to various
degrees, with Cisco IOS 12.0 and later routers, Nortel Contivity
Switches, OpenBSD, Raptor Firewall, Check Point FW-1, SSH Sentinel
VPN 1.1, F-Secure VPN, Xedia Access Point, PGP 6.5/PGPnet and
later, IRE SafeNet/SoftPK, Freegate 1.3, Borderware 6.0, TimeStep
PERMIT/Gate 2520, Intel Shiva LanRover, Sun Solaris and Windows
2000. The official FreeS/WAN web site has a regularly updated
compatibility list with the latest version of its on-line
documentation. FreeS/WAN version 1.5 is included in this
package.</p><p>I have created a single-diskette distribution that installs
the base configuration of a VPN firewall based on the Linux Router
Project (LRP,
<a href="http://www.linuxrouter.org" target="_self">www.linuxrouter.org</a>),
a compact Linux distribution that can fit on a single, bootable
floppy diskette. The distribution here is essentially Charles
Steinkuehler's Eiger disk image with Steinkuehler's IPSec-enabled
kernel and LRP IPSec package. Firewalling is carried out through
Linux ipchains. This particular version is based on the 2.2.16
kernel of Linux. This distribution is called DUCLING
(Diskette-based Ultra Compact Linux IPSec Network Gateway). Compact
Linux distributions have a twisted history. LRP technically refers
to Dave Cinege's compact distribution. There are many variants
around, including Charles Steinkuehler's distribution (EigerStein)
of Matthew Grant's defunct Eiger version
(<a href="http://lrp1.steinkuehler.net" target="_self">lrp1.steinkuehler.net</a>).
Another such distribution is David Douthitt's Oxygen
(<a href="http://leaf.sourceforge.net/content.php?menu=900&amp;page_id=1" target="_self">leaf.sourceforge.net/content.php?menu=900&amp;page_id=1</a>).
Also, there is LEAF (Linux Embedded Appliance Firewall), a
developer's umbrella that tries to coordinate releases and
documentation, sort of like a one-stop shop for compact Linux
distributions
(<a href="http://leaf.sourceforge.net" target="_self">leaf.sourceforge.net</a>).
I use the term LRP to refer to the compact Linux distribution
presented here, even though some may consider this terminology
incorrect.</p><p>If you are running MS Windows 9x, the distribution
self-extracts and installs itself onto a standard 3.5",
high-density floppy diskette. You also can write the image to a
boot floppy if you have a system running Linux. Once the extraction
is done, you will need to boot off the floppy disk you have
created, copy the network drivers for your network cards over and
edit the appropriate configuration files. That's it&mdash;no creating
and formatting disk partitions or messing with boot managers on
your hard drive. If you are not happy with the distribution, just
pop the diskette out, throw it away (or reformat it) and reboot
your PC. Check the links on
<a href="http://leaf.sourceforge.net/devel/thc" target="_self">leaf.sourceforge.net/devel/thc</a>
for more information on these options.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19d8580.0x1ad0b88"></a>Background on the Firewall and the VPN</h2></div></div><p>This distribution of LRP uses a standard ipchains-based
firewall. <span   class="bold"><b>ipchains</b></span> (replaced by
iptables in the 2.4 series kernels&mdash;see David A. Bandel's &ldquo;Taming
the Wild Netfilter&rdquo;, <i  >LJ</i>, September 2001) is a
freely distributed packet filter for Linux. It is very instructive
to look through the ipchains HOWTO if you are not familiar with
this firewalling tool. This can be found at
<a href="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/IPCHAINS-HOWTO.html" target="_self">www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/IPCHAINS-HOWTO.html</a>.</p><p>The VPN is provided by FreeS/WAN's implementation of IPSec.
FreeS/WAN's IPSec implementation is compliant with the IETF's IPSec
specification. IPSec is an extension to the Internet Protocol (IP)
that provides for authentication and encryption. Three protocols
are used to handle encryption and authentication, namely ESP
(Encapsulating Security Payload), AH (Authentication Header) and
IKE (the Internet Key Exchange). All these components are included
in the FreeS/WAN implementation of IPSec and generally are
transparent to end users. ESP and AH handle encryption and
authentication, while IKE negotiates the connection parameters,
including the initialization, handling and renewal of encryption
keys. The only encryption scheme currently supported by FreeS/WAN
is 3DES (the triple DES or Data Encryption Standard&mdash;the current de
facto standard for IPSec encryption). Authentication is carried out
using MD5 digests of a so-called shared secret (a shared key). The
shared key could be a mutually agreed-to character string, RSA
cryptographic key pairs or X.509 certificates. FreeS/WAN's KLIPS
(kernel IPSec) component, which is compiled into the Linux kernel,
implements AH, ESP and the handling of packets. IKE processes
handle key negotiation, and renewals are implemented in FreeS/WAN's
standalone pluto d&aelig;mon.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19d8580.0x1ad0df0"></a>Requirements and Installation</h2></div></div><p>First, you will need a PC with a floppy disk drive (I have
tested only 3.5" disk drives) and two network cards in it. The
demands of LRP (the distribution) are minimal and do not require a
powerful PC. Anything that is Intel 486-class or better with more
than 8MB of RAM will do. You also will need two floppy disks.
Reliable, high-density 3.5" floppy disks should do, such as
promotional diskettes from AOL. I have never had any problems with
generic floppy disk drives, but I have found some problems with
writing the distribution to floppy disks with Imation USB U2
SuperDisk drives.</p><p>You will need to download the appropriate DUCLING.tgz/zip
distribution from
<a href="ftp://ftp.cinemage.com/pub" target="_self">ftp.cinemage.com/pub</a>
and extract the contents of the archive file. If you have a static
IP address, then download the static version, and if you are
assigned a dynamic IP address, you will need the distribution with
a DHCP client. If you are running Windows 9x, download
ducling-stat-W9x-1-0.zip or ducling-dyn-W9x-1-0.zip. Extracting the
.tgz file with Winzip
(<a href="http://www.winzip.com" target="_self">www.winzip.com</a>) will
produce a file, ducling-dyn-1-0.exe or ducling-stat-1-0.exe and
directory modules. The .exe file is a self-extracting image that
formats a floppy disk and writes the image to that disk. Run the
ducling-stat-1-0.exe or ducling-dyn-1-0.exe file and place a floppy
disk into the floppy disk drive. Note that any data on the disk
will be overwritten.</p><p>If you are using MS-DOS or Windows 3.1, the TSR utility
FDREAD.EXE must be loaded at the DOS level first if you wish to
read and write to the 1,722KB format disk. FDREAD.EXE is a freeware
program from Christoph H. Hochst&auml;tter.</p><p>If you are running Linux, download ducling-dyn-1-0.tgz or
ducling-stat-1-0.tgz, untar the image (the example here is for the
DHCP-enabled dynamic IP address distribution):</p><pre     class="programlisting">
tar xvfz ducling-dyn-1-0.tgz
</pre><p>and write the image file, ducling-1-0.img, to a formatted
floppy using the Linux fdformat and dd commands:
<pre     class="programlisting">
fdformat /dev/fd0u1722
dd if=ducling-dyn-1-0.ima of=/dev/fd0u1722
</pre>


Once the floppy disk image is created as mentioned above, you will
have a bootable Linux floppy diskette.
</p><p>The zipfile/directory named modules contain the required
network driver modules as well as optional modules for firewall
masquerading. Copy the contents of the module zipfile or directory
onto a separate second MS-DOS-formatted floppy diskette for the
configuration portion of this discussion (below). In Linux, format
a second floppy disk by running</p><pre     class="programlisting">
fdformat /dev/fd0
</pre><p>followed by
<pre     class="programlisting">
mkdosfs /dev/fd0
</pre>


and mounting the floppy drive and copying the modules over. Read
the documentation included in the README files, which will give you
details on configuring your firewall/router.
</p><p>If you are unable to fit all the desired packages and modules
onto a single floppy diskette, you will need to examine alternative
setups that use dual floppy diskettes (see the included README
files with the DUCLING distribution), a bootable CD-ROM or even a
small hard disk. Refer to the on-line sources of LRP documentation
for further information.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19d8580.0x1ad1370"></a>The LRP Boot Floppies&mdash;The Surprising
Truth</h2></div></div><p>You may be surprised to discover that LRP uses DOS-formatted
floppies. You may be even more surprised to discover that the
DUCLING distribution installs itself as a 1,722KB bootable disk
image. The 3.5" high-density floppy is technically a 2MB format
medium, and you may see these diskettes rated as 2MB &ldquo;raw&rdquo; or
&ldquo;unformatted&rdquo; capacity. The 1,440KB formatted capacity is merely
the result of a conventional format that writes 80 tracks on the
magnetic media with 18 sectors per track. With the appropriate
tools, you can create diskettes that have 80 sectors and 24 tracks
per sector, giving 1,920KB per floppy. Floppies having 1,680KB
(80/21 sector/tracks per sector) are used regularly for LRP
distributions and seem to have a reliable track record; 1,722KB
(82/21), 1,743KB (83/21) and 1,760KB (80/22) also are reported to
be in use. I have found the 1,722KB format floppy to be reliable
enough for testing and have no problems to report so far.</p><p>I have created and used large-format floppies of up to
1,920KB. Extremely large-format floppies tend to be nonbootable,
apparently as a result of a conflict between PC BIOSes and the
nonstandard sector size on the diskette. It has been reported that
large-format floppies larger than 1,680KB can suffer from floppy
disk hardware dependability problems. Windows NT and Windows 2000
are reported to have reliability problems writing to large-format
floppies larger than 1,680KB.</p><p>MS Windows 9x operating systems generally read standard as
well as large-format floppy diskettes with no configuration
changes. In Linux systems, it is often necessary to mount the
floppy disk with the correct format specified, i.e., /dev/fd0u1722,
where fd0u1722 specifies floppy disk device 0 (fd0) and the u1722
specifies a 1,722KB format. The standard floppy disk drive in Linux
/dev/fd0 defaults to /dev/fd0u1440, the 1,440KB format.</p><p>For creating and manipulating large-format floppies, consult
the LRP Boot Disk HOWTO by Paul Batozech. You'll find this, and
other useful articles, in the resources listed at
<a href="http://leaf.sourceforge.net/devel/thc" target="_self">leaf.sourceforge.net/devel/thc</a>.
For MS Windows, I have found Gilles Vollant's WinImage
(<a href="http://www.winimage.com" target="_self">www.winimage.com</a>) to
be particularly useful and user friendly. However, it is in some
ways more limited than the Linux tools, such as fdformat, mkdosfs
and the more recent superformat application. The self-extracting
1,722KBps images for MS Windows discussed here were created using
WinImage.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19d8580.0x1ad1630"></a>How the LRP Distribution Loads</h2></div></div><p>Before you begin to work with LRP it is useful to note how
the distribution works. If you examine the bootable diskette, you
will see a series of files, including ldlinux.sys, linux,
syslinux.cfg, root.lrp, etc.lrp, modules.lrp and local.lrp.</p><p>The file ldlinux.sys is the bootstrap loader that loads the
kernel (the file named linux) and initial root.lrp package into
memory. The kernel starts and creates a RAM disk and extracts the
root.lrp package. A RAM disk is a portion of memory that is
allocated as a partition. In other words, the kernel creates a
space in memory and treats it like a read/write disk. The kernel
then mounts the boot device specified in syslinux.cfg. The
remaining .lrp packages on the boot disk are extracted as specified
in syslinux.cfg and loaded to the RAM disk. The .lrp packages are
merely standard UNIX tarballs (tar-gzipped archives). Once the .lrp
packages are installed in the directory tree on the RAM disk, the
system begins a boot based on the standard Linux rc file boot
hierarchy.</p><p>LRP is simply a stripped-down standard Linux kernel with
loadable modules and other software contained in sets of .lrp
packages. LRP is truly Linux; generally, anything that will run on
a generic Linux distribution should run off the LRP diskette. Often
the obstacle to extending LRP's applications and capabilities is
the space constraint of a single diskette. If you require
additional capabilities, for example, remote administration through
ssh, a DNS server and so on, you will want to look at
multidiskette, CD-ROM or even the full disk drive distributions of
LRP that are available.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19d8580.0x1ad17e8"></a>Start up and Configuration of Router/Firewalling
VPN</h2></div></div><p>Once the bootable floppy disk is created, make sure the
floppy is placed in the floppy disk drive of the machine on which
you wish to run the firewall/VPN. Ensure that the BIOS is
configured to boot from a floppy disk. Upon booting the
firewall/VPN, you will see the LRP splash screen, messages from the
Linux loader followed by a login prompt.</p><p>If you have made it this far, congratulations! You have
installed an LRP distribution successfully. Now you can start to
configure the firewall properties of the LRP as outlined in the
bundled documentation.</p><p>Once any firewalling tweaks are completed, the VPN needs to
be configured. The bundled DUCLING documentation discusses the
details for configuring a subnet-to-subnet setup. This involves
configuring IPSec's authentication mode (/etc/ipsec.secrets), the
IPSec network configuration (/etc/ipsec.conf) as well as the
firewalling rules to allow access to ports 500 (UDP), 50 and 51
(TCP).</p><p>Note that you need not necessarily require a static IP
address in order to run VPN links. A &ldquo;roadwarrior&rdquo; configuration is
described in the next section, in which the one VPN client has an
undetermined static IP address. I have run VPNs between pairs of
nodes with dynamically assigned IP addresses. The management of VPN
nodes with DHCP-assigned IP addresses becomes tricky if both IP
address assignments change frequently. The following section
discusses a roadwarrior configuration using DUCLING and a
Microsoft-based IPSec client.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19d8580.0x1ad19f8"></a>Interoperability Example</h2></div></div><p>This example shows an MS Windows 9x/2000 client point-to-site
using SSH Communications Security Sentinel 1.1 (Public Beta 3).
FreeS/WAN is interoperable with a wide range of IPSec
implementations. The ease of implementation and computability will
vary depending on the product. Many IPSec products that support
3DES/MD5 encryption through IKE are interoperable with FreeS/WAN.
However, I found that legally obtaining fully functional IPSec
implementations that support strong encryption can be arduous,
especially if you live outside of the United States.</p><p>Many vendors offer only limited capabilities in their freely
available IPSec implementations. For example, a product may only
support weak encryption (DES) or may limit VPN capabilities to
transport mode only. It is important to distinguish between the two
VPN modes that are offered through IPSec: transport mode and tunnel
mode. Transport mode encrypts and authenticates traffic between two
fixed end points. Tunnel mode is more useful for connecting subnets
and allows tunneling through firewall and router parameters into
different subnets. Basically, transport mode restricts traffic to
point-to-point communication. Tunnel mode also allows point-to-site
(point-to-subnet) or site-to-site communications. At least one
vendor does not seem to allow its implementation of IPSec to run
over a connection using a static IP address.</p><p>The SSH Communications Security Sentinel product
(<a href="http://www.ipsec.com" target="_self">www.ipsec.com</a>) does not
seem to suffer from any of these problems, possibly due to the fact
that the company is based outside of the US. I downloaded and
tested the 30-day trial beta 3 release of Sentinel 1.1 and found it
to be very easy to configure on a Windows 98 desktop PC. The
Sentinel documentation provides configuration examples for
interconnectivity with a FreeS/WAN VPN gateway.</p><p>Here is a summary of a roadwarrior configuration that allows
remote users with dynamically assigned IP addresses to connect
transparently to a LAN behind a firewall. You will need to open
ports 50, 51 (TCP) and port 500 (UDP) to the dynamic IP address or
the ISP's DHCP address range. Figure 1 shows the basic setup. You
will need to edit /etc/network.conf on the DUCLING FreeS/WAN
firewall (go into lrcfg, choose 1), then 1) and set</p><pre     class="programlisting">
eth0_IP_SPOOF=NO
</pre><p>to disable the blocking of tunneled packets. The bundled
documentation contains the detailed instructions on how to do these
tasks.

the FreeS/WAN-Windows connections sometimes. If this happens, go to
the FreeS/WAN gateway and do a restart of IPSec and then bring up
the various connections.

VPN gateway from a single 3.5" floppy diskette. With a single
floppy diskette, you should be able to connect hosts and networks
of various topologies securely using the Internet. The DUCLING
distribution is a bare-bones distribution. Once you are convinced
that a FreeS/WAN VPN can fulfill your needs, you can look at either
going to a more full-featured LRP distribution or even a full-blown
Linux system, implementing such things as remote access (via the
secure shell, ssh, for example) or a DNS server.</p><p><a href="4772s1.html" target="_self">Troubleshooting
