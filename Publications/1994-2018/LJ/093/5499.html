to set up a VNC-based X Window System desktop for your Linux
system. By the end of this two-part series, you'll have a
configuration that allows users to log in to their X-Window desktop
(running GNOME, KDE or other preferred window manager environment)
via a display manager (like GDM, KDM or XDM). More importantly, the
user will have secure access to the same desktop in the same state
from the workstation console and anywhere else on a network.
</p><p>Typically, a workstation system runs a display manager. In
this article we refer to such applications as XDM, GDM (GNOME
Display Manager) or KDM (KDE Display Manager) generically as
display managers. A display manager provides a graphical login
prompt for the user. When a user logs in, the display manager
starts the appropriate window manager (such as fvwm2, GNOME or
KDE). From the window manager, the user can run whichever
applications he or she wishes. When the user logs out, applications
are closed, the window manager exits and the display manager
reappears, ready to allow another user to log in. If the same user
logs in again, the display manager starts the window manager anew,
and all the applications must be restarted. This is how traditional
X Window System desktops work. We refer to such a desktop session
as an X desktop. We also say that when a user is using the keyboard
and monitor of the workstation, he or she is logging in to the
console. This is as opposed to connecting via the network.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="5499f1.large.jpg"><img src="5499f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. A Display Manager
</p></div></div><p>In the <i  >Linux Journal</i> article titled
&ldquo;Virtual Network Computing&rdquo; by Choong Ng [available at
<a href="../000/4840.html" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com</a> ], we
learned how to set up VNC in order to allow stateful access to a
desktop from any computer on the network. By stateful, I mean that
when a user is not connected to the desktop, the desktop does not
terminate but remains waiting for a user to reconnect. When the
user connects to the VNC server using a VNC client, every window is
in the place where it was last left, every application is still in
the same state as when last used, and every opened file remains
opened in the same position. The nature of the VNC server, which
controls the window manager and the applications, permits
this.</p><p>Therefore, any computer on the network can run a VNC client
(such as vncviewer) to connect to the workstation and display the
desktop. We even could run the VNC client on the workstation on
which the VNC server is running. We refer to such desktop sessions
as VNC desktops, and we refer to the workstation where we run the
VNC server (and its window manager) as the VNC workstation.</p><p>There is one problem with VNC desktops. Suppose you want to
log in to the console of the VNC workstation. Your VNC desktop is
running on this workstation as well, the same one you connect to
from many different computers on the network. You want to continue
to have access to the VNC desktop via the network. At the same
time, when you log on to the console via a display manager, you
want to see the same desktop you see when you connect via VNC. But
if you log in to the workstation via the display manager, it will
start a new window manager. Basically, you have started a new X
desktop, one which is independent of the VNC desktop, already
running on this workstation.</p><p>If you want to connect to the VNC desktop, you must run a VNC
client, such as vncviewer. This is awkward due to the fact that one
window of the X-based desktop is itself another desktop (the VNC
desktop). Keeping track of the many levels of redirection can be
troublesome. Besides being confusing, due to ambiguity as to what
desktop the user is actually using, it also is inefficient as it
requires two window managers to run concurrently, when only one is
needed.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="5499f2.large.jpg"><img src="5499f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 2. Screenshot of an X Desktop Running
vncviewer, Displaying a VNC Desktop</p></div></div>
</p><p>This article explains how to configure an X server, display
manager and a VNC server so that the desktop one sees when logging
in to the display manager is the VNC desktop, with no second window
manager and with all files and applications in the same state as
they were last left.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf55580.0x104de48"></a>Prerequisites</h2></div></div><p>The scheme we discuss can work on any Linux distribution. It
requires a working X server, a display manager and VNC. I checked
for these packages with this command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
rpm -q XFree86 vnc XFree86-xdm kdebase gdm
</pre><p>It is only necessary to have either XFree86-xdm kdebase or
gdm installed. I should note that all the configuration file
locations discussed in this article are as shipped with Red Hat
7.1. It is possible to configure any Linux system to allow
transparent VNC desktops, but you may have to download software or
locate configuration files if they are in different locations.
</p><p>Whatever display manager you prefer, it should start at boot
time. This is usually accomplished with a line in /etc/inittab
similar to this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
x:5:respawn:/etc/X11/prefdm -nodaemon
</pre><p><span   class="bold"><b>prefdm</b></span> is usually a copy of
a link to whatever display manager you prefer. X and your preferred
display manager must be up and running.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf55580.0x104e160"></a>Configuring a VNC Server</h2></div></div><p>The VNC server also must be running, and it must be
configured to run your preferred window manager. This is
accomplished by editing the file $HOME/.vnc/xstartup to call your
preferred window manager. Use <b  >startkde &amp;</b> for
KDE, <b  >gnome-session &amp;</b> for GNOME or
<b  >fvwm2 &amp;</b> for FVWM2. Also, make sure you have
run <b  >vncpasswd</b> in $HOME/.vnc/passwd to create the
password file.</p><p>Red Hat 7.1 provides an easy way to start up the VNC desktop
at boot time. Use <b  >linuxconf</b> to set the vncserver
boot script (in /etc/init.d/vncserver) to come up at boot. The
default bootscript, however, doesn't quite give me the flexibility
that I'd prefer. Edit /etc/init.d/vncserver, looking for the line
that says</p><pre     class="programlisting">
"su - ${display##*:} -c \"cd &amp;&amp; [ -f .vnc/passwd ]
&amp;&amp; vncserver :${display%%:*}\""
</pre><p>Change it to look like this:
<pre     class="programlisting">
"su - ${display##*:} -c \"cd &amp;&amp; [ -f .vnc/passwd ]
&amp;&amp; vncserver ${ARGS} :${display%%:*}\""
</pre>


Then edit /etc/sysconfig/vncservers so that it looks like this:
<pre     class="programlisting">
# The VNCSERVERS variable is a list of
# display:user pairs.
#
# Uncomment the line below to start a VNC server on
# display :1 as my 'myusername' (adjust this to your
# own). You will also need to set a VNC password;
# run 'man vncpasswd' to see how to do that.
#
# DO NOT RUN THIS SERVICE if your local area network
# is untrusted! For a secure way of using VNC, see
# &lt;URL:<a href="http://www.uk.research.att.com/vnc/sshvnc.html" target="_self">www.uk.research.att.com/vnc/sshvnc.html</a>&gt;.
VNCSERVERS="1:jdimpson"
ARGS="-geometry 1024x768 -alwaysshared "
</pre>


Change the value &ldquo;1024x768&rdquo; in ARGS to represent the size of your
actual X desktop. Add any other VNC server arguments that you wish
to this ARGS variable. Change jdimpson in VNCSERVERS to whatever
user you wish to run the VNC Desktop. The value &ldquo;1&rdquo; in VNCSERVERS
makes the VNC server run as display 1. You can have additional
desktops come up like this:
<pre     class="programlisting">
VNCSERVERS="1:jdimpson 2:phred 3:sysadmin"
</pre>


On a Red Hat system, make sure the VNC server is running by
executing this:
<pre     class="programlisting">
/etc/init.d/vncserver start
</pre>


At this point, you can connect to the VNC Desktop using any VNC
client.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf55580.0x104e6e0"></a>Configuring the Display Manager</h2></div></div><p>On my Red Hat 7.1 system, I created a file called
$HOME/.xsession. This file says which program, usually a window
manager, should be run when I log in through a display manager.
When logging in, the display manager checks for the existence of
this file. If it exists, the display manager will then run the
program listed in the file. The display manager considers this file
to contain the command to start the user's desired window manager.
Instead of running a window manager like GNOME or KDE, however,
we'll run the VNC client. Edit $HOME/.xsession so that it looks
like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
exec vncviewer -passwd $HOME/.vnc/passwd
-fullscreen localhost:1
</pre><p>If you are using another Linux distribution, it is highly
likely that the same mechanism will work for you, but you should
double-check. One quick way to check is to put the line
<pre     class="programlisting">
exec fvwm2
</pre>


in this file (assuming fvwm2 is loaded on your system). When
logging in to the display manager, if fvwm2 starts up, then you
have success. If not, you'll have to dive into the documentation
for your system or the configuration file; try understanding what
/etc/X11/xdm/Xsession does.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf55580.0x104e8f0"></a>Login</h2></div></div><p>Log in to the display manager login window. You will be
presented with your preferred desktop.</p><p>When you log in to the server using the display manager, it
will be replaced by your chosen window manager running under the
VNC server. If you have another computer on the same network,
trying using the VNC client to connect to your server. You should
see <span   class="emphasis"><em>two</em></span> copies of your desktop. When you move
a window using one computer, you will see the window move on the
other, too.</p><p>If, after logging into the display manager, the screen
flickers and the display manager login banner returns, then
something went wrong. Make sure vncserver is running, and make sure
the .xsession file is correct.</p><p>Notice that in this setup you should not use any logout
feature that may be part of your window manager. Doing so will end
the VNC desktop, which is probably not what you want to do.
Instead, just press Ctrl-Alt-Backspace to kill the X server. You'll
see the display manager return to the screen. If you log back in,
you'll be right where you left off. So you can turn the console
over to someone else but not lose your desktop state.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf55580.0x104eb58"></a>What's Happening?</h2></div></div><p>When the server boots, it will run the VNC server for each
user in the /etc/sysconfig/vncservers file. As it starts up, the
VNC server reads the .xsession file in your home directory and will
use it to run your preferred window manager. Then the VNC server
will simply sit in RAM, waiting for a connection (either a local
connection or one from over the network).</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="5499f3.large.jpg"><img src="5499f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. The Whole Process
</p></div></div><p>The display manager also starts up at boot time, which
presents you with a graphical login banner.</p><p>A user who does not have the VNC server configured, and who
does not have the proper .xsession file in his or her home
directory, will get a normal X desktop when logging in to the
display manager. A user with all of these things configured will
get the VNC desktop and also will be able to access the VNC desktop
from anywhere on the network. Doing so securely, however, is a tale
for the next article.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf55580.0x1447118"></a>Drawbacks and Other Options</h2></div></div><p>The setup I've described here has many advantages. For me,
the primary advantage is the ability to access my desktop's state
from any computer at work, which is nice if I'm on the other side
of the site with a half hour between meetings, and I want to check
my e-mail or my calendar.</p><p>A major drawback of using VNC as your default desktop is that
you lose graphical performance. For example, playing movies on your
VNC desktop is slow, due to long redraw delays. Most fast-action
games are slow as well. Also, when the VNC server runs, it acts
like an X server to all the applications that you run, but it is
not accelerated in any way. Even if your true X server is
accelerated, you won't be able to take advantage of it. (You can
log out, log in as a different user, play the movie or the game,
log out when finished, then log in again as your normal user. Your
original desktop will be sitting there just like you left
it.)</p><p>This configuration doesn't scale well for multiple users. You
could define many VNC sessions in the /etc/sysconfig/vncservers
file to start up at boot. But all of these VNC desktops will be
idle until they are used. And for each VNC desktop, a VNC server is
run, a window manager is run and, in the case of GNOME or KDE, many
auxiliary applications are run. All of these take up RAM, and they
may compete with each other for resources like the sound card.
Similar commercial solutions like Citrix MetaFrame and Microsoft
Terminal Server call for seriously powerful computers to support
many users, and I'd guess this solution would work just as well on
such hardware.</p><p>One alternative solution is to use XDMCP, which is how the
traditional X world provides remote X access (&agrave; la X
terminals). But in doing so you lose statefulness because the
desktop is restarted every time a connection is made to the server,
and you lose the ability to share the same desktop both remotely
and locally. See the documentation for your display manager (xdm,
gdm or kdm) or
<a href="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/XDMCP-HOWTO" target="_self">www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/XDMCP-HOWTO</a>
for more information.</p><p>Another solution is to run VNC out of inetd/xinetd, using the
-inetd option. Doing so, however, causes the VNC server to start
anew for every connection, disallows multiple connections to one
desktop and shuts down after the original connection exits. So it
loses statefulness and the ability to share the desktop both
remotely and locally. See the VNC server documentation for more
information.</p><p>Another option is x0rfbserver. This is an application that
you run in your normal X desktop that will relay the contents of
the desktop to a VNC client. It works well and will let you take
full advantage of any accelerated video cards that your X server
supports. It also is less RAM-demanding than running an X server
plus a VNC server (it only requires an X server, besides the
x0rfbserver itself, which is fairly small). But it requires that
you always keep your X desktop running on the console, so it will
not scale for multiple users. See
