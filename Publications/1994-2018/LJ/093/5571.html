    An interview with Wild Bill Goldsmith of KPIG and Radio Paradise.
    </p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="5571f1.jpg"></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19b7580.0x1aaf558"></a></h2></div></div><p> KPIG is an anomaly. It's a top-rated
commercial radio station programmed entirely by its own DJs. It's a
serious radio station with a terrific sense of humor. It's as much
a fixture in its community as a statue in front of a
courthouse&mdash;and a lot more fun.
</p><p>The station's format has been described as &ldquo;mutant cowboy
rock and roll&rdquo;, but it's hard to make any label stick on a station
that is more real, more fun and more like-it-oughta-be than (by my
conservative estimate) all the other commercial music stations in
the country put together. Its roots go back to the legendary KFAT,
and beyond that to the KRAB Nebula of loosely affiliated
noncommercial stations out of which &ldquo;community radio&rdquo; and &ldquo;free
form radio&rdquo; evolved in the sixties. It's a history that's as old
and woolly as UNIX's. The resemblance doesn't end there,
either.</p><p>The words free and open are taken seriously by KPIG and its
faithful, who contribute code in the form of original voices,
programming ideas and even musical selections. KPIG is fortuitously
located in (no kidding) Freedom, California, and has one of the
worst signals in the Salinas-Monterey-Santa Cruz market. If you're
in the bowl of mountains that surround Monterey Bay, chances are
you can get it. If you're not, your only choice is to punch up
<a href="http://www.kpig.com" target="_self">www.kpig.com</a> and choose
among a wide selection of streams, including a 128Mb MP3 spigot
that's one of the prettiest-sounding signals that ever poured out
of your speakers.</p><p>KPIG was the first commercial radio station to broadcast on
the Web, and it has blazed trails ever since. This last spring,
when AFTRA decided its commercial talent should be paid as much as
300% extra for commercials going out over the Net, thousands of
commercial stations shut down their streams. KPIG just hacked
around it. When the national ads come on, webstream listeners get
pleasant filler.</p><p>To the constant astonishment of everybody but the station and
its listeners, KPIG consistently manages to sit near the top of the
local Arbitron ratings, despite its second-rate signal. It is, by
all measures, a success. It is also full of open-source
technologies that are in a good position to burn down &ldquo;broadcasting
as usual if the right hackers and serious radio fanatics get their
hands on it. That's the idea behind what you're reading right
now.</p><p>KPIG's hacker in chief is &rdquo;Wild Bill&ldquo; Goldsmith, a KPIG
veteran going back to KFAT. He's now living full-time in (no
kidding) Paradise, California, where he has steadily improved his
own solo effort, Radio Paradise, alongside KPIG. I decided to get
in touch with Bill after I received e-mail raves about Radio
Paradise almost simultaneously from friends in Seattle, New York
and North Carolina. The sources were old radio pros who have since
moved on to other professions but know the real thing when they
hear it.</p><p>It was clear from a quick look at both KPIG and Radio
Paradise that the stations were up to something more than radically
good radio programming. Technically, both were easily customizable
hacks built on open-source software and generic hardware.
Specifically, Bill had put together what appeared to be a tightly
integrated system that involved the music library, the web site,
the whole audio chain, accounting, operations and scriptable
tie-ins to potentially money-making partnerships with anybody who
wanted to cross-promote anything, including stores, artists, labels
or whatever&mdash;in a way that allowed as much live operation or
automation as one saw fit.</p><p>This appeals to me. I'm a radio freak going back to my
childhood, when I was a ham radio operator (even today the only
code I know is Morse). My nickname, Doc, is the fossil remnant of
the name I used on the air when I worked at WDBS, a KFAT-like
station in North Carolina back in the seventies. Commercial radio
today is a snatched body that bears only superficial resemblance to
anything anybody loved in its golden age. Revitalizing radio is
also a passion I share with Phil Hughes, <i  >Linux Journal</i>'s chief geek and publisher, an old radio hand
who fondly recalls KRAB's golden days in Seattle.</p><p>When I wrote and asked Bill exactly what he was hacking
together at the two stations, he wrote this back:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>It's based on a set of software tools&mdash;for
picking and scheduling music and doing voice tracks from anywhere
over the Net, and for accepting and organizing listener feedback on
my playlist. Everything I'm doing software-wise is 100% open
source: Linux, PHP, Perl, Postgres and Icecast.
</p><p>I am convinced that what you see at
<a href="http://www.radioparadise.com" target="_self">www.radioparadise.com</a>
represents the future of radio, or of quality radio, anyway: very
interactive, tightly controlled artistically (no random segues,
everything happens for a reason), completely free from the
influences of the radio/music industry hype machine (to the best of
my ability, anyway) and supported primarily by voluntary
contributions from listeners.</p><p>This isn't a game plan that's going to make anyone rich. But
it can make it possible for anyone with talent to make a very
comfortable living without compromising their integrity in any
way&mdash;and that's all I for one have ever wanted.</p></blockquote></div><p>I suggested an interview and he agreed. We talked in late
October, right after he finished putting up the latest KPIG web
site.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span> Hey, I like the new
site. The Webcast links and the current song list are right up
front. And I like the webloggy thing going on in the center of the
page too. Makes it all very live. Very radio.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Bill</b></span> It should be more
webloggy-looking very soon, after the staff at the station takes it
over.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span> I've thought for a long
time that the Linux and open-source development community could do
something fun to blow commercial radio out of the water. Now it
looks to me like you're doing the pioneering work here. Are your
tracks in the snow the ones we should follow?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Bill</b></span> I really think so. What
I'm doing with the stations I'm working with is gradually evolving
toward a complete open-source package for programming, managing and
scheduling a radio station, with an integrated web site to go along
with it. Basically everything that makes it possible to do what you
see on the screen there at
<a href="http://KPIG.com" target="_self">KPIG.com</a> is all done with
open-source stuff. There is not one lick of proprietary software in
there anywhere.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span> Give me a rundown of
what I'm looking at when I visit the KPIG site. How is the content
organized and served up here?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Bill</b></span> Basically what builds
the page is Apache running on a Linux box. It pulls a lot of stuff
dynamically out of an SQL database in Postgres. And it also pulls
in a lot of bits and pieces&mdash;little snippets of HTML that are built
by scripts. An example of that is the Now Playing box. What you see
there is a snippet of code that actually is written by the
automation system that the DJs are using to choose and play back
the music, which is another Linux server running the same kind of
software. The DJ is looking at a private web page, by which they
control what goes out on the stream.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span> In other words, the disc
jockey has an internal web page that works as a control console.
It's interactive in some way.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Bill</b></span> Yes. They use that to
pick and schedule the music. The screen looks like any other radio
station automation system. It doesn't even look like a web page.
Most of them don't even know that they're looking at a web page. I
run it in full-screen mode. They use this screen to control the
server that does the audio playback, which they can program in
advance. They can preview what all the segues are going to sound
like, right down to the nth degree. And then they can walk away.
You could&mdash;though we never would&mdash;run a completely automated
station this way. The capabilities are there. I use it that way for
Radio Paradise and for Smooth Jazz
(<a href="http://www.smoothjazz.com" target="_self">www.smoothjazz.com</a>).</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span> Smooth Jazz is yours
too?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Bill</b></span> The technology of it or
the back end: the automation and the piece that builds the web
site.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span> So this back end is
writing scripts all over the place?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Bill</b></span> Okay, when the DJ hits
the button to start something, or the system starts something on
its own because it's been programmed to do that by the DJ, it not
only starts the music playback but also writes a new little Now
Playing page. That song in the Now Playing slot moves down to the
top of the next three. A total of four songs are listed: the song
now playing and the most recent three. Each has its own page. The
system also writes the page that you see when you click on
Playlist, which is a history of what's been playing for the last
six hours. Those actually are done on a separate machine and then
FTPed over to the web server and included in the main page.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span> Does all the music have
to be on a hard drive somewhere?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Bill</b></span> No. Most of it will be,
but there are exceptions. At KPIG if the jock wants to play
something not in the database, he can type in the title so the
system will display it.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span> And everything you're
hearing on KPIG is MP3?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Bill</b></span> They're high band rate
MP3s. Mostly 256Kb. Some are 192. All are played out of a Linux box
using a $90 sound card. The whole hardware cost for one of these
operations is about $600. It's really cheap, which is why a
business can be built around it. But it would be a specialized
business: serious next-generation radio.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span> I've been amazed at how
little the public and noncommercial stations use MP3 as an encoding
and transmission system on the Web. Most of them use Real and a few
use Windows Media Player. Yet that seems like it would be more
expensive to me. Is it just because they don't know better?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Bill</b></span> Yeah.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span> It's just
branding.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Bill</b></span> It's probably 80-90%
branding. Setting up a free Real server is easy for somebody to do
if they're not interested in serving more than 20 people at a time.
But there's nothing serious going on there. Okay, say 95% branding.
And inertia. A lot of people started with Real back when it was the
best choice and have stuck with it because they've had no real
reason to switch. But man, if I was paying for a server license for
a Real server, I'd drop that for MP3 or QuickTime or something else
that was free. It's nearly impossible to recoup even the bandwidth
costs downstream.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span> Is there an advantage to
Real at any of the different speeds?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Bill</b></span> Real's latest codecs
are much more optimized for low bit rates than MP3 is. They do have
a quality advantage at bit rates below about 32k. That's the 5%.
But the difference isn't that extreme.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span> Is your system in tight
enough shape for you to productize it?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Bill</b></span> I would like to get
this out there. I don't want to sell it as a product. I want it to
be the nucleus of an open-source project. I don't want to be the
Linus of the system, rather I want to use the system. That's why I
built it in the first place. I'm not a programmer by trade. I've
learned enough to build this&mdash;it's a lot of stuff, and I'm happy I
know it&mdash;but it's a little too big for me to handle alone. Others
need to come in and run with it.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span> Have you looked into
putting this up on SourceForge?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Bill</b></span> I'm looking at a number
of options. Right now I'd like somebody to come in from the outside
and check out what we've got here. It's a really big project. It
encompasses all these different activities involved in running a
broadcast operation. It's not a tool for somebody who wants to do
radio as a hobby. It's a tool for people who are serious about
doing high-quality radio by using 21st-century tools.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span> How many people know
what high-quality radio is?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Bill</b></span> In the industry, hardly
anybody. All the people who would be open to doing what I'm talking
about here have long since been driven out of the industry. KPIG is
the exception. If I weren't hooked up with KPIG, I wouldn't have
anything to do with commercial radio. I'd be off doing my own
thing.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span> KPIG breaks the mold in
a lot of ways.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Bill</b></span> Our staff is huge by
medium-market radio standards. We have live DJs 24 hours a day.
Nobody has that. Even in San Francisco you don't see that. Not
anymore.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span> You stream a wide
selection, but you're basically about MP3s. Is that because just
about everybody with a computer and a love of music has an MP3
player of some kind?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Bill</b></span> The penetration isn't
quite as high as for Real or Windows Media Player. But Real does a
fine job of playing MP3 streams, too. In any case, the number of
people out there who have Real, or Winamp or iTunes is pretty
high.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span> We're reviewing Apple's
OS X here, which sits on Darwin, a form of BSD. And the default MP3
player shipping with it is iTunes, which comes with a tuner that
demonstrates how hard it is to categorize stations. It's also fed
by something called the Kerbango database. (Kerbango is the late
embedded Linux radio company that was absorbed by 3Com and killed
off early this year.)</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Bill</b></span> Apple hired a friend of
mine who was a former Kerbango employee to maintain the iTunes
database as a part-time project. He has KPIG under &rdquo;Americana&ldquo; and
Radio Paradise under &rdquo;Alt/Modern Rock&ldquo;. It used to be under
&rdquo;Americana&ldquo;, but I told him to change it.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span> Who is going to be doing
serious radio and is there a business in it?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Bill</b></span> I think this is a nice
small-scale business for one person who has a wide-ranging skill
set&mdash;or for a small group of people. If it's done right, an on-line
radio station at this point in time could probably support a staff
of two or three people working full-time.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span> What's the revenue
model?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Bill</b></span> At this point the major
revenue source for all the successful operations I know about is
listener donations.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span> The public radio
model.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Bill</b></span> Yes. And it's much more
applicable to this situation than the commercial radio model, which
any number of people have tried to come in and make work on-line
and failed at. As long as there is commercial-free competition,
there is no reason anyone will want to listen to something that has
advertising in it, unless it was spectacularly better than the
alternative. And nobody's coming in and doing things that are
spectacularly better.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span> Seems to me the best
on-line stations, like the best over-the-air stations&mdash;few as there
are&mdash;sound like somebody who knows their stuff, playing their
record collection for you.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Bill</b></span> Which is the old
underground FM radio system.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span> Not many people have
observed that the fundamental flaw with commercial radio is that
its customers and consumers are different populations. That's a
disadvantage noncommercial broadcasting does not have. The
listeners are the customers. And on the Net it's easy to put out a
pay jar so people can compensate the broadcaster for the service.
Can't do that with a car radio.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Bill</b></span> That payment system
seems to work remarkably well at Radio Paradise.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span> How?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Bill</b></span> Here's my experience.
For about a year or so people would occasionally write me and say
&rdquo;Hey, I'd like to pay for this. Do you accept donations?&ldquo; And I'd
always write back and say, &rdquo;No, no. Keep your money.&ldquo; Until one day
my wife and I were sitting around trying to figure how the hell
we're going to pay for all this. And we said, &rdquo;Y'know, people have
been offering to give us money. Wonder what would happen if we made
that possible?&ldquo; So we put up the link and did a very, very low-key
promotion&mdash;maybe once or twice a day on the stream&mdash;and a little
blurb in the news section of the web site and a little link down at
the bottom of the page. In the first month we got about $2,000 in
donations. Which is about $2,000 more than we made the month
before. Now we've got a target of $3,000, and we get about
$3,000-$3,500 every month, plus another $300-$400 in affiliate
program stuff, like with CDNOW.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span> Since when?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Bill</b></span> May.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span> And that covers
you?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Bill</b></span> That's enough so I can
drop a number of consulting projects I had been doing.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span> Not bad for being this
early in the game.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Bill</b></span> Yeah. The station is
more or less playing for itself.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span> Will your expenses go
up?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Bill</b></span> We've got a free
bandwidth deal going right now. After that ends the expenses will
probably double, but I think the revenue will double as well. The
audience is growing.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span> Do you collect data on
listeners?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Bill</b></span> We're starting at KPIG.
It's all voluntary for the listeners. The sense is that about 80%
or better are at work. A lot of them are home workers with cable or
DSL accounts. At work is also where people are looking for some
music in the background and they've got a computer sitting there.
They're also mostly in the US, about 80% or so. Quite a few in
Europe. Age range is all over the place, but mostly in the 30s and
40s.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span> What do you make of
Live365, which hosts about 35,000 MP3 streams? It's like this vast
mutant thing that manages to crash for me on three different
platforms.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Bill</b></span> They require that you
use this little pop-up player of theirs. A little JavaScript
thing.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span> But do they demonstrate
a business in brokering individual MP3 streams?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Bill</b></span> I think there is
definitely a market in doing infrastructure for on-line radio.
That's basically what Live365 does. I question their revenue model,
which is advertising. They seem to do almost random in-stream ad
insertions. Their original model, like everyone else's, was to get
rich selling banner ads on their web site once it had a gazillion
visitors. We all know how well that worked.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span> We all could have saved
ourselves a lot of trouble if we read the MUTE buttons on our
remote controls.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Bill</b></span> [Laughter.] Live365
does have new people paying to stream through the service. But they
also have thousands and thousands grandfathered in for free. Radio
Paradise sneaked in under the wire. We're on there too. We probably
grab another 200 listeners at a time that way.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span> How many simultaneous
streams do you run?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Bill</b></span> It tops out at about
800-900. KPIG does about the same. Maybe slightly higher.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span> At what bit rate are
most people listening?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Bill</b></span> On Radio Paradise,
about 600 out of 800 will be listening at 128k.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span> Due mostly to cable and
DSL, I would guess.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Bill</b></span> Yes. 128k streams work
just great on cable and DSL.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span> Isn't there a
fundamental inefficiency involved as that number goes up?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Bill</b></span> Yes, it's incredibly
inefficient, but I don't think that's going to change. And we're at
the point where bandwidth and hardware are so cheap, or headed that
way, that there just isn't that much of a return on reinventing the
whole infrastructure of the Internet to make it more
efficient.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span> Are you worried about
what Disney and RIAA and these other creeps are trying to do with
legislation right now?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Bill</b></span> Yeah. If they get their
way, they will drive people like me out of business. There would be
no way to cost-effectively do what I want to do here.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span> It would be endless
digital rights management everywhere.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Bill</b></span> I can't believe that's
going to work&mdash;that they are going to shoehorn that thing through.
There is just too much standing up against it. The biggest is
reluctance on the part of consumers. They've had too much of a
taste of how it oughta be, with the free exchange of MP3 files, for
them to trade that for anything else.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span> Yet when Napster died,
not that many people cried. They just kind of moved on.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Bill</b></span> Well, there are any
number of alternatives. There's Gnutella, which has a good Linux
client. Mac too. True, none of them are as good as Napster was at
its peak.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span> So you're not
worried.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Bill</b></span> No, I'm really
optimistic.</p></div></div>
