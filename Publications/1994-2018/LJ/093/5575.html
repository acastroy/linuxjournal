    Advice on the ways that patents affect software licenses and the kinds of retaliation clauses you should consider.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19c3580.0x1abb500"></a></h2></div></div><p>Many members of the Open Source community
oppose software patents. Software patents, they say, hinder the
advancement of software art, and as such, counter the beneficial
effects of open and published source code. The risk of infringing a
copyright is much less than the risk of infringing a patent. You
can avoid infringing a copyright by employing good clean-room
practices and writing your own independent version of copyrighted
software. On the other hand, a software patent can stop you from
making, using or selling the patented invention, even if you didn't
copy the inventor's software. This means that you may not be able
to avoid infringing a patent no matter how careful you are. Someone
you never even heard of can inform you that he or she has a patent
and, if you cannot invent around that patented invention, your
open-source project may be stopped dead in its tracks.
</p><p>Like them or not, however, software patents are a reality.
Software patents have been blessed repeatedly by Congress and the
courts, and by the laws of many other countries. Given this
reality, it is important to understand the implications of patents
for software licenses so that you can select a license that meets
your philosophy and goals.</p><p>Consider, from the viewpoint of a licensee of open-source
software, three kinds of patents: 1) patents owned by the software
licensor, 2) patents owned by third parties and 3) patents owned by
the licensee or by the licensee's downstream sublicensees.</p><p>Licensor patents: suppose you took a license for some
open-source software and then discovered that the licensor has a
patent on that software that was not included in the license grant.
Without a license to that patent, you could not make, use or sell
the software. Whenever I review a software license for a licensee,
I make sure there is an express grant &ldquo;under claims of patents now
or hereafter owned or controlled by licensor, to make, use, sell,
offer for sale, have made, and/or otherwise dispose of licensed
software or portions thereof.&rdquo; Many open-source licenses, including
the BSD license, contain no such provision. In those cases, a
patent license may be implied, but I don't recommend relying on an
implied license. Wherever possible, make sure you have an explicit
license to any necessary patents held by the licensor.</p><p>Third-party patents: a software licensor may not be aware of
all patents that apply to its software. Some third party suddenly
may announce that it owns a patent that covers some aspects of the
software. As a licensee of infringing software, you may have to
stop using the software despite the license. To deal with this
situation, proprietary-software licenses often include an indemnity
clause, by which the software licensor indemnifies its licensees
against third-party patent claims, promising to refund license
fees, provide non-infringing versions of the software or obtain
licenses to third-party patents, if third-party patents come to
light. But open-source licenses usually don't contain indemnity
clauses because licensors of open-source software usually do not
collect license fees sufficient to cover the potential costs of the
indemnification. So, for most open-source software, the license is
&ldquo;as is&rdquo; without any warranty of non-infringement. Open-source
licensees beware! The risk of third-party patents is usually borne
by the licensee.</p><p>Licensee patents: the issue of licensee patents is much more
subtle than with licensor and third-party patents. Licensors often
include so-called &ldquo;patent retaliation&rdquo; clauses in their licenses to
prevent licensees from using patents offensively against the
licensor. Because this issue evokes strong feelings that justify
careful discussion, I'm saving that topic for its own column next
month.</p><p>Whatever your philosophy about software patents, it is
important to understand the ways that patents can affect software
licenses. It is not enough just to say &ldquo;I don't like software
patents.&rdquo; Whether you out-license your software to others, or you
in-license other's software for your own use, you should make sure
that the license fairly expresses your own philosophy and goals
relating to patents.</p><p>Legal advice must be provided in the course of an
