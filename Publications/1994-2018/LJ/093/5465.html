    The basics in booting a workstation remotely, the requirements on the network boot kernel and how to configure remote Linux for various applications.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a62580.0x2b5a6b8"></a></h2></div></div><p>Remote Linux refers to Linux workstations
or nodes that do not boot the Linux kernel from local media, but
instead receive their startup instructions over a network,
typically Ethernet. Due to the ease of configuring both the Linux
kernel and the operating system itself, Linux is being customized
to work in many disparate environments, from web serving, to
cluster computing and X servers.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a62580.0x2b5a7c0"></a>Why Remote Linux?</h2></div></div><p>The first question you might be asking yourself is why start
Linux remotely? After all, installing Linux locally is a matter of
sticking in the CD, answering a few questions and going out for a
double latte while the workstation installs. This is true for the
typical single-workstation installation; however, once you start to
manage and install a lot of workstations, particularly in a cluster
or server-farm setting, local media becomes less practical. With
the advent of dense servers from companies like RLX Technologies,
Inc., booting remotely becomes a necessity, as dense servers do not
provide diskette or CD-ROM drives on the nodes. Dense servers
expect to be brought up over the local fast Ethernet connection and
administered remotely. The main advantages of remote Linux
are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Centralized, hands-off administration: while many
installations do have someone on site that can jockey CDs and
diskettes 24/7, there are also many hands-off sites (sites where no
one is physically present at the site for long periods of time). At
these sites, when a programmer is working remotely and needs to
boot a node using a special image that's on local media, he or she
is out of luck until someone is there to load the correct
media.</p></li></ul></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Dense server solution: since the trend is toward
centralized remote administration for clusters and server farms, CD
and diskette drives become rather anachronistic. The very presence
of local media on the nodes means that the nodes must take on a
certain form factor, thereby increasing the minimum size of the
nodes. For higher density node packaging, CD-ROM and diskette
drives are being phased out in certain segments of the
industry.</p></li></ul></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Versatility: sometimes one can fix a problem with a
filesystem that prevents the node from coming up from local media.
For example, you can run fsck on a local hard drive on a remotely
booted machine in order to fix a filesystem problem.</p></li></ul></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Cost and security: why pay for media you don't
need? Some companies are selling workstations without hard drives
and other local media that are intended for use as secure terminal
servers. Secure, in this sense, means that if employees do not have
access to local media on their workstations, it is more difficult
to capture sensitive data.</p></li></ul></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Helps eliminate version skew: in the case where all
workstations are booted remotely from a single kernel image, it
eliminates the problem of updating local media for kernel patches
or enhancements. You can update the single remote kernel image
once, instead of propagating the change to a set of workstation
hard drives or, worse, to their local boot diskettes.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a62580.0x2b5adf0"></a>The Remote Boot Process</h2></div></div><p>The remote boot process mimics the local boot process but
with a few important distinctions. From a logical perspective,
without talking about the services that perform these tasks, this
is basically what happens during the network boot process:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>The node is powered up or reset and conditioned to
boot from the network.</p></li><li><p>The node broadcasts its unique Ethernet MAC
address, looking for a server.</p></li><li><p>The server, previously conditioned to listen for
specific MAC addresses, responds with the correct IP address for
the node. Alternately, the server responds to any broadcast on its
physical network with IP information from a designated range of IP
addresses.</p></li><li><p>The node receives its IP information and configures
its Ethernet adaptor for TCP/IP communications.</p></li><li><p>The node requests a kernel over its newly
configured adaptor.</p></li><li><p>The server responds by sending a network loader to
the client, which will load the network boot kernel.</p></li><li><p>The network boot loader mounts the root filesystem
as read-only.</p></li><li><p>The network loader reads the network boot kernel
sent from the server into local memory and transfers control to
it.</p></li><li><p>The kernel mounts root as read/write, mounts other
filesystems and starts the init process.</p></li><li><p>Init brings up the customized Linux services for
the node, and it comes up completely.</p></li></ol></div><p>From this description, we see that the booting node has
several dependencies on the server: a network boot kernel, a root
filesystem and a method of transporting the kernel and IP
information from the server to the node.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a62580.0x2b5b688"></a>The Basics</h2></div></div><p>To get a node to boot correctly remotely, the server and
client node must cooperate in several well-defined ways. There are
several basic requirements for setting up nodes for remote
booting:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>A well-stocked server: the server must have the
proper services running (we'll talk about those later) that can
provide information required by the remotely booting node.</p></li></ul></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>A method of remote power control: to start the
node's boot sequence, you have to be able to power up or reset the
node. You really cannot rely on the operating system on the node to
be present at this time&mdash;after all, sometimes you need to reset the
node because the operating system crashed.</p></li></ul></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>A network: the nodes all have to have a route,
direct or indirect via a gateway, to the server. We'll only talk
about Ethernet networks here.</p></li></ul></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>A network-bootable Linux kernel: the kernel can be
either compressed or uncompressed, tagged or untagged. Tagged
kernels, discussed later in this article, are used by the Etherboot
solution. Also, see the Etherboot web site in the Resources section
for more information.</p></li></ul></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>A network loader: a method of reading the network
boot kernel from the server and placing it correctly in the memory
of the node.</p></li></ul></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>A filesystem: in the good old days, the filesystem
was served over the network via NFS. With solutions like SYSLINUX,
you actually can provide the entire filesystem via a RAM disk, sent
over the network with the kernel.</p></li></ul></div><p>Now that we have a basic idea of the flow of the remote
booting process and a general list of the client's requirements for
the server, let's discuss in practical terms the options for
providing all these services.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a62580.0x2b526a8"></a>Remote Power Control</h2></div></div><p>Remote power control is a small subset of the available
possible remote hardware functions. Various manufacturers provide
specialized hardware and software with their offerings that provide
robust remote hardware control features, such as monitoring
temperature, fan, power, power controls, BIOS updating, alerts and
so on. The only remote hardware control features we really need in
order to boot the nodes remotely are the ability to power-on and
power-off, although having a reset feature is handy as well.</p><p>To force a network boot, the boot order on the workstation
probably has to be modified. Typically, the boot order is something
like diskette, CD-ROM and then hard drive. Most often, booting over
the network is either not on the boot list at all or at the very
bottom of the list, after the last of the local media. Since most
workstations are shipped with some viable operating system already
installed on the hard drive, a reset or power-on of the node will
boot it from its local hard drive.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a62580.0x2b52808"></a>Ethernet</h2></div></div><p>To do true network booting, you must have an Ethernet adaptor
that is PXE-compliant. PXE is the Preboot eXecution Environment,
part of Intel's Wired for Management (WfM) initiative.
PXE-compliant means that the Ethernet adaptor is able to load and
execute a network loader program from a server prior to bringing
over the kernel itself. Both the BIOS on the node and the firmware
on the Ethernet adaptor must cooperate to support PXE booting. A
PXE-compliant system is capable of broadcasting the adaptor MAC
address, receiving a response from the server, configuring the
adaptor for TCP/IP, receiving a network loader over the network and
transferring control to it.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a62580.0x2b52910"></a>Diskette</h2></div></div><p>Although this is an article about remote Linux, and a
diskette is a local media, there is a hybrid of remote booting that
is so important it must be mentioned. Since many Ethernet
adaptor/node BIOS combinations are not PXE-compliant, an
open-source solution has sprung up: Etherboot. Etherboot provides a
method of creating a boot diskette that contains a simple loader
and an Ethernet device driver. Set the boot list to disk, and when
the client is booted the Etherboot diskette takes over loading the
driver into memory and broadcasting the MAC address, looking for a
server. In the PXE case, the server is conditioned to respond with
a network boot loader; in the Etherboot case, the server must
respond with a tagged network boot kernel. A kernel is tagged by
running the mknbi command against the kernel. (See
<a href="http://etherboot.sourceforge.net/doc/html/mknbi.html" target="_self">etherboot.sourceforge.net/doc/html/mknbi.html</a>
for further information on mknbi.) The point of network booting the
node is to get the kernel into local memory. Regardless of whether
you choose the PXE scenario or the Etherboot scenario, the network
boot path quickly coalesces&mdash;the kernel is in memory and control is
passed to it.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a62580.0x2b52a70"></a>What Is My IP Information? (RARP, BOOTP and
DHCP)</h2></div></div><p>When the client boots over the network, whether using PXE or
from diskette, it will broadcast its MAC address over the LAN,
looking for a server that is conditioned to provide the client's IP
information. This is so the client can configure its Ethernet
adaptor with the correct IP information and continue the rest of
the boot conversation using TCP/IP. There are several methods of
providing the IP information to a broadcasting node: RARP, BOOTP
and DHCP.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a62580.0x2b52b78"></a>RARP</h2></div></div><p>RARP (Reverse Address Resolution Protocol) is the method by
which an adaptor's unique 48-bit Ethernet address (its MAC) is
associated with an IP address. When a client attempts to boot
remotely, it will broadcast its MAC address to all workstations on
the physical network. One or more of the workstations will be
running the RARPD d&aelig;mon, which reads /etc/ethers to make the
association between the 48-bit Ethernet address and an IP address
and responds to the broadcasting client with its shiny new IP
address. After receiving an IP address, the client should initiate
a TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol) request to get its image
(more about that later). The biggest drawbacks to RARP are that it
works only on the local physical network (it's not rebroadcast),
and it supplies only a small bit of information, the client's IP
address.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a62580.0x2b52c80"></a>BOOTP</h2></div></div><p>BOOTP (Bootstrap Protocol) is a distinct improvement over
RARP in that it provides gateway support (booting over a router)
and provides far more information to the booting client. In
addition to the client's IP address, BOOTP provides the address of
the gateway (router), the address of the server, the subnet mask
and the boot file (the bootable image for the client). Note that
there can be one, and only one, IP address assigned to a particular
hardware address.</p><p>The biggest drawback to BOOTP is that it assigns IP addresses
to MAC addresses in a one-to-one relationship&mdash;a specific MAC
address always will be assigned the same IP address. If you think
about the requirements presented by a mobile office and traveling
laptops, this one-to-one relationship proves to be somewhat
limiting. In the mobile office scenario, users travel with their
laptops and need to log in to a central server only occasionally,
to pick up mail or whatever. The rest of the time, their IP address
remains unassigned, which is a terrible waste of an IP address. The
problem of underused IP addresses is addressed nicely by
DHCP.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a62580.0x2b52de0"></a>DHCP</h2></div></div><p>DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) is a logical
successor to BOOTP. In fact, BOOTP is considered somewhat obsolete
and has been largely replaced by DHCP. One reason DHCP has
surpassed BOOTP in popularity is that DHCP supports dynamic address
range assignment, while BOOTP only supports static IP assignment (a
single MAC is always assigned the same IP address). The dynamic IP
assignment facility of DHCP allows IP addresses to be reused among
many nodes. In the mobile office scenario, a node connects to its
network and broadcasts its MAC. The server, running the dhcpd
d&aelig;mon, has allocated a range of IP addresses for mobile nodes
and simply assigns the next IP address in the range to the
broadcasting node. DHCP also manages the longevity of the
IP-address assignment via a DHCP leases file.</p><p>The options to DHCP are myriad and beyond the scope of this
article. For further investigation, consult <span   class="emphasis"><em>The DHCP
Handbook</em></span> by Ralph Droms and Ted Lemon (Pearson Higher
Education, 1999).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a62580.0x2b52f98"></a>Transferring the Kernel and Network
Loader</h2></div></div><p>After getting its IP information and configuring the adaptor
for TCP/IP, the node BIOS typically requests an image over the
network. This clear division of IP assignment and image serving is
deliberate; it allows for IP assignment and image serving to be
potentially served by different machines. TFTP (Trivial File
Transfer Protocol) is just the right tool to transfer the image
from server to client, since TFTP, unlike its heavier-weight cousin
FTP (File Transfer Protocol), does not require a user to log in to
get a file. The primitive security built into TFTP is that, by
default, TFTP only permits transfer of files from the server's
/tftpboot directory. Since this security scheme is fairly well
known among system administrators, only public files are put in
/tftpboot. In the latest version of tftp-hpa, file-access security
was added as well.</p><p>Notice that we've been talking about transferring an
image&mdash;this is because the image can be either a tagged kernel
(Etherboot) or a network loader (PXE). If you use Etherboot, the
diskette boot method, then BOOTP or DHCP should point to a tagged
kernel. If you use true PXE, then BOOTP or DHCP should point to a
network loader. In the PXE case, the network loader is loaded into
memory and then brings over an untagged kernel via TFTP. To use
PXE, the TFTP server must support the &ldquo;tsize&rdquo; TFTP option (RFC
1784, RFC 2349). <span   class="bold"><b>tftp-hpa</b></span>, by H.
Peter Anvin, supports this option and can be obtained at
<a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/network/tftp" target="_self">www.kernel.org/pub/software/network/tftp</a>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a62580.0x2b531a8"></a>Monolithic Kernel</h2></div></div><p>Whether you use the two-step PXE boot process (network loader
and kernel) or the one-step Etherboot process (just a kernel),
eventually the kernel is read into memory on the client and control
is transferred to it. You might be wondering, what are the
differences between a network boot kernel and a typical kernel
built to boot from the local hard drive? The first decision you
have to make is whether the kernel is modular or
monolithic&mdash;meaning no loadable modules. If you've ever built a
Linux kernel, you're aware that features are either selected with
&ldquo;Y&rdquo; (include the feature), &ldquo;N&rdquo; (do not include the feature) or &ldquo;M&rdquo;
(load on demand). If your kernel is monolithic, you cannot have any
M features.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a62580.0x2b532b0"></a>Kernel Flags</h2></div></div><p>Several flags have to be turned on for a monolithic network
boot kernel. First, if you're creating a monolithic kernel, you
need to turn off modules support. In the .config file, you will
see</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#CONFIG_MODULES is not set
</pre><p>and if you're doing a monolithic kernel, you would turn it
off, as in
<pre     class="programlisting">
CONFIG_MODULES=n
</pre>


You must support ext2 filesystems if you intend to create them on
the client or mount them from the server, as in the case of the NFS
root filesystem:
<pre     class="programlisting">
CONFIG_EXT2_FS=y
</pre>


If you intend to use a remote root filesystem, mounted via NFS, you
will need the NFS options:
<pre     class="programlisting">
CONFIG_NFS_FS=y
CONFIG_ROOT_FS=y
</pre>


Since you're going to use Ethernet to boot your remote client, you
must turn on network configuration and, at least, support for the
specific network interface card (NIC) on the client:
<pre     class="programlisting">
CONFIG_NETDEVICES=y
CONFIG_EEXPRESS_PRO100=y
</pre>


Lastly, you must configure the ability to get your IP address via
RARP, BOOTP or DHCP:
<pre     class="programlisting">
CONFIG_IP_PNP_RARP=y
CONFIG_IP_PNP_BOOTP=y
CONFIG_IP_PNP_DHCP=y
</pre>


If you are supplying your root filesystem via a RAM disk, instead
of over NFS (see next section), you'll have to specify the RAM
filesystem options:
<pre     class="programlisting">
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_RAM=y
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_INITRD=y
</pre>


</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a62580.0x2b53678"></a>Modular Kernel</h2></div></div><p>In the modular kernel, you are allowed to use M to select
modules to be loaded on demand by the kernel. Since the modules are
not statically bound in the kernel, there must be a place to load
the modules from when they are needed. The place provided by Linux
to load the kernel modules is the RAM disk. This RAM disk is used
only during the boot process and only to provide the kernel
modules. Another use of the RAM disk, to provide the remote root
filesystem, is outside the scope of this article.</p><p>To demonstrate the use of the modular kernel, we can make
support for the MINIX filesystem modular, to support a MINIX root
filesystem that will be loaded from diskette. To create a modular
kernel, the first thing to do is turn on modular support and
rebuild the kernel:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
CONFIG_MODULES=y
</pre><p>In our example, we're going to provide MINIX support via a
dynamic module, so we'll make that option an M:
<pre     class="programlisting">
CONFIG_MINIX_FS=M
</pre>


After rebuilding the modular kernel and copying it (bzImage) to
/tftpboot, we're going to need a way to load it. Tools like the
open-source SYSLINUX package provide the means to load the modular
kernel and provide the RAM disk. A sample default pxelinux.cfg file
might look like:
<pre     class="programlisting">
DEFAULT bzImage
APPEND vga=extended initrd=minix.gz root=/dev/fd0 ro
PROMPT 1
TIMEOUT 50
</pre>


The configuration file says that the name of the kernel is bzImage,
the RAM disk name will be minix.gz, and the client root will be
loaded from diskette (/dev/fd0).
</p><p>We will have to create a RAM disk that has the MINIX module
(minix.o) on it, as well as insmod (the command to load the MINIX
module), the console device (/dev/console) and linuxrc, the command
that gets called when the RAM disk is invoked. (Refer to the
initrd.txt file, written by Werner Almesberger and Hans Lerman and
distributed as part of the kernel RPM, for a complete description
of how RAM disks work in Linux.) To create the custom RAM disk that
will mount the MINIX modular dynamically, and MINIX root filesystem
from diskette, you must create a file and zero it out using
dd:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
dd if=/dev/zero of=minixroot bs=1k count=4096
</pre><p>Next, associate the file with a loopback device, /dev/loop0:
<pre     class="programlisting">
losetup /dev/loop0 minixroot
</pre>


Create an ext2 filesystem:
<pre     class="programlisting">
mkfs.ext2 /dev/loop0
</pre>


Mount the device over a convenient mountpoint, say /mnt:
<pre     class="programlisting">
mount /dev/loop0 /mnt
</pre>


Create some favorite directories:
<pre     class="programlisting">
mkdir /mnt/dev /mnt/lib /mnt/sbin
</pre>


Create the console device:
<pre     class="programlisting">
mkdev /mnt/dev/console c 5 1
</pre>


Copy the minix.o module into /lib, and sash and insmod into /sbin:
<pre     class="programlisting">
cp /usr/src/linux/fs/minix/minix.o /mnt/lib/minix.o
cp /sbin/sash /mnt/sbin/sash
cp /sbin/insmod /mnt/sbin/insmod
</pre>


Find out which libraries insmod needs:
<pre     class="programlisting">
ldd /sbin/insmod
</pre>


and copy them to /mnt/lib:
<pre     class="programlisting">
cp /lib/libc.so.6 /mnt/lib
cp /lib/ld-linux.so.2 /mnt/lib
</pre>


Then create a /mnt/linuxrc file that loads the minix module:
<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/sbin/sash
/sbin/insmod /lib/minix.o
</pre>


Make linuxrc executable:
<pre     class="programlisting">
chmod 777 linuxrc
</pre>


Umount /mnt and detach the loopback device:
<pre     class="programlisting">
umount /mnt
losetup -d /dev/loop0
</pre>


<span   class="bold"><b>gzip</b></span> the minixroot file, and
you're ready to boot the client:
<pre     class="programlisting">
gzip minixroot
</pre>


This example will get you as far as the kernel trying to load its
root filesystem from /dev/fd0. To fully test out the example,
you'll have to create a MINIX filesystem on the diskette, mount it
and copy over at least init and sh, and the libraries they need,
and create a console device.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a62580.0x2b53eb8"></a>Remote NFS Root</h2></div></div><p>As we all know, life without a root filesystem (/) is
meaningless. When booting locally, the root FS is almost always
found on the local hard drive. Where does root come from on a
network-booted client? To provide root you have two choices:
remotely mounted root over NFS from the server or by a RAM disk. If
you provide root via NFS, by default your kernel looks for root in
/tftpboot/<span   class="emphasis"><em>ip</em></span>, where <span   class="emphasis"><em>ip</em></span> is
the IP address of your client. This requires starting NFS on the
server and exporting /tftpboot (or
/tftpboot/<span   class="emphasis"><em>ip</em></span> for each node). To get the client
node to boot to the login prompt, there are several requirements on
the root filesystem, including the init and shell binaries;
devices, at least the console device; and any dynamically loaded
libraries the init and shell binaries might depend on.</p><p>A quick-and-dirty method of populating a remote root
filesystem would be to copy init, sh, the necessary libraries and a
console device, as in:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cp /sbin/init /tftpboot/192.168.64.1/sbin/init
cp /bin/sh /tftpboot/192.168.64.1/bin/sh
</pre><p>To determine the dynamically loaded libraries for init, use
the ldd command:
<pre     class="programlisting">
ldd /sbin/init
ldd /bin/sh
</pre>


and then copy the libraries listed by the ldd commands to
/tftpboot/<span   class="emphasis"><em>ip</em></span>/lib. To make the devices, there
is a handy MAKEDEV command, part of the MAKEDEV package:
<pre     class="programlisting">
/dev/MAKEDEV -d /tftpboot/129.168.64.1/dev console
</pre>


If you have your other services up and running on the server
correctly, when you force a network boot on the client, it will
then run the init script from its remote root, using the console
provided in its remote root, bring up a shell and prompt for a
runlevel (since there is no /etc/inittab file in remote root).
Enter s for single-user mode, and just like that, your client is up
and running to the shell prompt.
</p><p>A special shell is available, called sash (for standalone
shell) that is extremely useful in the remote environment. This is
because sash has no dynamically loaded libraries and provides some
standard built-in commands that manipulate filesystems (mount,
umount, sync), change file permissions (chmod, chgrp, chown) and
archive (ar, tar), among other things. Instead of starting sh, for
example, you can copy /sbin/sash to
/tftpboot/<span   class="emphasis"><em>ip</em></span>/sbin/sash, and the kernel will
bring up the standalone shell instead. You also might want to
provide your own rudimentary inittab file to run sash on startup,
as in:</p><pre     class="programlisting">

methods used to boot Linux remotely. Remote Linux is extremely
fertile ground for continuing research. As networks become faster
and can support greater numbers of remote clients, and as clusters
become larger and have greater dependency on centralized
administration, remote Linux techniques will play an even greater
role in the industry. With the advent of dense server technology,
remote Linux has become not just a convenience but a
necessity.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a62580.0x2b544e8"></a>Acknowledgements</h2></div></div><p>I gratefully acknowledge the research of Vasilios Hoffman
