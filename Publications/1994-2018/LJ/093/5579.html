    Challenge your old friends, wherever they live, to a game of Risk or Monopoly, across the network, across the world.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x152d580.0x16253a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>The wonderful thing about the Linux
community, Fran&ccedil;ois, is that there really is a community. In
some cases that community goes back to before Linux was born.
Today, more than ten years after Monsieur Torvalds released Linux
to the world, the tradition continues, those common bonds among
computer enthusiasts only heightened by the Internet's
<span   class="emphasis"><em>toujours l&agrave;</em></span> nature. Networks,
Fran&ccedil;ois&mdash;that is what makes this community strong.
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Mais oui</em></span>, Fran&ccedil;ois, you are
correct. While this whole notion of networks leads itself to
business communication, I think you will agree with me when I say
the real keyword is communication. That means bringing people
together, and what better way to bring people together than through
games. We are a playful species, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mon ami</em></span>. I
believe human evolution has brought us to this point, and the real
purpose of all this networking technology, Fran&ccedil;ois, is to
make it possible for people to play games with others around the
world or across the block&mdash;that and to exchange wine-tasting notes
via e-mail of course.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Ah, bonjour mes amis</em></span>! Fran&ccedil;ois!
To the wine cellar. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Vite</em></span>! Bring up the 1997
Mendoza from Argentina for our guests. Please, sit down,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>. Be comfortable. Fran&ccedil;ois and
I were just discussing ways to unwind with friends who are far
away. You know, when I was younger, we would sit around the table
with a glass of wine, chatting loudly and enjoying a classic board
game. With today's networking technology and your Linux systems, we
can still do that, even when our friends are on the other side of
the planet. Ah, Fran&ccedil;ois. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Merci</em></span>.
Please, pour for our guests.</p><p>The first such game I want to look at is an old favorite of
mine. You know the one&mdash;five ships are assembled on a grid
representing a strange ocean. Two players face off, firing shots
blindly:</p><p>&ldquo;E-7.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Miss.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;E-8.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Aw, you sunk my destroyer!&rdquo;</p><p>This game even has been played on scraps of paper with the
grids and ship positions drawn in. Now, if your long-lost friend is
at the end of an internet connection on some far shore, you still
can experience the joys of the game. In fact, it is even better.
Ricardo Quesada is the author of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Batalla
Naval</em></span>, a network-enabled game that takes this classic
into a new realm. With this version of the game the two-player
limit is gone, meaning that more can join in on the action. Now you
have more to worry about than a single opponent. The excitement
begins by visiting the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Batalla Naval</em></span> web site
at
<a href="http://batnav.sourceforge.net" target="_self">batnav.sourceforge.net</a>
and downloading the latest source. Building the software will be
familiar to many of you:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
tar -xzvf gbatnav-1.0.2.tar.gz
cd gbatnav-1.0.2
./configure
make
make install
</pre><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Voulez-vous jouer</em></span>? In order to start a
game, you must first execute the server program, gbnserver. It is
also possible to connect to an existing server running somewhere
else on the Internet. On the machine that launches the server, a
window will pop up showing client connection statuses ranging from
0 through 9. At this point, you can join the game using the
gbnclient program. The first thing you will see is a connection
box, asking for server and port number. If you started the server
by simply typing the command name, that port will be 1995. You also
can choose a name for your player at this time. The default is your
login name.
</p><p>When you are ready, place your ships on the grid (a total of
ten ships in this incarnation of the game) and click Send ships
when you are happy. You'll need at least two players, but you also
can fire up a robot to play against. When you are ready, and you
have all the players you want, click on the Start game
button.</p><p>So now we play over the network, whether it be across the
room or around the world. But what about the friendly, energetic
banter? What makes this feel like high-tech-meets-old-fashioned
play is (strangely) something that takes advantage of the networked
nature of the game&mdash;a chat interface. During the course of the
game, you can let friendly banter flow back and forth among the
assembled players by typing your messages in the text box at the
bottom of the client. All messages will be prefixed with the name
of the person who sent the message. Figure 1 shows a game of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Batalla Naval</em></span> in progress.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="5579f1.large.jpg"><img src="5579f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1. A Fierce Game of </p></div></div>
</p><p>The next item I want to cover appeals to the capitalistic
land baron in all of us. It is one of the most popular games of all
time, the classic real-estate trading and selling game called
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Monopoly</em></span>. Over the years, it has spawned many
variations including boards that represent a number of major cities
throughout the world. Atlantic City is but one locale for the
virtual real-estate mogul.
</p><p>You'll find a couple of variations of this classic game out
there, and we will get to that shortly. It is possible to connect
to existing servers on the Internet, but there were no permanent
servers when I checked into this, so the best bet is to run your
own server (particularly if you want to play with your own crowd).
The program that allows you to run such a server is Rob Kaper's
monopd. The address for downloading the monopd d&aelig;mon program
is
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/monopd" target="_self">sourceforge.net/projects/monopd</a>.
You will, however, need one other piece before you actually can
assemble the game d&aelig;mon. This piece is the libcapsi_network
library (once again from Rob Kaper), and it is also available from
SourceForge, but at the following address:
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/libcapsinetwork" target="_self">sourceforge.net/projects/libcapsinetwork</a>.
Let us start there. Begin by extracting the libcapsi source:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
tar -xzvf libcapsinetwork-0.0.13.tar.gz
cd libcapsinetwork-0.0.13
./configure
make
make install
</pre><p>Now that we have the prerequisite library, we can follow
essentially the same steps and create our monopd server
d&aelig;mon:
<pre     class="programlisting">
tar -xzvf monopd-0.2.0.tar.gz
cd monopd-0.2.0
./configure
make
</pre>


To start the d&aelig;mon, type <b  >monopd</b>. The
program listens on port 1234, and as it works you'll see little
messages like <b  >entering monopigator</b>. You
conceivably can run the monopd program at this time, and it will
run happily in the background, but we do need something else before
we can start having real fun. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Oui</em></span>,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, I agree that d&aelig;mons are fun,
but they do not make a board game, <span   class="emphasis"><em>non</em></span>? What
we need are clients. The client we have on today's menu is Eric
Bourget's gtkmonop. You can get gtkmonop from
<a href="http://gtkmonop.sourceforge.net" target="_self">gtkmonop.sourceforge.net</a>:
<pre     class="programlisting">
tar -xzvf gtkmonop-0.2.0.tar.gz
cd gtkmonop-0.2.0
./configure
make
make install
</pre>


When the client starts up, you'll notice three tabs. One is labeled
Game Board, and it displays the game board. Amazing, is it not? The
second is Assets, and from it you may wonder upon the wealth you
have accumulated in the form of properties. The third is where you
begin. Clicking this tab will provide you with a dialog for
choosing a server (if you started it on your own machine, this is
likely &ldquo;localhost&rdquo;), pick a nickname for the game and click
Connect. When a second player joins the game, you are ready to
begin.
</p><p>As with the previous item on tonight's menu,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Batalla Naval</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>gtkmonop</em></span>
provides a chat window so that you may (ahem) chat with your game
partner or partners. Have a look at Figure 2 for a screenshot of a
<span   class="emphasis"><em>gtkmonop</em></span> game in action.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="5579f2.large.jpg"><img src="5579f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 2. Squaring off for </p></div></div>
</p><p>In the Linux world, we sometimes joke about world domination,
meaning (of course) Linux's domination of the server world, the
desktop, the PDA and so on. It seems that for some of us, this
obsession goes back to the days before Linux was born. Many years
ago I whiled away a great deal of time with friends playing a
little friendly game of &ldquo;conquer the world&rdquo;. I do not need to tell
you the risk in such an enterprise. That, by the way, was also the
game's name: <span   class="emphasis"><em>Risk</em></span>. I occasionally miss those
days, but now I need no longer fear because our old friend, Ricardo
Quesada, decided that he too missed those days. Ricardo is the
author of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Tenes Empanadas Graciela</em></span> (or just
plain <span   class="emphasis"><em>TEG</em></span>). Along with his dedicated band of
developers and gamers, the classic world conquest board game lives.
<pre     class="programlisting">
tar -xzvf teg-0.8.0.tar.gz
cd teg-0.8.0
./configure
make
make install
</pre>


In order to get a game going over your network, you must now run
the tegserver program. Please note that you do not run this as the
root user; in fact, the program will not allow this. With the
server running, start another session, this time by running the
tegclient program. You will be asked for a server to connect to and
that will be (presumably) the name of the host on which you started
the server.
</p><p>Once you have connected to the server, you will be asked to
choose your color (red, blue, pink, yellow, black or green). In
order for a game to proceed, you need at least two people connected
and up to a maximum of six. When enough players have joined in, you
can click Start to begin the game. This is a game of strategy, but
the objective is simple: conquer the world. You'll notice, however,
when you start the game, you also can run modified objectives,
so-called secret missions. It also is possible to join in as an
observer, watching others play the game.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>TEG</em></span> has three different map themes.
These are classic, sentimental and my personal favorite, modern.
Changing from one theme to another can be done during a running
game by clicking on the Preferences tab. Figure 3 shows a game in
progress between myself and my faithful waiter.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="5579f3.large.jpg"><img src="5579f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 3. Marcel Regains Control of
France</p></div></div>
</p><p>As with the other games I covered, <span   class="emphasis"><em>TEG</em></span>
provides a chat window at the bottom of the screen so that you can
send short messages to your fellow players during the course of a
game. It is almost like sitting around the table at your
grandparents' country home, <span   class="emphasis"><em>non</em></span>? The fun, the
playful competition&mdash;it is all there, and now distance means
nothing. So call up your cousin Henri in Versailles (or wherever),
convince him to load Linux, and let the games begin.
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Oui</em></span>, Fran&ccedil;ois. I see the terrible
clock and she is taunting us, <span   class="emphasis"><em>non</em></span>?
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Mes amis</em></span>, I fear that closing time is upon us
once again. When we cook with Linux, it seems that time vanishes.
But do not worry. Finish your games. Drink your wine.
Fran&ccedil;ois, I believe that I own this property. Prepare to pay
up.</p><p>Until next time; <span   class="emphasis"><em>au revoir</em></span>,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>. Your table will be waiting.
