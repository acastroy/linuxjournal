    Threat analysis won't make you sleep any better at night, but it will help ensure that the right things keep you awake.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb94580.0xc8c558"></a></h2></div></div><p>If you've been reading this column
awhile, you know I like to balance technical procedures, tools and
techniques with enough background information to give them some
context. Security is a big topic, and the only way to make sense of
the myriad variables, technologies and black magic that figure into
it is to try to understand some of the commonalities between
security puzzles.
</p><p>One piece common to each and every security scenario is the
threat. Without a threat there's no need for security measures. But
how much time do you spend identifying and evaluating threats to
your systems, compared to the time you spend implementing and (I
hope) maintaining specific security measures? Probably far too
little time. If so, don't feel bad, even seasoned security
consultants spend too little time on threat analysis.</p><p>This is not to say you need to spend hours and hours on it.
My point is that, ideally, threats to the integrity and
availability of your critical systems should be analyzed
systematically and comprehensively; threats to less essential but
still important systems at least should be thought about in an
organized and objective way.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb94580.0xc8c710"></a>Assets: You've Got 'em, the Bad Guys Want
'em</h2></div></div><p>Before we dive into threat analysis, we need to cover some
important terms and concepts. First, what does threat mean? Quite
simply, a threat is the combination of an asset, a vulnerability
and an attacker.</p><p>An asset is anything you wish to protect. In information
security scenarios, an asset is usually data, a computer system or
a network of computer systems. We want to protect those assets'
integrity and, in the case of data, confidentiality.</p><p>Integrity is the absence of unauthorized changes.
Unauthorized changes result in that computer's or data's integrity
being compromised. This can mean that bogus data was inserted into
the legitimate data, or parts of the legitimate data were deleted
or changed. In the case of computers, it means that configuration
files have been altered by attackers in such a way as to allow
unauthorized users to use the system improperly.</p><p>We also want to protect the confidentiality of at least some
of our data. This is a somewhat different problem than that of
integrity, since confidentiality can be compromised completely
passively. If someone alters your data, it's easy to detect and
analyze by comparing the compromised data with the original data.
If an attacker illicitly copies (steals) it, however, detection and
damage-assessment is much harder since the data actually hasn't
changed.</p><p>For example, suppose ABC Corporation has an SMTP gateway that
processes their incoming e-mail. This SMTP gateway represents two
assets. The first asset is the server itself, whose proper
functioning is important to ABC Corp.'s daily business. In other
words, ABC Corp. needs to protect the integrity of its SMTP server
so its e-mail service isn't interrupted.</p><p>Secondly, that SMTP gateway is host to data contained in the
e-mail that passes through it. If the gateway's system integrity is
compromised, then confidential e-mail could be eavesdropped and
important communications tampered with. Protecting the SMTP
gateway, therefore, is also important in preserving the
confidentiality and integrity of ABC Corp.'s e-mail data.</p><p>Step one in any threat analysis, then, is identifying which
assets need to be protected and which qualities of those assets
need protecting.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb94580.0xc8ca28"></a>Vulnerabilities</h2></div></div><p>Step two is identifying known and plausible vulnerabilities
in that asset and in the systems that directly interact with it.
Known vulnerabilities, of course, are much easier to deal with than
vulnerabilities that are purely speculative. (Or so you'd think,
but an alarming number of computers connected to the Internet run
default, unpatched operating systems and applications.) Regardless,
you need to try to identify both.</p><p>Known vulnerabilities often are eliminated easily via
software patches, careful configuration or instructions provided by
vendor bulletins or public forums. Those that can't be mitigated so
easily must be analyzed, weighed and either protected via external
means (e.g., firewalls) or accepted as a cost of doing whatever it
is that the software or system needs to do.</p><p>Unknown vulnerabilities by definition must be considered in a
general sense, but that makes them no less significant. The easy
way to illustrate this is with an example.</p><p>Let's return to ABC Corporation. Their e-mail administrator
prefers to run sendmail on the ABC Corp.'s SMTP gateway because
she's a sendmail expert, and it's done the job well for them so
far. But she has no illusions about sendmail's security record; she
stays abreast of all security bulletins and always applies patches
and updates as soon as they come out. ABC Corp. is thus well
protected from known sendmail vulnerabilities.</p><p>ABC's very hip e-mail administrator doesn't stop there,
however. Although she's reasonably confident she's got sendmail
securely patched and configured, she knows that buffer-overflow
vulnerabilities have been a problem in the past, especially since
sendmail is often run as root (i.e., hijacking a process running as
root is equivalent to gaining root access).</p><p>Therefore, she runs sendmail in a &ldquo;chroot jail&rdquo; (a subset of
the full filesystem) and as user &ldquo;mail&rdquo; rather than as root,
employing sendmail's SafeFileEnvironment and RunAsUser processing
options, respectively. In this way the SMTP gateway has some level
of protection not only against known vulnerabilities, but also
against unknown vulnerabilities that might cause sendmail to be
compromised, but hopefully not in a way that causes the entire
system to be compromised, too.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb94580.0xc8cce8"></a>Attackers</h2></div></div><p>The last piece of the threat puzzle we'll discuss before
plunging into threat analysis is the attacker. Attackers, also
sometimes called &ldquo;actors&rdquo;, can range from the predictable
(disgruntled ex-employees, mischievous youths) to the
strange-but-true (drug cartels, government agencies, industrial
spies). When you consider possible attackers, almost any type is
possible; the challenge is to gauge which attackers are the most
likely.</p><p>A good rule of thumb in identifying probable attackers is to
consider the same suspects your physical security controls are
designed to keep out, minus geographical limitations. This is a
useful parallel: if you install an expensive lock on the door to
your computer room, nobody will ask, &ldquo;Do you really think the
maintenance staff will steal these machines when we go
home?&rdquo;</p><p>Computer security is no different. While it's often tempting
to say &ldquo;my data isn't interesting; nobody would want to hack me&rdquo;,
you have no choice but to assume that if you're vulnerable to a
certain kind of attack, some attacker eventually will probe for and
exploit it, regardless of whether you're imaginative enough to
understand why. It's considerably less important to understand
attackers than it is to identify and mitigate the vulnerabilities
that can feasibly be attacked.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb94580.0xc8cea0"></a>Simple Risk Analysis: ALEs</h2></div></div><p>Once you've compiled lists of assets and vulnerabilities (and
considered likely attackers), the next step is to correlate and
quantify them. One simple way to quantify risk is by calculating
annualized loss expectancies (ALEs).</p><p>For each vulnerability associated with each asset, you
estimate first the cost of replacing or restoring that asset (its
single loss expectancy) and then the vulnerability's expected
annual rate of occurrence. You then multiply these to obtain the
vulnerability's annualized loss expectancy.</p><p>In other words, for each vulnerability we calculate: single
loss expectancy (cost) &times; (expected) annual rate of
occurrences = annualized loss expectancy.</p><p>For example, suppose Mommenpop, Inc., a small business,
wishes to calculate the ALE for denial-of-service (DOS) attacks
against their SMTP gateway. Suppose further that e-mail is a
critical application for their business; their ten employees use
e-mail to bill clients, provide work estimates to prospective
customers and facilitate other critical business communications.
However, networking is not their core business, so they depend on a
local consulting firm for e-mail-server support.</p><p>Past outages, averaging one day in length, have tended to
reduce productivity by about one-fourth, which translates to two
hours per day per employee. Their fallback mechanism is a fax
machine, but since they're located in a small town, this entails
long-distance telephone calls and is expensive.</p><p>All this probably sounds more complicated than it is; it's
much less imposing expressed in spreadsheet form (Figure 1).</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="5567f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Itemized Single Loss Expectancy
</p></div></div><p>The next thing to estimate is this type of incident's
expected annual occurrence (EAO). This is expressed as a number or
fraction of incidents per year. Continuing our example, suppose
Mommenpop, Inc. hasn't been the target of espionage or other
attacks by its competitors yet, and as far as you can tell, the
most likely sources of DOS attacks on their mailserver are vandals,
hoodlums, deranged people and other random strangers.</p><p>It seems reasonable to guess that such an attack is unlikely
to occur more than once every two or three years; let's say two to
be conservative. One incident every two years is an average of 0.5
incidents per year, for an EAO of 0.5. Let's plug this in to our
ALE formula:</p><p>950 ($/incident) &times; 0.5 (incidents/yr) = 475
($/yr).</p><p>The ALE for DOS attacks on Mommenpop's SMTP gateway is thus
$475 per year.</p><p>Now suppose some vendors are trying to talk the company into
replacing their homegrown Linux firewall with a commercial
firewall; this product has a built-in SMTP proxy that will help
minimize but not eliminate the SMTP gateway's exposure to DOS
attacks. If that commercial product costs $5,000, even if its cost
can be spread out over three years (to $2,166 per year after 10%
annual interest), such a firewall upgrade would not appear to be
justified by this single risk.</p><p>Figure 2 shows a more complete threat analysis for our
hypothetical business' SMTP gateway, including not only the ALE we
just calculated but also a number of others that address related
assets, plus a variety of security goals.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="5567f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Sample ALE-Based Threat Model
</p></div></div><p>In this example analysis, customer data in the form of
confidential e-mail is the most valuable asset at risk; if this is
eavesdropped or tampered with, customers could be lost (due to
losing confidence in Mommenpop), resulting in lost revenue.
Different perceived potentials in these losses are reflected in the
single loss expectancy figures for different vulnerabilities.
Similarly, the different estimated annual rates of occurrence
reflect the relative likelihood of each vulnerability actually
being exploited.</p><p>Since the sample analysis in Figure 2 is in the form of a
spreadsheet, it's easy to sort the rows arbitrarily. Figure 3 shows
the same analysis sorted by vulnerability.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="5567f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Same Analysis Sorted by Vulnerability
</p></div></div><p>This is useful for adding up ALEs associated with the same
vulnerability. For example, there are two ALEs associated with
in-transit alteration of e-mail while it traverses the Internet or
ISPs, at $2,500 and $750, for a combined ALE of $3,250. If a
training consultant will, for $2,400, deliver three half-day
seminars for the company's workers on how to use free GnuPG
software to sign and encrypt documents, the trainer's fee will be
justified by this vulnerability alone.</p><p>We also see some relationships between ALEs for different
vulnerabilities. In Figure 3 we see that the bottom three ALEs all
involve losses caused by the SMTP gateway's being compromised. In
other words, not only will an SMTP gateway compromise result in
lost productivity and expensive recovery time from consultants
($1,200 in either ALE, at the top of Figure 3), it will expose the
business to an additional $31,500 risk of e-mail data compromises,
for a total ALE of $32,700.</p><p>Clearly, the ALE for e-mail eavesdropping or tampering caused
by system compromise is high. Mommenpop, Inc. would be well-advised
to call that $2,400 trainer immediately.</p><p>Problems with relying on the ALE as an analytical tool
include its subjectivity (note how often in the example I used
words like &ldquo;unlikely&rdquo; and &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo;) and, therefore, the fact
that the experience and knowledge of whoever's calculating, rather
than empirical data, ultimately determine its significance. Also,
this method doesn't lend itself too well to correlating ALEs with
each other (except in short lists as shown in Figures 2 and
3).</p><p>The ALE method's strengths, though, are its simplicity and
its flexibility. Anyone sufficiently familiar with their own system
architecture and operating costs, and possessing even a general
sense of current trends in IS security (e.g., from reading CERT
advisories and incident reports now and then), can create lengthy
lists of itemized ALEs for their environment with little effort. If
such a list takes the form of a spreadsheet, ongoing tweaking of
its various cost and frequency estimates is especially easy.</p><p>Even given this method's inherent subjectivity (not
completely avoidable in practical threat-analysis techniques), it's
extremely useful as a tool for enumerating, quantifying and
weighing risks. A well-constructed list of annualized loss
expectancies can help you optimally focus your IT security
expenditures on the threats likeliest to affect you in ways that
matter.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb94580.0xc8db58"></a>An Alternative: Schneier's Attack Tree
Method</h2></div></div><p>Bruce Schneier, author of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Applied
Cryptography</em></span>, has proposed a different method for
analyzing risk: attack trees. An attack tree, quite simply, is a
visual representation of possible attacks against a given target.
The attack goal (target) is called the root node; the various
subgoals necessary to reach the goal are called leaf nodes.</p><p>To create an attack tree, you must first define the root
node. For example, one attack objective might be &ldquo;steal Mommenpop,
Inc.'s customers' account data&rdquo;. Direct means of achieving this
could be 1) obtain backup tapes from Mommenpop's fileserver, 2)
intercept e-mail between Mommenpop, Inc. and their customers and 3)
compromise Mommenpop's fileserver over the Internet. These three
subgoals are the leaf nodes immediately below our root node (Figure
4).</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="5567f4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Root Node with Three Leaf Nodes
</p></div></div><p>Next, for each leaf node you determine subgoals that will
achieve that leaf node's goal, which become the next layer of leaf
nodes. This step is repeated as necessary to achieve the level of
detail and complexity with which you wish to examine the attack.
Figure 5 shows a simple but more-or-less complete attack tree for
Mommenpop, Inc.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="5567f5.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. More-Detailed Attack Tree
</p></div></div><p>No doubt you can think of additional plausible leaf nodes at
the two layers shown in Figure 5 and additional layers as well.
Suppose for our example, however, that this environment is well
secured against internal threats (seldom the case), and that these
are the most feasible avenues of attack for an outsider.</p><p>We see in this example that backup media are obtained most
probably by breaking into the office; compromising the internal
fileserver involves hacking in through a firewall, and there are
three different avenues to obtain the data via intercepted e-mail.
We also see that while compromising Mommenpop, Inc.'s SMTP server
is the best way to attack the firewall, a more direct route would
simply be to read e-mail passing through the compromised
gateway.</p><p>This is extremely useful information; if this company is
considering sinking more money into its firewall, it may decide
that their money and time are better spent securing their SMTP
gateway. But as useful as it is to see the relationships between
attack goals, we're not done with this tree yet.</p><p>After an attack tree has been mapped to the desired level of
detail, you can start quantifying the leaf nodes. For example, you
could attach a cost figure to each leaf node that represents your
guess at the cost of achieving that leaf node's particular goal. By
adding cost figures in each attack path, you can estimate relative
costs of different attacks. Figure 6 shows our example attack tree
with costs added (dotted lines indicate attack paths).</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="5567f6.large.jpg"><img src="5567f6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. Attack Tree with Cost Estimates
</p></div></div><p>In Figure 6 we've decided that burglary, with its risk of
being caught and being sent to jail, is an expensive attack. Nobody
will perform this task for you without demanding a significant sum.
The same is true of bribing a system administrator at the ISP; even
a corruptible ISP employee will be concerned about losing his or
her job and getting a criminal record.</p><p>Hacking is a bit different, however. While still illegal,
it's often perceived as being less risky than burglary.
Furthermore, most organizations' computer defenses aren't nearly as
difficult to breach as their physical defenses.</p><p>Having said that, hacking through a firewall takes more skill
than the average script-kiddie possesses and will take some time
and effort; therefore, this is an expensive goal. But hacking an
SMTP gateway should be easier, and if one or more remote users can
be identified, the chances are good that the user's home computer
will be easy to compromise. Therefore, these two goals are much
cheaper.</p><p>Based on the cost of hiring the right kind of criminals to
perform these attacks, the most promising attacks in this example
are hacking the SMTP gateway and hacking remote users. Mommenpop
Inc., it seems, had better take a close look at their perimeter
network architecture, SMTP server's system security and
remote-access policies and practices.</p><p>Cost, by the way, is not the only type of value you can
attach to leaf nodes. Boolean values such as feasible and not
feasible can be used; a &ldquo;not feasible&rdquo; at any point on an attack
path indicates that that entire path is infeasible. Alternatively,
you can assign effort indices, measured in minutes or hours. In
short, you can analyze the same attack tree in any number of ways,
creating as detailed a picture of your vulnerabilities as you need
to.</p><p>The cost estimates in Figure 6 are all based on the
assumption that the attacker will need to hire others to carry out
the various tasks. These costs might be computed very differently
if the attackers themselves are skilled system crackers; in such a
case time estimates for each node might be more useful than cost
estimates.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb94580.0xc84e90"></a>Defenses</h2></div></div><p>The whole point of threat analysis is to try to determine
what level of defenses are called for against the various things to
which your systems seem vulnerable.</p><p>There are three general means of mitigating risk. Defenses
can be categorized as means of reducing an asset's value to
attackers mitigating specific vulnerabilities and neutralizing or
preventing attacks.</p><p>Reducing an asset's value may seem like an unlikely goal, but
the key is to reduce that asset's value to attackers, not to its
rightful owners/users. The best example of this is encryption: all
of the attacks described in the examples earlier in this article
would be made irrelevant largely by proper use of e-mail encryption
software.</p><p>If stolen e-mail is effectively encrypted, it can't be read
easily by thieves. If it's digitally signed (also a function of
e-mail encryption software), it can't be tampered with without the
recipient's knowledge, regardless of whether it's encrypted too. A
physical world example is dye-bombs: a bank robber who opens a bag
of money only to see himself and his loot sprayed with permanent
dye will have some difficulty spending that money.
Asset-devaluation techniques like these don't stop attacks, but
they have the potential to make them unrewarding and
pointless.</p><p>Another strategy to defend information assets is to eliminate
or mitigate vulnerabilities. Software patches are a good example of
this: every single sendmail bug over the years has resulted in its
developers distributing a patch that addresses that particular
bug.</p><p>An even better example of mitigating software vulnerabilities
is defensive coding. By running your source code through filters
that parse, for say, improper bounds checking, you can help insure
that your software isn't vulnerable to buffer-overflow attacks.
This is far more useful than releasing the code without such
checking and simply waiting for the bug reports to trickle back to
you.</p><p>The defensive approach we tend to focus on the most (not that
we should) is heading off attackers before they reach vulnerable
systems. The most obvious example is firewalling; firewalls exist
to stymie attackers. No firewall yet designed has any intelligence
about specific vulnerabilities of the hosts it protects or of the
value of data on those hosts. A firewall's function is to mediate
all connections between trusted and untrusted hosts and minimize
the number of attacks that succeed in reaching their intended
targets.</p><p>Access control mechanisms such as username/password schemes,
authentication tokens and smart cards also fall into this category
since their purpose is to distinguish between trusted users and
untrusted users (i.e., potential attackers). Note, however, that
authentication mechanisms also can be used to mitigate specific
vulnerabilities (e.g., using SecurID tokens to add a layer of
authentication to a web application with inadequate access
controls).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb94580.0xc85200"></a>Good-bye for Now</h2></div></div><p>And with that, I bid you <span   class="emphasis"><em>adieu</em></span> for the
