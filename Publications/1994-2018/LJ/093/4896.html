    How to improve your server's performance by offloading a TCP/IP stack from a Linux-based server onto an iNIC.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25ff580.0x26f7a80"></a></h2></div></div><p>Looking to improve the performance on
your high-end Linux server? Is your Linux system connected to a
high-speed network? Are your servers spending too much of their
resources on processing the TCP/IP stack and Ethernet frames? These
are just some of the problems in today's network environment. These
problems arise because TCP/IP traffic on the Internet and on
private enterprise networks has been growing dramatically for the
past decade, and there is no sign that growth will be slowing down
any time soon. The widespread global adoption of the Internet and
the development of new networking storage technologies such as
iSCSI are driving networking speeds even faster. Although the
processors being manufactured today are gaining speed at an
astonishing pace, it is likely that network-related growth will
continue to outpace the increasing processor speeds, slowing
servers from their primary tasks to process network packets.
</p><p>Intel has developed a prototype that offloads an entire
TCP/IP stack from a Linux-based operating system onto an
intelligent network interface card (iNIC).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25ff580.0x26f7be0"></a>The iNIC Design</h2></div></div><p>The iNIC contains a real-time operating system (RTOS) and an
entire TCP/IP version 4 stack. An I/O processor (IOP) on the iNIC
processes all of the network packets allowing the host processor to
process other tasks. To accomplish this division of labor, a thin
layer of logic is needed on the host side to route all the network
traffic through the iNIC.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25ff580.0x26f7ce8"></a>Socket Offload</h2></div></div><p>This technology is based on the intelligent I/O (I2O)
architecture, which is already incorporated into the Linux 2.4.x
kernel. Figure 1 is an I2O primer for those who are not familiar
with I2O. The I2O specification is a message-based communication
mechanism between a host operating system (OS) and I/O devices that
are sitting on an IOP. The IOP runs an intelligent RTOS (IRTOS),
which contains device-driver modules (DDMs) for each connected
device. To obtain portability, I2O uses a split-driver model. The
specification defines a set of abstract messages for each supported
device class (i.e., LAN, tape, disk). The host OS uses the
abstracted message layer to communicate with DDMs running on an
IOP. The DDM translates these I2O messages to hardware-specific
commands. To communicate with an I2O device, the host OS must have
a driver that knows how to translate OS device commands to I2O
device class commands. This module in the host OS is referred to as
operating system module (OSM).</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4896f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. I2O Architecture
</p></div></div><p>The solution is based on an extension of this architecture
with the creation of the socket class. Changes were made to the I2O
architecture to increase performance and minimize latencies usually
associated with a split-driver model.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4896f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Socket Offload Architecture
</p></div></div><p>The socket class defines messages needed for communication
between the host OS and the DDM. The two drivers, OSM and DDM,
communicate over a two-layer communication system. The message
layer sets up the communication session, and the transport layer
defines how information will be shared. The DDM is composed of two
modules: intermediate service module (ISM) and hardware device
module (HDM). The ISM provides the full functionality of the TCP/IP
version 4 stack. The HDM is the device driver for the iNIC. The
socket OSM is unlike any other network device in Linux. Normal
network card drivers are protocol-independent and interface with
the Linux kernel at the network application program interface
(API). The socket OSM, on the other hand, will interface directly
below the socket API. This allows the necessary socket services to
be offloaded onto the IOP running the socket class ISM. The socket
OSM replaces the services that the TCP/IP stack provided to the
kernel, thereby providing necessary interfaces to the Linux kernel.
It also transmits and converts socket requests and data in the
socket offload format to the iNIC running the TCP/IP offload
stack.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25ff580.0x26f8210"></a>Socket OSM</h2></div></div><p>The OSM is divided into the following subsystems: user
interface, message interface, kernel interface and memory
management.</p><p>The user interface replaces the af_inet socket layer in the
kernel. It provides feedback to the users' programs exactly as the
native (non-TCP/IP offloaded) kernel would provide.</p><p>The message interface provides the initialization and control
of the socket offload system. It translates the user socket
requests to the socket messages.</p><p>The kernel interface provides kernel services to the OSM.
This is the point at which the OSM provides any services normally
provided to the kernel by the TCP/IP stack. This subsystem was
designed to minimize the modifications needed for the Linux
kernel.</p><p>The memory management module provides the buffer pools needed
for data transfer to and from the user-space applications. Memory
management was designed to 1) minimize the number of data copies
and DMA requests, 2) minimize the host interrupts, 3) avoid
requiring costly physical-virtual address mappings and 4) avoid
overhead of dynamic-memory allocation at runtime. Two pools of
DMA-capable data buffers are maintained in the OSM. The transmit
buffer contains the data headed for the iNIC; the receive buffer
receives the data into the kernel from the socket device.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4896f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Linux TCP/IP Stack
</p></div></div><p>As shown in Figure 3, Linux network components consist of a
layered structure. User-space programmers access network services
via sockets, using the functions provided by the Linux socket
layer. The socket structure defined in include/linux/net.h forms
the basis for the implementation of the socket interface. Below the
user layer is the INET socket layer. It manages the communication
end points for the IP-based protocols, such as TCP and UDP. This
layer is represented by the data structure sock defined in
include/net/sock.h. The layer underneath the INET socket layer is
determined by the type of socket and may be the UDP or TCP layer or
the IP layer directly. Below the IP layer are the network devices,
which receive the final packets from the IP layer.</p><p>The socket OSM replaces the INET socket layer. All
socket-related requests passed from the socket layer are converted
into I2O messages, which are passed to the ISM on the IOP.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25ff580.0x26f86e0"></a>Embedded Target</h2></div></div><p>The embedded system software consists of the messaging layer,
TCP/IP stack, device driver and RTOS.</p><p>The messaging layer is the portion of the software that takes
messages from the OSM, parses them and makes the socket call into
the TCP/IP stack. This layer also takes replies from the network
stack and sends the appropriate reply to the OSM. To improve
performance and minimize the effects of latency inherent in
split-driver systems, the messaging layer batches, replies and
pipelines requests.</p><p>The embedded TCP/IP stack is a zero copy implementation of
the BSD 4.2 stack. It provides all of the functionality of a
networking stack to the messaging layer. Like all the software that
runs on the IOP, the stack has been optimized for running on the
Intel 80310 I/O processor chipset with Intel XScale
microarchitecture (ARM-architecture compliant). Benchmarks were
performed on the TCP/IP stack during optimization to ensure that it
would perform well across all sizes of data traffic.</p><p>The HDM was written to take advantage of all the offloading
capabilities of the NIC hardware. This includes TCP and IP
checksums on transmit and receive, segmentation of large TCP
packets (larger than 1,500 bytes) and interrupt batching supported
by the chip. The NIC silicon chips supported were the Intel 82550
Fast Ethernet Mu.pngunction PCI/CardBus Controller and the Intel
82543GC Gigabit Ethernet Controller.</p><p>The RTOS is a proprietary OS that has been designed for the
demands of complex I/O operations. This OS is fully I2O-compliant.
It was chosen in part because of the willingness of the designers
to make modifications to the OS for the prototyping efforts.</p><p>As described before, the socket calls made by the application
layer are converted into messages that are sent across the PCI bus
and to the I/O processor. This embedded system is a complete
computer for performing I/O transactions. It consists of a
processor, memory, RTOS and a PCI bus. Because it is designed for
I/O, it will minimize the effects of context switching. Once a
message reaches the IOP, it is parsed. The socket call that was
requested by the application is then called on the embedded network
stack. A reply message is sent to the OSM once the socket operation
is completed.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25ff580.0x26f89a0"></a>Benchmark Results</h2></div></div><p>The benchmark tests that were run using the prototype showed
that the offloading of the TCP/IP stack significantly reduced both
CPU utilization and the number of interrupts to the host processor.
With a heavily loaded machine, the offloaded stack was able to
maintain overall network performance and host CPU cycles were able
to remain dedicated to the workload applications. In a native
machine, the host processors were interrupted far more frequently,
and the network application suffered from CPU resource starvation
resulting in the network performance degradation.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4896f4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Benchmark Results
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25ff580.0x26f8c60"></a>Future Direction</h2></div></div><p>As the subject of iSCSI (storage over IP by encapsulating
SCSI in a TCP/IP packet) starts to heat up, desire for minimizing
network overhead will continue to grow. Efforts used in moving the
TCP/IP stack to an IOP quickly could shift to providing a
full-featured TCP/IP stack at the back end of an intelligent iSCSI
adaptor. This would minimize the impact of iSCSI to a Linux
platform by making it available via the normal SCSI API. To compete
with Fibre Channel, iSCSI must provide comparable
performance.</p><p>Another future enhancement is that embedded Linux will be
used for the RTOS. At the start of this prototyping effort, an
Intel i960 RM/RN processor was used, and embedded Linux was not
available. Since then, the Intel XScale microarchitecture has been
introduced, enabling the adoption of the embedded Linux that is
available for Intel StrongARM core. Porting of Linux-based
StrongARM Linux to the XScale microarchitecture will be completed
by the end of the year.</p><p>There were several goals behind this prototype effort: 1) to
demonstrate that the enhanced performance achieved by offloading
network tasks from the host processor reduces the host processor
cycles otherwise consumed by processing of network data, 2) to show
that the use of specialized software on the iNIC performs the same
networking tasks while maintaining overall network performance and
3) to enable the use of I/O processors to work in conjunction with
the host processors to handle the network traffic, thereby
maximizing performance of a Linux-based server at minimal
cost.</p><p>Offloading the TCP/IP protocol to a specialized networking
software environment using embedded processors is an effective way
of improving system performance. With the advancement of high-speed
network deployments and adoption of network storage, TCP/IP will
inevitably play an important role.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25ff580.0x26ef700"></a>Acknowledgements</h2></div></div><p>Technical contributors: Dave Jiang, Dan Thompson, Jeff Curry,
