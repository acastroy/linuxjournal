    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28a5580.0x299d5b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>As Linux (ab)users, most of us take
networking for granted. Luckily for us, this is made easy due to
the Linux kernel design. But this can be abused, and badly.
Although UNIX and Linux administrators tend to have a better handle
on networking than most others, I want to relate something that,
while it happened on a Windows network and was exacerbated by poor
practice, also can happen on a Linux network.
</p><p>Some 18 months or more ago, I reviewed a client's network
before installing a Linux firewall. Their network was running 10Mb
and had some long cable runs (in some places using telephone cable
rather than Cat 5 cable), poorly terminated cables and up to four
hubs cascaded. They also were running three protocols (IP, IPX and
NetBEUI). Needless to say, with over 15% packet loss,
communications were poor. A couple of weeks ago, this client
decided to upgrade from a slow 64k frame-relay connection to a
significantly faster 128k wireless connection. At over 26% packet
loss, their network collapsed. They're doing better today with a
redesigned network: 100Mb circuits, one protocol (IP), the removal
of the hub cascade and correct, well-made cables. But their
administrators did not understand what had happened. We might blame
this on the fact they were MCSEs and had no UNIX network training,
but it can happen anywhere administrators don't have a full grasp
of network basics. There's a lot of networks out there, and many
are in bad shape. So don't laugh, you might just inherit
one.</p><p>Before I get started reviewing software, I want to note that
this is the first issue of the fourth year of Focus on Software.
During this time, some programs featured here have advanced
significantly, while others have (seemingly) disappeared. So I'm
going to feature one program from three years ago each month; if
you have a favorite I featured in the past, let me know.</p><p>For this month's flashback, I looked at several very good
programs, including the GTK+ Equation Grapher (geg), gtkfind (which
seems to have disappeared from the Web) and X Northern Captain,
among others, but my selection is PySol.</p><p>PySol
<a href="http://www.oberhumer.com/opensource/pysol" target="_self">http://www.oberhumer.com/opensource/pysol/</a></p><p>Whenever I upgrade my system, I always try to clean out all
the cruft (and I have a <span   class="emphasis"><em>lot</em></span> of cruft). Well,
the day I upgraded my system, not less than two members of the
family complained that PySol was gone. Few programs are as used as
this one, so despite the fact that it's a game, this one deserves
another mention. I called it &ldquo;Windows Solitaire on steroids&rdquo;
three years ago, but it has really advanced&mdash;sound, music, card
sets and hundreds of games. This eclipses any commercial card game
software I've seen. Requires: Python.</p><p>Netdude
<a href="http://netdude.sourceforge.net" target="_self">netdude.sourceforge.net</a></p><p>Hard-core network gurus might like to plow through a tcpdump
file and find it easy to read. But if you're just starting out,
Netdude is a very nice utility that will read a tcpdump file and
format the output so that it's extremely readable. You can even
make changes to the file and save it back. Requires: libgtk,
libgdk, libgmodule, libdl, libXext, libX11, libm, libglib, libpcap,
glibc.</p><p>ifmonitor
<a href="http://ifmonitor.preteritoimperfeito.com" target="_self">ifmonitor.preteritoimperfeito.com</a></p><p>The ifmonitor utility will watch an interface for you,
collect data on it from the /proc filesystem and insert it into an
SQL database. A PHP script is then available to access that data
and display it as a graph in a web browser. It's simple and easy to
install and use. Requires: MySQL, /proc, Perl, Perl module
DBD::MySQL, PHP with gd and MySQL, web server with PHP, web
browser.</p><p>GtkBalls
<a href="http://gtkballs.antex.ru" target="_self">gtkballs.antex.ru</a></p><p>This should keep folks occupied for some time. Try to align
five same-color balls to remove them and score points. Each time
you don't, three new balls appear randomly on the grid. Requires:
libtk, libgdk, libgmodule, libglib, libdl, libXext, libX11, libm,
glibc.</p><p>Manhattan Virtual Classroom
<a href="http://manhattan.sourceforge.net" target="_self">manhattan.sourceforge.net</a></p><p>This is an extremely simple, easy-to-use system for students
and teachers. A truly virtual classroom, the author built it with
security in mind. While not the simplest of applications to
install, the author provides clear, concise installation
instructions. Follow them to the letter, and you can't go wrong. If
you are a teacher or consultant working with a school, this program
deserves a demonstration. Requires: glibc, Apache Web
Server.</p><p>Celestia
<a href="http://www.shatters.net/celestia" target="_self">www.shatters.net/celestia</a></p><p>This is an extremely impressive 3-D star viewer. You can
visit the known universe from your computer. The graphics are well
done, and you have a lot of data available. While the beauty is
striking, what it will do to your system is just as striking. I may
not have the latest and greatest gigahertz system going, but I
didn't think it was that slow until I ran this. I wouldn't even
consider trying to run this on a classic Pentium I. Requires:
libpng, libjpeg, libGLU, libGL, libSM, libICE, libXmu, libXi,
libXext, libX11, libstdc++, libm, libz, libpthread, libdl, libXt,
glibc.</p><p>Until next month.</p></div></div>
