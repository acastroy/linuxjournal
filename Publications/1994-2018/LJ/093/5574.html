excuse for Windows users not to switch to Linux. A lot of work is
being done to undo this reasoning, not by bringing closed Microsoft
software to Linux, but by bringing the benefits of open-source
Linux software to Windows. Cross-platform versions of most popular
Linux desktop applications are available today, including the GIMP
image editor, StarOffice/OpenOffice office suite, the Mahogany
e-mail client, the Amaya WYSIWYG Web Editor and many web browsers,
including Mozilla and Opera. These all run on Linux and Windows,
and some even support Macintosh.

</p><p>Popular server applications like Apache and MySQL also have
been ported to Windows, but most programmers consider porting
desktop graphical user interface (GUI) software to be the most
daunting task. There are tricks that can help, but we'll show that
it's not that hard to accomplish. In this article we'll port
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Gothello</em></span>, a Linux version of the game
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Othello</em></span>, to Windows. In the process we'll
learn something about programming GTK+ (also called GTK). Our code
changes to <span   class="emphasis"><em>Gothello</em></span> will be made in such a way
as not to break existing Linux code.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Othello</em></span>, a cross between checkers and
tic-tac-toe, is a popular game. Released in Japan in 1971,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Othello</em></span> is a variant of the game
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Reversi</em></span>, invented in England in 1888. Although
many open-source software versions of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Othello</em></span>
exist for Linux, none of them would compile under Windows until
now.</p><p>A quick search for Linux applications at
<a href="http://freshmeat.net" target="_self">Freshmeat.net</a> reveals
many open-source, Linux-only versions of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Othello</em></span>: <span   class="emphasis"><em>Darwersi</em></span>,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Desdemona</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Gothello</em></span>,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>GReversi</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>QtHello</em></span>,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Rhino</em></span> and <span   class="emphasis"><em>xreversi</em></span>.
Choosing software based on a GUI with cross-platform support makes
porting much easier. Both GTK+ and Qt are Windows-ready, but X11 is
not (eliminating <span   class="emphasis"><em>xreversi</em></span> from our list).
Fortunately, most modern Linux software is based on those two
portable GUI libraries that form the underpinnings of GNOME and
KDE, respectively. For our first Linux-to-Windows 2000 porting
project we chose GTK+-based <span   class="emphasis"><em>Gothello</em></span> written
in C.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Gothello</em></span> author Osku Salerma is a
computer science student at the University of Helsinki, where Linus
Torvalds studied while creating Linux. Salerma says, &ldquo;Gothello came
about because I was interested in game trees. The AI is implemented
using Negamax search with Alpha-Beta pruning and Iterative
Deepening.&rdquo; <span   class="emphasis"><em>Gothello</em></span> uses AI to provide a
virtual opponent in the game. Salerma plans to work in UNIX systems
programming after he graduates in a year or so.</p><p>GTK+ (GIMP Toolkit) is a popular library for creating
graphical user interfaces in C or C++. Under the LGPL you can
develop open software, free software or commercial software using
GTK+. Although originally written for developing GIMP, GTK+ is used
in a large number of software projects, including GNOME. GTK+ is
built on top of GDK (GIMP Drawing Kit), a portable wrapper for
platform-specific windowing APIs like Xlib and Win32. The primary
authors of GTK+ are Peter Mattis, Spencer Kimball and Josh
MacDonald.</p><p>

</p><p>Tor Lillqvist, an engineer at Tellabs in Finland, ported GTK+
and GIMP to Windows in 1997. Lillqvist says he ported GIMP for fun
so he could use it with his Minolta slide scanner in Windows.
Although the current release of his Windows port, version 1.3.0, is
from December 2000, there is a lively developers list in which
Lillqvist actively takes part. &ldquo;I am still working on it as much as
time permits&rdquo;, says Lillqvist. &ldquo;I am the father of a
three-month-old baby girl.&rdquo;
</p><p>Before attempting to build <span   class="emphasis"><em>Gothello</em></span> on
Windows, we need to download and install the necessary GTK+ Windows
libraries. A link to GTK+ for Win32 is provided on the main GTK+
web site. Download and unzip the glib, libiconv, gtk+ and extralibs
files. The lib files are prebuilt, so there's no need to remake
them. Where you place the files is a matter of personal preference,
but we like /code/lib/gtk. We'll download
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Gothello</em></span> and untar it in /code/oss/gothello.
Note that Windows, except at the DOS command prompt, supports
forward slashes in all file paths. Avoiding Windows-only back
slashes saves trouble when switching back and forth with
Linux.</p><p>Many books are available on GTK+ programming. We have
<span   class="emphasis"><em>GTK+/Gnome Application Development</em></span> by Havoc
Pennington (New Riders, ISBN 0-7357-0078-8). A book isn't required,
however, because the GTK+ web site provides a nice on-line tutorial
maintained by Tony Gale. We'll use his &ldquo;Hello World&rdquo; code example
to test that we have GTK+ properly installed [Listing 1, available
at
<a href="../listings/093/5574.tgz" target="_self">ftp.linuxjournal.com/pub/lj/listings/issue93/5574.tgz</a>].
The heavily commented code is a good introduction to how GTK+
works.</p><p>Open-source purists may prefer choosing an open-source
Windows C++ compiler, and that is certainly feasible. Dev-C++ is a
full-featured, open-source Windows integrated development
environment (IDE) that we've used successfully in the past. This
compiler incorporates the MinGW or Cygwin (gcc) compilers and the
Insight or GDB debuggers. Most Windows C++ programmers, however,
use the popular Microsoft Visual C++ compiler. It doesn't matter
which Windows compiler is used, but we'll select Visual C++ so that
we can cover some pitfalls that often trap less-experienced VC++
programmers. If you are a Linux open-source project leader
accustomed to working with gcc, these VC++ tips can save you a lot
of aggravation when working with the Windows VC++ programmers
porting your code.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="5574f3.large.jpg"><img src="5574f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
The deceptively simple Visual C++ project settings dialog,
estimated to have more potential configurations than there are
atoms in the universe.
</p></div></div><p>Although VC++ can use Makefiles, smooth handling of project
files is one of its most popular features. Project files are
generated automatically by VC++. The typical VC++ programmer has no
clue how to write a Makefile. Project files consist of a workspace
file (extension .dsw) and one or more project files (extension
.dsp). These text files are written by the {Project}{Settings}
tabbed dialog box and are not intended for editing by hand&mdash;there's
a zillion setting combinations. Not knowing what to look for here
is one of the hardest aspects facing a user unfamiliar with VC++. A
few settings are critical. Note that simply because a project will
build doesn't mean the settings are right.</p><p>Now we come to the heart of setting up a complex VC++
project. Listen carefully because even though you may never use
VC++ yourself, you almost certainly will have to tell any member of
your team doing a Windows port how to set it up correctly. What
VC++ programmers typically do is set absolute paths to libraries in
the project or configure their copy of VC++ to search implicitly
for libraries where they have installed them. That would make the
project files fail for anyone other than the person doing the
port&mdash;not cool.</p><p>Here's how to set relative paths in the project from
{Project}{Settings} in VC++:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
{C/C++}{Preprocessor}{Additional include directories}:
        ../../lib/gtk/src/gtk+,../../lib/gtk/src/glib,
        ../../lib/gtk/src/gtk+/gdk
{C/C++}{Use runtime library}:
        Multi-threaded
{Link}{Input}{Object/library modules}:
        glib-1.3.lib gdk-1.3.lib gtk-1.3.lib
        (added before the others here)
{Link}{Input}{Additional library path}:
        ../../lib/gtk/src/glib,../../lib/gtk/src/gtk+
        /gdk,../../lib/gtk/src/gtk+/gtk
</pre><p>Make sure that All Configurations is selected before entering
these settings, or else after you get the Debug version to build
you'll have to do it over again with Release settings. Since GUI
applications typically are multithreaded, it is always prudent to
turn that on.
</p><p>Our hello_gtk project will build now, but it won't run. A
Windows error message complains that we haven't installed the GTK+
dll files (dynamic link libraries). Copy these to the Windows
system32 folder, or better still, create a new folder for them and
set Windows {Control Panel}{System}{Advanced}{Environmental
Variables}{Path}. (Note: path changes won't take effect in the VC++
debugger without restarting VC++.)</p><p>After all this work to get VC++ and Windows configured
properly, the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Gothello</em></span> porting effort itself
isn't so hard. The first step is to deal with build errors from
missing UNIX include files that don't exist under Windows, such as
&lt;sys/time.h&gt; and &lt;unistd.h&gt;. Fortunately, most of the
functions and type definitions included in these missing files are
available somewhere in Windows. It's a bit of an Easter-egg hunt to
find the right Windows header file. Some are documented and easily
found, others are not. It turns out that &lt;winsock.h&gt; is a
good place to look for undocumented, UNIX-compatible Windows calls.
Berkeley sockets incorporate many common UNIX types and were
implemented as part of Windows sockets.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="5574f4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Building and running the GTK+ &ldquo;Hello World&rdquo; test application proves

include:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#ifdef _WIN32
#include &lt;winsock.h&gt;
#else
#include &lt;sys/time.h&gt;
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
#endif
</pre><p>Windows compilers implicitly define the system variable
_WIN32. Using that name as a conditional is the standard method of
making code automatically sense whether it is being compiled under
Windows or some other operating system. This allows us to keep good
Linux code in place while substituting Windows-specific code where
needed.
</p><p>Fixing <span   class="emphasis"><em>Gothello</em></span>'s timer.c is a little
more difficult because we encounter a UNIX function not implemented
anywhere in Windows:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#ifdef _WIN32
#include &lt;sys/timeb.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
#include &lt;winsock.h&gt;
void gettimeofday(struct timeval* t,void* timezone)
{       struct _timeb timebuffer;
        _ftime( &amp;timebuffer );
        t-&gt;tv_sec=timebuffer.time;
        t-&gt;tv_usec=1000*timebuffer.millitm;
}
#endif
</pre><p>Having a copy of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Using C on the UNIX
System</em></span> by David Curry (O'Reilly &amp; Associates, ISBN
0-937175-23-4) comes in handy to tell us what the gettimeofday()
function is supposed to do.
</p><p>Code revisions to <span   class="emphasis"><em>Gothello</em></span>'s child.c
include:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#ifdef _WIN32
#include &lt;stddef.h&gt;
#include &lt;io.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;winsock.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#else
#include &lt;sys/time.h&gt;
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
#endif
</pre><p>Making child.c compile wasn't hard. We just had to track down
the relevant Windows include files when the compiler complained
about size_t, timeval, fd_set, FD_ZERO, FD_SET, tv_sec, tv_usec,
select, NULL and _exit.
</p><p>Code revisions to <span   class="emphasis"><em>Gothello</em></span>'s gtk_main.c
include:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#ifdef _WIN32
#include &lt;io.h&gt;
#include &lt;fcntl.h&gt;
#include &lt;process.h&gt;

Windows doesn't fork(), and that can be a big problem in porting
Linux applications. With fork(), Linux creates a clone of the
running program in memory that can then branch to perform a
simultaneous task. Windows has the less-powerful spawn() function
but prefers to do its multitasking with threads. We'll rewire
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Gothello</em></span>'s main() to make it think that a
Windows thread is a child process. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Gothello</em></span>
uses pipes to communicate between parent and child processes, a
standard approach. Pipes work in Windows threads, too.
</p><p>Explaining this thread (Windows) and fork (Linux) code in
detail would be too tedious, but the design is based on the simple
idea of creating two thread functions containing the code that the
child and parent processes each would execute after forking. Be
careful not to put the gtk_main() message pump loop function into
these threads; doing so would stall the Windows message queue and
lock up the application. If you are designing a Linux project with
porting in mind, you can save yourself some trouble by using
threads from the beginning. Linux threads are similar to those
found in Windows.</p><p>The code in Listing 2 [available at
<a href="../listings/093/5574.tgz" target="_self">ftp.linuxjournal.com/pub/lj/listings/issue93/5574.tgz</a>]
is much easier to understand if you read the functions in reverse
order. The code in read_thread() requires some special explanation.
Inside <span   class="emphasis"><em>Gothello</em></span> init_all() we make this minor
modification, commenting out gdk_input_add() in Windows:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#ifndef _WIN32
    gdk_input_add(to_parent[0], GDK_INPUT_READ,
                  read_from_child, NULL);
#endif
</pre><p>When we first tried to run <span   class="emphasis"><em>Gothello</em></span>
under Windows, the program locked up. The Windows port of GTK+
doesn't seem to be happy with gdk_input_add(). Threads are a better
way to go than multitasking in the message loop. Instead of using
<b  >gdk_input_add()</b> to detect input on a pipe inside
the GTK+ message queue, we handle that as an independently running,
simultaneous thread. We also make a minor change to child.c to fake
out the select() call that in Linux sets the pipe to operate
asynchronously:
<pre     class="programlisting">
#ifdef _WIN32
    ret = 0;
#else
    ret = select(to_child + 1, &amp;set, NULL, NULL, &amp;tv);
#endif
</pre>


Porting <span   class="emphasis"><em>Gothello</em></span> was our first time using
GTK+. It would have been easier to do the port had we first built
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Gothello</em></span> under Linux. We didn't do that
because we wanted to evaluate how hard it would be for a Windows
programmer unfamiliar with GTK+ to do a port sight unseen. It took
myself and partner Gabrielle Pantera a couple of weeks, working
part-time during nights and weekends. That popular Linux GUI
toolkits such as GTK+ and Qt are portable vastly simplifies the
task of making Linux applications run on Windows.
</p><p>Ported Linux desktop GUI applications can ease the learning
curve of Windows users considering a move to Linux. And Linux users
can access their favorite applications when using a Windows machine
that may be at the office or that belongs to a friend. You even can
program enhancements to your favorite open-source application for
Linux while working in another operating system. Besides, there's
nothing wrong with easing a million Windows C++ programmers into
open-source programming.</p><p><a href="5574s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
