Linux, with one KVM. Both work when I start up the desktop, in this
case GNOME/Enlightenment. When I switch from the Mandrake desktop
to the other system, then back again, I lose mouse support
entirely. I've checked cables, restarted the gpm d&aelig;mon and
pressed Ctrl-Alt-Backspace to leave the desktop. When I restart the
desktop, the mouse is detected again, but only for as long as I
don't switch to Windows and then back again.
</p><p>With the Windows side, I can switch to Linux and back with no
problem, and every time I start the desktop on Linux it works&mdash;but
only until I switch the screen away and back again. Any ideas as to
what this needs to fix? Linux/Mandrake 7.1 is running on a Dell P90
(old) with PS/2 mouse, gpm runs with <b  >gpm -t
ps/2</b>. Could some other d&aelig;mon I'm not running
because of security be what's causing the problem? I have amd, atd,
innd, lpd and portmap disabled.</p><p>&mdash;Dave Dennis,
<a href="mailto:dmd@speakeasy.org">dmd@speakeasy.org</a></p><p>This is most likely not a problem with the Linux setup. PS/2
mice have a configuration that is initialized during startup. A KVM
is responsible for restoring this configuration on switch back to a
machine; Linux is totally unaware of the switch.</p><p>&mdash;Christopher Wingert,

of two desktop machines and a laptop. I would like to get my mail
on any machine but can do so only on the older desktop machine. I
have set up the Netscape preferences identically on all machines.
On the newer machine and the laptop I get the message &ldquo;Netscape
unable to locate the server mail&rdquo;, when I try to retrieve mail. The
server &ldquo;mail&rdquo; is the name given by my ISP (Cox@home), which works
perfectly fine on the older machine. On the other machines, when I
try to get new messages, Netscape always asks for my password even
though in the preferences I have explicitly selected the &ldquo;remember
password&rdquo; button, so I'm wondering if NS is reading the wrong
preferences file.
</p><p>&mdash;Eric Smith,
<a href="mailto:esmith289@home.com">esmith289@home.com</a></p><p>Sounds like your one working machine has the Fully Qualified
Domain Name (FQDN) for your ISP and the others do not. Try adding
the rest of the hostname to the configuration for Netscape (i.e.,
mail.example.com, if example.com is your domain name). Alternately,
you could update your /etc/resolv.conf &ldquo;search&rdquo; configuration line
and add the correct domain name so that you don't have to type in
all the time.</p><p>&mdash;Christopher Wingert,

<a href="mailto:db101055@hotmail.com">db101055@hotmail.com</a></p><p>You seem to expect the HD with SCSI address 3 to be /dev/sdc.
Linux doesn't work like that: the lowest-addressed SCSI HD is
always /dev/sda, regardless of its SCSI address. The
next-higher-addressed SCSI HD is always /dev/sdb, and so on. Your
SCSI CD will be /dev/scd0 or /dev/sr0&mdash;both names work equally
well.</p><p>&mdash;Scott Maxwell,

The superblock could not be read or does not describe

</p><p>&mdash;Bob Wooden,
<a href="mailto:bwooden@computelnet.com">bwooden@computelnet.com</a></p><p>/dev/hda is a drive. While it is possible to install a

else was changed; dates, inode, etc., were the same. <b  >rpm

altered. Since I am running a public web server on this machine, I
reinstalled the glibc package. Then Tripwire complained about the
dates and inodes; this is natural when you have reinstalled a
package. I believe I have a well-setup firewall. How can the
checksum of libc change? Why does the checksum of kcore
change?</p><p>&mdash;Magnus Sundberg,
<a href="mailto:Magnus.Sundberg@dican.se">Magnus.Sundberg@dican.se</a></p><p>I don't know why libc changed, but I know why /proc/kcore
changed: /proc/kcore is a pseudo-file representing the system's
physical memory. It's only natural that the contents of physical
memory would vary with time. If it didn't, your system would be a
lot less useful. So don't worry about that one.</p><p>&mdash;Scott Maxwell,

<a href="mailto:mike@CamaroSS.net">mike@CamaroSS.net</a></p><p>You cannot add two default routes. You have to tell Linux
which traffic should go to which network. Sounds like what you are
trying to do is load balancing on the two T1s (or possibly
redundancy). Check out the EQL or Bonding driver. You also could
route via BGP. Check out the Advanced Routing HOWTO at
