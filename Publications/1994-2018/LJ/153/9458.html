I am not a musician.  Although I did play the clarinet in grade school,
that was a long, long time ago, and I have forgotten what I learned.
Therefore, when I want to hear music, I tend to go down to the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Alideia
dos Piratas</em></span>, my favorite restaurant, and listen to the musicians who
play there.
</p><p>
One evening as I sat in my favorite seat looking out over the ocean,
I must have drifted away to the music because a young friend of mine,
Bryant, asked me why I was smiling.
</p><p>
&ldquo;I remembered a story about a musical instrument that came
very close to non-existence&rdquo;, I said.
</p><p>
The year was approximately 1703, and the place was Florence, Italy.
An instrument maker named Bartolomeo Cristofori had a great idea for a
new instrument.  He was certain that the new instrument would take the
market by storm, and he wanted to patent his idea.  Patents as we know
them today already existed in Florence, Italy, because they were introduced
to Italy in 1474, more than 200 years previous.  Getting
a patent was a natural thing for people to do if they had invented a
totally new instrument.
</p><p>
There was a problem, however.  The new instrument was expensive to make,
and there was no music for it.  If there was no music, there would be no
demand for the instrument.  No demand for the instrument meant no sales of the
instrument.  And, if there were no sales of the instrument, there would be no music created.
A vicious circle.
</p><p>
So instead of taking out a patent, the instrument maker decided to
publish far and wide how to make the instrument.  It took him several
years to find a writer who would write about this instrument, and
eventually, he found a magazine in Germany that would publish the articles.
When German instrument makers saw the article, they agreed it would make
a great instrument, and so they started making copies of it and giving
it to the great songwriters of the day&mdash;people like Handel, Bach and
(later) Mozart.
</p><p>
For the instrument that we are discussing, the instrument that replaced
the harpsichord (which could play only one loudness of music due to having
the strings plucked rather than hit), was the pianoforte (soft and loud),
which we simply call the piano today.
</p><p>
And yet, even with all those instrument makers free to make the piano,
it still took almost 100 years for the piano to replace the
harpsichord as the &ldquo;standard keyboard instrument&rdquo;.
</p><p>
&ldquo;Wow&rdquo;, Bryant responded when I finished telling the story,
&ldquo;imagine if Cristofori had tried to patent
it so that only he could make it.  It might have taken another 100
years for the piano to make it in the marketplace, if it ever did.  Were
there ever patents associated with pianos?&rdquo;
</p><p>
&ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, I said, &ldquo;but not always to good
effect.&rdquo;
</p><p>
If you look in the back of a piano, you normally see a list of patents
that are covered in that piano.  Sometimes the list is 50 or more
patents long.  Each one of them stands for some small improvement that
some person made, and often these patents were licensed out to other piano
makers for a small sum.  Sometimes, however, as you take apart a piano to
fix it, you find some strange mechanism or technique in making the piano,
and you wonder why someone did that particular thing so strangely&mdash;until
you realize it was to get around a particular patent.  The piano maker
actually made an inferior instrument, trying hard not
to pay a royalty for the patent, or because the competitor would not
license the rights to that patent.
</p><p>
&ldquo;But patents must have some good use&rdquo;, said Bryant.  &ldquo;Why would the
government have created them otherwise?&rdquo;
</p><p>
In some cases, it can be argued that patents are useful.  Particularly
when the concepts they are protecting are ones that took large
amounts of time and money to create&mdash;medicines, for example.
</p><p>
There are people who graduate from college and spend their entire
lives looking for an effective treatment for a disease.  The search
for the treatment typically requires lots of expensive equipment, lots
of staff and many expensive chemicals.  Once the treatment is found,
there needs to be testing of the treatment, and the results have to be
studied and approved.  All of the expense for this research is expected to
be repaid in selling the treatment.  Without a patent on the medicine,
other companies could duplicate what those researchers had done, and
undercut the profits on the production of the medicine.
</p><p>
There are arguments about whether patents on medicine are too long or
whether the costs of patented medicines are too high, but a lot of this
could be handled by governmental programs to get medicines into the hands
of the people who need them.  The issue is whether the law will
give an effective monopoly to the creator of the medicine long enough
for them to recover the large costs they have incurred.
</p><p>
If some competitor wants to make the same medicine, the patent can be
licensed out.  There are relatively few numbers of medicine developers,
and relatively few numbers of people who can produce a drug safely
and effectively.
</p><p>
Compare this to the normal way a software patent is created today.
Software developers have a problem.  They study the problem a day
or two, then they write a nice piece of code to solve the problem.
A lawyer looks over their shoulder as they submit the code and asks the
fatal question:
&ldquo;Do you think we can patent that?&rdquo; And, before the developers can deny
that it is patentable, the patent is well on its way to the patent office.
I have simplified this scenario somewhat, and surely there are issues in computer
science that take more effort than what I have just described, but not
the orders of magnitude greater effort and cost that medical patents
represent&mdash;and particularly not in today's society.
</p><p>
When I started programming, computers cost millions of dollars (and
that was when a million US dollars was a lot of money).  The programming
community was relatively small.  There were a couple journals on
programming and algorithms.  If you wanted software written for you,
either you did it yourself, or you went to a relatively small number of
people who could write software for you.  Software was not everywhere,
as it is today.  And, even without the Patent Office allowing software
to be patented (software patents really got underway in 1981), concepts
like microcode, compilers, databases, subroutines and so forth were created
and built upon by the software community.
</p><p>
Then, just as the cost of hardware began to drop appreciably, and as
software started to become intertwined with our lives, more and more
software patents started being applied to software.  Unlike the issue
of medicine, or the making of steel or automobiles, everyone uses the
concepts of software, and most people can create software, both for profit
and nonprofit.
</p><p>
For those of you who are not programmers, imagine Michelangelo painting
the Sistine Chapel&mdash;lying on his back, year after year, painting.
Just as he finishes, his arch-enemy Leonardo da Vinci walks in and tells
him that he has to start all over again, because last week he had patented
a particular brush stroke that Michelangelo used a lot.
</p><p>
Or, imagine that as Beethoven finishes his <span   class="emphasis"><em>Symphony no. 9 in D
Minor</em></span>, which included &ldquo;Ode
to Joy&rdquo;, one of the most beautiful works of music, in walks one of
his greatest critics, Johann Nepomuk Hummel and signs (because Beethoven
is deaf) that he has to rewrite the entire symphony because last week
Hummel had patented the triplet.
</p><p>
Unlike a law of nature, such as gravity, patents are laws of humankind
and just as we can make those laws, we can dismantle them when they have
served their purposes.  It is particularly necessary to dismantle the
laws if the laws are now hurting the type of innovation the laws were
supposed to foster.
</p><p>
With hundreds of programmers joining the ranks of programming every day,
and thousands more people using computers every day, it is unreasonable
for programmers to have to memorize the thousands of software patents
that have been created.  It is also unreasonable for people writing
software, either as a hobby or offering at no cost to society, to have to
pay legal fees (either for lawyers or for patent royalties) to someone
to distribute software that they wrote.
</p><p>
I have nothing against copyright law.  Copyright violation is relatively
easy to avoid.  But I believe that in the modern world software patents
are hindering innovation, not helping it.
</p><p>
And I invited Bryant to my house to listen to my pianola, which is yet
another story....
