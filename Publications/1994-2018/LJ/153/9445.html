<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #153, January 2007</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>

<span   class="bold"><b>Michael Halcrow</b></span> has submitted some patches to add support for public key
cryptography in <span   class="bold"><b>eCryptFS</b></span>. Overall, folks
like <span   class="bold"><b>Andrew Morton</b></span> seem to be in
favor of this; although Andrew points out that there already is key
management support in the kernel, and that perhaps the existing code should
be extended to support eCryptFS's public key features, instead of creating
that support afresh. But, Michael feels he's going in the right
direction,
and in spite of how any particular implementation details will resolve
themselves, it does seem as though public key support in eCryptFS has
arrived.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Alon Bar-Lev</b></span> has extended the <span   class="bold"><b>kernel boot-command-line length</b></span> from 255
characters to 2,048 characters to accommodate all the stuff that's been
piling into the command line in recent years, such as module arguments,
initramfs, suspend and resume, and more. Unfortunately, it's become
clear that one cannot simply extend the kernel command line. The
command-line code is written in assembler and has such poor design and odd
code behaviors within it that simple changes turn out to require bigger
fixes. But <span   class="bold"><b>Andi Kleen</b></span>, <span   class="bold"><b>H. Peter Anvin</b></span>, Alon and others have taken this as an
opportunity to clean up the whole mess. So, that's exactly what they're doing.
It may delay the migration from the 255 to 2,048 character boot command lines,
but it probably will open up other doors that have not yet been considered.
</p><p>
Writing <span   class="bold"><b>user-space PCI drivers</b></span> has been
an insane process, according to <span   class="bold"><b>Greg
Kroah-Hartman</b></span> and <span   class="bold"><b>Thomas
Gleixner</b></span>. So they decided to do something about it.
Thomas wrote up some infrastructure code to rein in the whole process, and
Greg added his own touches. Now they've released the code, and a bunch of
folks, including Andrew Morton, have begun piling on to get it into shape for
actual inclusion into the kernel. The code already seems poised to
become a generic user-space driver subsystem, not only for PCI drivers. So
naturally, a bunch of people are considering possible names for the
subsystem&mdash;everything from User Space Driver (USD) subsystem to Framework
for Userspace Drivers (FUD) subsystem. Personally, I'd like to see a
subsystem called FUD. Meanwhile, folks like <span   class="bold"><b>Manu
Abraham</b></span> already
are chomping at the bit to see this thing implemented fully, as it would have
made some work he did with <span   class="bold"><b>Andrew de
Quincey</b></span> go much more smoothly.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Neil Brown</b></span> has been frustrated by the sheer number of ways it is possible to
feed <span   class="bold"><b>configuration parameters</b></span> into the kernel in recent years. Between
sysctl, SysFS, module parameters, kernel parameters and (in a hushed
whisper) ProcFS, he doesn't know which thing to use anymore to configure
some random module he's writing. He has asked for help and guidance. The
discussion that followed may not have led to a definitive answer for Neil,
beyond <span   class="bold"><b>Horst von Brand</b></span>'s recommendation of sysctl, but it did manage to get
<span   class="bold"><b>Oleg Verych</b></span> to talk about his new
configuration interface, called <span   class="bold"><b>etab</b></span>
(short for External Text and Binary). The etab interface stores
configuration in key/value pairs, and according to Oleg, may be useful in
many parts of the kernel where configuration is done.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Joerg Roedel</b></span> has implemented the
protocol defined in <span   class="bold"><b>RFC 3378</b></span> to allow
Ethernet packets to be tunneled through IPV4. As <span   class="bold"><b>Philip Craig</b></span> pointed out,
<span   class="bold"><b>iproute2</b></span> already exists and would be a logical place to add Joerg's
features. Joerg has agreed with this, but says he did the implementation
separately to gain experience. Once the code begins to stabilize, his plan is
to add it to iproute2.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Intel's Arjan van de Ven</b></span> has announced the first release of the Linux-ready
<span   class="bold"><b>Firmware Developer Kit</b></span>. This open-source Intel initiative involves a set of
tests to see how well a system's BIOS will interact with Linux. Hopefully,
says Arjan, this will help BIOS developers ensure that their systems
continue to interoperate with Linux. Intel also is hopeful that developers
will hop on board and start feeding bug fixes and support for additional
BIOSes to the upstream sources.

<h2 class="title">Google Offers Code Search&mdash;Are Koders and Krugle Feeling Lucky?</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Doc Searls</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #153, January 2007</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>

In journalism, we say, &ldquo;three examples makes a trend&rdquo;. In
business school, professors teach that three competitors make a market category. Both tropes
now apply to code search, since Google has jumped into a market
pioneered by Koders.com three years ago and expanded by Krugle.com in
the middle of 2005.
</p><p>
I asked Chris DiBona, Google's top open-source guru, about
differentiation. He replied, &ldquo;We are more comprehensive by an order of
magnitude, and I think we give a faster, smarter experience. Our
dupe-detection is really cool. You can almost instantly see which
routine is more popular/used in the world (search for btree or some
other common algorithm).&rdquo;
</p><p>
Koders and Krugle are hardly standing still, of course. And, they can now
press their advantages around the edges of a large market presence. For
Koders, those include algorithms optimized for code searching and results
ranking, search filters, an API so other services can access the search
index, and an Enterprise Edition that searches behind company firewalls.
For Krugle, those include iterative searching, search of related non-code
documentation, ties of metadata to code, and a notes function for
comments on (and linkage to) code.
</p><p>
Those, of course, are subsets of current offerings by all three
services, which are sure to evolve and change even more as competition
heats up and programmers become more involved.

It's been a year since Mirus announced Koobox, a new line of desktop PCs
that come loaded with Linux. The first offerings were standard tower
configurations, starting at $299 US, pre-loaded with Linspire's latest
distro. Then, in summer 2006, the company added a Mac-Mini-like unit with a
mouse/keyboard/speaker bundle for $399.99 US (after a mail-in rebate).
Since then, Mirus has been adding other Mini models, scaled upwards with
faster CPUs, bigger drives and features like DVD+RW.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="9445kooboxf1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

Mirus is a subsidiary of Equus, a Microsoft Platinum OEM and Gold
Certified Partner, yet calls itself &ldquo;The Largest Whitebox System Builder
to the Channel&rdquo; and was named by CRN as number 1 out of the 50 system
builders. It'll be interesting to see how it does.

All the creativity, customer whims, long tails, and money are at the
network's edge. That's where chipmakers find the volumes that feed their
Moore's law margins. That's where you can find elastically ascending
