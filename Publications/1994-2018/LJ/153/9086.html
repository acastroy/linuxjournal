Add the Pixel graphics program to your LyX-created book to finish the
ultimate Lulu on-line book.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1159580.0x1251298"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Last month, I dove into LyX, a graphical LaTeX typesetting program
for Linux.  Because LyX produces commercial quality documents, it's an
ideal match for the Lulu.com self-publishing Web site.
</p><p>
I'm reasonably certain most authors send material that comes from a
standard word-processing program, such as Microsoft Word.  Look back at the
article in the December 2006 issue of <i  >LJ</i> where I show you some output between a word processor
and LyX to see what a difference it makes for your final product.
</p><p>
This time, I finish our book publishing tutorial.  Publishing to
Lulu.com is a two-step process.  First, you need to upload your finished text
files to Lulu.  Then, you need to design a cover for the final product.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1159580.0x12514a8"></a>
Final Touches</h2></div></div><p>
After Lulu accepts your text file, it asks you to format or upload a
cover for the book.  You have two choices: use one of Lulu's
predesigned cover backgrounds, or upload a custom book cover that
you created.
</p><p>
The sample book covers Lulu provides vary and may suit your publication
just fine.  If you decide to use one of those, the on-line system will help you add text
to the image.  Lulu's on-line program will place the author, ISBN
and copyright notice for you as well.
However, creating a book cover yourself is a great opportunity to examine Pixel.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1159580.0x1251608"></a>
Pixel</h2></div></div><p>
In my estimation, Pixel is not a direct competitor of The GIMP.
Pixel is a commercially produced application that runs on many operating
systems.  The Pixel Web site (<a href="http://www.kanzelsberger.com/pixel" target="_self">www.kanzelsberger.com/pixel</a>) notes at
least six different operating systems, including Linux, Windows and Mac OS X.
</p><p>
By its own description, Pixel seems suited for advanced
graphic artists.  In fact, the first non-beta version of Pixel
should include Photoshop plugins and .psd import and export.  See
<a href="http://www.kanzelsberger.com/pixel/?page_id=60" target="_self">www.kanzelsberger.com/pixel/?page_id=60</a> for more details and a
list of features for the next release.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1159580.0x1251818"></a>
In Support of Commercial Software</h2></div></div><p>
Pixel is not free.  It is available as a demonstration software package,
and users can buy a license for $32 US.  This fee includes unlimited support
and all updates until the next major release.
</p><p>
The demonstration copy does have a significant drawback.  Any image
created with Pixel contains a Pixel watermark.  There is also a small
&ldquo;nag&rdquo; screen reminding you to buy the product to get full use of the
software.  So, you can't use any graphics produced with the demo version.
</p><p>
I don't find this objectionable.  Pixel's author intends to steer
the software to compete with the leaders in the graphics industry.
Although the expected version 1 price is around $100 US, it's still less
than the competition.  I like competition; it helps keep prices down.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1159580.0x1251a28"></a>
Installation</h2></div></div><p>
Because Pixel is not open source or free, it's not likely you will find
it in a major distribution's repository.  So, download a demo copy
from <a href="http://www.kanzelsberger.com/pixel/?page_id=4" target="_self">www.kanzelsberger.com/pixel/?page_id=4</a>.  Installation is
straightforward.  Download the Linux .tar file, unpack it and click
on the file to start program installation.  Follow the instructions on-screen to finish the setup.
</p><p>
Once complete, start Pixel from the command line or your system menu,
and the home screen appears (Figure 1).  At first impression,
Pixel looks similar to other top-line commercial software.  It's also
different from The GIMP, because it covers your entire screen.  In addition,
many tools are in full view by default (Figure 2).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9086f1.large.jpg"><img src="9086f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="9086f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Multiple Toolboxes Default on the Screen
</p></div></div><p>
The screen layout is clean.  Some of the icons are a bit troublesome
to identify due to their size.  But, trying to find hundreds of unique
pictures for tools must be challenging for any programmer.
</p><p>
Now you're ready to begin.  Because Pixel is still in beta release, documentation
is scarce.  In March 2006, the Pixel support forum explained that no
documentation is ready as the focus is on product development.  There
is a help system available by pressing F1 (Figure 3), but currently no embedded
tutorial exists.  Even without much documentation, Pixel's layout is
somewhat intuitive.  If you know Adobe Photoshop, you're in
luck&mdash;it's
nearly the same.

</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1159580.0x12521b8"></a>
The Best-Seller Cover</h2></div></div><p>
To review, in the last article we uploaded our sample text
document in .pdf format to the Lulu Web site.  Now, we need to create
our custom cover.  With Lulu, you can upload two different images, one for
the front and one for the back.  Or, you can design your own wrap-around
cover, including
the spine.
</p><p>
I chose to upload two different images for this tutorial.  Wrap-around
images look nice, but making one for an 8.5 x 11 book requires 1242 x
810 PostScript points.  At 300 dpi, a file in Pixel can be large and
difficult to manipulate.
</p><p>
Lulu's standards for an 8.5 x 11 book cover are 2663 x 3525 pixels
and no less than 300 dpi.  In Pixel, go to File&rarr;New, and a creation box
opens (Figure 4).  Enter the dimensions as shown in the example.  In the
lower-right corner, you will see the memory requirements for this file
are 35.8MB.  Press OK, and Pixel creates a blank document template
(Figure 5).  Now you have a blank page to create your cover art.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="9086f4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

Figure 5. The 8.5 x 11 Background for the Cover
</p></div></div><p>
To keep artwork simple for the tutorial, use your mouse to change the
foreground color as shown in Figure 6.  Pixel opens a color chooser for you to
select nearly any shade you want (Figure 7).  Choose your colors wisely.
Not all will transfer into the shade you expect during printing.
You should consider using a color management system if you have specific
needs.

</p></div></div><p>
Next, I decided to use Gradient G to spice up the background of the
cover.  Use your mouse to select the gradient button on the left of your
screen (Figure 8).  Drag your mouse by pressing the left-mouse button from
the top of your cover to the bottom.  This tells Pixel which direction
to draw the gradient (Figure 9).  I mentioned earlier that
Pixel's operation is intuitive.  When you select the gradient button,
look to the bottom right of the screen; the program gives you
hints on how to use the feature or effect (Figure 10).

</p></div></div><p>
After the screen updates, you should have a sample cover that looks
similar to the one shown in Figure 11.

Adding Text</h2></div></div><p>
Because a blank cover won't do much good on the bookshelf, we need to
add text.  Adding text is similar to adding color and gradients.
</p><p>
Use your mouse to select the text button (Figure 12).  Position your
cursor over any area on the working cover and use it to expand the text
box.  When complete, type and format the text for the cover (Figure
13).  After typing the text, use the character controls in the bottom
right-hand side of the screen to adjust any preferences with the text.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="9086f12.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="9086f13.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 13. Entering Text with the Text Box
</p></div></div><p>
At this point, you can add other colors, images or just about anything
else you like for the cover art.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1159580.0x164b9b0"></a>
Save and Upload Your Cover</h2></div></div><p>
When complete, go to File&rarr;Save As.  Name your cover, and use the
drop-down file-type list to choose .jpg.  Pixel will prompt for further
characteristics of the JPEG file.  The default settings are acceptable
for the tutorial.
</p><p>
My test book cover is shown in Figure 14.  Log in to your Lulu.com account
and upload your completed book cover into the system.  This completes
the design for your front cover.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9086f14.large.jpg"><img src="9086f14.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 14. Sample Book Cover
</p></div></div><p>
For the back cover, I decided to use a solid black background.  Lulu
provides a sample black background for you to use.  Simply use the
on-line tools to &ldquo;Choose Gallery Image&rdquo;.  Lulu adds the cover into your
publishing project.  Select Save and Continue.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1159580.0x164bd78"></a>
Final Publishing Steps</h2></div></div><p>
Lulu provides a snapshot of your final book cover in your Publishing
section of the Web site.  My final cover is shown in Figure 15.  Watch the
trim marks.  Be careful that no important graphic or text is beyond
the cutting line.  Once you accept the cover design, it's easy to price
your final publication and order a proofreading copy.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9086f15.large.jpg"><img src="9086f15.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1159580.0x164c038"></a>
Publishing Wrap-Up</h2></div></div><p>
My first article described the benefits of quality text formats by using
LyX to get typesetting output for your publication.  Now we have completed
the project by making a book cover and getting to the final proofreading
stage with Lulu.com.
</p><p>
Using Pixel as a graphical editing package may cause some frustrations
if you are a longtime GIMP user&mdash;not that Pixel can't match up to GIMP.
Quite the contrary, Pixel targets a high-end graphical artist
environment; however, it takes some time to become familiar with how to use the software.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1159580.0x164c198"></a>
Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Using Lulu.com, nearly anyone with the itch to write a book or magazine can
create professional printed media.  Using LyX and Pixel as
tools for high-quality output may be the ideal combination for report
and book formats.  Scribus may better fit publications, such as magazines
and newsletters.  Lulu can print many types of documents&mdash;even calendars.
</p><p>
LyX is open source, and it appears to have support for
further development as a GUI LaTeX editing package.  On the other hand, Pixel
is proprietary, and it seems its maintenance and development credit a
small cadre of programmers, with Pavel Kanzelsberger as the leader.
Other research on the Internet describes Mr Kanzelsberger as the only
developer, yet the information screen of Pixel gives kudos to others.
So, it might be a little risky to become too involved in Pixel until
it matures a little more.  I don't think you will need to wait long;
the final release is expected soon.
</p><p>
Pixel is sharp.  The likeness to Adobe Photoshop is sure to win the
attention of graphic artists.  I think it's safe to spend $32 US
for the current version and look toward a final product in the next
few months.
