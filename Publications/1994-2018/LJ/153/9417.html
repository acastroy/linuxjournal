Getting back to Apache log analysis by ending with a cliffhanger.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xed4580.0xfcc3a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
I admit it.  I got sidetracked last month talking about how you can use
a simple shell script function to convert big scary numbers into more
readable values that are understandable.  Sidetracked because we were in
the middle of looking at how shell scripts can help you dig through your
Apache Web server logs and extract useful and interesting information.
</p><p>
This time, I show how you can ascertain the most common
search terms that people are using to find your site&mdash;with a few
invocations of grep and maybe a few lines of awk for good measure.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xed4580.0xfcc500"></a>
Understanding Google</h2></div></div><p>
For this to work, your log has to be saving referrer information, which
Apache does by default.  You'll know if you peek at your access_log and
see lines like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">195.110.84.91 - - [11/Oct/2006:04:04:19 -0600] "GET
&#8618;/blog/images/rdf.png HTTP/1.0" 304 -
&#8618;"http://www.askdavetaylor.com/date_math_in_linux_shell_script.html"
&#8618;"Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.0)"</pre><p>
It's a bit hard to read, but this is a log entry for someone requesting
the file /blog/images/rdf.png, and the referrer, the page that produced
the request, is also shown as being date_math_in_linux_shell_script.html
from my askdavetaylor.com site.
</p><p>
If we look at a log file entry for an HTML hit, we see a more
interesting referrer:</p><pre     class="programlisting">81.208.53.251 - - [11/Oct/2006:07:32:32 -0600]
 &#8618;"GET /wicked/wicked-cool-shell-script-library.shtml
 &#8618;HTTP/1.1" 200 15656 "http://www.google.com/
&#8618;search?q=Shell+Scripting+&amp;hl=it&amp;lr=&amp;start=10&amp;sa=N"
 &#8618;"Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.0;
 &#8618;.NET CLR 1.0.3705)"</pre><p>
Let me unwrap that just a bit too.  The request here is for
wicked-cool-shell-script-library.html on my site (intuitive.com), based
on a Google search (the referrer is google.com/search).  Dig into the
arguments on the Google referrer entry, and you can see that the search
was &ldquo;Shell+Scripting&rdquo;.  Recall that + represents a space in a URL,
so the search was actually for &ldquo;Shell Scripting&rdquo;.
</p><p>
(Bonus tip: because we're at start=10, this means they're on the second
page of results.  So, we know the match that led this person to my
site is somewhere between #11 and #20.)
</p><p>
Okay, so now the question is, can we extract only these searches and
somehow disassemble them so we can identify the search terms quickly?
Of course we can!
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xed4580.0xfcc920"></a>
Extracting Google Searches</h2></div></div><p>
For now, let's focus only on Google's search results, but it's easy to
extend this to other search engines too.  They all use the same basic
URL structure, fortunately:</p><pre     class="programlisting">$ grep 'google.com/search' access_log | head -1
168.230.2.30 - - [11/Oct/2006:04:08:05 -0600]
 &#8618;"GET /coolweb/chap14.html HTTP/1.1" 200 31508
 &#8618;"http://www.google.com/search?q=%22important+Style+Sheet+
&#8618;Attribute.%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=" "Mozilla/4.0 (compatible;
 &#8618;MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322;
 &#8618;.NET CLR 2.0.50727; InfoPath.1)"</pre><p>
Okay, that was simple.  Now, extracting only the referrer field is easily
done with a quick call to awk:</p><pre     class="programlisting">$ grep 'google.com/search' access_log | head -1 | awk '{print $11}'
"http://www.google.com/search?q=%22important+Style+Sheet
&#8618;+Attribute.%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr="</pre><p>
Okay, closer.  The next step is to chop off the value at the ? and then
at the &amp; afterward.  There are a bunch of ways to do this, but I
use only two calls to cut, because, well, it's easy:</p><pre     class="programlisting">$ grep 'google.com/search' access_log | head -1 | awk
 &#8618;'{print $11}' | cut -d\? -f2 | cut -d\&amp; -f1
q=%22important+Style+Sheet+Attribute.%22</pre><p>
Nice! Now, we need to strip out the q= artifact from the HTML form
used on Google itself, replace all occurrences of + with a space, and
(a little bonus task) convert %22 into a double quote so the search
makes sense.  This can be done with sed:</p><pre     class="programlisting">$ grep 'google.com/search' access_log | head -1 |
 &#8618;awk '{print $11}' | cut -d\? -f2 | cut
 &#8618;-d\&amp; -f1 | sed 's/+/ /g;s/%22/"/g;s/q=//'
"important Style Sheet Attribute."</pre><p>
Let me unwrap this a bit so it's easier to see what's going on:</p><pre     class="programlisting">grep 'google.com/search' access_log | \
  head -1 | \
  awk '{print $11}' | \
  cut -d\? -f2 | cut -d\&amp; -f1 | \
  sed 's/+/ /g;s/%22/"/g;s/q=//'</pre><p>
Obviously, the head -1 is only there as we debug it, so when we pour
this into an actual shell script, we'll lose that line.  Further, let's
create a variable for the name of the access log to simplify things too:
</p><pre     class="programlisting">#!/bin/sh

ACCESSLOG="/var/logs/httpd.logs/access_log"

grep 'google.com/search' $ACCESSLOG | \
  awk '{print $11}' | \
  cut -d\? -f2 | cut -d\&amp; -f1 | \
  sed 's/+/ /g;s/%22/"/g;s/q=//'</pre><p>
We're getting there....
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xed4580.0xfcce48"></a>
Sorting and Collating</h2></div></div><p>
One of my favorite sequences in Linux is <tt  >sort | uniq -c | sort
-rn</tt>, and
that's going to come into play again here.  What does it do? It sorts
the input alphabetically, then compresses duplicate lines with a preface
count of how many matches are found.  Then, it sorts that result from greatest
matches to least.  In other words, it takes raw input and converts it into a
numerically sorted summary.
</p><p>
This sequence can be used for lots and lots of tasks, including figuring
out the dozen most common words in a document, the least frequently used
filename in a filesystem, the largest file in a directory and much more.
For our task, however, we simply want to pore through the log files and
figure out the most frequent searches that led people to our Web site:
</p><pre     class="programlisting">#!/bin/sh

ACCESSLOG="/var/logs/httpd.logs/access_log"

grep 'google.com/search' $ACCESSLOG | \
  awk '{print $11}' | \
  cut -d\? -f2 | cut -d\&amp; -f1 | \
  sed 's/+/ /g;s/%22/"/g;s/q=//' | \
  sort | \
  uniq -c | \
  sort -rn | \
  head -5</pre><p>
And the result:</p><pre     class="programlisting">$ sh google-searches.sh
 154 hl=en
  42 sourceid=navclient
  13 client=safari
   9 client=firefox-a
   3 sourceid=navclient-ff</pre><p>
Hmmm... looks like there's a problem in this script, doesn't there?
</p><p>
I'm going to wrap up here, keeping you in suspense until next month.  Why
don't you take a stab at trying to figure out what might be wrong and how
it can be fixed, and next month we'll return to this script and figure
out how to make it do what we want, not what we're saying it should do!
