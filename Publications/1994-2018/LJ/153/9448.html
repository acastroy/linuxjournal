To answer the classic question, &ldquo;Does anybody really know what time it
is?&rdquo;, our Chef's answer seems to be, &ldquo;Yes, but you need lots and lots of
clocks.&rdquo;
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc2b580.0xd23450"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Time, Fran&ccedil;ois...it's all about time. Yes, I'll explain in a bit, but
for now, time is running out and our guests will be here shortly. Just
make sure the main server is updated against the reference time
server. Forget that, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mon ami</em></span>. I'm sure it's
accurate, and besides
our guests have arrived! To the cellar,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>imm&eacute;diatement</em></span>! Head to
the South wing and bring back the 2001 Ch&acirc;teauneuf du Pape, the Guigal we
were sampling earlier this evening. I will show our guests to their tables.
</p><p>
Welcome, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span> to <span   class="emphasis"><em>Restaurant Chez
Marcel</em></span>, home of great wine,
exquisite Linux and open-source fare and, of course, world-class
guests. Please, sit down and make yourselves comfortable. I've sent
Fran&ccedil;ois to the cellar to bring back tonight's wine selection, and he should
be back shortly. You may notice an overabundance of timepieces on your
respective desktops, so I'll start with a little movie history,
by way of explanation.
</p><p>
I'm going to pretend that some of you are old enough to remember the
1960 George Pal movie version of H.G. Wells' <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Time
Machine</em></span>. In
the movie, George, the H.G. character, has a room filled with ticking
clocks of every kind: cuckoo clocks, grandfather clocks&mdash;you name
it&mdash;no digital clocks though. If you don't remember that, perhaps you
remember Robert Zemeckis' 1985's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Back to the Future</em></span>, starring
Michael J. Fox. Doc Brown, played by Christopher Lloyd, has his own
lab full of ticking clocks. Guess which one takes its inspiration from
the other? Take a look at Figure 1, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, and you'll see a
Linux desktop version of George's Victorian home or Doc Brown's
lab&mdash;depending on your video memory.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9448f1.large.jpg"><img src="9448f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Does Marcel
really know what time it is with all these clocks?
</p></div></div><p>
Some of you may be asking yourself why people would possibly want
another clock on their system. After all, both KDE and GNOME have a
clock embedded in their panels. Click on the clock, and a nice little
calendar pops up, as in my desktop screenshot (Figure 1). Clocks are cool though,
and some are more cool than others. On today's menu, I have several clocks
for your enjoyment. From the super-stylish to the decidedly strange,
you are bound to find something you like. Here is something you will
definitely like and perhaps even love. My faithful waiter has just
returned with the wine. Please pour for our guests, Fran&ccedil;ois.
</p><p>
While Fran&ccedil;ois pours the wine, I want you to take one more look at the
clock in the lower right-hand corner of my KDE kicker panel. That's
not the default KDE clock, but Fred Sch&auml;ttgen's StyleClock, a
themeable replacement that includes an alarm clock and a countdown timer
(your chef has used it to take little naps at his chair).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="9448f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. To configure the
StyleClock, simply right-click on the clock.
</p></div></div><p>
From the menu, you can set an alarm or a countdown timer. Both modes come
with some one-click presets, but both the alarm and timer allow for a custom
setting. Of course, we also can select themes for that special visual
touch. I happen to like the analog styles, but StyleClock comes with
both analog and digital themes. There's also the mandatory, super-geeky,
binary clock.
</p><p>
Speaking of binary clocks, if you've been reading this column for a
long time, you know that although I tend to run a KDE desktop, I still have
an enduring fondness for Window Maker and its trademark dock apps. It
is for this reason that I now direct your attention to Thomas
&ldquo;Engerim&rdquo;
Kuiper and Sune Fjod's wmBinClock. This slick little Window Maker
dock app can display the time vertically or horizontally (horizontal is
the default). You read the time by doing binary translation of LEDs that
are either on (1) or off (0). When reading the time horizontally, the
seconds are the two vertical rows of LEDs on the right. The two middle
LEDs are minutes and so on. This is a great little application, and no,
you don't need Window Maker to run it. It works just as well under
KDE or GNOME.
</p><p>
Maybe you aren't running a graphical display, or you have a fondness for
running things in a terminal window, but you would still like a binary
clock. Nico Golde's BinClock displays the time in a terminal
window. By default, the time is displayed similarly to wmBinClock (Figure
3), but this is a one-time display. To run the clock continuously,
you must use the -l option to loop:

<pre     class="programlisting">
binclock -l
</pre>
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="9448f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Two binary
clocks, wmBinClock and dclock, seem to be keeping good time with each
other.
</p></div></div><p>
Use the -h option to see a number of command-line
options that let you run the clock in a single-line or traditional mode
or change the color of the ones and zeros. Of course, if you want to
do straight text, you simply could type the <tt  >date</tt> command in your
terminal window. If you want a calendar for the current month, type
<tt  >cal</tt>. I do, however, want to focus on the desktop.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc2b580.0xd24108"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Clockywock</b></p><p>
On a related note, check out Thomas S. Glascock's
Clockywock at <a href="http://www.soomka.com" target="_self">www.soomka.com</a>. This is an ncurses-based
analog clock that runs in a terminal window. It's high technology meets
low.
</p></div><p>
Although binary clocks may be geeky, there's something cool about a nice,
retro, analog clock running on your desktop. To avoid looking for and
downloading anything, try the venerable Xclock that comes with your
system's X software. This baby was originally written by Tony Della Fera,
Dave Mankins and Ed Moy. To run the Xclock, simply type
<tt  >xclock</tt>
(use your Alt-F2 program launcher or the command line). By default, it
doesn't show a second hand. To activate that, type <tt  >xclock -update
1</tt>. This adds a second hand that updates every second.
</p><p>
The Xclock hasn't changed much over the years (why mess with success?), but
that lack of change got Marc Singer writing his Buici clock,
a simple, yet classy clock that does nothing other than show you the
time with a nice, red, sweep second hand. For those who like a little
more animation than just a sweep second hand, I recommend Kaz Sasayama's
rglclock. This is a rotating 3-D Mesa/OpenGL clock that you can
drag with the mouse to spin in whatever direction and at whatever speed
you like. All three of these are shown in Figure 4.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9448f4.large.jpg"><img src="9448f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Analog clocks
come in many styles, from the classic Xclock on the left, followed by
the simple but classy Buici clock in the center, and the spin-happy
rglclock to the right.
</p></div></div><p>
Taking classy to a higher plane was surely Mirco Mueller's plan when
he wrote Cairo Clock. Seriously, this is a gorgeous-looking clock
with several different faces, 12- and 24-hour formats and more. To
change a running Cairo Clock, right-click and a menu appears letting
you change not only the look of the clock, but several other attributes
as well (Figure 5). You even can change the size to whatever you like.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9448f5.large.jpg"><img src="9448f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. The highly
configurable and beautiful Cairo Clock can be changed while it is
running.
</p></div></div><p>
Although I've spent some time talking about analog clocks, there are
some pretty cool digital clocks out there as well. One of my favorites is Jamie
Zawinski's XDaliClock (Figure 6), a wonderfully strange digital
clock where the numbers don't so much change, as morph. Second by
second, and minute by minute, digits melt from one to the other. You'll
be watching this one just to see the hours change as 59 minutes and 59
seconds approaches. Use the command <tt  >xdaliclock
-cycle</tt>, and you'll
not only see the numbers morph, but the background color as well.
</p><p>
Tim Edwards' dclock, a modification of Dan Heller's original code,
is a great digital clock that looks like the old seven-segment LED display
clocks. dclock has a number of command-line arguments that let you set
the date format, the color of the LED segments (both on and off) and
more. For instance, typing <tt  >dclock -date Today is %A, %B %d -fg yellow -bg
brown -led_off brown4</tt> generates the clock in the lower part of
Figure 6. Furthermore, while the clock is running and your mouse pointer
is inside the active window, you can change various settings with single
keystrokes. For example, pressing the S key toggles the seconds
display, R reverses the video colors and /
increases the angle of the digits. Check the documentation for other one-key changes.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="9448f6.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. The very cool
XDaliClock melts away the seconds, while dclock keeps somewhat more
solid time.
</p></div></div><p>
All this talk of clocks just makes it more apparent that closing time
is fast approaching. While Fran&ccedil;ois refills your glasses a final
time, I'll leave you with perhaps the strangest clock of all, the
aptly named UFOClock by Matt Wronkiewi (Figure 7), which is also very cool and
worthy of some desktop space.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="9448f7.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 7. The UFOClock&mdash;timepiece or artifact left behind by an alien race?
</p></div></div><p>
The UFOClock displays the time of day, the phase of the moon, ratio of day
to night, time to the beginning (or end) of twilight, and the time until
the solstice or equinox. If you are asking, yes, I'm still trying to figure
it all out. The distribution bundle comes with an example configuration
file, so you can set the latitude and longitude of your home location
(so you can tell the time of day).

And now, <span   class="emphasis"><em>that</em></span> time is officially upon us. With all these clocks,
there is no way to escape the reality of closing time, and there are
still so many clocks to explore. Please, raise your glasses and let us
all drink to one another's health.
