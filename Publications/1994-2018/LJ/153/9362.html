Porting Linux to run on the Pico E12 and beyond.

In software development, possibly the most mystical and prestigious
effort is taking dead hardware and breathing life into it&mdash;porting
an operating system to a new platform&mdash;the mythical land of
wizards and gurus, the software side of <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Soul of a New
Machine</em></span>.  I had
performed almost every other software development task, and I wanted a
chance to conquer this one.
</p><p>
I had been working with Linux and open-source software for many years.  I
am a fairly competent software developer (with hardware experience), but
prior to starting the E12 port, I had done little more than tweak a Linux
driver and build custom configured kernels.  I was fortunate to have a
friend building a new company that was developing one of the smallest
embedded systems available, the Pico E12.  I practically begged for
the opportunity to put Linux on the E12.  &ldquo;A man's reach should exceed
his grasp, or what's a heaven for?&rdquo;
</p><p>
The E12 used a Xilinx Virtex 4 FX20 FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array)
that included a 300MHz PowerPC 405 processor, 128MB of memory and 64MB
of Flash ROM.  I bought a Macintosh Lombard PowerBook Laptop on eBay,
as a sort of simulator for the E12.  It also provided a way to write
for the E12 without a cross compiler.  While waiting for the E12 to
progress far enough to start working with it, I scoured the Web for
information about Linux porting and developed competence in PowerPC
assembly language.  Linux kernel programming is primarily in C, but small
parts of the Linux kernel&mdash;parts critical to putting Linux on a new
system are in assembler.  I have programmed in many assemblers&mdash;once
writing the standard C library in x86 assembler, but PPC assembler was
new and took a day or two to learn.  Linux had been ported to PowerPCs,
even a different Xilinx FPGA, long ago.

I have a reference library of software books that fills a three-car garage.
With few exceptions, they gather dust.  My primary research tool today
is a broadband Internet connection and a search engine.  There are vast
resources available on the Web for Linux developers.  The Linux Device
Driver guide&mdash;the Linux bible for device drivers&mdash;and numerous mailing
lists target all aspects of Linux systems development.  Kernel-Newbies is
a great place to start (see the on-line Resources).  There are mailing lists
for every Linux subsystem.  And, there are several Linux PowerPC mailing
lists&mdash;one specific to embedded PowerPC Linux.  At the root of this tree is LKML,
the Linux Kernel Mailing List.  LKML is Mount Olympus&mdash;the home of Linus,
and the other Linux gods and titans.  There are Web pages documenting
the experience of others porting Linux to specific boards.  Finally, the
ultimate reference&mdash;the Linux kernel source&mdash;is available on kernel.org.
</p><p>
Finally, the E12 was far enough along to start work, and I received one
via FedEx.  I had documents and specifications, but actually holding
one made it real and answered questions that could not be read from
the specifications.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x116a580.0x1262768"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>The E12</b></p><p>
The E12 is a Compact Flash card&mdash;exactly like those in
many digital cameras.  It has only two connectors: a CF bus connection
on one end and a 15-pin miniature connector on the other.  There are
no other external connections.  The E12 is based on an FPGA.  There are a few additional components, and a
few fixed elements, such as the PPC405 CPU on the FPGA.  A large part of
the hardware is programmable.  Most external connections are through the
FPGA.  Almost none of the &ldquo;hardware&rdquo; has form or meaning until the FPGA
is loaded.  Changing the bit file on the fly drops in a completely new
hardware design.  Welcome to a new era&mdash;even the hardware is software.
The BIT image&mdash;in essence the program for the FPGA&mdash;is created by
an FPGA developer, programmed into the Flash ROM and automagically
loaded into the FPGA on power-up.  Once this BIT image
&ldquo;boots&rdquo;, hardware
is created in the FPGA.  Now, the pins on the connectors have meaning.
The 15-pin connector provides three external connections for internal devices.
It supports Ethernet, serial and JTAG connections through custom cables.
The CF connector provides a bidirectional interface to a host&mdash;in most
instances using a CardBus or PCMCIA adapter.  Most of the pins on either
connector can be whatever the FPGA programmer chooses to make them.
Fielded systems may be plugged in to a CF connector solely to get power.
E12's are used in daughter cards in typical embedded applications, on
bus boards in high-performance computers in clusters and for
applications, such as image processing or code cracking.  They also are being used in
applications with no operating system or extremely minimal operating
systems.
</p></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9362f2.large.jpg"><img src="9362f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. E12 in PCMCIA Adapter
</p></div></div><p>
Pico provided tools for hosted development.  The standard E12 BIT file
provided a CF interface with a simulated LPT3/JTAG port, a 512-word
bidirectional communications FIFO called the keyhole, and host access to
the Flash ROM.  Pico also provided host-side Windows and Linux drivers
that allowed reading and writing the Flash ROM.  The normal FPGA BIT image
contains a very small PPC monitor program that can perform a small number
of tasks&mdash;most of which rely heavily on support from the host.  One of
those functions is the ability to load two types of files into the E12.
It can load a new BIT image or load and execute binary ELF files&mdash;a
simple bootloader.  This saved me the difficulty of porting a bootloader, such as U-Boot.  The Linux kernel was the most complex ELF file
that the E12 monitor program had loaded to this point, and a few tweaks
were needed to the loader.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x116a580.0x1262be0"></a>
Getting a Pulse</h2></div></div><p>
My first objective was to write the proverbial &ldquo;Hello World&rdquo; program
for the E12.  I spent a few days and wrote two different &ldquo;Hello
World&rdquo;
programs: one for the keyhole FIFO and one for Xilinx uartlite port.
</p><p>
Now, I was ready to attack Linux.  I decided to start with Linux
2.6.  There were numerous issues&mdash;good reasons, as well as respected
and conflicting opinions favoring both 2.4 and 2.6.  I elected to
use Linux 2.6, because I eventually was going to have to move to
2.6 anyway.  Initially, I used the PowerBook to configure and build
my Linux kernel for the Pico E12.  This allowed me to start without
cross compilers. Eventually, I switched to building inside of a coLinux
virtual machine on Windows hosting the E12.  Most Pico clients are doing
Windows-hosted development.  It was critical that everything work in
that environment.  Besides, building a PowerPC Linux kernel in a Linux
virtual machine running Windows and loading it into a PowerPC, means
that Linux outnumbers Windows 2 to 1 inside my laptop.
</p><p>
I used the Xilinx ML300 as a template to create a new Linux BSP
(Broad Support Package).  I grepped the kernel source for all
references to the Xilinx ML300.  I copied and renamed all ML300-related files to new files for the Pico E12.  There were four
completely unique files for the E12:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
arch/ppc/platforms/4xx/pic0-e1x.c: board-specific setup code.
</p></li><li><p>
arch/ppc/platforms/4xx/pic0-e1x.h: headers and data structures for the
board-specific setup
code.
</p></li><li><p>
arch/ppc/platforms/4xx/xparameters/xparameters_pic0-e1x.h: a set
of hardware definitions created by the Xilinx software that created the
bit image for the FPGA.
</p></li><li><p>
arch/ppc/configs/defconfig_pic0-e1x: a default
Linux configuration file for the E12.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
There were major similarities between the Xilinx ML300, but there were
a few specific differences.
The E12 deliberately implements a lot less hardware.  The E12's purpose
is to provide a very minimal base platform, with the largest percentage
of FPGA left for the client.  The minimal useful Linux configuration must
have either Ethernet, a serial port or the keyhole port.  The default
E12 does not have an interrupt controller&mdash;the PPC405 provides a timer
interrupt that does not require a PIC.  The E12 also uses the Xilinx
uartlite uart, not the much larger and more common 16550 uart.  There
were no Linux drivers for the uartlite.  Two other ML300 files, generic
support for Virtex FPGAs required minor modifications.
</p><p>
The next major issue was learning the Linux configuration system.  I was
not able to find much documentation.  With Linux kernel programming,
the two primary resources are the Linux source itself and the mailing
lists.  Sometimes, there is excellent documentation for a system; sometimes
there is nothing.  Sometimes I found documentation in some obscure corner
of the Web&mdash;after I had figured things out on my own.  I had to develop
enough understanding of the kernel build system to add a new board,
some new configuration options and a few new drivers to the build system.
</p><p>
The first element is the Kconfig files in most of the Linux source
directories.  Kconfig is a cross between a very, very simple scripting
language and a menu construction language.  The entries in Kconfig files
determine the menu structure and choices that you get when you execute
any of the Linux menu configuration build options&mdash;make oldconfig,
make menuconfig, make xconfig.
</p><p>
I had to create a new menu item under the ppc 4xx menu for the Pico
E12, menu items in the drivers/serial/Kconfig file for the uartlite and
keyhole serial ports, and a small collection of menu items for other
options.  The syntax for the Kconfig items I needed to create could be
easily worked out by inspection and a small amount of trial and error.
I copied blocks for similar objects, made name changes as needed,
and without too much effort, it worked.  Inside the .config file, source
code and Makefiles, the configuration items defined in Kconfig files are
prefixed with CONFIG_.  After the Kconfig entries were created, entries
needed to be added to the matching Makefiles.  This mostly involved
copying similar objects and making name changes, and except for a few
very complex choices, was pretty easy.
</p><p>
So far, I had done very little actual coding.  Most of what I had done
was remove ML300-specific code from the new Pico E12 copy.  I also copied
the Xilinx PIC driver and created a stripped-out dummy PIC driver.
</p><p>
I was now able to build a Linux kernel for the Pico E12, without serial
or Ethernet drivers.  I still needed to write two serial device drivers:
uartlite.c and keyhole.c.  I deliberately chose to use the 8250 driver as
a template&mdash;8250s and their numerous successors are ubiquitous, probably
making up more serial devices than all others combined.  I assumed that
the 8250 driver would be, by far, the most stable and well-debugged
serial driver.  Also, many 8250-based systems are known to have problems
with interrupts, so I knew that the Linux 8250 driver had to work without
interrupts.  This turned out to be a bad choice.  The Linux 8250 driver
is probably, by far, the most complex Linux serial driver.
</p><p>
Eventually, I remodeled my drivers based on the m32r_sio driver.  I did
not know much about the m32r_sio, but the driver was clean and simple,
had all the features I needed and none that I did not.  I also had to create
a set of serial port headers for the keyhole and the uartlite, defining
the uart registers and the bits within the registers.  I also modeled
these directly on the 8250, which was a much better decision.  I have been
writing uart code, including software uarts, for a long time.  Writing the
device-specific code for the keyhole and uartlite was simple.  Fewer than
a dozen lines of code were needed to send and receive a character.  The
uartlite and keyhole, like most Linux serial devices, do not have modem
control and operate at a single speed.  The few lines of code needed to
send a character were also useful elsewhere for debugging.  The keyhole
is not a real serial device, but it can be made to look like one to
Linux and then used as a console when the E12 is hosted.  This was
very important.
</p><p>
Connecting a rat's nest of cables to the host computer and to the tiny
external connector on the E12 for Ethernet and the uartlite serial port
created problems.  The time testing every cable connection to assure
that one had not come loose prior to trying a new kernel was greater
than the time writing and testing code.  I wore out or damaged several
external connectors before I was done.  When using the keyhole, all the
connections between the E12 and the host are internal.  It was also useful
to send debugging through one device using the other as the console.
The keyhole had one other attribute that came in extremely handy&mdash;I
could write 16- or 32-bit values to one register as a single output
instruction and see the data on the host side.  This was critical when
debugging PowerPC assembly code.  Inserting code to display a value or
trace execution needed to be done using few instructions, minimal side
effects and assuming very little was working.  Outputting values directly
to the keyhole port became my equivalent to flashing an LED connected
to an I/O port.  It was equally simple and slightly more powerful.
</p><p>
To some extent, all software development is working in the dark, but
embedded board bring-up is particularly so.  Output is a flashlight letting
you see a little bit of what is going on.  The E12 has provisions for
JTAG debugging, either through the emulated parallel port or the 15-pin
connector.  The Linux kernel provides kgdb and xmon support.  These presume
support on the host side and working hardware and drivers on the target.
Linux also provides options for outputting progress and debugging prior
to loading the console driver.  These were limited primarily to 8250-compatible uarts.  I added uartlite and keyhole ports to the early
text debugging devices.  Aside from persuading Linux to use it, this
primarily involved supplying a few lines of code to output a character.
I have the skills needed to use debugging tools from logic analyzers to
gdb.  Most of the time, I find that sophisticated tools provide massive
amounts of additional information, obfuscating the problem rather than
revealing it.  But debugging is a religious art with competing sects,
each with their own dogma.
</p><p>
Once I had working output routines for the uartlite and the keyhole,
a stripped version of the ML300 code for the E12 and modified Kconfig
and Makefiles for the E12, I was ready to build a kernel and try it.  The
normal Linux build process for the PowerPC leaves a kernel image in ELF
format in arch/ppc/boot/images as zImage.elf.  I copied this from the
PowerBook I was using to build Linux kernels onto the host computer for
the E12, and I used PicoUtil to replace the current Linux kernel image on
the E12 Flash.  I used the E12's monitor to execute the ELF file.  The
Linux boot process is similar across platforms and boot methods.  In
my instance, the zImage.elf file loaded at 0x40000000 and started
with a small wrapper that did some early hardware setup, decompressed
and relocated the actual Linux kernel and then jumped to the early Linux
setup code.  I copied the simple character output routines for the
keyhole and uartlite into the files arch/ppc/boot/simple/keyhole_tty.c
and uartlite_tty.c, and these provided debugging output during the
wrapper execution.
</p><p>
My first big problem was that the memory map of the E12 had the Flash
starting at physical address 0 and the RAM at a higher physical
address.  Advice I received on the Linux PPC embedded mailing list
suggested I really, really did not want to try to port Linux to
a board without RAM at 0, if it was humanly possible to persuade the
board designers to change the memory map.  There have been previous and
subsequent efforts to modify Linux to support systems where RAM does
not start at physical address 0.  I believe that is less of an issue now.
Still, I took the advice, and after a few hours of begging, Pico agreed to
re-organize memoryped to 0.  The soft hardware meant that they were able to
provide me with a new bit image with RAM mapped to 0 within a few hours.
</p><p>
For a while, I also ran my own customized version of the monitor program,
passing a board information structure Linux expected with a small amount
of information on memory size, processor speed and the mac address to
use for the NIC.  Eventually, these modifications were incorporated into
the standard Pico monitor.
</p><p>
The best documentation for the boot process as it applied to my system
was in the MontaVista comments at the top of xilinx_ml300.c.  These did
not cover the decompression and relocation wrapper, but exposed the rest
of the boot process.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x116a580.0x12635d8"></a>
First Breath</h2></div></div><p>
The next significant problem was in arch/ppc/kernel/head_4xx.S.  Here,
Linux does basic MMU and exception handling setup, then uses an
rfi instruction to transition from &ldquo;real&rdquo; mode to
&ldquo;virtual&rdquo; mode
and continue with the kernel initialization.  I was able to execute
right up to that rfi.  I was able to check all the obvious conditions
for successfully executing the rfi.  However, I never ended up at
start_here&mdash;where the rfi should have continued.  I spent days
developing an understanding of the Linux Virtual Memory system&mdash;most of
the documentation x86-specific.  And, I became more knowledgeable about
the PowerPC MMU, a fairly simple device compared to the x86 MMU.  It
is basically a 64-entry address translation table.  Virtual memory
OSes inevitably use more than 64 virtual-physical addresses mappings,
region sizes and privileges.  A reference to a virtual address not in
the MMU, or one that violates the privilege bits set for that entry,
causes an exception, and it is the OS's responsibility to sort it out
using whatever algorithms, methods and data that suits it.  The fault
processing might take longer, as it is not handled in hardware, but it
is more flexible, adaptable and less resource-intensive.  There are no
gigantic fixed mapping tables in dedicated regions of physical memory,
as required on some other processors.
</p><p>
But, I still could not figure out why the rfi was not executing
correctly.  I added all kinds of additional entries to the MMU, assuming
that I was actually successfully switching to virtual mode but unable to
communicate, because my I/O ports were no longer accessible.  I sprinkled
the equivalent of &ldquo;I am here&rdquo; debugging markers throughout head_4xx.S
and got my first clue.  I was continuously looping through an exception
handler.  Every time I switched to virtual mode, I lost control of the
PPC, regaining it again in real mode in the exception handler.  I had
the critical clues to figure things out, but I was still mystified.
</p><p>
Every problem can be solved if it can be divided into smaller
pieces.  Eventually, I realized that it was possible to transition from
real to virtual mode in smaller increments rather than all at once as
the rfi did.  I was able to turn on address translation for data and
turn it back off without ill effects.  I was able to add 1-1 physical
to virtual address mappings for my keyhole debug port to the MMU, turn
it on to do some output and turn it off.  With more effort, I was able to
turn on instruction address translation execute code and turn it back off.
</p><p>
That is when it finally dawned on me that the problem had nothing to do
with switching from real to virtual mode, but that something else being
set by the rfi must be enabling an exception that was not occurring
otherwise.  So, I tested the bits in MSR_KERNEL&mdash;the PPC machine status
register value Linux uses&mdash;one bit at a time, until I discovered that
anytime I set MSR_CE, enabling machine check exceptions, I lost control.
I redefined the macro that set MSR_KERNEL so that it did not set MSR_CE
for the E12 and reported to Pico that I thought there was a hardware
problem in the E12.  Pico never found the problem, but six months later,
updates to Xilinx's firmware building blocks corrected the problem.
</p><p>
After working around the machine-check problem, I suddenly found Linux
booting all the way through to setting up the serial/console driver.  I
was stalled for a few days while I actually finished the serial drivers
for the keyhole and uartlite.  Linux needs a place to hold the root filesystem.  There are many possibilities.  Frequently, the norm for embedded
systems is to place the root filesystem for an embedded development
environment on an NFS share on another machine.  This requires a working
Ethernet driver.  My confidence in my serial drivers was not high at that
point.  Further, the Pico minimalist mantra does not include networking
as part of the base Linux, and many E12/Linux applications do not need it.
</p><p>
The root filesystem can be on a hard disk (none readily available in
the E12) or in Flash.  The E12 uses a very simple Pico File System, but one
that is not suited for a root filesystem.  Another alternative was to
put the root filesystem on a RAM disk.  Linux provided the ability to
use and populate a RAM filesystem as an intermediate step in the boot
process.  One objective was to migrate as much of the Linux boot code
out of the kernel to user space as possible.  Linux systems going back
many years boot through initrd, then execute a pivot_root to switch the
root filesystem from the initrd RAM disk to the disk-based root filesystem.  Using initrd requires the loader to copy the compressed Linux
image and the separate image of the contents of the initial RAM disk into
memory, and provides Linux with a pointer to the initial RAM disk data.
</p><p>
Linux 2.6 introduced a new variation&mdash;initramfs. One difference
between initramfs and initrd was that with initramfs, the contents of
the initial root RAM disk filesystem were compressed into the Linux
image during build, so there was only one file&mdash;in my case an ELF
file&mdash;to load. This meant that the Pico monitor would not need changes.
This initramfs approach proved to be extremely clean, simple and easy
to use.  Getting it working was complex and time consuming, because
initramfs is fairly new.  The primary documentation is a collection of
posts to LKML.  To create an initramfs for the Pico E12, I determined
that I needed to create a directory on my build system and populate it
with the files for the root filesystem.  I enabled the initramfs option
using menuconfig and told menuconfig where to find the directory that
represented my root filesystem.  There are a few other ways to do this, but that
was the simplest.  Initially, I decompressed the initramfs from the Gentoo
Linux install on my PowerBook.  I eventually switched to a cross-compiled
BusyBox when I erroneously thought I might be having problems with my boot
image, because the binaries were built for the PowerBook, not a PPC405.

First Words</h2></div></div><p>
After this, I hit my next problem.  Linux was booting all the way though
to executing /init where it just stopped.  I wrote a trivial version
of ls and included it in the kernel, calling it prior to exec'ing
/init.  Everything was fine.  But on exec'ing /init, Linux became deaf and
dumb.  Debugging can be particularly difficult when the horses look like
zebras.  I spent a lot of time tracing through the Linux exec process,
which was remarkably ingenious in many instances, doing minimal work
and loading a process through page faults.  Unfortunately, this made
tracing what was happening very difficult and led me once again to
the (almost) erroneous conclusion that I had a virtual memory problem.
I wrote a Linux version of &ldquo;Hello World&rdquo; in PPC assembler with no external
libraries and was able to execute it as /init.  But, I could not exec
anything more complex.  I eventually found and enabled system call tracing
and was able to watch as /init executed.  The system always died while
in the middle of virtual memory operations.  I ended up with failure
cases when Linux would go dumb right in the middle of outputting some
debug string&mdash;again, always during a VM operation.  I could actually
change the point of failure by inserting additional debugging.  I was
a victim of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle&mdash;observation changed
the observed behavior.
</p><p>
I was sure something was wrong with my serial drivers, despite the fact
that this did not make sense, but how else could output stop in the
middle of a string? All the critical clues were present to solve this
problem, though one of them was buried as an artifact of the machine-check problem.  This was a VM problem, in a twisted sense, and it was
a serial driver problem.  I will not confess to how long it took for
the answer to dawn on me.  Let's just say I rewrote the serial drivers
several times before I saw that although the serial drivers requested
and saved a virtual address for the memory mapped hardware&mdash;partly as an
error induced by using the 8250 serial driver as a starting point&mdash;the
virtual address for the serial port was subsequently getting overwritten
by the physical address of the port.  Because in my efforts to debug the
machine-check problem I put a 1-1 physical-virtual mapping directly
into the MMU Translation Lookaside Buffer, I/O continued to work until
the Linux VM system overwrote my temporary TLB entry.  After recognizing
this, it took less than 30 minutes to correct, and I was able to boot up
Linux to a bash prompt.

The End&mdash;the Beginning</h2></div></div><p>
Little matches the thrill of seeing a new machine reach a shell prompt and
knowing I made it happen.  I had completed my base Pico E12 Linux port.
Well, that is not quite true&mdash;no port is ever finished.  When I completed
my Pico E12 port, I was unaware of any other port of Linux to a Xilinx
V4 chipset.  Subsequently, a Linux port for the Xilinx ML403 by Grant
Likely started working its way through Linux embedded PPC development
trees and has been accepted into the distribution kernel.  The Pico E12 is
distinct from the ML403, but they are more similar to each other than the
older ML300 from which I started.  Grant's ML403 port reflected changes
that were impacting the whole Linux PPC development tree, so I made my
Pico E12 port track those developments.

I have depended on the keyhole port for hosted development work, and
as a result, the keyhole serial driver gradually has grown smaller and
more consistent with the direction in which Linux serial drivers seem
to be headed.  I will have to update the uartlite driver to catch up.
</p><p>
I am currently on my third iteration of a Linux network driver for the E12,
and Pico is on its second iteration of the underlying network hardware.  The
new network hardware is interrupt-driven requiring a PIC.
</p><p>
A second Pico board has matured, and with minimal changes, the Pico E12
port has evolved into the Pico E1X port.

I am working to get the Linux Memory Technology Device (MTD) system to work
with the Pico Flash.  This is complicated by the fact that the Flash in
Pico hardware can be read and written to by both Linux and the host,
and Pico is eventually planning on Flash device sizes that should be
windowed into Linux memory instead of mapped in their entirety.
</p><p>
Once the Linux MTD work is completed, Pico wants a Linux (and Windows)
filesystem driver for its simple filesystem&mdash;PicoFS.
</p><p>
Pico is considering changing the keyhole port so that on the host
side (and possibly the target side), it sufficiently and closely resembles
an 8250-compatible UART to use only the OS's native serial drivers.
</p><p>
Later, Pico developed a daughterboard for the E12 called the Little
Brother Board that allows using the E12 in a non-hosted environment and
includes three USB ports, an LED and several other hardware components.  In
one application, the E12/LBB combination is being used as a very
high-performance Webcamera.

The E12 also can be hosted as a grid on a bus board called the
supercluster.  Currently, that configuration is used for blazingly fast
code cracking, using FPGA hardware without OS support, but Linux HPC
support is on the wish list.  Higher performance can no longer be achieved
simply by doubling the clock every 18 months.  Clusters are a significant
alternative; 16 E12s provide enormous horsepower while occupying little
space and consuming little power.
</p><p>
There have been several iterative releases to Linux 2.6 since the E12
port, and occasionally, these require changes to the port.
</p><p>
I would like to get the Pico E1X port and drivers I wrote for it included
into the Linux distribution kernel.  Within the Linux embedded PPC
mailing list, there has been some interest in seeing that happen.  The
code has been moved into git to make it easier to merge with new Linux
iterations and to produce patch files for submission to LKML.

I got Linux up and running on new hardware, and other opportunities with
other hardware and with other embedded OSes have occurred.  Board bring-up
for the E12 was hard.  Somewhere on Kernel-Newbies I read advice to
newbie kernel hackers to lurk on the mailing lists for a few years
before attempting anything serious&mdash;advice I am glad I did not take.  I
did not start this as a complete novice.  I had a lot of experience that
made this much easier.  It was thrilling, mythical and magical.  I can
call myself a Linux Kernel Developer&mdash;though maybe not too loudly around
Linus Torvalds, Andrew Morton or Alan Cox.  But, it was not more difficult than
many other software tasks&mdash;just more rewarding.
