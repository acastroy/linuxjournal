Fine-tune and firewall your UML guest systems.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x158f580.0x16873f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
In the last two Paranoid Penguin columns, I walked you through the process of
building a virtual network server using User-Mode Linux.  We built both
host and guest kernels, obtained a prebuilt root filesystem image,
configured networking on the host, and when we left off last month,
we finally had booted our guest kernel with bridged networking, ready for
configuration, patching and server software installation.
</p><p>
This month, I tie up some loose ends in our example guest
system's startup and configuration, show you the uml_moo command,
demonstrate how to write firewall rules on your UML host system, offer
some miscellaneous security tips and give some pointers on creating your
own root filesystem image.  And, can you believe we will have scratched
only the surface of User-Mode Linux, even after three articles?
Hopefully,
we'll have scratched deeply enough for you to be off to a good start!
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x158f580.0x1687558"></a>
Guest System Configuration</h2></div></div><p>
You may recall that last time we set up bridged networking on our host,
creating a local tunnel interface called uml-conn0 that we bridged
to the host system's &ldquo;real&rdquo; eth0 interface.  If you don't have last
month's column, my procedure was based on the one by David Cannings (see
the on-line Resources).  When we then started up our host
(User-Mode) kernel, we mapped a virtual eth0 on the guest to uml-conn0
via a kernel parameter, like so:</p><pre     class="programlisting">umluser@host$ ./debkern ubd0=debcow,debroot
 &#8618;root=/dev/ubda eth0=tuntap,uml-conn0</pre><p>
The last parameter, obviously, contains the networking magic:
eth0=tuntap,uml-conn0.  It can be translated to &ldquo;the guest kernel's eth0
interface is the host system's tunnel/tap interface uml-conn0&rdquo;.  This is
important to understand; to the host (real) system, the guest's Ethernet
interface is called uml-conn0, but to the guest system itself, its
Ethernet interface is plain-old eth0.
</p><p>
Therefore, if you run an iptables (firewall) rule set on either host
or guest (I strongly recommend you do so at least on the host), any
rules that use interface names as sources or targets must take this
difference in nomenclature into account.  We'll discuss some example
host firewall rules shortly, but we're not quite done with guest-kernel
startup parameters yet.
</p><p>
Going back to that startup line, we've got definitions of our virtual
hard drive (ubd0, synonymous with ubda), our path to virtual root
and, of course, our virtual Ethernet interface.  But what about memory?
</p><p>
On my OpenSUSE 10.1 host system, running a UML Debian guest with the
above startup line resulted in a default memory size of about 29MB&mdash;pretty puny by modern standards, especially if I want that guest system
to run real-world, Internet-facing network services.  Furthermore, I've
got an entire gigabyte of physical RAM on my host system to allocate;
I easily can spare 256MB of RAM for my guest system.
</p><p>
To do so, all I have to do is pass the parameter mem=256M to the guest
kernel, like so:</p><pre     class="programlisting">umluser@host$ ./debkern mem=256M ubd0=debcow,debroot
 &#8618;root=/dev/ubda eth0=tuntap,uml-conn0</pre><p>
Obviously enough, you can specify however much more or less than that as
you like, and you can allocate different amounts of RAM for multiple guests
running on a single host (perhaps 128M for your virtual DNS server,
but 512M for your virtual Web server, for example).  Just be sure to leave
enough non-guest-allocated RAM for your host system to do what
<span   class="emphasis"><em>it</em></span>
needs to do.
</p><p>
Speaking of which, you'll save a lot of RAM on your host system by not
running the X Window System, which I've always recommended against running
on hardened servers anyhow.  The X server on my test host uses around
100MB, with actual desktop managers requiring more.  On top of this, the X
Window System has a history of security vulnerabilities with varying degrees
of exploitability by remote attackers (remember, a &ldquo;local&rdquo; vulnerability
ceases being local the moment any non-local user starts a shell).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x158f580.0x1687ad8"></a>
Managing COW Files</h2></div></div><p>
If, as I recommended last month, you run your UML guest with a Copy on
Write (COW) file, you may be wondering whether your UML guest-kernel
startup line is the only place you can manage COW files.  (A COW file
is created automatically when you specify a filename for one in your
ubd0=... parameter.)
</p><p>
Actually, the uml-utilities package includes two standalone commands
for managing COW files: uml_moo and uml_mkcow.  Of the two, uml_moo is
the most likely to be useful to you.  You can use uml_moo to merge all
the filesystem changes contained in a COW file into its parent root
filesystem image.
</p><p>
For example, if I run the example UML guest kernel startup command
described earlier, and from within that UML guest session I configure
networking, apply all the latest security patches, install BIND v9 and
configure it and finally achieve a &ldquo;production-ready&rdquo; state, I may
decide that it's time to take a snapshot of the UML guest by merging
all those changes (written, so far, only into the file debcow) into
the actual filesystem image (debroot).  To do so, I'd use this command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">umluser@host$ uml_moo ./debcow newdebroot</pre><p>
The first argument
you specify to uml_moo is the COW file you want to merge.  Because a COW
file contains the name of the filesystem image to which it corresponds, you
don't have to specify this.  Normally, however, you should specify the
name of the new filesystem image you want to create.
</p><p>
My example uml_moo command, therefore, will leave the old root filesystem
image debroot intact (maybe it's also being used by other UML guests,
or maybe I simply want to preserve a clean image), creating a new
filesystem named newdebroot that contains my fully configured and
updated root filesystem.
</p><p>
If I want to do a hard merge, however, which replaces the old filesystem
image with the merged one (with the same filename as before), perhaps
because my hard disk is too full for extra image files, I'd instead use
<tt  >uml_moo -d ./debcow</tt> (the -d stands for destructive merge).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x158f580.0x1687ef8"></a>
iptables and UML</h2></div></div><p>
Whether you chroot your User-Mode guests, and whether you use
SELinux, depends on how deep you want your layers of security
to go and how much time and effort you're able to expend.  However, I
strongly recommend that on any Internet-facing, bridged User-Mode Linux
system, you use iptables on your UML host to restrict your guest systems'
network behavior.
</p><p>
On the one hand, if your UML system already resides outside a firewall
in a DMZ network (as should any Internet server), you're already
protecting your internal network from the possibility of a network
server compromise.  However, there's really no good reason not to take the
opportunity also to use UML-host iptables rules to reduce the ability of
an attacker to use one compromised UML guest to attack other UML guests,
the UML host itself or other systems in your DMZ network.
</p><p>
There are two categories of rules I strongly recommend you
consider.  First, anti-IP-spoofing rules can help ensure that every
packet sent by each guest bears the source IP address you actually
assigned to that guest, and not a forged (spoofed) source IP.  These are
low-maintenance rules that you'll have to think about only at setup time,
unless for some reason you change a guest system's IP address.
</p><p>
Suppose you have a UML system whose IP address is 10.1.1.10 and whose
tun/tap interface is (from the host's perspective) uml-conn0.  The
anti-spoofing rules you install on the UML host might therefore look
like that shown in Listing 1.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x158f580.0x1688108"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Listing 1. Anti-IP-Spoofing Rules</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">iptables -A FORWARD -m physdev --physdev-in uml-conn0
 &#8618;-s ! 10.1.1.10 -j LOG --log-prefix "Spoof from uml-conn0"

iptables -A FORWARD -m physdev --physdev-in uml-conn0
 &#8618;-s ! 10.1.1.10 -j DROP</pre></div><p>
The first rule logs the spoofed packets; the second one actually drops
them.  As you may know, the LOG target doesn't cause packets to cease
being evaluated against subsequent iptables rules, but the DROP target
does, so the LOG rule must come before the DROP rule.
</p><p>
Due to space constraints, I can't launch into a primer on how to write
iptables rules or how they're managed on your Linux distribution of
choice.  But, I can talk about the bridge-specific magic in Listing 1:
the physdev iptables module and the --physdev-in parameter.
</p><p>
Usually, we use iptables' -i and -o flags to denote which network
interface packets are received and sent from, respectively.  However,
when writing iptables rules on a system doing bridged networking, we
need to be a bit more precise, especially when we're also using tun/tap
interfaces, as eth0 then takes on a different role than in normal
Layer 3 (routed) networking.
</p><p>
Therefore, where we might normally use <tt  >-i
uml-conn0</tt> in a rule,
on a bridging host, we should instead use <tt  >-m physdev --physdev-in
uml-conn0</tt>.  Similarly, instead of <tt  >-o
uml-conn0</tt>, we'd use <tt  >-m physdev
--physdev-out uml-conn0</tt>.  As with other module invocations, you
need only one instance of <tt  >-m physdev</tt> if a given
iptables rule uses both the
--physdev-in and --physdev-out rules.
</p><p>
After setting up a pair of anti-IP-spoofing rules, you also should create
a set of &ldquo;service-specific&rdquo; rules that actually govern how your guest
system may interact with the rest of the world, including other guest
systems and the host itself.
</p><p>
Remember that in our example scenario the guest system is a DNS
server.  Therefore, I'm going to enforce this logical firewall policy:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
The UML guest may accept DNS queries (both TCP and UDP).
</p></li><li><p>
The UML guest may recurse DNS queries against upstream (external)
servers.
</p></li><li><p>
The UML guest may send its log messages to a log server (called
logserver).
</p></li><li><p>
The UML host may initiate SSH sessions on the UML guest.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
Listing 2 shows iptables commands that could enforce this policy.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x158f580.0x1688a50"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Listing 2. Service Rules for the UML Guest</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">iptablee -A FORWARD -m state --state
 &#8618;RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT

iptables -A FORWARD -m physdev --physdev-out uml-conn0
 &#8618;-p udp --dport 53 -m state --state NEW -j ACCEPT

 &#8618;-p tcp --dport 53 -m state --state NEW -j ACCEPT

iptables -A FORWARD -j DROP

iptables -A OUTPUT -d 10.1.1.10 -p tcp --dport 22 -m
 &#8618;state --state NEW -j ACCEPT</pre></div><p>
Listing 2 has two parts: a complete set of FORWARD rules and a single
OUTPUT rule.  Because, logically speaking, UML guest systems are
&ldquo;external&rdquo;
to the UML host's kernel, interactions between UML guests and each other,
and also interactions between UML guests and the rest of the world,
are handled via FORWARD rules.  Interactions between UML guests and the
underlying host system, however, are handled by INPUT and OUTPUT rules
(just like any other interactions between external systems and the
host system).
</p><p>
Because all of my logical rules except #4 are enforced by iptables FORWARD
rules, Listing 2 shows my UML host's complete FORWARD table, including an
initial rule allowing packets associated with already-approved sessions,
and a final pair of &ldquo;default log &amp; drop&rdquo; rules.  Note my use of the physdev
module; I like to use interface-specific rather than IP-specific rules
wherever possible, as that tends to make it harder for attackers to
play games with IP headers.
</p><p>
The last rule in Listing 2 should, in actual practice, appear somewhere
in the middle of a similar block of OUTPUT rules (beginning with an
allow-established rule and ending with a default log/drop rule pair),
but I wanted to illustrate that where the source or destination of a
rule involves the UML host system, you can write an ordinary OUTPUT or
INPUT rule (respectively) rather than a FORWARD rule.
</p><p>
Because your UML host is acting as an Ethernet bridge, you can write
still-more-granular and low-level firewall rules&mdash;even filtering by
MAC addresses, the ARP protocol and so forth.  But for that level of
filtering, you'll need to install the ebtables command.  iptables rules
of the type I've just described should, however, suffice for most
bastion-host situations.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x158f580.0x1a81068"></a>
Miscellaneous Security Notes</h2></div></div><p>
If you patched your UML host's kernel with the SKAS patch, you've already
got reasonably good assurance that an attacker who compromises a UML
guest won't be able to do much, if anything, on the host system.  However,
I'm not one to argue against paranoia, so I also recommend you chroot
your UML guest system.  This is described in detail on the UML Wiki (see
Resources).  And, what about shell access
to your UML guests? There are various ways to access &ldquo;local
consoles&rdquo;.  You
get one automatically when you start your UML guest from a UML
host shell manually&mdash;after your UML kernel loads, you'll be presented with a
login prompt.
</p><p>
That doesn't do you much good if you start your UML guest automatically
from a script, however.  The &ldquo;Device Inputs&rdquo; page on the User-Mode Linux
home page (see Resources) describes
how to map UML guest virtual serial lines to UML host consoles.  For me,
however, it's easiest simply to install SSH on my UML guest system,
configure and start its SSH d&aelig;mon, and create a firewall rule that
allows connections to it only from my UML host.
</p><p>
Generally speaking, you want to use the same security controls and tools
on your UML guest (tripwire, chrooted applications, SELinux, tcpwrappers
and so on) as you would on any other bastion server.

Building Your Own Root Filesystem Image</h2></div></div><p>
Describing in detail the process of building your own root filesystem
image from scratch would require its own article (one which I may yet
write).  Suffice it to say, the process is all but identical to that
of creating your own bootable Linux CD or DVD, without the final step
of burning your image file to some portable medium.  There are three
major steps:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Create an empty filesystem image file with <tt  >dd</tt>.
</p></li><li><p>
Format the image file.
</p></li><li><p>
Mount it to a directory via loopback.
</p></li><li><p>
Install Linux into it.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
The first three steps are the easiest.  To create a 1GB ext3 image file,
I'd run the commands shown in Listing 3 as root.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x158f580.0x1a817a0"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Listing 3. Making and Mounting an Empty Filesystem Image</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">dd if=/dev/zero of=./mydebroot bs=1024K count=1000
mkfs.ext3 ./mydebroot
mkdir /mnt/debian
mount -o loop ./mydebroot /mnt/debian</pre></div><p>
Installing Linux into this directory gets a bit more involved, but if
you've got a SUSE host system, the Software module in YaST includes a
wizard called &ldquo;Installation into Directory&rdquo;.  Like other YaST modules,
this is an easy-to-use GUI.
</p><p>
Similarly, if you run Debian, you can use the command
<tt  >debootstrap</tt>.  See
Michael McCabe and Demetrios Dimatos' handy article &ldquo;Installing User
Mode Linux&rdquo; for detailed instructions on using debootstrap to populate
your root filesystem image.
</p><p>
See the UML Wiki for some pointers to similar utilities in other
distributions.  The Linux Bootdisk HOWTO (see Resources),
although not
specific to UML, is also useful.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x158f580.0x1a81b68"></a>
Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
I hope you're well on your way to building your own
virtual network servers using User-Mode Linux! The two most
important sources of UML information are the UML home page
and the UML Wiki (see Resources).  Those and the other Web sites
mentioned in this piece should help you go much further with User-Mode
Linux than I can take you in an introductory series of articles like
this.  Have fun, and be safe!
