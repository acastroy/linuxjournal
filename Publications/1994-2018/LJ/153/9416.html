R Cubed Technologies makes a Linux dream machine out of an ASUS notebook.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xaf0580.0xbe8298"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Although you certainly can pick up a laptop from number of mainline PC makers
and install Linux yourself, this remains a risky proposition.  Whether
it's fun or frustrating depends on the distro, the machine and, of course,
your skills.  The graphics adapters, chipsets, power-saving features and
other elements make laptops inherently more complex than your standard
desktop.  Many of us look forward to the challenge of calling on our
ingenuity and resources, such as the Linux on Laptops site (<a href="http://www.linux-on-laptops.com" target="_self">www.linux-on-laptops.com</a>), to make the thing work.  But what if you absolutely positively
need it to work out of the box?
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9416f1.large.jpg"><img src="9416f1.jpg"></a></div><p>
Your desire for more standard hardware might direct you to the
mainline companies; however, there you'll be barking up the wrong tree.  HP,
for instance, once had a pre-installed Linux laptop.  My conspiracy
theory on why it disappeared? One of their VPs freaked when the 425
area code popped up on her caller ID; hence the kibosh.  Regardless of
the reason, your better bet is to call on one of the myriad scrappy,
garage-and-basement-founded hardware companies that flourish in our
community.  If you look around, you'll find a wide array of options,
with many of the machines produced by mainline companies but customized
by Linux specialists.
</p><p>
A fine example of this innovative breed of Linux company is R Cubed
Technologies, whose LS1250 laptop is the focus of this review.  <i  >Linux Journal</i> Editor in Chief, Nick Petreley, had had his eye on this sweet
little machine for some time and asked me to review it, not knowing I had
actually just bought one.  Thus, I have had the machine for a few months
and am in the perfect position to rate it after much day-in-day-out usage.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xaf0580.0xbe8608"></a>
Exhibit A</h2></div></div><p>
My old laptop was a beast.  I bought it as a desktop replacement with a
nice, big display for doing GIS.  Unfortunately, I couldn't get a cheap
copy of ArcGIS, so I do GIS at my university's computer lab instead.  Then,
I started traveling more, which left me lugging the beast around the
world on my chronically sore shoulder.  &ldquo;Wouldn't it be nice to travel
in comfort?&rdquo;, I thought.
</p><p>
Beyond portability, I wanted a laptop that would fit my mobile
editor/student lifestyle.  I was looking for solid performance at a
fair price and dual-boot functionality, as well as excellent keyboard,
display and Wi-Fi support.
See the sidebar for information and specs on the LS1250.

As you can see from its specs (for example, the older processor), although the
LS1250 is by no means cutting edge, it packs a solid punch into a small,
easy-to-tote package.  Note also that the LS1250 is actually built by
Taiwan's ASUS Computer.  R Cubed's role is to ship you the LS1250 packed
with Linux goodies, as well as other OSes if you so desire.  Thus, in
order to give credit where due, let's take a closer look at both the
LS1250's physical aspects (ASUS' responsibility) and the functional
aspects (R Cubed's responsibility) and see how this machine stacks up.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xaf0580.0xfe2010"></a>
Let's Get Physical</h2></div></div><p>
Being the geek that I am, I approach the practical with confidence and the
style factor with apprehension.  Though style is secondary to me, I admit
that ASUS has made a sleek and attractive laptop.  I like the LS1250's
matte silver-grey color with black trim.  The nagging doubts I had earlier
about the &ldquo;cool factor&rdquo; have been gradually vanquished with each woman
(now four and counting!) who raves about my cool laptop.  Admittedly, a
Mac or Sony VAIO will generate more net saliva, but the LS1250 may prove
a better value on a &ldquo;conversation starters per dollar&rdquo; basis.
</p><p>
Not only is the LS1250 handsome, but also it feels well built.  The
carbon-fiber alloy material gives the chassis a nice, solid
feel&mdash;neither bulky, creaky nor &ldquo;plasticky&rdquo; but rather more rigid, almost
metallic.  Both ASUS and R Cubed claim that the carbon fiber improves
portability and is &ldquo;120% stronger than conventional material&rdquo;.  Dropping
the laptop to prove the latter point was fortunately not part of the test.
</p><p>
Regarding portability, this is an area where the LS1250 performs
well.  ASUS rightfully classifies the LS1250 (that is the Z33Ae in its catalog)
as an ultraportable.  Weighing in at a thrifty 3.4 lbs. (1.5 kg),
the LS1250 slips easily into my backpack or laptop case with the same
burden as a mid-sized, softcover book.
</p><p>
Once I've transported my LS1250 to its destination, I am generally pleased
with its physical performance.  The aspect I like most is the crisp,
responsive keyboard.  Despite this enjoyment, however, I find fault
with the combination cursor block and scroll keys that were stuffed into
the congested lower-right corner.  I continually reach over and press the
wrong undersized key or play Twister with my fingers.  Getting rid of one
of those special (er, stupid) Windows keys would free up plenty of room
for a better layout.
</p><p>
The 12.1" XGA TFT LCD display is bright, crisp and consistent with no
dead pixels and works decently in direct sunlight.
</p><p>
As mentioned above, the ergonomic design of the LS1250 is strong.  For
example, ASUS won a German industrial-design award for the rimless design
of its touch pad, which sits flush with the palm rest.  This design
feels smooth to the touch and eliminates dust accumulation.
</p><p>
I chose the standard 3-cell Li-Ion battery, which worked solidly but
less than promised.  While in a &ldquo;word processing&rdquo; power-management mode,
I got around 1.75 rather than 2.5 hours worth of word processing and
wired Web surfing.
</p><p>
Finally, heat management is solid, though the underside and palm rest
can get quite warm under everyday working conditions.  The fan located
on the right side runs continuously but acceptably quietly.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xaf0580.0xfe2538"></a>
R Cubed Inside</h2></div></div><p>
Of course, I could have bought the LS1250 directly from ASUS and installed
Linux myself.  Instead, I chose to have R Cubed do my dirty work.  It was
a good decision, because R Cubed invests a great deal of effort to make
nearly everything work smoothly out of the box.  When I placed my order,
R Cubed was offering only Fedora Core, but when I asked for SUSE 10.1,
R Cubed obliged and sent me a fully functional machine with its own
customized kernel.  Now R Cubed says that it is an official Novell
partner because of this, so maybe I should be asking for royalties?
</p><p>
I was very pleased with R Cubed's Linux installation for three main
reasons.  First, the LS1250 came preconfigured with a majority of the
applications you'll find in a SUSE distro.  Second, all of the function
buttons worked appropriately on both Linux and Windows XP.  And third,
I was surfing wirelessly within seconds of starting the machine.  Let's
take a closer look at each of these.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xaf0580.0xfe2698"></a>
Everything You Need</h2></div></div><p>
The folks at R Cubed shipped me the LC1250 partitioned to my
specification, which was dual-boot SUSE Linux 10.1 (60GB) and
Windows XP (20GB).  The GRUB bootloader was already configured
as well.  After booting the Linux side, I fired up KDE and found
a vast majority of applications that come with a SUSE distribution,
all conveniently categorized in the menus and with key icons on the
desktop and below on the Kicker (taskbar).  Not only do I have all of
the standard applications&mdash;OpenOffice.org, Acrobat Reader, Firefox and
so forth&mdash;but nearly every application type has at least two options
from which to
choose.  It has barely been necessary to install additional programs
on the machine.  My most pleasant surprise occurred when I plugged my
Canon PowerShot digital camera in to the USB port, which instantly
was recognized by digiKam.  I was asked if I wanted to download the photos
on the camera, which I did, and I was managing them without a hitch.
</p><p>
I also am enamored with the Wi-Fi capabilities
out of the box.  The
installed KNetworkManager is smart, performs automatic link-ups for
you and makes managing wireless networks a breeze.  I discuss actual
Wi-Fi performance below.
</p><p>
Through no fault of R Cubed, I was unable to play most video formats
out of the box, despite having the various media players installed, such
as Kaffeine, Totem and RealPlayer.  This left me to find and install
codecs on my own.  I learned that R Cubed is now providing multimedia
installation icons that allow one to acquire instantly all of the codecs
one needs to play back all common video formats.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xaf0580.0xfe2850"></a>
Buttons That Work</h2></div></div><p>
On my old laptop, I never even thought about the function keys at the
top of the keyboard, because none of them worked on Linux.  However, all
of them work on the LS1250 on both Linux and Windows&mdash;hibernate,
wireless on/off, brightness control, display, browser launch, volume
control and mute, and so on.  R Cubed also provides users with a directory
called .asus_acpi in their home Linux directory where users can customize
what occurs when each button is pressed.
</p><p>
A button worthy of special mention puts the computer into five different
modes of operation.  These performance modes range from Turbo at the
top to Word Processing in the middle to Maximum Battery Savings
at the bottom.  Each step down not only dims the display but reduces
processor speed and hard drive spin while expanding the read and
look-ahead caching in order to avoid powering up the hard drive.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xaf0580.0xfe29b0"></a>
Not Just Good Looks</h2></div></div><p>
Because this is a review of only one laptop, our performance assessments
will be subjective.  The performance matches my expectations considering
the processor and memory (768MB RAM) onboard.  I run all of the
applications I want to, including audio CDs on Amarok, never feeling
like the system is overtaxed or sluggish.
</p><p>
The Wi-Fi performance exceeds my expectations.  Besides the excellent
network management mentioned above, the signal reception excels under
even challenging conditions.  My ultimate test is whether I can sit
outside on my porch under a metal roof about 30 feet from my router.  All
of my previous laptops with wireless PC cards struggled to maintain
a connection.  The LS1250, with its integrated wireless, maintains a
strong connection.  Furthermore, from an unobstructed distance of about
50 feet the LS1250 was able to maintain wireless performance of about
13Mbps.
</p><p>
I tried experimenting with the 3-D acceleration by playing the game
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Chromium B.S.U.</em></span>, but I had difficulty.  Despite enabling acceleration
with YaST, the game told me that it was unavailable, and it played
sluggishly.  R Cubed informed me that such a problem should not have
occurred because the chipset supports acceleration.  Unfortunately, I
was unable to ameliorate this problem before deadline.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xaf0580.0xfe2bc0"></a>
A Few Words about Service and Support</h2></div></div><p>
One of the most pleasant aspects of working with R Cubed is that the
company is
big enough to put out professional products yet small enough to know who
you are.  When I called to inquire about my order, I simply mentioned my
name and the person at R Cubed knew what I ordered and its status off
the top of his head.  Furthermore, R Cubed has an order-tracking system
that shows the order's status.  My only complaint is that R Cubed does
not enter any information in the system between the order placement
and shipment.  Thus, I was waiting for what I felt was a long time and was
forced to call to discover the ETA of my machine.
</p><p>
Despite this complaint, the post-order support was as friendly,
accessible and as personal as my earlier inquiry.  The technician (probably
the same person), who picked up after a few rings, knew my machine and
troubleshot my problem (which was no audio on the Windows side) in just a few
minutes.  Phone-support hours are 8:00am to 5:00pm CT on weekdays only.
</p><p>
Recently I spoke with R Cubed's CTO, who told me that the firm
is gradually expanding its support and features.  One of these new
offerings is remote support, whereby a technician can remotely access and
troubleshoot a customer's machine via VNC.  Another offering is a set of
custom self-installations of applications, such as Internet Explorer on
Wine, Google Earth and VMware Server.  Finally, you can now ship your
machine back to R Cubed and, for $50 US, the company will upgrade your OS with
its custom kernel to maintain full functionality.
