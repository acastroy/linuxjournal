I Love Your Opinions</h4><p>
Nick, I love [your columns] and all your articles. Up until you came
along, I thought I was the only Linux jinx. I've had very few easy
install/upgrades of Linux. My latest, Kubuntu5, installs fine, although
Kubuntu6 can't seem to find my gateway to the Internet, no matter what I
set with ifconfig, so I'm stuck for now with 5. My motherboard is an ASUS
A8V-MX with an integrated Ethernet, sound and video (which don't work),
so again, I agree with you.
</p><p>
I've used CP/M, DOS, OS/2 and (yuck) windoze. Then three years ago, I
discovered Linux, and I've been converted&mdash;if only it wasn't so damn
picky.
</p><p>
/var/opinion/ this month, October 2006, is very VERY interesting! I plan to
use your experience installing MythTV as a guide to make my attempt to
do the same upgrade. Please make this an article, including all hardware
and software, with explicit steps to follow.

Deja Vu All over Again</h4><p>
Your recent changes to the magazine layout reminded me of the time when
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Dr. Dobb's Journal</em></span> dropped Forth from the programming tree.
</p><p>
The older <span   class="emphasis"><em>Dr. Dobb's Journal</em></span>'s taught me to use the then free
language Forth; <span   class="emphasis"><em>Dr. Dobb's Journal</em></span>
also felt like it was losing its innocence.
</p><p>
Ten pages of ads before making any sense is beautifully commercial.
</p><p>
I wish you all success in presenting Linux with a glossy, professional,
corporate image.

Fedora Disk Labels All over Again</h4><p>
I have found a reason why Fedora uses disk labels rather than device
file entries. It may be because, on some machines, using device
files causes a strange race condition. For example, in our lab
(<a href="http://www.minds.may.ie/~balor/photographs/lab" target="_self">www.minds.may.ie/~balor/photographs/lab</a>) we have machines
on which GRUB correctly interprets /dev/sda1 as the first SATA
device. However, on boot (before root is mounted), the Linux kernel
(sometimes) assigns the /dev/sda1 device file to the first USB
mass-storage device that happens to be plugged in to the machine,
causing a failure to mount the root partition. Obviously, using /
as the root disk label means that any USB mass-storage disks would be
ignored, and the correct partition on the SATA disk would be mounted.
I do agree that a label such as FC5Root is preferable to /, as one
could then have FC4Root and FC5Root on the same box.

I noticed this same unpredictable behavior on one of my systems too. I
installed a RAID card to avoid down time due to any single disk failure
(I use RAID 5), and I noticed that Linux does not respect the boot order
I set in the BIOS. I haven't noticed any race conditions with any given
kernel, but one kernel will make the RAID card /dev/sda, and another
kernel will make it /dev/sdb. I discovered how to control which it sees
first with Ubuntu by changing a script in the initrd image. Look for
how I did it in our new tech tips column this month called Tech Tips
with Gnull and Voyd.

No Myth about MythTV</h4><p>
I have just read your /var/opinion in the October 2006 issue of
<i  >Linux Journal</i>. You make a couple of valid points about
MythTV&mdash;for example, that it
can be time-consuming to set up, but once it is running, it is like 99%
of the Linux boxes I have ever built in that it just keeps working!
Can I suggest for ease of setup and use that you give MythDora a try? The
ISO images can be found at <a href="http://www.g-ding.tv" target="_self">www.g-ding.tv</a>, and the main guy there is very
helpful (so much so that I actually felt like I wanted to feed data back
into the system, not feeling obliged as I have with some other projects I
have assisted with).
</p><p>
Incidentally, you are right&mdash;it is becoming apparent, from what I have
read on the forums, that the Hauppauge WINTV-PVR-500 is just 2*150's
bolted together (so why didn't they call it the 300? Too obvious?).
I am sure you are aware, but if you have any issues getting it working,
the guys over at linuxtv are very approachable and have helped me out
many a time with my Compro DVB-T300s and my Dvico FusionHDTV Dual
(which I must admit thought would be a bag of pants but works
flawlessly).
</p><p>
I must admit, I do look forward to reading your magazine, and your
/var/opinion page does usually give me something to think about.
</p><p>
Now for a shameless plug: to see how far I have gotten with my MythTV
build, go to <a href="http://trueentropy.linuxbloggers.com" target="_self">trueentropy.linuxbloggers.com</a>, and all should become
apparent (if I have had time/remembered to update it).

Digital Subscriptions</h4><p>
Having bought the paper version of <i  >LJ</i> for more than ten years, I took
out a digital subscription last week. It's a real improvement! Not only
can I read back issues without having to search round the flat for them,
but I also can fit dozens of issues on a memory stick, and my wife doesn't
complain that I'm hoarding paper!
</p><p>
Rotating the view on my IBM 1600x1200 ThinkPad and holding it sideways
gives a perfectly readable full-page view.

64-Bit Laptops</h4><p>
The discussion in the Letters column [October 2006] about 64-bit laptops caught my eye.
One reason to have 64-bit laptops is binary compatibility with the
desktop. My laptop is purposely set up to mirror my desktop system. I
use rsync to move things back and forth and keep them synchronized.
</p><p>
Right now, I don't have to worry about moving executable files back and
forth or where I do a &ldquo;make&rdquo;. That's a situation I would like to
keep unchanged if and when I move to 64-bit systems.

Less Technical?</h4><p>
First off, I think <i  >Linux Journal</i> is a terrific asset to the Linux community.
</p><p>
I have to agree with Guilherme DeSouza [see Letters, November 2006], who
argues that <i  >Linux Journal</i> is
going downhill, as it moves toward less technical content and more attempts
to appeal to the masses. This is what caused
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Dr. Dobb's Journal</em></span> to
crash while <i  >LJ</i> was taking off:
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Dr. Dobb's Journal</em></span> tried to expand into cute and slick
articles and lost its core audience, while <i  >LJ</i> was offering solid
technical content.
</p><p>
I certainly applaud the intent of Taylor and Gagn&eacute;to make Linux more
accessible to a wider audience. But, I question whether
<i  >LJ</i> is the forum for it.
For example, if you walk to your local bookseller and watch who buys
<i  >LJ</i>,
how many MS Windows <span   class="emphasis"><em>programmers</em></span> do you think you'll see? I've tried
to interest MS programmers in Linux and gotten nothing but bored stares.
</p><p>
If that's the case with Windows programmers, ask yourself how many
Windows <span   class="emphasis"><em>users</em></span> are going to pick up a <i  >Linux Journal</i>. My guess is the
number of readers of <i  >LJ</i> who have no programming background and no Linux
background is less than 1%, but surely you have the numbers to say.
If you really want to reach the masses, maybe <i  >LJ</i> should sponsor a contest
for the best Linux-related article published in, say, <span   class="emphasis"><em>PC
Magazine</em></span> or
the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Wall Street Journal</em></span>.
</p><p>
In short, I hope you'll not abandon your core audience as
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Dr. Dobb's Journal</em></span> did.
I enjoy <i  >LJ</i> and read it thoroughly, and would hate to see
<i  >LJ</i> lose its way.

A Supplement to &ldquo;The Dark Age of <i  >Linux Journal</i>&rdquo;</h4><p>
I have to admit that this note was provoked by Guilherme DeSouza's
letter in the November 2006 issue. Let me introduce myself: I have
been a user of Linux for a long time. In fact, I tried to install the
Red Hat Halloween release in 1994. I had read of Linux before 1994,
and I considered it the most exciting development in computing at that
time. The Red Hat disc did not have all the drivers for the peripherals of
my rather advanced Compaq, and despite many helpful but frustrating phone
discussions with Red Hat, I actually used Slackware, which was more up
to date and I think was packaged with Matt Welsh's &ldquo;Linux Installation
and Getting Started&rdquo;. This being said, I consider myself an amateur
user of Linux rather than a professional. To such as myself, there was
much of interest in the early issues of <i  >Linux Journal</i>, and I have had
a subscription since the beginning. One thing that sticks in my memory
was the introduction of ext3 and the instructions in
<i  >LJ</i> to use
a make file to install it, which really worked to my great excitement. I
used Linux as my basic working system in support of my research and for
connecting to my central UNIX system until my retirement. Latterly,
I found SUSE most satisfactory, and I continued using that at home. I
will admit that I did dual-boot with Windows, because I needed some of the
programs that made up the MS Office collection.
</p><p>
However, I am afraid that <i  >Linux Journal</i> is becoming, dare I say
it, boring to someone like myself. It seems to me to be aspiring to
emulate a professional journal but without the rigor of the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Journal of
the ACM</em></span>. My math is up to it, and I can scan the titles of the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>ACM</em></span> and
read the articles that interest me, but I used to read the
<i  >Linux Journal</i>
cover to cover, and these past few months, I realized that I no longer
do so. The other US Linux magazines (are there more than one?) seem to be
thin negligible broadsheets, but the European journals are different.
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Magazine</em></span> (not the US magazine of the same name)
<span   class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> interesting, and I
do read it more or less completely.
</p><p>
I read the on-line <span   class="emphasis"><em>TUX</em></span> magazine with a great amount
of interest, but I would
prefer to see some of its content in <i  >Linux Journal</i>. I don't know
if your editorial staff has looked at <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Magazine</em></span>
recently, but they
should do so despite the $10 price.


<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
James Silverton  <br><br>
</p><p>
Thanks to all who have written to us about the technical content
of <i  >Linux Journal</i>. One thing that needs to be said up front is that
it is unrealistic to think <i  >Linux Journal</i> or any magazine will please
everyone. Those who find a particular article boring should keep in mind
that for every article that you may feel is beneath you, another person
finds that particular article the most useful and views your favorite
technical article as incomprehensible. The Linux universe does not
revolve around only one type of reader.
</p><p>
Some of you may have noticed that we occasionally include some
less-technical end-user content, because a portion of our readership appreciates
it and benefits from it. We try to pick more advanced end-user topics,
however, rather than basic point-and-click tutorials. Ironically,
with respect to James Silverton's suggestion that we include content
from <span   class="emphasis"><em>TUX</em></span> in <i  >Linux Journal</i>, that is the only category we consciously
try to avoid&mdash;&ldquo;new desktop user&rdquo; content. Our sister
magazine, <span   class="emphasis"><em>TUX</em></span>
(<a href="http://www.tuxmagazine.com" target="_self">www.tuxmagazine.com</a>), targets that audience very well.
</p><p>
Aside from including a variety of content, the only conscious shift we
are making is to focus some of our more technical content to provide
readers with information they can apply in practical ways, not just
for our readers' amusement, but so they are better equipped to do their
jobs. Having said that, we certainly do not believe that articles for
your amusement and instruction are a bad thing. We understand that
purely academic articles are desirable, interesting and have long-term
benefits. So, we'll always include them. We simply need to strike the
right balance. You can help by keeping your letters coming.
