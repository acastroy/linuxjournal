Steven Goodwin's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Game Developer's Open Source
Handbook</em></span> (Charles River Media)</h2></div></div><p>
Charles River Media's recent book titled <span   class="emphasis"><em>Sex in Video
Games</em></span> came out too
early for me to include it here (curses!), but then a new title with
much appeal caught my eye: <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Game Developer's Open Source
Handbook</em></span>
by Steven Goodwin.  The book is targeted at &ldquo;all game developers,
especially the 'Indies', who want to use the wealth of free software in
their own games to help increase the scope of the technology available
and reduce the financial burden&rdquo;.  Charles River also calls it
&ldquo;required
reading for the producers and systems analysts of game studios who
want to see the big picture&rdquo;.  The book's main purpose is to help the
game developer find and utilize the plethora of open-source software
tools and libraries&mdash;such as graphic editors, IDEs, MIDI sequencers,
3-D editors, movie playback code and so on&mdash;for use in every aspect of the
development process.  The author, Steven Goodwin, has been responsible
for developing five different game titles, including <span   class="emphasis"><em>Die Hard:
Vendetta</em></span>
on the three big console platforms.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="9451f1.jpg"></div><p>

EMAC Inc.'s SoM-NE64M</h2></div></div><p>
The EMAC folks have let us know about their new 16-bit, System on Module
Internet-appliance engine, which they have ubercreatively named SoM-NE64M.
The SoM-NE64M module is based on the Freescale ColdFire MC9S12NE64,
16-bit, 68HC12-compatible processor with built-in Ethernet MAC and PHY and
two serial ports.  It also features 64KB of Flash, 32KB of EEPROM and 8KB of RAM, with room for up to 512KB.  The aforementioned functionality
is integrated into a diminutive board&mdash;smaller than a business card
and using less than a Watt of power&mdash;and is designed to plug in to a
custom carrier board.  Applications for the SoM-NE64 can be programmed
using GNU tools within an Eclipse IDE or with CodeWarrior.  One of the
product's advantages, says EMAC, is &ldquo;more functionality built in than
many other SoM designs&rdquo;, making the carrier board easier to design and
produce and thus lowering cost and time to market.  Target applications
are Web/network data acquisition and control.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9451f2.large.jpg"><img src="9451f2.jpg"></a></div><p>

SafeNet's Sentinel Hardware Keys</h2></div></div><p>
SafeNet has introduced its Sentinel Hardware Keys to the world of Linux.
The product is a rights management token with military-grade security
that is intended to allow &ldquo;software developers in the Linux community to
protect 32-bit software applications from piracy and implement flexible
licensing models&rdquo;, sayeth SafeNet.  When attached to a computer or
network, the keys monitor and enforce the licensing of products that
have been protected using SafeNet's solution.  The Java-based Sentinel
Hardware Keys Software Development Kit is supported on Red Hat Enterprise
Linux, Fedora Core and SUSE and includes &ldquo;a device driver to access
keys, a network server d&aelig;mon to manage licenses, a Web-browser-based
monitoring tool to track licenses on site and a set of Business Layer
APIs for high-level licensing implementation.&rdquo;</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9451f3.large.jpg"><img src="9451f3.jpg"></a></div><p>

Steve Atwal's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Building Websites with XOOPS</em></span> (Packt
Publishing)</h2></div></div><p>
Packt Publishing is a relatively new yet prolific IT publisher that
focuses heavily on Linux and open-source titles.  Its tagline
reads &ldquo;Community Experience Distilled&rdquo;, with the firm contributing
a royalty back to the open-source projects it writes about.  A case
in point is Packt's new title, called <span   class="emphasis"><em>Building Websites with XOOPS: A
step-by-step tutorial</em></span> by Steve Atwal.  XOOPS is a popular open-source,
object-oriented, PHP-based Web content management application.  The book
introduces readers to XOOPS and shows how to use it to create &ldquo;small to
large dynamic community Websites, intracompany portals, corporate portals,
Weblogs and much more&rdquo;.  Some topics covered include configuration of
XOOPS, working with news stories and managing diverse elements, such as
blocks, modules, users, themes and more.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9451f4.large.jpg"><img src="9451f4.jpg"></a></div><p>

Open Country's OCM Universal Linux System Management Suite</h2></div></div><p>
Open Country hops on the 64-bit bandwagon with release of the OCM
Universal Linux System Management Suite, Version 3.1.  This systems
management application now supports Intel's Itanium 2 processor line.
OCM's raison d'&iuml;&iquest;&frac12;re is to &ldquo;help companies with widely distributed
Linux investments to easily discover their entire inventory of
hardware/software investments, then track installations and updates,
deploy security patches, simplify repetitive management tasks, and
respond effectively to changing computing needs&rdquo;.  Open Country further
credits its Web-based architecture with optimizing expertise and reducing
labor costs over traditional client-server architectures.  In addition,
besides the mainline Linux distributions, OCM supports many distributions less common
to North America, such as Asianux, CS2C, Red Flag, Turbolinux, Haansoft
and several others.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9451f5.large.jpg"><img src="9451f5.jpg"></a></div><p>

Arkeia Software's Arkeia Network Backup</h2></div></div><p>
Arkeia Software recently brought forth the release of Arkeia Network
Backup Version 6, the firm's flagship data-protection solution for medium-
to large-sized networks.  Arkeia says that the main intent of Version 6 is
to &ldquo;improve backup performance and increase flexibility for distributed
infrastructures such as organizations with Storage Area Networks&rdquo;.  Some
of the specific new features include a media server for SAN option that
enables LAN-free backup for SAN environments, remote drive management for
LANs and WANs to centralize the management of remote servers and networks
and to consolidate and share drives across the LAN, an integrated virtual
tape library option to leverage the performance and flexibility of disk
technology, and a disk-to-disk-to-tape option to shorten backup/restore
times and to create granular tiered storage policies.  A trial version
is available at Arkeia's Web site.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9451f6.large.jpg"><img src="9451f6.jpg"></a></div><p>

The OpenVZ Project's OpenVZ</h2></div></div><p>
The OpenVZ Project recently announced that its OpenVZ OS-level server
virtualization solution, which is built on Linux, is now available
for systems using Power 64-bit processors.  Like other virtualization
solutions, OpenVZ allows one to create isolated, independent, secure
virtual environments on a single physical server in order to achieve
better server utilization and ensure that applications do not conflict.
However, the OpenVZ Project asserts that its advantages lie not
only in its single rather than its multiple kernels but also in its
&ldquo;portability across different architectures since 95% of the code is
platform-independent&rdquo;.  The OpenVZ Project is an Open Source community
project supported by the firm SWsoft, which utilizes OpenVZ as the
heart of its commercial virtualization product, dubbed Virtuozzo.
The OpenVZ software, complete with Power support, can be downloaded from
the project's Web site.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9451f8.large.jpg"><img src="9451f8.jpg"></a></div><p>
