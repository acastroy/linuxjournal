    Some advice on taking advantage of MD5, PAM and more.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2247580.0x233f4a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>If you want an example of evolution in
action, look at the GNU/Linux password system. Although it includes
the basic UNIX password structure as a vestigial organ, natural
selection in the form of crackers has forced the evolution of
shadow passwords, the MD5 algorithm and PAM. Passwords have even
found new niches in the form of boot managers, remote login formats
and advanced security systems. All these tools are used daily, but
by taking a closer look at them, you can use them to make your
system a little more secure.
</p><p>Back in the Jurassic days of the 1970s, the standard UNIX
password structure appeared. Nowadays, many users access it
graphically through gdm, otherwise its structure hasn't changed
much. To log in to an account, users enter a password of up to
eight characters (it was six or seven in the past), and the
password is encrypted into a key using the DES (data encryption
standard) algorithm. This key is stored in the second column
/etc/passwd, where any user can view it.</p><p>What has changed is the competition. Nowadays, the DES
algorithm can be cracked in seconds. And, to make matters worse,
there's little choice in the standard structure except to store the
key for each password in a public place, where any intruder can
find it. The alternative is to place severe restrictions on
ordinary users and prevent them from using basic commands like
<b  >ls -l</b>. Although some security experts would be
happy with a computer that was turned off and left in a lead-lined
vault several miles beneath the surface of the earth, these
restrictions are largely unacceptable.</p><p>By the mid-1990s, with the Internet's popularity giving
crackers more opportunities, the competition was becoming intense.
Because of this pressure, defenses began to evolve. At first
available only as add-ons, by the dawn of modern times in the late
nineties, these defenses were in symbiotic relations with each
other and were standard parts of every distribution.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2247580.0x233f710"></a>The Shadow Knows</h2></div></div><p>Shadow passwords get their name because they are the hidden
counterparts of basic passwords. The difference is that, instead of
being native to a public file like /etc/passwd, their habitat is
the second column of /etc/shadow, a file readable only by the root
user. If no password is set for an account, the column is marked by
an asterisk or an exclamation mark, depending on the distribution.
Only an &ldquo;x&rdquo; in the password column of /etc/passwd is left to mark
their passage.</p><p>Since shadow passwords have been standard, manual
configuration has all but disappeared. All the same, shadow
passwords generally come with a toolset.
<span   class="bold"><b>pwconv</b></span> and grpconv keep user and
group entries in /etc/shadow and /etc/passwd in sync, but this
housekeeping is generally done automatically when a password is
created for the account. Similarly, pwunconv and grpunconv allow
the creation of regular passwords, but few modern systems ever
require this devolution. About the only useful shadow password tool
is Debian's shadowconfig, whose on-and-off options can tell you
quickly whether shadow passwords are enabled.</p><p>Another evolutionary dead end is the set of additional
columns in /etc/shadow. Superficially, these columns promise extra
control over when passwords are changed, when warnings of the need
to change are given and when an account is disabled if its password
is not changed. These columns could be a major survival trait.
Unfortunately, they have to be entered individually for each user.
More importantly, they must be entered in days since January 1,
1970. This measurement is so cumbersome to calculate that many
system administrators leave most of the columns blank and fill the
rest with impossibly large numbers so they can ignore them.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2247580.0x233f920"></a>The Age of MD5</h2></div></div><p>Another adaptation of the basic password structure is the use
of the MD5 encryption algorithm. MD5 is the latest in an
evolutionary line of algorithms developed by Ronald Rivest, an MIT
professor and a founder of RSA Security, the dominant company in
encryption for over a decade. It is a descendant of MD2, an
algorithm optimized for 8-bit machines, and a modification of MD4,
an algorithm for 32-bit machines that Rivest and his collaborators
felt was rushed into release. First released to the public domain
in 1991, MD5 was further modified in 1994.</p><p>Today, MD5 remains a standard in authentication, even though
Rivest insists that it was never intended for that use. More
elaborate algorithms have been developed in recent years, such as
IDEA, Skipjack or Bowfish, but none has been proven to outperform
MD5 consistently enough to replace it.</p><p>MD5 became available as an add-on for GNU/Linux in the
mid-nineties and is a now a standard part of most distributions.
From a security perspective, the advantages of MD5 over the DES
used in the standard password structure is that it allows for
longer passwords and provides more sophisticated encryption. When
MD5 is enabled, passwords of up to 256 characters are possible.
Regardless of the password's actual length, MD5 passes it through
four rounds of encryption to create a 256-character key. Since this
process is not reversible (at least, not without considerable
effort), MD5 is classified as a &ldquo;one-way hash&rdquo;.</p><p>MD5 is an option during the installation of every major
distribution. Although MD5 can create problems with network
information systems on most modern workstations or networks, there
is no reason not to use it. If you are unsure whether MD5 is
enabled, check whether the password column in /etc/shadow starts
with $1$, or search the files in /etc/pam.d for lines that end in
&ldquo;md5&rdquo;. If it isn't, locating the necessary files and
reconfiguring the system is time-consuming enough that a new user
might be tempted to upgrade or re-install instead.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2247580.0x233fb30"></a>Articulating the Skeleton: PAM</h2></div></div><p>The rise of shadow passwords and MD5 could potentially cause
over-diversification, with every combination of add-ons requiring
its own versions of commands like passwd or login. This problem is
avoided by the Pluggable Authentication Method (PAM). PAM can be
thought of as an intermediary between the commands and processes
involved with authentication and any modifications to it. PAM
evolved along with shadow passwords and MD5 and has been available
in distributions since about 1997.</p><p>Originally, PAM was configured in /etc/pam.conf. However, in
most distributions, this file is now as vestigial as an appendix.
Instead, PAM uses the /etc/pam.d directory.</p><p>A handful of files in /etc/pam.d define which users or
groups, if any, can use a specific command. For example,
/etc/pam.d/su regulates the su command. Other limits may be set in
/etc/security/limits.conf. However, the majority of the files in
/etc/pam.d act as intermediaries between password system
enhancements and other commands, pointing to libraries in
/lib/security. Examples of these files include chfn, chsh, cron,
gdm and login. This function allows not only the use of shadow
passwords or MD5 but eases the addition of upscale security
solutions such as Kerebos.</p><p>The files in /etc/pam.d offer far too many options to detail
here. However, the files are heavily commented and relatively easy
to follow. Files such as passwd, gdm, login and su, which control
the basics of the password system, are especially useful. For
example, login can control root logins, put a time restraint on
logins and set how login attempts are logged. Similarly, if you use
su on the system, rather than the more controllable sudo,
/etc/pam.d/su can help you set limits on how the command is used.
And, while you don't want to change the references to security
libraries in the pam.d files, you might want to look at the options
used with them&mdash;for instance, the security-minded might want to
avoid nullok, which allows users to change empty passwords. Going
farther afield, chsh can be used to limit the shells users can use
to a list in /etc/shells. In short, while browsing the pam.d
directory can leave you with the trauma of option anxiety, you'll
find the effort an important step in learning how to make your
system more secure.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2247580.0x233fd40"></a>Evolutionary Pressures and New Niches</h2></div></div><p>Shadow passwords, MD5 and PAM all increase the security of a
system. However, keep in mind that the security they provide is
relative. Given enough computing power and enough time, a
brute-force attack can crack any system.</p><p>Moreover, the effort is getting easier with each advance in
hardware and crackers' tools. To put things in perspective, in
1994, RSA Security system estimated that a brute-force attack on
the average machine would succeed within 24 days. By contrast, the
developers of mdcrack, a tool that can be used for testing the
security of MD5-enabled systems, claim that a 56-character password
can be cracked on an average machine using the 2.2 Linux kernel
within 20 seconds. Although that was almost twice as long as the
average time to crack a Windows machine, obviously Linux users have
no reason to be smug. And the situation is only going to get
worse.</p><p>One way to respond to this pressure is to make better use of
the password system. Many users, especially at home, forget about
the password system after they install and fail to use anything
except its most basic features. Yet a little attention to detail
could be enough to send the script kiddies into tantrums. For
example:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Set the number of days that a password can be used
in /etc/shadow. The method is a pain, but regularly changed
passwords could set back a brute-force attack that relies more on
time than computing power.</p></li><li><p>Increase the minimum and maximum password lengths
in /etc/pam.d/passwd. Other things being equal: the longer the
password, the longer it takes to crack.</p></li><li><p>Lower the minimum number of login attempts in
/etc/pam.d/gdm. Legitimate users with sausage-like fingers might
complain, but anyone attempting a brute-force attack could be
irritated enough to go away.</p></li><li><p>Approve all user passwords or insist that they are
generated by a program like pwgen that creates secure passwords.
The number of users whose password is &ldquo;password&rdquo; or the name of
their youngest daughter or goldfish is too depressing for
words.</p></li><li><p>Install a program like cracklib2, which prevents
the use of easily guessed passwords. You'll probably want to add a
custom dictionary of company, product and user names that cannot be
used as passwords. Currently, cracklib2 requires some patience to
set up, as well as the uncommenting of a number of lines in
/etc/pam.d, but it, or a similar package, is likely to become a
standard part of major distributions in the next few years.</p></li><li><p>Do not allow the root user to log in
remotely.</p></li><li><p>Watch for expired passwords or user accounts
without passwords. Either could be an entry point to the
system.</p></li><li><p>Turn off your computer or your net connection if
you're not using it. Forget the geek macho about how long your
system has been running. If it's not connected, then remote cracks
can't happen.</p></li></ul></div><p>Another response to the increased risks of modern computers
is the increased use of password authentication on the system. Here
are some of the places you can add passwords if they aren't already
there:
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The BIOS: use a password and make sure it can't be
bypassed via floppy or CD.</p></li><li><p>The Boot Manager: use LILO's password command or
GRUB's lock command.</p></li><li><p>Remote Services: ssh sends encrypted
passwords&mdash;Telnet and FTP don't. Guess which one you should
use?</p></li></ul></div>

Of course, passwords alone won't secure your system from anyone
except the rawest of script kiddies. And, the harder the password
is to crack, the harder it is to remember&mdash;and the more likely that
the user will write it on a post-it note taped to the bottom of the
keyboard.
</p><p>Still, there's no reason not to use whatever security
passwords afford. And there's definitely not a reason to bypass the
password system or weaken it&mdash;two options that are starting to
appear in modern distributions in the hopes of making GNU/Linux
seem more like other operating systems of the average user's
acquaintance. The tools are there, so why not use them?</p></div></div>
