    In a market flooding with similar featured PDAs, Sharp takes a
    bold leap, unveiling Linux/Java PDA at JavaOne.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2576580.0x266e4a8"></a></h2></div></div><p> At JavaOne in San Francisco, Sharp
unveiled a new PDA for the non-Japan market that features an
embedded Linux operating system and a Java application environment.
Like many (perhaps most) recently announced PDAs and handheld
computers, the device uses Intel's StrongARM system-on-chip
processor as its core hardware platform. But unlike the makers of
other mainstream PDAs, Sharp has clearly decided to gamble that a
combo of Linux plus Java&mdash;rather than either Palm's highly popular
Palm OS or Microsoft's struggling WinCE&mdash;will be key
differentiators helping it to carve out a niche in the highly
competitive PDA market.

</p><p>Sharp Corporation, which claims to be the largest maker of
handheld devices in Japan, has announced a goal of selling one
million units of this new device worldwide by March 2002. In the
words of Hiroshi Uno, general manager of Sharp's Mobile Systems
Division: &ldquo;we intend to aggressively combine Java with Sharp's
user-interface technology and core devices, particularly LCDs, to
develop powerful handheld products in wireless communication, data
integration, multimedia and PIM-based applications.&rdquo;</p><p>The devices are expected to be available late this year,
hopefully in time for year-end holiday shoppers to make those
geek-gottahave-gift purchases.</p><p>As of this writing, the precise name and model number of the
new Sharp PDA was not available. However, sources within Sharp are
referring to the new PDA as a member of the company's Zaurus PDA
family. Sharp's Zaurus PDAs, while highly popular in Japan, have
failed to catch on elsewhere, so this new Linux/Java PDA represents
Sharp's attempt to succeed by carving out a Linux/Java PDA niche in
the US, Europe and other worldwide markets.</p><p>The new Linux/Java PDA, a prototype of which was shown at
JavaOne, sports a bright, full-color &ldquo;quarter-VGA&rdquo; LCD
touch/display, along with a unique built-in QWERTY keyboard. The
keyboard, which has small keys, is not something you'd want to do a
lot of typing on. However, it certainly makes text entry
straightforward.</p><p>Here's a summary of the unit's hardware specs:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>206MHz StrongARM SA-1110 system-on-chip CPU</p></li><li><p>32MB DRAM, 16MB Flash (in the prototype, at
least)</p></li><li><p>240 &times; 320 pixel (&frac14; VGA) full-color TFT
LCD with touchscreen</p></li><li><p>QWERTY keyboard (behind sliding lower
section)</p></li><li><p>CompactFlash and SecureDigital card slots</p></li><li><p>IrDA, serial, USB and audio I/O ports</p></li></ul></div><p>One noteworthy feature of this new PDA is that the keyboard
is hidden &ldquo;inside&rdquo; the lower portion of the PDA; the bottom
section slides down to expose the keyboard. Thanks to this clever
approach, the device has a typical PDA size when the keyboard is
not in use. Also, the keys usually are not exposed to inadvertent
presses.
</p><p>On the software side, Lineo's Embedix was selected by Sharp
as the new PDA's internal Linux OS, along with Tao's Intent JVM and
ACCESS' Java-based NetFront browser. Additionally, Amiga has been
selected to develop Java-based applications for the device,
including things like games, animation and multimedia
applications.</p><p>A key aspect of Sharp's strategy in adopting Linux/Java as
the software environment for this new PDA is to create a vibrant
developer community around the device. To encourage this, Sharp has
launched a developer web site. Those who decide to register as
developers (a quick and simple process) are immediately granted
access to more detailed information about Sharp's new device and
its associated developer program, including a FAQ about the device
and the developer program, detailed specs of the device, discussion
forums, information about development tools and documentation and
application software and libraries (when available).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2576580.0x266f058"></a>Speaking of Linux PDAs</h2></div></div><p>Whatever happened to the G.Mate's YOPY and Agenda's VR3 Linux
PDAs? Both companies have ongoing beta-level products available for
developers to play with, and both are scrambling to get their
products ready for production.</p><p>Agenda is currently in an &ldquo;any moment now&rdquo; wait-loop, so
their VR3 may well be shipping to customers by the time you read
this. G.Mate hopes to have a fully released product shipping by
November of this year and is obviously racing against Sharp to be
the first to ship a high-end, Linux-based PDA. Also, MIZI Research
is rumored to have formed a partnership with a major Korean
electronics manufacturer, in an effort to bring out a Linux-based
PDA/cell phone combo by the year's end.</p><p>At this rate, we could be facing an oversupply of Linux PDAs
as we enter 2002!</p><p><a href="4845s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
