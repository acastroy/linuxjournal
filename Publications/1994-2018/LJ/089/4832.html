    This game is something of a classic already,
    and there's a reason for its popularity despite its potential for
    complexity; it's really, really, really fun.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d36580.0x1e2e4a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>Welcome Tribsoft! <span   class="emphasis"><em>Jagged
Alliance 2</em></span> is the first ported product of this
burgeoning Linux gaming company and a great title to select for
their debut performance. In <span   class="emphasis"><em>JA2</em></span>, a Sir-tech
game from 1999, you direct the operations of a force of mercenaries
as you attempt to help an exiled leader retake control of his
ravaged homeland and release it from the clutches of its despotic
ruler. In order to do this, you must manage your own fiscal
resources, hire and fire the right mercenaries at the right time,
help train guerilla forces, obtain weaponry and supplies, liberate
the countryside of an entire nation, and somewhere in there, you
have to find time to actually fight the bad guys. As one might
imagine, a game with goals so grandiose is going to be a bit long
on options and can pack a learning curve steep enough to twist your
ankle on, especially if you have an aversion to reading manuals.
However, this game is something of a classic already, and there's a
reason for its popularity despite its potential for complexity;
it's really, really, really fun.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d36580.0x1e2e660"></a>The Story</h2></div></div><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Jagged Alliance 2</em></span> was actually the third
installment in the Jagged Alliance series (the second being
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Jagged Alliance: Deadly Games</em></span>), and actually
it isn't the latest. However, Tribsoft is working tirelessly, we're
told, to bring us the next <span   class="emphasis"><em>JA2</em></span> in the series,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Jagged Alliance 2: Unfinished Business</em></span>, at
some point in the near future. Basically, the game revolves around
the actions of a horde of mercenaries under your control as you
attempt to aid the exiled leader of the fictional nation of Arulco.
It seems that Queen Deidranna has abolished the democratic
government and set herself up as supreme ruler of the tiny country
using her military strength to squeeze what wealth and power she
can from her own people (I guess NATO's sitting this one out). The
deposed leader of Arulco, Enrico Chivaldori, contacts you secretly,
and you meet in a quiet bistro at the beginning of the game where
he tells you his sad story and offers you lots of money to help him
out with his homebrew revolution. The plan is simple: you go in,
take back his cities, train his people to defend themselves and
restore him to power. If you agree to help, he can provide a
network of contacts and enough money to get you started (with the
promise of more later). Well, of course you agree (you're a
money-grubbing merc and he has a briefcase full of money for
goodness' sake), and the adventure begins.</p><p>The internal story is really nonlinear. Though the ultimate
goal of retaking the country remains paramount throughout the game,
you are out there to help the people of Arulco, and as such, are
often tasked with subgoals of various types. Objectives like
finding wanted terrorists for bounty, giving messages to covert
agents, training militias and clearing supply corridors for rebel
forces are the kinds of tasks you'll run across at every turn in
<span   class="emphasis"><em>JA2</em></span>. The map itself is so complex and detailed
that you'll also find smaller goals hidden inside larger ones from
time to time. For instance, during one phase as you clear out a
sector of countryside of enemy forces, if you're looking inside
buildings closely you might notice a small T-shirt company. Inside,
you'll discover that the place is exploiting children for labor,
and you can free them with the right plan. During the game, you
actually can talk and interact with NPCs (nonplayer
characters&mdash;there are over 150 of them); indeed, they're invaluable
sources of information and add much to the development of your
game's own unique storyline and history. Perhaps the only downfall
of the free-form nature of <span   class="emphasis"><em>JA2</em></span>'s storyline is
that it opens the possibility for some very long, long games, and
while people simply can play small portions of a larger campaign to
get their fix between <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Simpsons</em></span> and
<span   class="emphasis"><em>The X-Files</em></span>, there really isn't any such thing
as a short <span   class="emphasis"><em>JA2</em></span> game.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d36580.0x1e2ead8"></a>Game Play</h2></div></div><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Jagged Alliance 2</em></span> is a bit of a puzzle.
Is it a role-playing game? No, well, yes. Is it a strategy game?
Sometimes. Is it real-time or turn-based? Yes, it's both; it
depends&mdash;okay, <span   class="emphasis"><em>JA2</em></span> is obviously a bit hard to
pigeonhole into a single category. With <span   class="emphasis"><em>JA2</em></span>,
Sir-tech blended the best parts of strategy, role-playing,
real-time tactics and turn-based gaming in a clever balance that
makes the game really flow nicely once you get into it. The getting
into it, on the other hand, can be something of a challenge. The
diversity and complexity of <span   class="emphasis"><em>JA2</em></span>'s control
interfaces can make <span   class="emphasis"><em>SimCity</em></span> look tame by
comparison; however, I think most players would agree that once
they master the basic elements of the game and get a certain feel
for the minutiae of the interfaces, the level of control is not
only necessary for the combination of role play, strategy and
tactics to function properly, but actually provides a rather
comforting degree of flexibility and adaptability in the game's
mechanics.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4832f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Your Eniac Laptop!
</p></div></div><p>The game starts off on your merc's laptop. Sir-tech has
created its own faux OS interface, loosely based on Windows it
would seem, called sirOS VIII, which can connect (via satellite
modem one must assume) from deep in the jungles of Arulco to a
Sir-tech mockup of the Internet. Much of the resource management in
the game is initiated from here. Indeed, your laptop is nothing
short of vital to your success as a mercenary; you send and receive
e-mail from it (and even receive spam that says it's not spam), you
browse trade web sites, purchase things (like guns and ammo) from
e-commerce sites (some of which are occasionally under
construction) and balance your budget on it. You store files on it,
such as maps of Arulco and reconnaissance information, and can even
browse your logs to recall what you've done and when.</p><p>The game gets going when, from your laptop, you connect to a
couple of web sites and recruit your initial team of mercs. A.I.M.,
the Association of International Mercenaries, is the largest and
most prestigious job exchange available to you, though you do have
the option of personalizing and creating your own custom soldier, a
mercenary who works for free in your group. Your only limitation on
hiring mercs is money, and each merc has his or her own dollar
amount.</p><p>What's more, each merc is totally unique&mdash;they have
personalities, they have their own equipment, some get along well
with others, some don't, some are true professionals who have been
doing this all their lives and some are just crazy backwoods freaks
who want to kill someone for money. One of your biggest challenges
in the game is to construct a team of mercs that will get along
with each other, compliment each others' abilities well, and most
importantly, be able to fight their way through the evil Queen
Deidranna's forces and do it all within your limited budget. As you
progress in the game, you'll have the opportunity to hire or
recruit some of the more advanced mercs and the mercs you hire now
will learn new skills to become wise veteran soldiers.</p><p>It's interesting actually, to get accustomed to your team and
see their individual potentials and personalities emerge and grow
as you play. Some can be quite crass (parents be warned: some mercs
curse like sailors and there are no parental controls available),
others can be wimpy and nerdy or shy and introverted, and almost
all of their random dialogues will leave you grinning and shaking
your head. One of my favorites was a merc code named Steroid
speaking in his Hans and Franz-style Schwarzenegger voice to
announce that he was wounded with a deadpan &ldquo;My skin is punctured
and leaking.&rdquo;</p><p>Your mercs are dropped into a city in Arulco, and basically
from here on, you move around the map in real time. If it takes you
two minutes to cross a bog, it really takes you two minutes. The
large map of Arulco is divided up into large parcels of land, or
sectors, that make up the map your mercs are on at any given
moment. You can separate your mercs into as many squads as you like
and send them to as many different sectors as you like (in fact, as
the game progresses, you'll leave mercs all over the place to train
the locals to be militia soldiers), but you can only zoom in to
look closely at one sector at a time. If you like, you can exit
into a control screen where you can speed up time to make those
long six-hour journeys from one part of the country to another
flash by in the blink of an eye, monitor the locations of all your
mercs on one screen and zoom in at will to any particular hot spot
that interests you. If your mercs run into an enemy at any time,
whether in the close-up real-time view or in the overview, or Map
Screen mode, the game immediately switches over into turn-based
combat, and you have the options of either retreating your people
to an adjoining sector (if you're near a border) or duking it out
with all the Queen's men in the sector.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4832f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Shoot-out at the Airport Gates
</p></div></div><p>In turn-based combat, your mercs have dozens of movement
options available to them, and you must use combat tactics to
maneuver and manipulate them appropriately to win the battles. You
can use the terrain or foliage to provide cover or even vantage
points for ambushes. Your mercs can run across the map to new
locations, crouch down, crawl or even go into a stealth mode that
you can use to sneak up on enemies who haven't seen you yet. Should
your mercs be wounded in battle, someone in your party with medical
skill must administer first aid to them or they will continue to
bleed and lose health. Your mercs can take and give damage to
various body parts (leg shots tend to make them fall down
temporarily, head shots can cause serious injury, etc.) and even
fight hand-to-hand when close enough to an enemy.</p><p>Outside of combat, your mercenaries are still central to your
game play. With your mercs, you secure your only source of income
in the game, the gold and silver mines of Arulco. The more of these
mines you can secure with your forces, the more monthly income you
can derive from them, and thus the more mercs you can hire and
sustain. Mercs also manage weaponry and supplies, they carry and
find all sorts of guns, ammo and armor around the countryside, as
well as medkits, lock-pick kits, crowbars, canteens, flak jackets
and a host of other weird sundry items like bubble gum or beer.
Mercs can also train militia or practice skills when left alone and
actually need to sleep occasionally or will become fatigued and
unable to fight well.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4832f4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Move Your Troops from Sector to Sector on the Map Screen
</p></div></div><p>The graphics in <span   class="emphasis"><em>JA2</em></span> are, well, they're
from 1999. The resolution is limited to 640 &times; 480, and though
I'm not sure you'd actually need to go higher to get any more
information, the display seems somewhat pixelated and blocky by
today's standards. The flip side of this coin is that you quickly
forget about the graphics once you start getting into the game play
or realize that 3-D-rendered bushes aren't really required for this
type of game. The environment is phenomenally complex and epic in
scale; moreover, thousands of objects in each sector can be
manipulated, opened, closed, picked up, blown up, etc. Half the fun
of playing is exploring the diverse landscape and poking around in
buildings for loot. The character animation is really excellent
(the close-up combat scenes actually reminded me quite a bit of
Maxis' <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Sims</em></span>--the detail on the character
movement is just that good), and the cutscenes and &ldquo;movies&rdquo; are
drawn with the game engine itself. The only real fault I could find
in the graphics engine is that the terrain modeling is almost
impossible to interpret in complex situations&mdash;it's nearly
impossible to tell if you are shooting over or at obstacles between
you and your targets (who, incidentally, could apparently see
through walls or trees from time to time). The sound effects are
really awesome, and the musical score, while perhaps somewhat
repetitive in a game that takes this long to play, always fits the
mood of the action perfectly.</p><p>Unfortunately, there simply is no multiplayer mode for
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Jagged Alliance 2</em></span>, period. However, at the
start of each game, you do have several options available to liven
up the party. The difficulty levels do make a big difference in
this game, and your gaming experience changes dramatically based on
which level you choose. You can also set a Tons of Guns option that
drastically increases the numbers of types of guns available to you
at any given point in the game, and you can even, get this, hit the
Sci-Fi option wherein huge alien insects will attack your mercs at
night!</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d36580.0x1e2f6e0"></a>Linux Notes</h2></div></div><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Jagged Alliance 2</em></span> requires a fairly
minimal hardware setup to run. Tribsoft recommends only a PII
233MHz with 32MB RAM, a 4X CD-ROM and 400MB of free hard disk
space. Since nothing about <span   class="emphasis"><em>JA2</em></span> requires 3-D
acceleration, pretty much any card that will run at least XFree86
3.3.x at 640 &times; 480 or higher should work just fine. An
OSS-compatible sound card is required, of course, and Tribsoft also
suggests a version 2.2 Linux kernel (or greater) as well as glibc
2.1 or higher. The game played like a dream on both of the 700MHz
and 500MHz systems I tested it on (GeForce/Debian woody and
G400/VA-enhanced Red Hat, respectively). The installation footprint
can vary from 305MB (the base installation) to over 800MB (if you
want to put all the maps and speech files on your hard disk) and
can be done with either a shell script or a nice-looking graphical
installer.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d36580.0x1e2f898"></a>Summary</h2></div></div><p>This is really a great game. At first, I admit, I was
skeptical about this title, owing mainly to its relative age in the
gaming market, low-tech graphics and seemingly overly complex
controls, but once I got to know <span   class="emphasis"><em>JA2</em></span>, I really
began to understand just how cool this game is and why Tribsoft
chose to port it. It's one of those games that you can play a
hundred times and have a hundred different games and still want to
try something different the next time. There's an attractiveness to
this game that's hard to define; maybe it's the profound
individuality of the mercs themselves, the personal touches from
all the dialogues of the NPCs, the choose-your-own-adventure feel
or the ever-so-smooth transitions between strategy, tactics, real
time and turn-based action modes. Either way,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>JA2</em></span> is a game that you can play for hours on
end and still want more. Highly recommended for anyone not afraid
of a little complexity in their games.</p><p><a href="4832s1.html" target="_self">The Good/The Bad</a></p></div></div>
