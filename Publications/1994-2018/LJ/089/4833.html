    How to write servlets and basic applications using the tools
    that come with Enhydra.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xeee580.0xfe63f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>Last month, we looked at XMLC, a new
system for displaying dynamic web content that comes with the
Enhydra application server. This month, we will look at how to
write servlets and basic applications using the tools that come
with Enhydra. While Enhydra's web applications are not as
standardized as servlets with Jakarta-Tomcat, they do offer a fair
amount of power and the possibility of creating Enterprise
JavaBeans with a fully open-source infrastructure.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xeee580.0xfe6500"></a>History and Background</h2></div></div><p>Enhydra is an open-source application server written in Java,
aiming for full compliance with Sun's J2EE specifications. Lutris,
the company that spearheads Enhydra development, has made the
application server available under a BSD-like license. The current
stable version of Enhydra is 3.x and includes support for a large
number of standards, including servlets and JSPs. Enhydra
Enterprise, which is slated for release during the summer of 2001,
will have additional J2EE features, including support for
Enterprise Java Beans (EJB).</p><p>Enhydra itself is available as a fully open-source product,
meaning that you can download it from the Web and install it. But
for those clients who might be suspicious of open-source software,
who want to use a packaged product that has gone through quality
assurance or who want to get support from Lutris, commercial
versions of Enhydra are available. I suspect that most people
reading this column will not need support from Lutris, but it is
good to know that they are ready and willing to help others use the
product.</p><p>Lutris is aiming Enhydra not just at the J2EE market but also
at the market for wireless internet applications. I personally have
yet to see a compelling use of cellular internet technologies&mdash;the
WAP functionality on my mobile phone could charitably be called
pathetic&mdash;but Lutris is positioning Enhydra as a player in what
will inevitably become a hot market.</p><p>While Enhydra has yet to develop the mindshare or community
of Zope and the ArsDigita Community System, they have managed to
score a fair number of impressive commercial triumphs. In
particular, Hewlett-Packard recently announced that they would work
with Lutris to market and use Enhydra in a number of applications.
If nothing else, this proves that open-source application servers
do have an important place in the world of web application
development and that they can provide a compelling case even to
companies that could otherwise afford to pay much more.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xeee580.0xfe6710"></a>Getting Started</h2></div></div><p>Now that we've reviewed a bit of the background, let's try to
create some basic web applications using Enhydra. The first task,
of course, is to download and install the product. I decided to
download the beta of Enhydra Enterprise, in no small part because I
wanted to play with the EJB features. As of the beta release,
Enhydra Enterprise requires JDK 1.3, a pleasant contrast to
previous releases that required JDK 1.2 even after 1.3 had been
released for quite a while.</p><p>I downloaded and unpacked the Enhydra tar file, which created
a large number of files and directories under the enhydra4.0
directory. As you might guess, the doc directory contains
documentation, the lib directory contains .jar files that Enhydra
needs and the conf directory contains global Enhydra configuration
files. There is also a bin directory, in which nearly all files are
shell scripts (with Windows .bat equivalents) that execute the
various Java programs that make up Enhydra.</p><p>To ensure that the Enhydra shell scripts and Java programs
are aware of the directory in which you installed Enhydra, run the
configure shell script in the root directory of the Enhydra
distribution (to which I will refer as $ENHYDRA).
<span   class="bold"><b>configure</b></span> takes a single mandatory
argument, the root directory of your JDK installation.
<span   class="bold"><b>configure</b></span> modifies a number of
Makefiles and other configuration files but does not force a
recompilation of any code. After running configure (which does not
produce any visible output), run the bash shell script (setup.bash)
in $ENHYDRA, which adds the JDK executable directory to your
PATH.</p><p>Enhydra consists of a number of different interrelated
software packages. The application server itself, known as the
multiserver, can work directly opposite HTTP clients or with a
front-end web server such as Apache acting as a proxy. You can
reduce the number of services that the multiserver starts up or
change the order in which they are started by changing the
loadOrder property in $ENHYDRA/conf/bootstrap.conf.</p><p>To start the multiserver, simply run
<b  >$ENHYDRA/bin/multiserver</b>. It should start up
right away, launching services one at a time until you finally see
the message, &ldquo;Bootstrapper initialized normally&rdquo;. At this point,
you can test the multiserver by pointing your web browser at port
8001, which should bring up a control panel for viewing the current
state of your multiserver.</p><p>My initial attempts to launch the multiserver failed, with
the program complaining that it was unable to find enhydra.jar in
my CLASSPATH. Particularly confusing here was the fact that I
couldn't find any such file as enhydra.jar in the entire Enhydra
distribution.</p><p>The solution turned out to be simple, if not obvious: Enhydra
knows what CLASSPATH is necessary in order to run each of its
programs but will ignore those settings if you have already set
your CLASSPATH. So before running the multiserver, make sure to
unset CLASSPATH, removing this environment variable. Once you have
done this, the multiserver should come up as expected.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xeee580.0xfe6b30"></a>Building a Simple Web Application</h2></div></div><p>Over the last few months, we have looked at Java servlets and
JavaServer Pages. Enhydra, as a J2EE-compliant application server,
fully supports these technologies. Moreover, as an open-source
server, Enhydra uses the Jakarta-Tomcat engine as the basis for its
servlets and JSPs. As we will see later, it is possible (and often
preferable) to use Enhydra's own advanced form of web
applications.</p><p>It's relatively easy to create servlets using the tools that
come with Enhydra. And indeed, Enhydra's authors have spent a great
deal of time creating a system that is not only powerful when
deployed, but relatively easy to work with during
development.</p><p>If you are used to simply writing a servlet, compiling it and
dropping it into a directory, then you will find that Enhydra gets
in the way, complicating the process. This is in no small part due
to the way in which Enhydra applications are deployed&mdash;rather than
requiring an external server, Enhydra expects that you will want to
test (and run) many of your web applications independently of any
others.</p><p>To create a simple servlet, we will use the application
generation wizard (appwizard) that comes with Enhydra, which you
can invoke as $ENHYDRA/bin/appwizard. The appwizard is not an IDE
but rather a sophisticated file-copying program that provides a
basic skeleton application that already works.</p><p>When you first run appwizard, it will ask you whether you
want to develop a web application (i.e., standard servlet) or an
Enhydra super servlet. Choose a standard web application; super
servlets will come later. The next screen will ask whether you want
to produce output in HTML or WML, the latter being the standard
XML-based format for cellular internet applications. We will use
HTML and will call both the project directory and the package
&ldquo;atf&rdquo;. By default, Enhydra applications are placed under your
home directory in the subdirectory enhydraApps. Choose a license
under which your code will be released, and appwizard will generate
files for your new application.</p><p>And indeed, appwizard creates a large number of automatically
generated files and directories. Among them are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>a global Makefile that allows us to build the
application. There are individual Makefiles in a number of the
applications subdirectories as well.</p></li><li><p>config.mk, which defines a number of environment
variables on which the Makefile depends, with such information as
the Enhydra version, the location of your JDK installation and the
location of your Enhydra installation.</p></li><li><p>the src directory that contains the source code for
Java servlets and HTML files. Under src is a standard WEB-INF
directory, whose web.xml file names each of the servlets we plan to
deploy. The atf directory, whose name depends on the project we
created, contains four subdirectories: business, data, presentation
and resources. The two that interest us most are the presentation
and resources directories, since the former contains servlets and
the latter contains HTML files and JSPs.</p></li></ul></div><p>To build the application, simply run a
<b  >make</b> in the root directory of our project. (The
Enhydra Enterprise documentation makes a big deal out of saying
that it now uses the Java-based Ant build tool in favor of make,
but application creation still appears to rely on make.)
</p><p>After make completes its work, there will be a new output
subdirectory at the top level of our application, parallel to src
and input. The output directory contains everything we need in
order to launch our application, including a standard Java .war
(web archive) file containing our .class files, XML descriptors,
JSPs and images:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
WEB-INF/classes/atf/presentation/WelcomeHTML.class
WEB-INF/classes/atf/presentation/WelcomeServlet.class
WEB-INF/classes/atf/presentation/RedirectServlet.class
media/Enhydra.gif
index.jsp
WEB-INF/web.xml
</pre><p>Notice that we have three .class files here, while there were
only two in src/atf/presentation/. That's because XMLC turned the
HTML file from src/resources into a Java source file, which was
then turned into a Java .class file.
</p><p>So with just two commands, appwizard and make, we have
managed to create a full, running Enhydra application. The
application, as it stands, doesn't do anything particularly complex
or interesting, but it provides us with a skeleton that we can then
modify and extend.</p><p>To run our application, we run
<b  >output/start4</b>. This starts the application on
port 9000 (defined in input/conf/servlet/servlet.conf.in). If you
point your web browser to http://localhost:9000/, you will see the
output from our servlet: the Enhydra logo, the name of our
application (atf), the current time and date and a hyperlink that
redirects you back to the application.</p><p>The HTML page is generated by XMLC and demonstrates how XMLC
is integrated into the rest of Enhydra. XMLC compiles
src/atf/resources/Welcome.html into a Java servlet, which is then
turned into a .class file. The Java class created by XMLC includes
a hook for each of the &lt;span&gt; tags in the file, allowing
retrieval and modifications of anything within a &lt;span&gt; tag
that has an ID attribute.</p><p>WelcomeServlet, the servlet that is initially executed in our
application, displays the current time and date by creating an
instance of the XMLC-generated class:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
now = DateFormat.getTimeInstance(DateFormat.MEDIUM) .format(new Date());
welcome = new WelcomeHTML();
welcome.getElementTime().getFirstChild() .setNodeValue(now);
</pre><p>In other words, we replace the text within the &lt;span&gt;
tag with an ID of &ldquo;time&rdquo; by turning the HTML file into a
DOM-accessible tree and then changing the value of a specific node.
</p><p>To add additional servlets to our application, we can write
and save them in src/atf/presentation. Note that the package will
be atf.presentation and not simply atf. We will write a very simple
class, Foo, which you can see in Listing 1. Except for the package
name, there isn't any difference between traditional servlets and
Foo.java.</p><p><a href="4833l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1. Foo.java</a></p><p>Now we need to tell the servlet engine to map a URL to our
servlet. We do this in src/WEB-INF/web.xml. This XML file is
divided into two parts: the first maps servlet classes to servlet
names, and the second maps servlet names to URLs. Listing 2
contains a version of web.xml modified to handle mapping our Foo
servlet.</p><p><a href="4833l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2. Modified Version of
web.xml</a></p><p>Finally, we need to include our new class in the Makefile,
adding the name of our class to the CLASSES variable:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
CLASSES = WelcomeServlet \
RedirectServlet Foo
</pre><p>Run <b  >make</b> and check that Foo.class has been
added to the application with:
<pre     class="programlisting">
jar tvf output/archive/atf.war
</pre>


If it all works, then run <b  >output/start4</b>, and
point your browser to http://localhost:9000/foo. You should see the
HTML output delivered by our new Foo servlet.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xeee580.0xfe7898"></a>Building an Enhydra Application</h2></div></div><p>Experienced web developers, regardless of the language or
environment, are used to writing a separate program for each web
page. If you want to display five different dynamically generated
pages, then you must write five different CGI programs, mod_perl
handlers, servlets or JSP pages.</p><p>Enhydra allows developers to break away from this model,
thinking in terms of applications rather than individual pages. The
way to do this is with super servlets, as they are known, in which
a single application object is associated with multiple
presentation objects.</p><p>You can easily identify a presentation object in an Enhydra
URL; the suffix .po tells Enhydra that it should invoke the object
named in the URL. So requesting Abc.po will execute the run()
method for the presentation object Abc. Unlike standard Java
servlets, presentation objects are instantiated once for each HTTP
request. This may be less efficient than using multiple threads on
a single-servlet instance, but it does remove the headaches
associated with writing threadsafe servlet code.</p><p>A simple Enhydra application will thus consist of at least
one application object, plus at least one presentation object.
These POs, as they are known, can then connect to the two other
main types of Enhydra objects: business objects (which perform
commonly needed functions) and data objects (which map persistent
storage, such as a relational database, to a Java class). Each of
these three types of objects&mdash;presentation, business and data&mdash;has
its own directory within an application's src subdirectory, as we
have already seen. Moreover, each of these objects constitutes one
of the three standard tiers in a three-tier web application. So
while it might take some time to get used to the separation between
object types, this model is becoming increasingly prevalent in web
applications.</p><p>Once again, we will use Enhydra's appwizard to create a
skeleton application that we can change. Run
<b  >appwizard</b> again, but choose super servlet from
the selection list on the first screen, rather than a simple web
application. I chose to call the project myproject and to put it in
the il.co.lerner package, which is what I use for internal projects
at my company. <span   class="bold"><b>appwizard</b></span> then
creates a skeleton application in ~/enhydraApps/myproject. The
application has a similar structure to our servlet, with a similar
directory structure. Under src/il/co/lerner, we have presentation,
data and business directories. And once again, there is a top-level
Makefile that will compile and create our super servlet.</p><p>Look at presentation/WelcomePresentation.java, the source
code for the presentation object that will eventually be displayed.
Indeed, if we type <b  >make</b> at the top-level
directory, run <b  >output/start4</b> to start our
application and point our web browser to http://localhost:9000/, we
will find that our browser is redirected to
http://localhost:9000/WelcomePresentation.po. This page displays
the same sample output that our skeleton servlet printed, with the
Enhydra logo and the current time and date.</p><p>The po suffix, as we already know, tells Enhydra to invoke
the run() method in WelcomePresentation. In the automatically
created skeleton application, WelcomePresentation.run() looks like
Listing 3.</p><p><a href="4833l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3.
WelcomePresentation.run()</a></p><p>The super servlet interface is similar to that of a regular
servlet and does not take much time for a programmer familiar with
servlets to learn. The run() method takes a single argument of type
HttpPresentationComms, which provides our presentation object with
all of its communication needs to the outside world, including the
HTTP request and response objects.</p><p>The run() method displays output by creating an instance of
WelcomeHTML, the Java class that XMLC created from the file
Welcome.HTML. Following that, run() replaces the contents of the
&lt;span&gt; tags with an ID of &ldquo;time&rdquo; with the current date and
time. Then we write the contents of welcome, which contains a DOM
tree, to the HTTP response object.</p><p>We can create our own presentation object, FooPresentation,
as demonstrated in Listing 4. Remember to add the new object to the
CLASSES line in the presentation directory's Makefile. When you
rerun make from the top-level application directory,
FooPresentation will be compiled and inserted into our Enhydra
application.</p><p><a href="4833l4.html" target="_self">Listing 4.
FooPresentation.java</a></p><p>It's very nice to be able to write our own presentation
objects, but where is the application object that is controlling
them? In the main source directory, at the same level as the
presentation, data and business directories, there is a Java class
file whose name is the same as the project&mdash;so in our case, there
is a file at src/il/co/lerner/myproject.java.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xeee580.0x13e0220"></a>Deploying Our Super Servlet</h2></div></div><p>Until now, we have only run our super servlet on its own,
outside of the overall multiserver. This functionality is great for
developers who want to be able to test applications without
interfering with the main production web site, but we will want to
add our application to that server at some point.</p><p>Enhydra makes this relatively easy to do: we add information
about our application to the multiserver's configuration file, so
that it can find the application. Then we use the multiserver's
control panel to add our application to the production server under
the URL of our choice. At that point, our application is available
for all the world to see.</p><p>In order to accomplish this, we must start the multiserver
once again, with the shell script $ENHYDRA/bin/multiserver. This
makes the multiserver available on port 8001. Load the
administration screen in your browser, and look at the list of
available applications in the top-left corner.</p><p>Now we will copy the application configuration file&mdash;but not
the application itself&mdash;named output/conf/myproject.conf and copy
it to the global multiserver directory, $ENHYDRA/apps. Then edit
$ENHYDRA/apps/myproject.conf, changing the value of
Server.ClassPath[]. There are already two possible values for
Server.ClassPath[] in myproject.conf: one for running the
application in standalone mode and another for running it under the
multiserver. Comment out the (first) standalone value, and
uncomment the (second) multiserver value.</p><p>Having done this, return to your web browser and click on the
Add button (with a big + sign on it) in the multiserver control
panel. We're going to add a new application, whose name (myproject)
should be in the selection list. Choose a root URL for this
application, and enter any text string you want for this
application's group. Click on OK to add the application.</p><p>Now refresh the multiserver control panel. In the upper
left-hand corner, you should see &ldquo;myproject&rdquo;, along with whatever
other applications might currently be loaded. If you click on the
myproject name, the right-hand side of the screen will fill with
information about myproject.</p><p>To run the application, we need to define one or more
connections for our application and then run it. By default, our
application will run on ports 8002 and 8003; we can add one or more
new connections if we want. Once the connections are defined, click
on the Run button on the left side of the screen. The connection
URLs will become hyperlinks, and clicking on one of them will open
a connection to our web application&mdash;with the Enhydra logo and
current time&mdash;displayed in a new window. (I normally find
JavaScript and new windows to be annoying, but the Enhydra authors
have somehow managed to balance taste and functionality with a
decent-looking web interface.)</p><p>We can test our FooPresentation object by changing the URL,
replacing WelcomePresentation.po to FooPresentation.po. Sure
enough, we see our simple Foo HTML output displayed in the
browser.</p><p>We can remove our application from one or more ports or from
the multiserver entirely using the web-based control panel.
Finally, we can shut down the multiserver either using the control
panel or by pressing Ctrl-C in the terminal window where we started
it.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xeee580.0x13e05e8"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>It is not inherently difficult to write servlets, but Enhydra
offers much more than just servlets. In particular, they provide an
environment that makes it easy to write and test servlets without
having to run a full web server. Moreover, the super servlets that
Enhydra provides can be easier to work with than regular servlets,
especially since we can avoid having to deal with threading issues
and writing a new overall handler application for each page.</p><p>There are, of course, some drawbacks. Enhydra, like most Java
programs, requires a fair amount of patience when setting
CLASSPATH. (Although to the credit of Lutris, removing my own
CLASSPATH solved almost all of those problems.) And while Enhydra's
automatically generated Makefiles dramatically reduce the amount of
thought that you must put into creating a finished web application,
Java programs always seem to require ten times as many files as
their Perl and Python counterparts.</p><p>While super servlets are certainly an improvement over their
nonsuper cousins, I always hesitate before jumping into a
technology that deviates from a known, well-documented and mature
standard&mdash;particularly when the Open Source community seems to be
taking its time to rally around Enhydra in a major way. Finally,
while it's true that Enhydra Enterprise is not yet a released
product, the installation instructions and documentation leave
something to be desired.</p><p>With all of these reservations, I easily can see myself using
Enhydra for future Java development, instead of the plain, vanilla
Jakarta-Tomcat that I have used in the past. The combination of
XMLC and an integrated environment is quite attractive in many
ways.</p><p>As I mentioned earlier, one of the reasons I am most excited
about Enhydra Enterprise is its ability to connect to Sun's
Enterprise JavaBeans. Over the next two months, we will look more
closely at Enhydra, first investigating its DODS tool for mapping
relational databases to Java objects. Then we will dip our toes
into the world of EJB, demonstrating that just because we rely on
open-source products doesn't mean that our tools are any less
capable than proprietary programmers.</p><p><a href="4833s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
