Learn exactly what's in all those packets flying by on your
network with this essential development and administration tool.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2877580.0x296f240"></a></h2></div></div><p>
I recently started using a network tool called Ethereal. For those
familiar with tcpdump, think of Ethereal as
a GUI form of tcpdump that shows you the whole packet and can break
down the packet to show individual fields. For those who haven't
used tcpdump or similar packet sniffers, it might be best to show
the capabilities of Ethereal through a few examples.
</p><p>
When you start Ethereal, it looks like the graphic shown in Figure
1.
Typically, you want to capture some data from
the network attached to your workstation; do this by selecting
Capture&rarr;Start..., which brings up the dialog shown in Figure 2. When
you've captured the data you need, stop the capture and
examine it. Figure 3 shows a capture of some IPv6 traffic, where I've
selected an ICMPv6 packet (in the top frame) and expanded the
IPv6 and ICMPv6 contents to select the IPv6 source address (in the
middle frame). Ethereal automatically highlights the raw
bytes corresponding to the selected field&mdash;in this case, source
address&mdash;within the packet in the bottom frame. This type of
functionality makes Ethereal useful for understanding various
network protocols, and I definitely recommend its use as a teaching or
self-education aid in conjunction with networking RFCs. Ethereal also is
useful for educating users and management about the dangers of
using protocols that send data in clear text, as shown for File
Transfer Protocol in Figure 4.

</p></div></div><p>
Ethereal also is useful for investigating proprietary protocols or
other networking protocols that are not well documented. Figure 5
shows a somewhat contrived example&mdash;rsync. This protocol is in
widespread use because of its ability to save significant bandwidth but is essentially defined by the source code to the application. I
used Ethereal to capture a number of rsync transactions and figured
out how the protocol works&mdash;at least enough to write an rsync protocol
dissector for Ethereal. I understand the Samba team uses
Ethereal and a number of other tools to develop clients and servers
that interoperate with the Microsoft CIFS implementations, because the
Microsoft documentation for these protocols is incomplete or
incorrect.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6842f5.large.jpg"><img src="6842f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. Ethereal Capturing rsync (Now Supported)
</p></div></div><p>
I also have used Ethereal as a part of network application testing (on
zcip and Service Location Protocol) to assess correctness and
response times. Ethereal time-tags each transaction, so you easily can
see the relationship between packets.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2877580.0x296fce8"></a>
How Ethereal Works</h2></div></div><p>
Ethereal works by capturing packets through a reasonably portable
library called libpcap, which on Linux accesses the packets on the
network through using a kernel mechanism called packet socket.
It is possible to disable this option under Linux, although probably all
vendor kernels have it enabled, and it is enabled in the default
kernel configuration for most architectures on Linux
kernels. Other operating systems have different interfaces, but
libpcap abstracts this away and provides a common API.
</p><p>
Having received a copy of the network packets, Ethereal builds an
internal linked list and saves the packets to a file. It then
determines what protocol the packet is carrying based on the port
numbers, type fields in the supporting protocols or a heuristic that
guesses the protocol based on the contents of the field. It is worth
noting that this approach essentially is informed guesswork and is by
no means infallible. For example, traffic to port 53 probably is DNS,
but there is no reason why a network administrator could not choose to
run another service on that port. In addition, Ethereal supports
an option to interpret a particular packet as a different protocol,
using Tools&rarr;Decode As.
</p><p>
Based on the guessed protocol, Ethereal decodes (dissects, in
Ethereal nomenclature) the packet. Each protocol supported by Ethereal
is handled through a bit of code known as a dissector. At the time
of this writing, 333 dissectors are built in to Ethereal, some of
which handle more than one protocol. Protocols also can be provided as
plugins, which are loaded dynamically. Depending on the protocol
and the level of sophistication provided by the dissector code, the
packets can be broken down for analysis of individual bits or they can be
presented at a very high level. Both options are depicted in Figure 6,
where the TCP dissector shows the individual bits set in the flags,
but the IMAP dissector breaks out only two fields. It is worth noting
that IMAP is a text-based protocol, so a simple ASCII dump of the
packet contents is an appropriate way to show them.

Key Features</h2></div></div><p>
From my point of view, the key features of Ethereal are its ability to
capture and analyze network traffic within a single application and
the sophistication of its display and filtering code.
</p><p>
Although we looked earlier in this article at how capturing network traffic
is done, Ethereal can capture more than
Ethernet traffic. Ethereal typically can (at least on Linux)
capture data from Ethernet, Token-Ring, FDDI, serial (PPP and SLIP),
802.11 wireless LAN, ATM connections and all networking devices at
the same time. Called the &ldquo;any&rdquo; device in the Ethereal capture
dialog, this feature only works in Linux. Of course, suitable
networking hardware and kernel drivers need to be enabled to get
the packets.
</p><p>
On a busy network, you may have thousands of packets in a capture
file and be interested in only some of them. To make it easier to
interpret the Ethereal display, which can get pretty busy, you can
use colors. From the Display&rarr;Colorize Display... option, you can
select display packets in various colors; Figure 7 shows how the
filter is specified. In this case, I'm filtering on only a single
field (the version number for Service Location Protocol), but you
can build sophisticated filters with Boolean logic. Figure 8
shows a typical example with a few filters, and Figure 9 shows the
working display (with Service Location Protocol Version 2 in red, DNS
in green and ARP in blue). You can use a wide range of text
colors as well as background coloring to
separate out the various protocols.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6842f7.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

Figure 9. A Typical Colorized Capture Session
</p></div></div><p>
After coloring the display, the next step is to remove packets
of no interest, a task Ethereal handles through display
filtering. A simple example is shown in Figure 10, where adding a
srvloc filter (in the bottom left of the window) has removed all the
other protocols, leaving only the Service Location Protocol. If this
still is too complex, you could choose to change the coloring again,
this time showing packets from particular hosts in separate colors or packets
containing particular types of client requests or server responses in
particular colors.

Figure 10. Display Filtering on Same Session as Shown in Figure 9
</p></div></div><p>
Another option is to not capture the unwanted packets in the first place. To do this,
Ethereal supports the same capture filter syntax that tcpdump uses. An
example of this syntax is shown in Figure 11, where the dialog captures
only the packets going to or from the machine with IP 192.168.0.1.
Unfortunately, the syntax used in capture filters is
different from that used in the display filters, a fact that makes capture
filtering much less accessible to occasional users.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6842f11.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div><p>
Another feature that some people find useful is the Follow TCP
Stream... tool, which presents a text representation of the
conversation. I personally don't use this feature often, but it is a
powerful tool for looking at text-based protocols such as IMAP (Figure 12).

Misfeatures and Omissions</h2></div></div><p>
Apart from the different syntaxes required for capturing and displaying
filters, I've come across a few other issues in the
time I've been using Ethereal. Some of these have to do with personal preferences,
and others have been gleaned from monitoring the Ethereal mailing lists.
</p><p>
At the time of this writing, my biggest issue is with the quality of the support documentation,
especially the User's Guide, which is incomplete and outdated.
Also, a significant amount of the User's Guide, about the last 80%, is
generated automatically and is not
user-friendly. In addition, the version on the Web site
has not been regenerated in some time. I personally found the GUI a
little difficult to get used to, although as I became more familiar
with the various menus, I became more productive with
Ethereal. Perhaps some better documentation would have helped with
this. There is also limited developer documentation, although I see
this as a less important issue, given the large number of examples from
which you can work.
</p><p>
Various users occasionally ask &ldquo;when will such and such a protocol be
supported?&rdquo; Where I have found a few protocols not
supported by Ethereal (rsync, distcc and ACAP), I've generally needed
to code support myself. This is fairly easy to do with Ethereal.
If you need support for a particular protocol, however, and it is not
supported by Ethereal at the moment, you should allow for some
development effort (either as an in-house development or on a
contract basis) before committing to Ethereal. If you do develop
additional dissectors or enhance an existing one, I strongly recommend
that you have it incorporated into the Ethereal source tree to ensure
it remains up to date.
</p><p>
Another feature supported by other packet analysis tools is the ability
to capture data on a remote host and display it locally. If
you can run Ethereal on the remote host, this scenario is possible,
but often you want to capture data on a machine acting as a
router or a server, where a full-blown X environment is
undesirable. This lack may be overcome in a future version or it
may not be particularly important, depending on your environment.
</p><p>
The only other issue worth mentioning is that a substantial number
of the queries on the user-support mailing list seem to be from
Windows users experiencing a wide range of problems. I personally
haven't run the Windows version, so I don't know if the difficulties
are associated with the underlying tools (especially WinPcap), Windows
itself or the skill levels of the users.

manual, downloads and mailing lists.
</p><p>
To understand better what Ethereal is showing you, you need the
appropriate documentation on the network protocol. Those protocols,
codified by the Internet Engineering Task Force, are available at
<a href="http://www.rfc-editor.org" target="_self">www.rfc-editor.org</a>.
</p><p>
rsync is an efficient network file transfer application originally
developed by Andrew Tridgell (of Samba fame). See <a href="http://rsync.samba.org" target="_self">rsync.samba.org</a>.
</p><p>
zcip is a tool for automatic assignment (zeroconf) of IPv4 addresses,
without needing a DHCP server. See <a href="http://zeroconf.sourceforge.net" target="_self">zeroconf.sourceforge.net</a>.
</p><p>
Service Location Protocol is a way for clients to find servers in a
network-efficient way. See <a href="http://www.srvloc.org" target="_self">www.srvloc.org</a> for more details on
the protocol, or refer to RFC 2608, RFC 2609, RFC 2610 and RFC 2614,
available from <a href="http://www.rfc-editor.org" target="_self">www.rfc-editor.org</a>. A free implementation,
mainly developed by Matt Peterson, is available at <a href="http://www.openslp.org" target="_self">www.openslp.org</a>.
</p><p>
The capturing capabilities of Ethereal depend on libpcap, developed by
the TCPDUMP Group. You need libpcap to build Ethereal, although most
distributions ship with libpcap packages. See <a href="http://www.tcpdump.org" target="_self">www.tcpdump.org</a>.
</p><p>
The Windows version of libpcap is WinPcap. See <a href="http://winpcap.polito.it" target="_self">winpcap.polito.it</a> for more information and to download the
installer package.
</p><p>
IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol) is a server-based e-mail
protocol, in many ways superior to the Post Office Protocol (POP) that
is widely used. For more details, get RFC 2060 from <a href="http://www.rfc-editor.org" target="_self">www.rfc-editor.org</a>.
</p><p>
distcc is a distributed compilation application developed by Martin
Pool that uses various network machines to participate in building C
code. See <a href="http://distcc.samba.org" target="_self">distcc.samba.org</a>.
