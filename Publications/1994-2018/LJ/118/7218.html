Laptop Vendor Catches the Cluetrain</h4><p>
As a Linux user and supporter, while I truly enjoy seeing evidence of
businesses that get it, I also feel I have to share my experiences with
a vendor that for a time seemed to have forgotten that one of the most
important values we share, as buyers and sellers, users and hackers, is
community, and that whenever we stray from open communication and straight
dealing, we do so at our own peril.
</p><p>
Four months ago, I set out to purchase a new laptop to replace an aging
VAIO that I had loaded with Linux manually, and in addition to the
creeping obsolescence of the hardware, I always have been frustrated by
certain incompatibilities, especially the IEEE 1394 chipset. I was
looking forward to getting a beefier machine, from a Linux friendly
vendor, so I finally could do some amateur video work with my Mini-DV
camcorder.
I decided to purchase my system from QLI, based on several
recommendations I found in the on-line archives of this very magazine.
I was excited at the prospect of receiving my new, more powerful,
super-slim, pre-loaded with my fave distro, with 100% compatible
hardware laptop. I initially was encouraged that my credit card was charged
right away, assuming this meant the unit would ship soon. This quickly
turned to confusion, frustration and eventually anger.
</p><p>
For the next two months, every time I tried to get information about my
order, I was given a new variation of some story about how bad the
supplier was. They don't speak English; they never send e-mail; their
ETAs are always vague. I was understanding at first, but less so with
each passing week, especially when an important trip came and went, and
I still had to use my existing, ailing portable. At the two-month
mark, I was facing the prospect of another trip, with more intermittent
failures due to x-ray machines and increasingly poor battery life. Do
you know how hard it is to find a usable outlet in some airports?
</p><p>
I canceled the order and was told the refund might take a while;
the sales department could be slow at times. They were so slow that
the original credit card expired, a fact even I had failed to notice.
This merely made an already bad situation worse. Communication, which
had never been very good, got worse. I had to send an e-mail every day,
sometimes several times a day, to get a reply at the rate of about once
a week. This time, the stories told were about problems with the order
system and the credit-card processing company. More weeks passed
without resolution and without any good explanation of why I was
continuing to have to pay finance charges on a purchase that was never
fulfilled. I was more irritated with the poor communication than
anything else.
</p><p>
Finally, I lodged a complaint with the local Better Business Bureau and
sent a draft of my letter to <i  >Linux Journal</i>, in hopes that external
intervention might draw enough attention to bring things to a
satisfactory resolution. I am pleased to report that it did, although
I am still disappointed it took as long as it did and that I had to
take the actions I did.
</p><p>
Finally, the matter came to the attention of Ray Sanders, CTO and one
of the founders of QLI. He helped clarify some of the internal issues
that had caused this whole affair to drag on and also explained some of
the steps that had been taken to correct the situation, including
mandatory staff training, staff reviews for those involved and serious
negotiations with the credit-card processing company who apparently
were at least partly to blame, at one point attempting to issue the
refund but only successfully debiting QLI, never crediting my account.
</p><p>
Ray's involvement finally resulted in a full refund, plus an unasked-for little extra to help defray the finance charges. Most importantly,
Ray clearly communicated along the way what he was doing and when I
should expect to see things happen and made himself directly available
in case of a problem. He also was genuinely upset that it took his
involvement to sort things out, another encouraging sign that someone
in the organization gets it. I also see this as further proof that
success can be dangerous, in that quick growth often dilutes important
values no matter how strongly held at the outset.
</p><p>
Companies like QLI offer products and services that appeal to a market
filled with savvier-than-usual consumers, so they must remember that
trust and respect are as important to building and keeping goodwill as
superior products and services at competitive prices. Problems such as
mine should be seen as opportunities to prove commitments to the
community through honesty, communication and courage.

Porting US House of Representatives Software to Linux?</h4><p>
I started the Linux-pe mailing list over a year ago, with the
purpose of providing a platform for Linux advocates in the US to
<span   class="emphasis"><em>organize</em></span> to bring Linux into US governments at
the local, state and national levels.
My own personal project, as I live in Silver Spring, Maryland,
a subway ride from Capitol Hill, is to get Linux usable by
Congress. Now any member of Congress certainly can install
Linux, but this will do a House of Representatives member very
little good unless he or she can use the HIR (House Information
Resources) software, which has not been ported to Linux, although
there is nothing in principle preventing it from being ported.
</p><p>
Our Congressman here in the Maryland suburbs is Chris Van
Hollen, a liberal Democrat. He is intelligent and energetic,
but not at all IT-aware, nor is his staff. However, by dint
of energetic lobbying&mdash;e-mails and visits by me and several
other of his Linux-minded constituents&mdash;we have persuaded
Mr Van Hollen to write a letter to the members of the
Committee on House Administration, asking this committee,
the one in charge of HIR, to investigate the issue of porting
the client to Linux.
I believe we should all congratulate Mr Van Hollen for taking
this initiative and ask the members of the Committee on House
Administration to act on Mr Van Hollen's proposal.

SE Linux from Outside the USA</h4><p>
I would like to correct a mistaken letter published in the November 2003
issue of <i  >Linux Journal</i> [&ldquo;SE Linux outside
US?&rdquo;].
I did my initial SE Linux work while living in The Netherlands
and had no problem accessing any part of the NSA Web site using
the Zon and KPN ISPs. I am now living in Australia and still
have no problem accessing the NSA site.
I am not aware of any country restrictions on who can access
the site, and I am quite sure that there is no block on The
Netherlands.

Mandrake Automatically Recognizes Pen Drives</h4><p>
I just finished reading the December 2003 issue of <i  >Linux Journal</i>, and I was
pleased as usual. The article &ldquo;Floppies for the New
Millennium&rdquo;
by Rick Moen contained an excellent tip about using noatime for USB pen drives,
which I have now adopted.

As Moen pointed out, the problem of mounting his pen drive
read/write seems to be with that brand. I have used a Universal
Smart Drive for some time without any mounting problems.
Using Linux-Mandrake 9.1, the first time I plugged in the pen
drive, an icon was added to the KDE desktop and an entry was
added to /etc/fstab (noatime added by me):


<pre     class="programlisting">
/dev/sdb1 /mnt/removable auto
user,iocharset=iso8859-1,kudzu,codepage=850,noauto,noatime,umask=0,exec
0 0
</pre>
</p><p>
Right-clicking on the icon allows you to mount or unmount the pen
drive. Of course, as a holdover from the old days, I also have a second
entry:

<pre     class="programlisting">
/dev/sdb1 /mnt/usd vfat noauto,user,noatime 0 0
</pre>
</p><p>
It follows the line added by Mandrake. Otherwise, the icon's load
routine gets confused. Either mountpoint can be used from the command
line.
As Moen noted, leave the FAT format in place. It makes the pen drive
usable on most machines (like that quarantined Windows box). Keep
those articles coming!

Traffic Shaping Advantage</h4><p>
I am no longer a newbie, but every time I explore Linux I discover
that it is more than an ordinary operating system. I could
not have prioritized my network bandwidth better than with the
easily configured traffic shaper package shapecfg. Thanks to
the community of developers and everyone who is involved in Linux.
I am more than convinced that by using Linux you will save
your company from all unnecessary expenses in securing a
good networking environment and administer your network more
effectively. It's nice discovering Linux.

SATA Question on Ultimate Linux Box</h4><p>
As always, I enjoyed getting your most recent issue [December 2003].
In the Ultimate Linux Box article, it mentions that SATA is used. But
nowhere does it say what had to be done to get SATA working. Were any
kernel patches installed to get this to work with 2.4.19?

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Eric   <br><br>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Glenn Stone replies:</b></span>
We did not use the regular Serial ATA interface on the
motherboard, but instead used the SATA interfaces on the
3ware Escalade 8500 card; the 3w-xxxx driver we used was the
stock driver that comes with SuSE Linux Enterprise Server 8.
3ware has been really good about seeing to it that its drivers
made it into the main kernel tree the last two years or so.
</p><p>
Serial ATA support for the Silicon Image chipset is present
(in the source, at least) in SuSE's 32-bit offerings in kernel
2.4.20. Linus' 2.4.22 tree adds support for the Intel ICH5.
Those are the only two SATA chipsets that linux-ide.org
advertises support for as of this writing.
