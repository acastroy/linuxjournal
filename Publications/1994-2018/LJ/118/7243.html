Web-based intelligence, Fran&ccedil;ois, is the theme of this
issue. As I planned the menu for today, I was caught by
the sheer number of possibilities that term brought to mind.
You too, <span   class="foreignphrase"><i>mon ami</i></span>? True, it could be Web-based artificial
intelligence programs, but I was thinking of simpler things.
Encyclopedias, business-to-business resources, dictionaries,
new sites, search engines and even electronic mail. Yes,
Fran&ccedil;ois, I agree with you. With so much spam these days, the
intelligence in e-mail is becoming questionable. Nevertheless,
e-mail still is an indispensable tool for modern communication.
Consider that closely tied to e-mail, groupware solutions
continue to grow, and you can begin to understand why I chose
today's menu.
</p><p>
We must continue this later, Fran&ccedil;ois, for our guests have arrived.
<span   class="foreignphrase"><i>Bonjour, mes amis</i></span>, and welcome to
<span   class="foreignphrase"><i>Chez Marcel</i></span>, the Linux world's
finest restaurant and finest wine cellar. Please sit and make yourselves
comfortable. Fran&ccedil;ois will fetch the wine
<span   class="foreignphrase"><i>imm&eacute;diatement</i></span>. To the
wine cellar, Fran&ccedil;ois, south wing. Something Spanish is in order&mdash;the Bierzo Corull&iacute;n 2000 is a perfect choice for today's menu.
</p><p>
Right before you arrived, Fran&ccedil;ois and I were discussing Web-based
intelligence. From a business perspective, I tend to think that the
kind of intelligence that matters most is entirely customer-related.
Without customers, there is no business. Consequently, a great deal of
energy goes into systems that help in the management of customer
relationships. This is where CRM (customer relationship management)
software comes into play. This type of
software gathers all sorts of customer information from the obvious
contact details to sales, marketing and support. With that information,
companies can assign tasks or reminders related to each customer's need.
This could be calling back on a specific product, supporting a request, dealing with
a complaint, setting up a meeting date or anything related to your
relationship with a particular customer. CRM systems run the gamut from
very simple to highly complex, corporate-wide, data-mining behemoths.
Prices vary as well from no or little cost to hundreds of thousands
of dollars. That figure alone should give you an idea of the importance
businesses place on customer relationships.
</p><p>
Here in our Linux kitchen, with the help of open-source programmers,
we can sample a number of CRM systems while spending nothing more than
a little time.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7243f1.large.jpg"><img src="7243f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. CRM-ctt's main screen offers admin and configuration options.
</p></div></div><p>
The first CRM package I would like to look at is called CRM customer
tracking system (CRM-ctt). Its basic Web-based interface might make
you look elsewhere because it appears so simple&mdash;I confess I almost
did the same thing. Hidden underneath this simplicity, however, is a
capable CRM system. With options for multiple users, multiple languages, extensive
customizations, security, prioritization, e-mail notification and PDF
reporting, CRM-ctt starts to look rather impressive (Figure 1).
Pick
up a copy of the program at <a href="http://crm-ctt.sourceforge.net" target="_self">crm-ctt.sourceforge.net</a>.
</p><p>
To get the system up and running, you need a running Apache server,
with PHP and MySQL support. If you want graphical support for
CRM-ctt, you also need to have the php-gd package installed. The
installation procedure takes a few steps, but it is not complicated. Extract the package into your Web server's document root.
You also may want to change the name of the directory at this point:

<pre     class="programlisting">
cd /var/www/html
tar -xzvf crm-1.9.2-19102003.tar.gz
mv crm-1.9.2-19102003 crm
</pre>
</p><p>
Before you continue, change the ownership of the CRM directory to that
of your Web server's user and group. In my case, that meant running
<tt  >chown -R apache.apache crm</tt>.
</p><p>
Let's move on to the actual configuration of the software. Start by
pointing your
browser to the location where the application is installed
(something like http://www.webserver.dom/crm).
You then are led through a number of setup screens, the last of which
involves the creation of your company repository. From here, follow the
steps&mdash;enter your name, the name and e-mail address of the administrator
and your chosen admin password. There are four Web-based steps
in all.
</p><p>
The final step in the installation procedure is to write out
the configuration file. The suggested method here is to
change the permissions on the header.inc.php file temporarily:

<pre     class="programlisting">
cd /var/www/html/crm
chmod 777 header.in.php
</pre>
</p><p>
Return to your installation page and click Try Now. If all
goes well, you should be presented with a successful completion
message. You also can choose to generate the file and
copy it manually to the directory where CRM is installed. Once you
have completed this step, change the permission of the header
file from 777 back to 755. Now, go to the bottom of
the page. Click the highlighting where it says
&ldquo;When done, point your browser here&rdquo;, and you are taken to the main
login screen. Log in with your admin user name and password.
</p><p>
A system like this isn't particularly useful without customer information,
so start adding. Click the Customers tab, then click Add a customer
on the screen that follows. Repeat this for all of your customers.
Once you have customer data entered, you can create Entities
against those customers. An entity is anything you have to do for
that customer, whether it is a pending order, an open trouble ticket, a
friendly follow-up call or a note to send flowers on someone's birthday.
CRM-ctt even can send you an e-mail to remind you of those things.
As you explore CRM-ctt, you'll find great reporting features, including a one-click
export to PDF option for quick, professional reports.
</p><p>
Because CRM can remind employees of people they need
to contact and when, you also should add an entry to cron so
it can send these e-mail notifications.
What's interesting here is the server doing the mail-outs can be
a machine other than the one running CRM-ctt. Although I show
you only one entry (for 8:00 am), you could have the notify process run as
often as you deem necessary for your organization. The yourCRONpwd
in the following example is set in the Administration menu on CRM-ctt's
main page, under Change global system's values.


<pre     class="programlisting">
# CRM Alarm date manager
0 8 * * * wget http://www.webserver.dom/crm/
&#8618;duedate-notify-cron.php?password=yourCRONpwd
&#8618;\&amp;reposnr=XXX 1&gt; /dev/null 2&gt; /dev/null
</pre>
</p><p>
As an administrator, you can add other accounts so you can delegate
tasks to other members of your organization. From the administration
screen, you also can generate management reports for your entire
customer base, another task that can be exported to PDF reports. To help you along,
CRM-ctt includes an on-line manual.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7243f2.large.jpg"><img src="7243f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

exporting.
</p></div></div><p>
Many CRM packages are available for Linux, and all of them
track customer relationships as the core of what they do. If
you look closely, though, you might think that CRM packages look
a lot like some of the new Web-based groupware suites. And you might
be right. Many of the ideas behind a
good CRM system also exist in a good groupware system. What sets groupware
apart is the scope of the Web-based intelligence it provides and the
collaborative possibilities it opens. Groupware suites can include
centralized electronic mail, calendars, address books, discussion forums,
call tracking and any number of other applications. One Web-based
groupware suite that I think is well worth checking into is eGroupWare.
</p><p>
eGroupWare is a GPL suite with an open-source API, so applications
can be created and added to the system easily. Among the applications
included are e-mail, calendaring, an infolog for tracking customer calls
and setting up to-do lists, a trouble ticket system, forums, personal and
corporate address books, a knowledge base, a wiki documentation system and
more. There's also a site manager feature, so individual users can create
and deploy their own Web sites. eGroupWare does all this while sporting
a slick-looking business-ready face (Figure 3). At the time of
this writing (early November 2003), eGroupWare was about two weeks away
from its 1.0 release.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7243f3.large.jpg"><img src="7243f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. eGroupWare offers a calendar, trouble ticket system
and management for user Web sites.
</p></div></div><p>
eGroupWare supports the two most popular open-source database
formats, MySQL and PostgreSQL. In my test, I chose to run
it with PostgreSQL, but both formats are easy to set up. To get
in on the eGroupWare action, download the package from <a href="http://www.egroupware.org" target="_self">www.egroupware.org</a>. Tarballs and binary packages both are
available.
</p><p>
To install from the tarred and gzipped bundle, extract the package
into your Web server's document root. For instance, a default Apache
installation should have document root at /usr/local/apache/htdocs, whereas
an RPM-based install (such as Red Hat) often has it at
/var/www/html:

<pre     class="programlisting">
cd /var/www/html
tar -xzvf eGroupWare-relnum.tar.gz
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2237580.0x2330370"></a></h2></div></div><p>
This step creates a directory called egroupware. Change the
permissions on this directory tree like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
chown -R apache.apache egroupware
</pre>
</p><p>
Assuming a PostgreSQL installation, your next step is to create a
PostgreSQL user to access the database. Do this by switching to your
postgres user:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ su - postgres
$ createuser egroupware
Shall the new user be allowed to create
databases? (y/n) y
Shall the new user be allowed to create more new
users? (y/n) n
CREATE USER
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2237580.0x2330580"></a></h2></div></div><p>
When asked whether this user is allowed to create other databases, say
yes. When asked whether this user can create other users, choose
no. All that's left to do is create a database
for eGroupWare. Still logged in as the postgres user, type the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ createdb -U egroupware egroupware_db
CREATE DATABASE
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2237580.0x23306e0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
If you don't like the idea of calling it egroupware,
you could use basically any name you want for the database or modify the name
slightly, as I did above. After this, you are done with the command-line
work, so fire up your browser and finalize eGroupWare's settings.
Open up Mozilla, Konqueror or any JavaScript-enabled browser and
point your Web server to http://yourwebserver/egroupware/setup.
</p><p>
On this screen, enter the relevant information for
your setup to create your header configuration file
(header.inc.php). If you changed your DB user from egroupware
to something else, make sure you identify it here. The same holds true
for the database name. You also should assign a header password and an
administration password. The header password lets you modify or recreate
the configuration file you are building now.
</p><p>
When you are finished, you are taken to the setup/header login screen.
You already have created the header file, so chances are you do not
wish to do it all over again, <span   class="foreignphrase"><i>non</i></span>? Your concern now is the actual
eGroupWare setup. Before we move to this step, I have noticed
that many of you have emptied your glasses. Fran&ccedil;ois, if you
would kindly do the honor of refilling
them&mdash;<span   class="foreignphrase"><i>merci</i></span>.
</p><p>
Once you have logged in using the admin password, the setup checks to
see if your database has been created properly and if the appropriate user
ID defined in the header creation step is used. If everything has gone well
up to this point, you should be at Step 1 of the local configuration.
Click Install to create the application tables and install the
eGroupWare suite of applications. The system chugs along for a
couple of minutes while it does this.
</p><p>
When everything has been completed, check the browser's screen to make
sure no error messages have been reported, and click the Recheck my
Installation button. If all has gone well, you can go on to Step 2 and
create your admin account. The option also exists to create three demo
accounts, but you do not have to do this. Step 3 lets you define the
default language to be used, and Step 4 is for individual application management.
From this dialogue, you can specify whether you want all the applications
(this is the default) or only some of them. When you log out from here,
your installation is complete.
</p><p>
Now it's time to start doing things with eGroupWare; begin by logging in
with your admin account. This most likely means pointing your browser
to http://your.server.dom/egroupware. Along the top of the
screen, you should see a number of icons representing the various groupware
services. To the left, menus appear based on the functions of the
current application, although a smaller menu with Home, Preferences,
About and Logout always is there. The look and feel can be
modified to suit your personal tastes by clicking Preferences and making
adjustments.
</p><p>
If you are the administrator, you can make changes for the entire
organization. You even can force some defaults and prevent users
from changing them, a useful feature for the corporate administrator.
User accounts can be created with predefined applications delivered to
their specific login based on groups. For instance, the support group
may need access to the trouble ticket system (Figure 4). Using this
group-based approach provides a consistent set of tools for
your users. Create your groups first, decide what applications they
need to access and create your users based on those groups.

Figure 4. Entering a Trouble Ticket in eGroupWare
</p></div></div><p>
In terms of the future and ongoing support, eGroupWare
has an active community of users and developers. Several
mailing lists and an IRC channel are available, should you find yourself needing answers
to your questions.
</p><p>
<span   class="foreignphrase"><i>Mon Dieu!</i></span> We are running out of time once again. Space and time
do not permit me to cover anything else in detail today, but
many excellent packages out there are worthy of your consideration.
Although we all enjoy cooking with Linux, I humbly suggest that our
customer/restaurateur relationship needs no software to manage it.
Instead, I shall continue providing you comfortable chairs at your
favorite table, and Fran&ccedil;ois shall keep your glasses filled. Sometimes,
simpler is better. Fran&ccedil;ois, if you would do the honors, please.
Until next time, <span   class="foreignphrase"><i>mes amis</i></span>, let us all drink
to one another's health. <span   class="foreignphrase"><i>A votre sant&eacute; Bon app&eacute;tit!</i></span>
