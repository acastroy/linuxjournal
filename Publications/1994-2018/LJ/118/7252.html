In my last column [<i  >LJ</i>, December 2003], we discussed
how I2C bus drivers and I2C
algorithm drivers work. We also described how to make a tiny dummy I2C
bus driver. This month, we discuss how an I2C chip driver
works and provide an example of one in action.
</p><p>
An I2C chip driver controls the process of talking to an individual I2C device
that lives on an I2C bus. I2C chip devices usually monitor
a number of different physical devices on a motherboard, such as
the different fan speeds, temperature values and voltages.
</p><p>
The struct i2c_driver structure describes a
I2C chip driver. This structure is defined in the
include/linux/i2c.h file. Only the following
fields are necessary to create a working chip driver:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
struct module *owner; &mdash; set to the value
THIS_MODULE that allows the proper module reference
counting.
</p></li><li><p>
char name[I2C_NAME_SIZE]; &mdash; set to a descriptive
name of the I2C chip driver.
This value shows up in the sysfs
file name created for every I2C chip device.
</p></li><li><p>
unsigned int flags; &mdash; set to the value
I2C_DF_NOTIFY
in order for the chip driver to
be notified of any new I2C
devices loaded after
this driver is loaded. This
field probably will go away
soon, as almost all drivers set
this field.
</p></li><li><p>
int (*attach_adapter)(struct i2c_adapter *); &mdash;
called whenever a new I2C bus driver is loaded in the system.
This function is described in more detail below.
</p></li><li><p>
int (*detach_client)(struct i2c_client *); &mdash;
called
when the i2c_client device is to
be removed from the system. More information about this
function is provided below.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
The following code is from an example I2C chip driver called
tiny_i2c_chip.c., which is available from the <i  >Linux Journal</i> FTP site [<a href="../listings/118/7252.tgz" target="_self">ftp.linuxjournal.com/pub/lj/listings/issue118/7252.tgz</a>]. It shows how the
struct i2c_driver structure is set up:

<pre     class="programlisting">

static struct i2c_driver chip_driver = {
    .owner          = THIS_MODULE,
    .name           = "tiny_chip",
    .flags          = I2C_DF_NOTIFY,
    .attach_adapter = chip_attach_adapter,
    .detach_client  = chip_detach_client,
};

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2225580.0x231d9d0"></a>Registering a Chip Driver</h2></div></div><p>
To register this I2C chip driver, the function
i2c_add_driver should be called with a
pointer to the struct i2c_driver:

<pre     class="programlisting">

static int __init tiny_init(void)
{
    return i2c_add_driver(&amp;chip_driver);
}

</pre>
</p><p>
To unregister the I2C chip driver, the
i2c_del_driver function should be called with
the same pointer to the struct i2c_driver:

<pre     class="programlisting">

static void __exit tiny_exit(void)
{
    i2c_del_driver(&amp;chip_driver);
}

</pre>
</p><p>
After the I2C chip driver is registered, the
attach_adapter function callback is
called when an I2C bus driver is loaded. This function checks to see if any
I2C devices are on this I2C bus to which the client driver wants to
attach. Almost all I2C chip drivers call the core I2C
function i2c_detect to determine
this. For example, the tiny_i2c_chip.c driver does this:

<pre     class="programlisting">

static int
chip_attach_adapter(struct i2c_adapter *adapter)
{
    return i2c_detect(adapter, &amp;addr_data,
                      chip_detect);
}

</pre>
</p><p>
The i2c_detect function probes the I2C
adapter, looking for the different addresses specified in the
addr_data structure. If a device is
found, the chip_detect function then is
called.
</p><p>
If you look closely at the source code, you
cannot find the addr_data structure
anywhere. The reason for this is it is created by the
SENSORS_INSMOD_1 macro. This macro is
defined in the include/linux/i2c-sensor.h
file and is quite complicated. It sets up a static variable
called addr_data based on the number of
different types of chips that this driver supports and the
addresses at which these chips typically are present. It then
provides the ability to override these values by using module
parameters. An I2C chip driver must provide the variables
normal_i2c, normal_i2c_range, normal_isa and
normal_isa_range. These variables define the
i2c smbus and i2c isa addresses this chip driver supports.
They are an array of addresses, all terminated by either the special
value I2C_CLIENT_END or
I2C_CLIENT_ISA_END.
Usually a specific type of I2C chip shows up in
only a limited
range of addresses. The tiny_i2c_client.c
driver defines these variables as:

<pre     class="programlisting">

static unsigned short normal_i2c[] =
  { I2C_CLIENT_END };
static unsigned short normal_i2c_range[] =
  { 0x00, 0xff, I2C_CLIENT_END };
static unsigned int normal_isa[] =
  { I2C_CLIENT_ISA_END };
static unsigned int normal_isa_range[] =
  { I2C_CLIENT_ISA_END };

</pre>
</p><p>
The normal_i2c_range variable specifies that
we can find this chip device at any I2C smbus address. This
allows us to test this driver on almost any I2C bus driver.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2225580.0x231de48"></a>What to Do When the Chip Is Found</h2></div></div><p>
In the tiny_i2c_chip.c driver, when an I2C
chip device is found, the function
chip_detect is called by the I2C core.
This function is declared with the following parameters:

<pre     class="programlisting">

static int
chip_detect(struct i2c_adapter *adapter,
            int address, int kind);

</pre>
</p><p>
The adapter variable is the I2C adapter
structure on which this chip is located. The
address variable contains the address where
the chip was found, and the kind variable
indicates what kind of chip was found. The
kind variable usually is ignored, but some I2C chip
drivers support different kinds of I2C chips, so this variable
can be used to determine the type of chip present.
</p><p>
This function is responsible for creating a
struct i2c_client structure that then is
registered with the I2C core. The I2C core uses that
structure as an individual I2C chip device. To create this
structure, the chip_detect function does the
following:

<pre     class="programlisting">

struct i2c_client *new_client = NULL;
struct chip_data *data = NULL;
int err = 0;

new_client = kmalloc(sizeof(*new_client),
                     GFP_KERNEL);
if (!new_client) {
    err = -ENOMEM;
    goto error;
}
memset(new_client, 0x00, sizeof(*new_client));

data = kmalloc(sizeof(*data), GFP_KERNEL);
if (!data) {
    err = -ENOMEM;
    goto error;
}
memset(data, 0x00, sizeof(*data));

i2c_set_clientdata(new_client, data);
new_client-&gt;addr = address;
new_client-&gt;adapter = adapter;
new_client-&gt;driver = &amp;chip_driver;
new_client-&gt;flags = 0;
strncpy(new_client-&gt;name, "tiny_chip",
        I2C_NAME_SIZE);


</pre>
</p><p>
First, the struct i2c_client structure and a
separate local data structure (called
struct chip_data) are created and initialized
to zero. It is important that the i2c_client structure is
initialized to zero, as the lower levels of the kernel driver
core require this in order to work properly. After the memory
is allocated successfully, some fields in the
struct i2c_client are set to point to this
specific device and this specific driver. Notably, the
addr, adapter and driver variables must be initialized. The
name of the struct i2c_client also must be
set if it is to show up properly in the sysfs tree for this I2C
device.
</p><p>
After the struct i2c_client structure is
initialized, it must be registered with the I2C core. This is
done with a call to the i2c_attach_client
function:

<pre     class="programlisting">

/* Tell the I2C layer a new client has arrived */
err = i2c_attach_client(new_client);
if (err)
    goto error;

</pre>
</p><p>
When this function returns, with no errors reported, the I2C
chip device is set up properly in the kernel.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2225580.0x231e210"></a>I2C and sysfs</h2></div></div><p>
In the 2.0, 2.2 and 2.4 kernels, the I2C code would place the
I2C chip devices in the /proc/bus/i2c directory. In the 2.6
kernel, all I2C chip devices and adapters show up in the sysfs
filesystem. I2C chip devices can be found at
/sys/bus/i2c/devices, listed by their adapter
address and chip address. For example, the tiny_i2c_chip
driver loaded on a machine might produce the following sysfs
tree structure:

<pre     class="screen">

$ tree /sys/bus/i2c/
/sys/bus/i2c/
|-- devices
|   |-- 0-0009 -&gt; ../../../devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:06.0/i2c-0/0-0009
|   |-- 0-000a -&gt; ../../../devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:06.0/i2c-0/0-000a
|   |-- 0-000b -&gt; ../../../devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:06.0/i2c-0/0-000b
|   `-- 0-0019 -&gt; ../../../devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:06.0/i2c-0/0-0019
`-- drivers
    |-- i2c_adapter

        |-- 0-000a -&gt; ../../../../devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:06.0/i2c-0/0-000a
        |-- 0-000b -&gt; ../../../../devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:06.0/i2c-0/0-000b
        `-- 0-0019 -&gt; ../../../../devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:06.0/i2c-0/0-0019
</pre>
</p><p>
This shows four different I2C chip devices, all controlled by the
same tiny_chip driver. The controlling
driver can be located by looking at the devices in the
/sys/bus/i2c/drivers directory or by looking
in the directory of the chip device itself and reading the
name file:

<pre     class="screen">
$ cat /sys/devices/pci0000\:00/0000\:00\:06.0/i2c-0/0-0009/name
tiny_chip
</pre>
</p><p>
All I2C chip drivers export the different sensor values through
sysfs files within the I2C chip device directory. These filenames are
standardized, along with the units in which the values are
expressed, and are documented within the kernel tree in the
file Documentation/i2c/sysfs-interface (Table 1).
</p><div class="table"><a name="N0x2225580.0x231e478"></a><p class="title"><b>Table 1. Sensor Values Exported through sysfs Files</b></p><table     summary="Table 1.

As the information in Table 1 shows, there is only one value per file.
All files are readable and some can be written to by
users with the proper privileges.
</p><p>
The tiny_i2c_chip.c driver emulates an I2C
chip device that can report temperature values. It creates the
files, temp_max1,
temp_min1 and temp_input1
in sysfs. The values it returns when these files are read
from is incremented every time the file is read to show how to
access different unique chip values.
</p><p>
In order to create a file in sysfs, the
DEVICE_ATTR macro is used:

<pre     class="programlisting">

static DEVICE_ATTR(temp_max, S_IWUSR | S_IRUGO,
                   show_temp_max, set_temp_max);
static DEVICE_ATTR(temp_min, S_IWUSR | S_IRUGO,
                   show_temp_hyst, set_temp_hyst);
static DEVICE_ATTR(temp_input, S_IRUGO,
                   show_temp_input, NULL);

</pre>
</p><p>
This macro creates a structure that then is passed to the
function device_create_file at the end of the
chip_detect function:

<pre     class="programlisting">

/* Register sysfs files */
device_create_file(&amp;new_client-&gt;dev,
                   &amp;dev_attr_temp_max);
device_create_file(&amp;new_client-&gt;dev,
                   &amp;dev_attr_temp_min);
device_create_file(&amp;new_client-&gt;dev,
                   &amp;dev_attr_temp_input);

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2225580.0x231ebb0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
That call creates the sysfs files for the device:

<pre     class="screen">
/sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:06.0/i2c-0/0-0009
|-- detach_state
|-- name
|-- power
|   `-- state
|-- temp_input
|-- temp_max
`-- temp_min
</pre>
</p><p>
The file name is created by the I2C core, and
the files detach_state and
power/state are created by the driver core.
</p><p>
But, let's go back to the DEVICE_ATTR macro. That
macro wants to know the name of the file to be created, the mode
of the file to be created, the name of the function to be called
when the file is read from and the name of the function to be
called when the file is written to. For the file
temp_max, this declaration was:

<pre     class="programlisting">

static DEVICE_ATTR(temp_max, S_IWUSR | S_IRUGO,
                   show_temp_max, set_temp_max);

</pre>
</p><p>
The function called when the file is read from is
show_temp_max. This is defined, as are many
sysfs files, with another macro that creates a function:

<pre     class="programlisting">

#define show(value) \
static ssize_t \
show_##value(struct device *dev, char *buf)        \
{                                                  \
    struct i2c_client *client = to_i2c_client(dev);\
    struct chip_data *data =                       \
        i2c_get_clientdata(client);                \
                                                   \
    chip_update_client(client);                    \
    return sprintf(buf, "%d\n", data-&gt;value);      \
}
show(temp_max);
show(temp_hyst);
show(temp_input);

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2225580.0x2315758"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The reason this function is created with a macro is that it is
quite simple to create other sysfs files that do almost the same
thing, with different names and that read from different variables,
without having to duplicate code. This single macro creates
three different functions to read from three different
variables from the struct chip_data
structure.
</p><p>
In this function, the struct device * is
converted into a struct i2c_client *. Then
the private struct chip_data * is obtained
from the struct i2c_client *. After that the
chip data is updated with a call to
chip_update_client. From there, the variable
that has been asked for is printed into a buffer and returned to
the driver core, which then returns it to the user:

<pre     class="screen">
$ cat /sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:06.0/i2c-0/0-0009/temp_input
1
</pre>
</p><p>
The chip_update_client increments all values
by one every time it is called:

<pre     class="programlisting">

static void
chip_update_client(struct i2c_client *client)
{
    struct chip_data *data =
        i2c_get_clientdata(client);

    down(&amp;data-&gt;update_lock);
    dev_dbg(&amp;client-&gt;dev, "%s\n", __FUNCTION__);
    ++data-&gt;temp_input;
    ++data-&gt;temp_max;
    ++data-&gt;temp_hyst;
    data-&gt;last_updated = jiffies;
    data-&gt;valid = 1;
    up(&amp;data-&gt;update_lock);
}

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2225580.0x23159c0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
So, all subsequent requests for this value are different:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ cat /sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:06.0/i2c-0/0-0009/temp_input
2
$ cat /sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:06.0/i2c-0/0-0009/temp_input
3
</pre>
</p><p>
The set_temp_max function also is created
from a macro to allow variables to be written to:

<pre     class="programlisting">

#define set(value, reg)	\
static ssize_t                                     \
set_##value(struct device *dev,                    \
            const char *buf, size_t count)         \
{                                                  \
    struct i2c_client *client = to_i2c_client(dev);\
    struct chip_data *data =                       \
        i2c_get_clientdata(client);                \
    int temp = simple_strtoul(buf, NULL, 10);      \
                                                   \
    down(&amp;data-&gt;update_lock);                      \
    data-&gt;value = temp;                            \
    up(&amp;data-&gt;update_lock);                        \
    return count;                                  \
}
set(temp_max, REG_TEMP_OS);
set(temp_hyst, REG_TEMP_HYST);

</pre>
</p><p>
Just like the show functions, this function
converts the struct device * to a
struct i2c_client *, and then the private
struct chip_data * is found. The data
the user provides then is turned into a number with a call to
simple_strtoul and is saved into the
proper variable:

<pre     class="screen">
$ cat /sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:06.0/i2c-0/0-0009/temp_max
1
$ echo 41 &gt; /sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:06.0/i2c-0/0-0009/temp_max
$ cat /sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:06.0/i2c-0/0-0009/temp_max
42
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2225580.0x2315c80"></a>Cleaning Up</h2></div></div><p>
When the I2C chip device is removed from the system, either
by the I2C bus driver being unloaded or by the I2C chip driver being
unloaded, the I2C core calls the
detatch_client function specified in
the struct i2c_driver structure. This usually is
a simple function, as can be seen in the example
driver's implementation:

<pre     class="programlisting">

static int chip_detach_client(struct i2c_client *client)
{
    struct chip_data *data = i2c_get_clientdata(client);
    int err;

    err = i2c_detach_client(client);
    if (err) {
        dev_err(&amp;client-&gt;dev,
                "Client deregistration failed, "
                "client not detached.\n");
        return err;

As the i2c_attach_client function was called
to register the struct i2c_client structure
with the I2C core, the i2c_detach_client
function must be called to unregister it. If that function
succeeds, the memory the driver has allocated for the I2C
device then needs to be freed before returning from the function.
</p><p>
This example driver does not specifically remove the sysfs files
from the sysfs core. This step is done automatically
in the driver core within the
i2c_detach_client function. But if the
author would like, the file can be removed manually by a call to
device_remove_file.

This two-part series of articles has explained the basics of how to write a kernel I2C
bus driver, I2C algorithm driver and I2C chip driver. A lot of good information on how to
write I2C drivers can be found in the Documentation/i2c
directory in the kernel tree and on the Lm_sensors Web site
(<a href="http://secure.netroedge.com/~lm78" target="_self">secure.netroedge.com/~lm78</a>).
