    After showing you how to configure your modem in Part I,
    Tony moves on to show you how to connect to the Internet.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb7f580.0xc775b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>In Part I of this article (see the
February 2002 issue of <i  >LJ</i>), I explained how to
configure the modem. At the end of the article you ended up with a
symbolic link called /dev/modem that pointed to the right device
file for your modem. You were sure that everything worked fine, as
you connected to your internet service provider (even though you
didn't establish a PPP connection). In this article I go further,
explaining how to connect to the Internet. You are advised to read
the previous article first. If you can't, just make sure that your
modem is configured correctly, and that you do have a symbolic link
called /dev/modem that points to the right device file in /dev.
</p><p>In order to make any use of this article you should have all
the login information about your provider, including the phone
number you should dial to connect, your login and password, and a
valid DNS server address (this is optional, as it can be assigned
automatically by your provider).</p><p>This article assumes that your provider accepts PAP
authentication. PAP is a way of sending your login and password
information to the provider through the PPP protocol; it saves the
users from the more complicated (and often manual) login procedures
required by some internet service providers in the past. The vast
majority of ISPs today will require you to use PAP. This article
also assumes that you have a standard modem and not a Winmodem.
Configuring a Winmodem is possible but can be tedious and is
outside the scope of this article.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb7f580.0xc777c0"></a>Establishing the Connection: the Basic
Tools</h2></div></div><p>First of all, you must be logged in as root to configure your
internet connection. A connection to the Internet via the modem is
established using PPP (point-to-point protocol), which is used to
encapsulate common TCP/IP packets so that they can be sent through
a serial line (in fact, TCP/IP packets are meant to be transmitted
over a network medium and wouldn't fit, as they are on a serial
connection without being serialized first).</p><p>This article assumes that you have the following software
installed: the kernel module that handles the PPP connection (every
distribution I know of comes with a kernel that includes the PPP
module, so you probably don't need to worry about it); the program
pppd, which initializes the kernel modules after establishing the
connection; the program chat, which is responsible for establishing
the connection; and the program minicom, a very simple terminal
program that lets you talk to the modem. To check if you have all
of these programs, you can use the
<span   class="bold"><b>which</b></span> command. This command tells
you if the programs are available in one of the directories listed
in the $PATH environment variable:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
which pppd
/usr/bin/pppd
which chat
/usr/bin/chat
which minicom
/usr/bin/minicom
</pre><p>If you don't have some of these programs, you should grab the
right package and install it. You also might want to disable the
call waiting for your telephone line. If it is active, an incoming
call could cause the line to drop while you are connected.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb7f580.0xc77a28"></a>Overview of a Connection</h2></div></div><p>Once we configure the modem, how do we connect to the
Internet? We have to use (and configure) a program called pppd
(point-to-point protocol d&aelig;mon). The following is what
happens when you run pppd (assuming that chat is used as the dialer
program and that pppd is correctly configured).</p><p>The d&aelig;mon starts. It sets the serial port parameters
(speed, etc.). Then it runs an external program (chat) to establish
the connection, which sends the connection command to the modem
(ATDT followed by the provider's number). Then it waits for the
string CONNECT from the serial port. At that point the connection
has been established, and it's as if there were a serial cable
running from your computer to the provider's computer. Once chat
has finished its job, the program pppd takes over again. If the
connection could not be established, pppd will exit and return an
error. Otherwise, it will talk to the PPP d&aelig;mon on the other
side of the line (the PPP handshake that you saw earlier as a bunch
of indecipherable symbols) and will be assigned an IP address. A
login and a password normally are required to complete this stage
successfully (login information is sent during the PPP handshake).
The program pppd makes sure that a kernel network interface is
created and that the network traffic is directed to it.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb7f580.0xc77b88"></a>A Few Words about Logging</h2></div></div><p>The two programs that you need, pppd and chat, are not
interactive. They are run and then send any messages to the system
log d&aelig;mon, syslogd. The syslogd will then write the received
messages on the hard drive. There are several classes of messages,
and the different classes usually are stored in separate files. The
exact place they are stored depends on your syslogd
configuration.</p><p>Now, you should configure syslogd so that you are 100% sure
that the debugging information from the d&aelig;mons pppd and chat
actually are stored on disk&mdash;and that you know where they are. The
configuration file for syslogd is /etc/syslog.conf. All you have to
do is enter one extra line to it. To do that, just type the
command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
vi /etc/syslog.conf
</pre><p>Of course, you may use any editor you like (vi, Emacs, joe,
pico, etc.). Now, insert the following line:
<pre     class="programlisting">
daemon.debug;*.info           /var/log/ppp_article
</pre>


Remember that there should be a tab between info and
/var/log/ppp_article.
</p><p>Now, you have to make sure that the d&aelig;mon syslogd knows
about the change in its configuration file. To achieve this, run
the command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
killall -HUP syslogd
</pre><p>The file /var/log/ppp_article should have been created and
should contain one line that tells you that syslogd has been
restarted. To check that this is true, you can type the following
command:
<pre     class="programlisting">
cat /var/log/ppp_article
Aug  4 19:28:46 merc_linux syslogd 1.3-3: restart.
</pre>


Instead of the cat command, which just reads a file, you can use
the command tail with the option -f. This will keep on reading a
file and will print on the screen any new information added to it.
This means that as soon as syslogd writes anything on the file
ppp_article, tail will show it on the screen:
<pre     class="programlisting">
tail -f /var/log/ppp_article
Aug  4 19:28:46 merc_linux syslogd 1.3-3: restart.
</pre>


From now on, any logging information recorded by pppd or chat will
appear on the screen automatically. You really should keep this
console open always, and check for messages whenever you need to.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb7f580.0xc77fa8"></a>Understanding chat</h2></div></div><p>As you probably saw in Part I of this article, in order to
establish the serial connection, you have to send the string
ATDT12345678 (with your provider's phone number, of course) to your
modem and wait for the string CONNECT to come back from the modem
itself (that would happen once the connection has established).
Some messages other than CONNECT might be returned: BUSY, NO
CARRIER, NO ANSWER, etc. In the previous article, you tried this
practically, using minicom.</p><p>Even though you could do all of this by hand using minicom,
you might want to use a program that does it all for you. The
program should be able to talk to the modem, sending information
and expecting a particular string as a response. Of course, such a
program does exist, and it's called chat. For example, try to run
the following command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
chat ABORT "BUSY" "OK" "TRY" "THIS"
"TESTING" "COMMAND"
</pre><p>Be careful, because from now on the keyboard will be locked
and you won't be able to quit the program, not even by pressing
Ctrl-C. Type <b  >ok</b>. The word TRY will pop out. Now
type <b  >this</b>; the word TESTING will appear on the
screen. Finally, type <b  >command</b>; the program chat
will exit successfully. Try to run the command again: type
<b  >ok</b>, and again you will see the string TRY come
out. At this point, type <b  >busy</b>: the program will
exit immediately. As you can guess, the chat program is designed to
wait for a string and print something as a response. The first two
words, ABORT BUSY, are special and instruct chat to exit if the
word BUSY is received at any point during its execution. If
something goes wrong, you can run the same chat command adding the
switch -v:
<pre     class="programlisting">
chat -v ABORT "BUSY" "OK" "TRY" "THIS"
"TESTING" "COMMAND"
</pre>


The -v option stands for verbose, meaning that chat will tell you
exactly what is going on, what it is expecting and so on. Of
course, all the debug information will be recorded in
/var/log/ppp_article if you followed the instructions I gave you
earlier about syslogd. Let's analyze a different chat command:
<pre     class="programlisting">
chat ABORT "BUSY" "" "AT" "OK"
"ATDT93355100" "CONNECT"
</pre>


As you can probably guess, you will have to behave like a modem in
order to get chat to exit successfully. It will send you an AT
string, and you have to type <b  >ok</b>. Then, it will
send you the string ATDT93355100 and wait until you type
<b  >connect</b>. Then, it will exit. This probably
sounds familiar to most readers; this is exactly what you need to
connect to your ISP, if you could get chat to talk to the modem and
not the keyboard. The command I use for my provider is:
<pre     class="programlisting">
chat ABORT BUSY ABORT "NO CARRIER"
TIMEOUT 120 "" AT OK ATDT94310999 CONNECT
</pre>


It's very simplistic, and as a matter of fact, it could be done a
lot better. But in my case, it does the job and I am perfectly
happy with it. You should have a look at the man page for chat
(just type <b  >man chat</b>) and look at the options it
offers; later, you might want to change your connection script so
that it uses all of the fancy options offered by chat. The next
step is to write a shell script that encapsulates the chat command
you wrote. The file will be placed in /etc/ppp and will be called
chat-connect. To create it, just type the command:
<pre     class="programlisting">
vi /etc/ppp/chat-connect
</pre>


(of course, you can use any editor you like if you don't like vi).
The script should look like this:
<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/sh
chat ABORT BUSY ABORT "NO CARRIER" TIMEOUT 120 ""
AT OK ATDT94310999 CONNECT
</pre>


You should substitute 94310999 with your ISP's dial-up number. Now,
save and exit the editor. You need to make the script executable,
with the chmod command:
<pre     class="programlisting">
chmod +x /etc/ppp/chat-connect
</pre>


See if the script works by running
<pre     class="programlisting">
/etc/ppp/chat-connect
</pre>


If it works, you moved one step toward your working internet
connection. Effectively, you are very close to the goal. All you
have to do is run pppd with the right parameters.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb7f580.0xc786e0"></a>Understanding pppd</h2></div></div><p>At this point you can start to work on the actual pppd
configuration. The files involved are /etc/ppp/options,
/etc/ppp/chap-secrets, /etc/ppp/pap-secrets and
/etc/ppp/peers.</p><p>The options file is used to give pppd a list of default
options. For now you should make sure that the options file, stored
in /etc/ppp, is totally empty; just edit it with your favorite
editor and delete everything in it. If you don't feel comfortable
deleting the content, you can comment all the lines out putting a #
symbol in front of each line. It is important to have the options
file empty to make sure you have a fresh start. The first thing now
is to test if the chat script we wrote works in a real situation.
In order to do that, you can run pppd with the minimum number of
parameters:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
pppd /dev/modem 38400 modem lock connect
/etc/ppp/chat-connect
</pre><p>The parameters can be given to pppd in any order. The
/dev/modem option represents the serial port that the modem is
connected to (as you know, it is a symbolic link that points to the
real ttyS device). The parameter modem instructs the pppd
d&aelig;mon that it will be dealing with a modem connection, and
not a straight serial cable between you and your provider. The word
lock tells pppd to lock the modem while using it (if you don't know
what that means, don't panic; basically it's a way of guaranteeing
that no other program will be accessing the modem while your
connection is up). The last option, connect, comes with the
parameter /etc/ppp/chat-connect and tells pppd what program it
should run to dial the number and connect to the internet service
provider; in your case, it's the chat script you wrote in the
previous section of the article.
</p><p>If nothing seems to work, you should add the option -v to the
chat script, try again and look at the logs&mdash;at this point, it's
normally quite easy to fix problems. If everything goes well, you
should be able to see your modem connecting and hear it going
through the usual whistling noises. Now you should be able to
connect to the Internet with only one extra step. Edit the file
/etc/pap-secrets and add your password to that file, adding a line
that looks like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
<span   class="emphasis"><em>your_username_here</em></span>  *     <span   class="emphasis"><em>your_password_here</em></span>
</pre><p>Remember that there should be a tab between each word. Now
you are ready for the big test, an actual connection. Try the
following command:
<pre     class="programlisting">
pppd /dev/modem 38400 modem lock
connect /etc/ppp/chat-connect
user <span   class="emphasis"><em>your_username_here</em></span> defaultroute
</pre>


The only extra parameters are user (followed by your user name as
it comes in /etc/ppp/pap-secrets) and the option defaultroute. This
last option makes sure that your connection will be used by default
by the packets that are supposed to reach the Internet. With this
option, pppd will set up the correct routing table once the
connection is established. You should see, in the log, a message
like this:
<pre     class="programlisting">
Aug  4 16:12:23 merc_linux pppd[4430]:
local  IP address 94.232.195.174
Aug  4 16:12:23 merc_linux pppd[4430]:
remote IP address 194.232.195.4
</pre>


If it didn't happen, you might have to run pppd with the debug
option and read the log file (that is /var/log/ppp_article) to see
what happened:
<pre     class="programlisting">
pppd /dev/modem 38400 modem lock
connect /etc/ppp/chat-connect
user <span   class="emphasis"><em>your_username_here</em></span> defaultroute debug
</pre>


If everything worked, congratulations; you are now connected to the
Internet. Remember that when you want to disconnect, you simply can
type:
<pre     class="programlisting">
killall pppd
</pre>


</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb7f580.0xc78cb8"></a>Testing the Connection</h2></div></div><p>The next step is to test whether the connection actually
works. The best way to see if the link is up is to run ifconfig
(see Listing 1). This command shows you the active kernel network
interfaces. In my case, I have lo, the standard loopback interface
I will use if I want to connect to myself, and ppp0, which is the
modem PPP interface.</p><p><a href="5467l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1. The Result of My ifconfig
Command</a></p><p>To see if you actually are routing to the Internet, you can
run the traceroute command, followed by any IP address. For now you
should use the -n option in order to disable the DNS name
resolution (that hasn't been configured yet). For example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
traceroute -n 198.182.196.56
traceroute to 198.182.196.56 (198.182.196.56),
30 hops max, 38 byte packets
 1  194.232.195.4 (194.232.195.4) 181.518 ms
    139.473 ms  149.822 ms
 2  194.232.195.1 (194.232.195.1) 129.540 ms
    139.739 ms  139.821 ms
</pre><p>...
<pre     class="programlisting">
19  207.245.34.122 (207.245.34.122)  479.696 ms
    479.653 ms *
20  198.182.196.56 (198.182.196.56) 489.711 ms
    479.644 ms  479.874 ms
</pre>


The IP 198.182.196.56 is the server for
<a href="http://www.linux.org" target="_self">www.linux.org</a>. The
program traceroute will tell you about the path followed by the
packets you send to the Internet. Now, you should make sure that
you tell your system the IP of your DNS, through the file
/etc/resolv.conf. My resolv.conf file looks like this:
<pre     class="programlisting">
nameserver 203.14.168.3
nameserver 202.0.185.226
</pre>


Some ISPs don't provide a DNS server address, as your computer is
given one once the PPP handshake is completed. If that is the case,
you simply can disconnect and reconnect using the usepeerdns option
when you run pppd:
<pre     class="programlisting">
pppd /dev/modem 38400 modem lock
connect /etc/ppp/chat-connect
user <span   class="emphasis"><em>your_username_here</em></span> defaultroute usepeerdns
</pre>


Now, you can try to see if your DNS is working, using, for example,
the Telnet program. The Telnet program is only an excuse to see if
the system was able to translate the name
<a href="http://www.linux.org" target="_self">www.linux.org</a> into an IP
address.
<pre     class="programlisting">
telnet www.linux.org 80
Trying 198.182.196.56...
Connected to www.linux.org.
Escape character is '^]'.
</pre>


It worked! Now, you can start your browser (Netscape, Mozilla,
Opera, Galeon, Lynx, etc.) and browse the Net as you like.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb7f580.0xc6fa70"></a>A Bit of Housekeeping</h2></div></div><p>By now, everything should work well; the internet connection
is up, and you can connect to the Internet whenever you want. There
is, of course, room for improvement. The first thing to do would be
to increase the speed of the serial port and see if everything
still works. To do that, just substitute 38400 with 115200 in the
pppd command line.</p><p>Also, after a couple of weeks you probably will start
noticing that there is a high number of parameters that have to be
typed for the command pppd. In fact, every time you want to connect
you have to type:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
pppd /dev/modem 115200 modem lock
connect /etc/ppp/chat-connect
user <span   class="emphasis"><em>your_username_here</em></span> defaultroute
</pre><p>The good news is that you can, of course, put all those
parameters in a configuration file, /etc/ppp/options. So, in your
case, the options file would look like this:
<pre     class="programlisting">
/dev/modem
115200
modem
lock
connect /etc/ppp/chat-connect
user
defaultroute
</pre>


In this file the order of the parameters really doesn't matter.
From this point on, you will be able to connect to the Internet
simply by typing the command <b  >pppd</b>. What happens
if you have several providers you might want to call? In this case,
you can create several options files and then place them in
/etc/ppp/peers. The output below shows what my peers directory
looks like:
<pre     class="programlisting">
ls -l /etc/ppp/peers
total 4
-rw-r--r--  1 root   root    197 Aug  4 15:41 main_net
-rw-r--r--  1 root   root    189 Mar 11  2000 primus
</pre>


My file /etc/ppp/options is empty; when I run pppd, I always run:
<pre     class="programlisting">
pppd call main_net
</pre>


This way, the file /etc/ppp/peers/main_net will be used as well as
my /etc/ppp/options file (which happens to be empty). If my main
provider (Main Net) is down for some reason, I still can use some
of my time-limited account with Primus.
</p><p>Now, the best thing you can do is to read the man page for
pppd (just type <b  >man pppd</b>) and see if any of the
esoteric options can somehow improve your connection. In Listing 2
you will find a very rich options file written by my friend and
Linux guru Pancrazio De Mauro. Can you do better than that?</p><p><a href="5467l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2. Pancrazio's Options
File</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb7f580.0xc6ff98"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>This process certainly can look quite scary; the amount of
knowledge you must have to connect to the Internet using Linux
seems ludicrous, especially if you compare it to the simplicity of
the Windows Remote access interface; the comparison makes you
wonder whether it was worthwhile doing everything by hand.</p><p>In my opinion, there are two main advantages in configuring
everything by hand. The first one is that you can (and should) go
through the many options of pppd to optimize your connection. The
second is that from now on when you use a graphical interface to
configure your internet access, you know exactly what is going on,
and you can fix problems if the automatic process doesn't seem to
work properly.</p><p>Before I finish, I would like to point out that there is a
command-line program (no GUI) that automatically does everything I
have explained in this article (find the modem, connect to the
provider with the right parameters, etc.). The program is called
wvdial
(<a href="http://www.worldvisions.ca/wvdial/index.html" target="_self">www.worldvisions.ca/wvdial/index.html</a>).
When I discovered it a few years ago, I found it rather amazing. I
would suggest it to impatient people who want to connect to the
Internet quickly without going through the hassle of knowing
everything about pppd, chat, etc.</p><p><a href="5467s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
