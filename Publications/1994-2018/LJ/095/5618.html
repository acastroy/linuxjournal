    An early start with Linux will allow the next generation of
    students&mdash;everywhere&mdash;more and better job opportunities.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2920580.0x2a18500"></a></h2></div></div><p>Forty-three top students at the Shree
Bachhauli Secondary School in Bachhauli, Nepal are learning
computer programming, a skill that could keep them out of the
child-labor market and rocket them into higher education and a real
job after graduation. Their school has 14 teachers and over 600
students, but the computer classes are kept small and staffed by
German and Swiss volunteers who work for a group called Ganesha's
Project. They make do with donated machines and focus on
open-source software like Linux, a move that cuts the cost of
acquiring software licenses for an already impoverished school
system.
</p><p>&ldquo;The main goal of Ganesha's Project is to try to create a
humane alternative to child labor in Nepal&rdquo;, said Kirstin
Boettcher, a German graphic designer who is working with the group
to raise funds. She added,</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>In Nepal, as in other third-world countries, most
people don't profit from the spread of progress. The point of our
Project is to narrow the digital divide that keeps computing
resources away from the masses and to show people how to bridge the
chasm of poverty with education.</p></blockquote></div><p>Ganesha's Project is only one startling example of
under-funded and under-staffed schools around the world that are
turning to Linux as a way to create an inexpensive and intensive
computer curriculum. Like Apple's early efforts (in the 1980s) at
giving free Apple II machines to schools, Linux software
distributors and volunteer organizations are gaining life-long
users by delivering open-source technology at little or no cost to
elementary and high schools.
</p><p>The key to this program's success is the freedom that
administrators and teachers gain in using open-source software.
Peter Farina teaches computer science using open-source software at
Montini Catholic High School in Lombard, Illinois, a suburb of
Chicago. &ldquo;Once the students get past the hurdle of learning the
Linux commands and the Linux directory structure, they get pretty
excited about it&rdquo;, he said. &ldquo;Then they find that there are
thousands of programs out there that are free for them to grab.
It's not like they have to get some bootleg copy from a
friend.&rdquo;</p><p>Farina's school is part of SuSE's Free Linux for US High
Schools Program. As part of the program, SuSE donated over 2,000
copies of their version of Linux to high schools across the
nation.</p><p>&ldquo;Having it in high schools around the US demonstrates the
open-source philosophy and shows students, teachers, administrators
and IT specialists that they do not have to be tied to expensive
operating systems and ongoing costly upgrades&rdquo;, said Dirk Hohndel,
president of SuSE's US operations.</p><p>Like the volunteers at Ganesha's Project, Farina also is
faced with a cash-strapped department, and he is turning to Linux
to reduce costs.</p><p>&ldquo;We're at a point now where we're trying to increase the
size of the network&rdquo;, he said. &ldquo;The cable and infrastructure is
in place, but licensing is so expensive. It's crippling us. I'm
trying to find a way to increase our offerings without paying
through the nose for each PC that's on the network.&rdquo;</p><p>Farina uses Linux as a teaching tool and has gone as far as
to instruct students how to build their own small computer
networks. He said the biggest stumbling block was trying to
convince teachers to learn the new operating system. He explained
that most of the teachers were just beginning to feel comfortable
with Microsoft Windows products, and that he &ldquo;would get a lot of
grief&rdquo; if he sprung Linux on them too suddenly.</p><p>Students, parents and teachers at New York's Beacon School,
on the other hand, use Linux daily but hardly know it's there.
Shantanu Saha, deputy director of technology for the New York Board
of Education, says Linux is the backbone of the Beacon School's
network.</p><p>The Beacon School's web site, which runs Red Hat, provides an
outlet for news and announcements. It also includes a
parent/teacher interaction system that makes the many messages
broadcast on-line by the administration hard to miss.</p><p>&ldquo;This site is largely developed and maintained by the
students, and it improves on every iteration&rdquo;, said Saha. &ldquo;I've
been doing my Linux initiative purely as an opt-in program, with
interested schools participating in a workshop that I ran this
year&rdquo;, he said.</p><p>So far, Saha plans to install networked servers running Linux
to handle most e-mail and web-related tasks for each of the 70
schools in the area. He explains:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>My current paradigm is to install Linux servers
at selected schools as the core of their networks, to train the
teachers and technicians in basic administration and maintenance,
and to help them out by managing the servers remotely, without
traveling to the school or sending a technician.</p></blockquote></div><p>&ldquo;I want to replicate success where I find it&rdquo;, he added,
citing the Beacon School's reputation as one of the most high-tech
schools in the New York school system.
</p><p>Volunteer organizations around the world also are trying to
replicate the success of many open-source educational projects in
their own areas. One volunteer organization, headed by Paul Nelson
and Eric Harrison of the Multnomah County Education Service
District, located near Portland, Oregon, developed the K-12 Linux
Project, a system designed to allow schools to use old and outdated
hardware to their fullest advantage through Linux
networking.</p><p>&ldquo;Schools get old hardware&rdquo;, said Nelson, who spent the last
20 years with the Riverdale School District as an educator and,
later, as a system administrator:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>These computers come with the hard drives wiped
and no operating system, and you have to pay a one-hundred-dollar
license fee to Microsoft to get it running again. With Linux, you
don't have to have a fast or new computer to make it useful.</p></blockquote></div><p>The K-12 Linux Project uses a central server to transmit
GNOME to computers around the school. Currently, Nelson administers
hundreds of computers in the two school districts where he works.
He says the Project has taken off. &ldquo;Kids require no training at
all. They just start clicking. In a matter of days, they're
experts&rdquo;, he said. &ldquo;That's how kids learn. We want the operating
system to be an on-ramp, not a roadblock.&rdquo;
</p><p>&ldquo;The K-12 Linux software is spreading&rdquo;, said Nelson.
Schools in London and Belize are running the program already, and
he has had requests for the software from as far away as Malaysia
and the Philippines. &ldquo;It's a snowball at the top-of-the-hill
stage. There's a lot of potential here&rdquo;, he said.</p><p>Nelson believes that the open-source paradigm is the best way
for schools to remain competitive in an international marketplace.
The software is free, he says, the need is great, and &ldquo;schools
have no money.&rdquo; He adds,</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>With this Project, we have one computer for every
three students. We're able to administer those remotely at
locations around the building, something we could never do
before.</p></blockquote></div><p>The companies and volunteers that are offering services and
software to schools are doing more than marketing their products,
although a healthy capitalist instinct obviously prevails.
MandrakeSoft is working with hardware vendors to supply schools in
under-funded and low-income districts of Los Angeles, as well as
poorer schools in Canada and Mexico.
</p><p>&ldquo;In the next two to three years, most Mexican schools will
be running Linux&rdquo;, said Daniel Morales, vice president for
MandrakeSoft in the Americas. &ldquo;We are donating software and some
of the servers, just to put installations all together&rdquo;, he said.
&ldquo;We, as a company, are emphasizing education and creating new
talent to handle open source.&rdquo;</p><p>Ultimately, Linux is sneaking into schools around the world
and becoming as ubiquitous as the Apple icon to America's
educators. The real bottom line, of course, is money. Saha believes
that the kind of computer literacy provided by open-source systems,
coupled with the traditional three Rs, is key to future
success.</p><p>&ldquo;If you want to learn about computers, you need to know the
operating system that basically drives the universe&mdash;UNIX.&rdquo; Saha
believes that students who know Linux, and by extension UNIX, have
a &ldquo;license to print money&rdquo; in any job market. Even the one in
Nepal.</p></div></div>
