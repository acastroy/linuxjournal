works when I boot into the SMP kernel. It works fine when booting
the non-SMP kernel. I have downloaded and compiled the latest
stable kernel, and the problem still exists. Under 7.1 the same
modem worked fine with the SMP kernel. I have a US Robotics 56K
FaxModem (model 3CP5610A) with a Tyan motherboard and dual-Intel
Pentium 133.</p><p>&mdash;Nathan Myers,
<a href="mailto:myersn@voyager.net">myersn@voyager.net</a></p><p>Check to see if the modem is detected by the kernel. You can
see this with a <b  >grep ttyS /var/log/messages*</b>.
You will see a list of serial devices; note that some will be
built-in on your motherboard.</p><p>&mdash;Christopher Wingert,
<a href="mailto:cwingert@qualcomm.com">cwingert@qualcomm.com</a></p><p>Thank you for including the model number of your modem; it is
most useful. A quick search on Google shows that you have a PCI
modem, which works slightly differently from old-style ISA modems.
The good news is that it is a real modem and not a Winmodem. The
best link I found for you is this one:

directories, which is now an ext3 fs, to several other peripheral
machines (all Red Hat 6.2). I've noticed that files updated on the
peripheral machines don't get updated on the server, and the
changes don't get reflected on the other peripheral
machines.</p><p>The server exports options (rw, no_root_squash). The client
invokes with defaults, nodev, rw. This seems to indicate that the
clients are caching, but it never seems to flush (I have a file
that was changed a day ago that is still unchanged on the server).
I've searched the Web and have found nothing that would
help.</p><p>&mdash;R. K. Owen,

the obvious and make extra sure that the clients are indeed writing
in an NFS-mounted directory and accessing the NFS server. You also
can check that when you modify a file on the server, the clients
are seeing the new copy.</p><p>&mdash;Marc Merlin,

The problem, which occurs with both StarOffice 5.2 and 6.0 beta, is
that encapsulated PostScript graphics files (.ps or .eps files) are
read as text, not as graphics. This happens with any selection
(e.g., Text Document, Presentation, Drawing or Chart).
<span   class="bold"><b>gv</b></span> shows the correct graphics. So
the question is: does StarOffice have the capability to read
graphics files in PostScript format and display the graphics rather
than the PostScript text? If so, how do you do it?</p><p>&mdash;John C. Burgess,

not a Winmodem, which is why I purchased it. I planned on using it
on my dual booting (Windows 98/Linux) system. Windows 98 listed it
as device COM5, not the usual COM2.</p><p>I went into the Linux side and created a /dev/ttyS4, using
setserial to set the port and irq. I made a symbolic link to
/dev/modem. When I run minicom, it does not complain that the
device isn't there, it just does not seem to do anything. How do I
get Linux to recognize my modem? I tried an <b  >echo

the modem.</p><p>&mdash;Tony Preston,
<a href="mailto:apreston@k2nesoft.com">apreston@k2nesoft.com</a></p><p>This sounds like the IRQ is not set correctly. You should

get this message, or whether you are able to write anything on

sure that you do not have SCSI connection or termination issues. If
your backup does occur, you may have some mt command after the

perfectly, but Mandrake doesn't recognize it.</p><p>&mdash;Luis,
<a href="mailto:godoman1@hotmail.com">godoman1@hotmail.com</a></p><p>Check to make sure that /dev/fd0 exists. Also, check

clue to the problem.</p><p>&mdash;Christopher Wingert,
<a href="mailto:cwingert@qualcomm.com">cwingert@qualcomm.com</a></p><p>Make sure the kernel sees your floppy. You should have
something like this in /var/log/dmesg:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Floppy drive(s): fd0 is 1.44M
FDC 0 is a National Semiconductor PC87306

<a href="mailto:marc_bts@valinux.com">marc_bts@valinux.com</a></p><p>When you say that &ldquo;it is connected correctly and it works
perfectly&rdquo;, I assume you dual boot your system and the floppy
drive works in the other OS environment. Here are a few things you
can check: make sure that the /dev/fd0 file exists, that it is
indeed a device-special file and that it has the correct
permissions on it. The floppy you are trying to mount has a
filesystem on it, and the filesystem support is present in the
kernel.</p><p>&mdash;Usman Ansari,

I
need this socket for a Perl script. I can change the name in the
script, but can someone tell me what to change it to? I do not know
the name of the socket that the lpd d&aelig;mon uses in Red Hat
7.1.</p><p>Scott Statland,
<a href="mailto:scott@nycgiftbaskets.com">scott@nycgiftbaskets.com</a></p><p>Not to be obstructionist, but are you sure you need direct
access to the device file? If you're just trying to print, you can
do that in Perl with</p><pre     class="programlisting">
open(FH, '| lpr')  ||  die $!;
</pre><p>and print your desired text to the FH filehandle.
If your script is intended for broad distribution, bear in mind
that UNIX printing is very flexible; a given print queue may be
serviced by a printer attached to some other machine on the
network, for example, so the local machine may not have any file
under /dev that represents that printer. You might want to find a
Perl module that helps you parse /etc/printcap and look for a print
queue's lp resource to learn what device file, if any, is
associated with that printer. (Type <b  >man printcap</b>
for a thorough description of that file.)

<a href="mailto:marc_bts@valinux.com">marc_bts@valinux.com</a></p><p>If you want to print using lpd, there's a Perl Net::Printer
module downloadable from CPAN that lets you print to lpd and check
the status of your print jobs from a Perl script. Read the man page
