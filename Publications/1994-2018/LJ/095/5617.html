    Gianluca concludes the packet's journey through the kernel,
    picking up with TCP processing.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b1d580.0x1c15558"></a></h2></div></div><p>In the last issue we started following a
packet's journey from the wire up to the higher levels of network
stack processing. We left the packet at the end of layer 3
processing, where IP has completely finished its work and is going
to pass the packet to either TCP or UDP. In this article, we
complete our analysis by considering layer 4, the PF_PACKET
protocol implementation and the socket filter hooks.
</p><p>Apart from the case of IGMP and ICMP processing, which is
dealt with in the kernel, the packet's journey toward the
application proceeds by passing through either tcp_v4_rcv() or
udp_rcv(). TCP processing is a bit intricate, since this protocol's
FSM (finite state machine) has to deal with a lot of intermediate
states (just think of the various states a TCP socket can assume:
listening, established, closed, waiting and so on). To simplify our
description, we can reduce it to the following steps:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Inside tcp_v4_rcv() (net/ipv4/tcp_ipv4.c), perform
TCP header integrity checks.</p></li><li><p>Look for a socket willing to receive this packet
(using __tcp_v4_lookup()).</p></li><li><p>If it is not found, take appropriate actions (among
which, cause IP to generate an ICMP error).</p></li><li><p>Otherwise call tcp_v4_do_rcv(), passing to it both
the packet (an sk_buff) and the socket (a sock structure).</p></li><li><p>Inside this latter function, perform different
receive actions based on the socket's current state.</p></li></ul></div><p>The most interesting aspect in TCP processing from the LSF
point of view, comes in the last function we mentioned; at its very
beginning, tcp_v4_do_rcv() calls sk_filter(), which as we will see,
performs all the filter-related magic. How does the kernel know
that it should invoke the filter for packets received on a given
socket? This piece of information is stored inside the sock
structure associated with the socket. If a filter has been attached
to it with a setsockopt() system call, the appropriate field inside
the structure is not NULL, and the TCP receive function knows that
it has to call sk_filter().</p><p>For those of you who are fluent with sockets programming and
recall that listening TCP sockets are forked upon reception of a
connect message, it must be said that the filter is first attached
to the listening socket. Then, when a connection is set up and a
new socket is returned to the user, the filter is copied into the
new socket. Have a look at tcp_create_openreq_child() in
net/ipv4/tcp_minisocks.c for details.</p><p>Back to packet reception. After the filter has been run, the
fate of the packet depends on the filter outcome; if the packet
matches the filter rules, processing proceeds as usual. Otherwise,
the packet is discarded. Furthermore, the filter may specify a
maximum packet length that will be kept for further processing (the
exceeding part is cut via skb_trim()).</p><p>The packet's trip proceeds on different paths depending on
the socket's current state; if the connection is already
established, the packet will be passed to the tcp_rcv_established()
function. This one has the important task of dealing with the
complex TCP acknowledgment mechanisms and header processing, which
of course are not very relevant here. The only interesting line is
the call to the data_ready() function belonging to the current sock
(sk), commonly pointing to sock_def_readable(), which awakens the
receiving process (the one that was receiving on the socket) with
wake_up_interruptible().</p><p>Luckily, UDP processing is much simpler; udp_rcv() just
performs some integrity checks before selecting the receiving sock
(udp_v4_lookup()) and calling udp_queue_rcv_skb(). If no sock is
found, the packet is discarded.</p><p>The latter function calls sock_queue_rcv_skb() (in sock.h),
which queues the UDP packet on the socket's receive buffer. If no
more space is left on the buffer, the packet is discarded.
Filtering also is performed by this function, which calls
sk_filter() just like TCP did. Finally, data_ready() is called, and
UDP packet reception is completed.</p><p>

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b1d580.0x1c15ea0"></a>What Happens to PF_PACKET Packets?</h2></div></div><p>The PF_PACKET family deserves a special handling. Packets
must be sent directly to the application's socket without being
processed by the network stack. Given the packet processing
mechanisms we have outlined in the previous sections, this is
actually not a difficult task.</p><p>When a PF_PACKET socket is created (see packet_create() in
net/packet/af_packet.c), a new protocol block is added to the list
used by the NET_RX softirq. The packet type related to this
protocol family is put either in the generic list (ptype_all) or in
the protocol-specific one (ptype_base) and has packet_rcv() as a
receive function. For reasons that will be clear in a while, the
newly created sock's address is written inside the packet type data
structure. This address would not logically belong to this part of
the kernel, since usually the socket information is dealt with by
layer 4 code. Hence, in this case, it is written as private opaque
information in the data field of the protocol block being
registered&mdash;a field reserved inside the structure for
protocol-specific mechanisms.</p><p>From that moment on, each packet entering the machine and
going through the usual receive procedure will be intercepted
during net_rx_action() execution and passed to the PF_PACKET
receive function.</p><p>The first thing this function does is to try to restore the
link layer header, if the socket type is SOCK_RAW (recall from my
article, &ldquo;The Linux Socket Filter: Sniffing Bytes over the
Network&rdquo;, <i  >LJ</i>, June 2001, that SOCK_DGRAM
sockets will not see the link layer header). This header has been
removed either by the network card (or any other generic link layer
device that received the packet) or by its driver (interrupt
handler). When dealing with Ethernet cards, the latter is almost
always the case. Restoring the link layer header is not possible if
removal has taken place at the hardware level, since that
information never gets to the system main memory and is invisible
outside the network device. The computational cost of header
restoration is quite low, thanks to the smart handling of skbuffs
inside the kernel.</p><p>The following step is to check whether a filter has been
attached to the receiving socket. This part is a bit tricky because
filter information is stored inside the sock structure, which is
not known yet since we are at the bottom of the protocol stack. But
for PF_PACKET sockets, which must be able to skip the protocol
stack, the receiving sock structure address has to be known
<span   class="emphasis"><em>a priori</em></span>. This explains why, during the socket
creation phase, the address of the sock structure had been written
opaquely into the protocol block's private data field; this
provides a relatively clean way to retrieve that information during
packet reception.</p><p>With the sock structure in hand, the kernel is able to
determine whether a filter is present and to invoke it (via the
sk_run_filter() call). As usual, the filter will decide whether the
fate of the packet is to be discarded (kfree_skb()), be trimmed to
a given length (pskb_trim()) or be accepted as it is.</p><p>If the packet is not discarded, the next step consists in
cloning the sk_buff containing the packet. This operation is
necessary because one copy will be consumed by the PF_PACKET
protocol, and the other must be made available for possible
legitimate protocols that will be executed later. For example,
imagine running a program that opens a PF_PACKET socket on a
machine that is browsing the Web at the same time. For each packet
belonging to the web connection, the net_rx_action() function would
call the PF_PACKET processing routines before calling the normal IP
ones. In this case, two copies of the packet would be needed: one
for the legitimate receiving socket, which would go to the web
browser, and the other for the PF_PACKET, which would go to the
sniffer. Note that the packet is duplicated only after being
processed by the filter. This way, only packets that actually match
the filter rules engage the CPU. Also note that packet filtering
performed at application level (i.e., using a PF_PACKET with no
socket filter) would require cloning of all the packets received by
the kernel, resulting in poor performance. Luckily, packet cloning
simply involves copying the fields of the sk_buff, but not the
packet data itself (which is referenced by the same pointer in the
clone and in the original sk_buff).</p><p>The PF_PACKET receive function finally completes its job by
invoking the data_ready() function on the receiving socket, just
like the TCP and UDP processing functions did. At this point the
application sleeping on a recv() or recvfrom() system call is
awakened and packet reception is complete.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b1d580.0x1c162c0"></a>Sleeping Processes</h2></div></div><p>As a side note, you may be wondering, how does a user process
come to sleep on a given socket when it invokes a recv(),
recvfrom() or recvmesg() system call? The mechanism is actually
pretty easy: all the recv functions are implemented inside the
kernel by calling, more or less directly, sock_recvmsg() (in
net/socket.c). This function, in turn, calls the recvmsg() function
that is registered inside the protocol-specific operations within
the sock structure. For example, this function is packet_recvmsg()
in the case of PF_PACKET protocol.</p><p>The protocol-specific recvmsg function, among other things,
sooner or later will call skb_recv_datagram(), which is a generic
function handling datagram reception for all the protocols. The
latter function obtains process blocking by calling
wait_for_packet() (in net/core/datagram.c), which sets process
status to TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE (i.e., sleeping task) and queues it
into the socket's sleep queue. The process rests there until a call
to wake_up_interruptible() is triggered by the arrival of a new
packet, as we saw in the previous paragraphs.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b1d580.0x1c16420"></a>What about the Filter Itself?</h2></div></div><p>The main filter implementation resides in core/filter.c,
whereas the SO_ATTACH/DETACH_FILTER ioctls are dealt with in
net/core/sock.c. The filter initially is attached to a socket via
the sk_attach_filter() function, that copies it from user space to
kernel space and runs an integrity check on it (sk_chk_filter()).
The check is aimed at ensuring that no incongruent code is executed
by the filter interpreter. Finally, the filter base address is
copied into the filter field of the sock structure, where it will
be used for filter invocation as we saw before.</p><p>The packet filter proper is implemented in the
sk_run_filter() function, which is given an skb (the current
packet) and a filter program. The latter is simply an array of BPF
instructions (see Resources) that is a sequence of numeric opcodes
and operands. The sk_run_filter() function does nothing more than
implement a BPF code interpreter (or a virtual CPU, if you prefer)
in a pretty straightforward way; a long switch/case statement
discriminates the opcode and takes actions on emulated registers
and memory accordingly. The emulated memory space, where the filter
code is run, is of course the packet's payload (sk-&gt;data). The
filter execution flow terminates, leading toward exiting the
function, when a BPF RET instruction is encountered.</p><p>Note that the sk_run_filter() function is called directly
only from PF_PACKET processing routines. Socket-level receive
routines (i.e., TCP, UDP and raw IP ones) go through the wrapper
function sk_filter() (in sock.h), which in addition to calling
sk_run_filter() internally, trims the packet to the length returned
by the filter.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b1d580.0x1c165d8"></a>Hooks to Packet Filter</h2></div></div><p>Our tour of the kernel packet handling functions is now
completed. It is interesting to draw some conclusions regarding the
packet filter invocation points. As we have seen, there are three
distinct call points inside the kernel where the filter may get
invoked: the TCP and UDP (layer 4) receive functions, and the
PF_PACKET (layer 2.5) receive function. Raw IP packets are filtered
also because they pass through the same path followed by UDP
packets (namely, sock_queue_rcv_skb()), which is used for
datagram-oriented reception).</p><p>It is important to notice that, at each layer, the filter is
applied to that layer's payload. That is, as the packet travels
upward the filter can see less and less information. For PF_PACKET
sockets, the filter is applied to layer 2 information, which
includes either the whole link layer data frame for SOCK_RAW
sockets or the whole IP packet; for TCP/UDP sockets, the filter is
applied to layer 4 information (basically, port numbers and little
other useful data). For this reason, layer 4 socket filtering is
likely to be useless. Of course, in any case the application level
payload (user data) is always available for the filter, even if it
is often of little or no use at all.</p><p><a href="5617l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2. udpsnd</a></p><p>A bright example of layer 4 uselessness is given in Listing 1
[available at
ftp.linuxjournal.com/pub/lj/listings/issue95/5617.tgz and
Listing 2, which presents a simple UDP server with an attached
socket filter and an associated simple UDP data sender. The filter
will accept only packets whose payload starts with &ldquo;lj&rdquo; (hex
0x6c6a). To test the program, compile and run Listing 1, called
udprcv. Then compile Listing 2 (udpsnd), and launch it like
this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
./udpsnd 127.0.0.1 "hello world"
</pre><p>Nothing will be printed by udprcv. Now, try writing a string
starting with &ldquo;lj&rdquo;, as in
<pre     class="programlisting">
./udpsnd 127.0.0.1 "lj rules"
</pre>


This time the string is printed correctly by udprcv since the
packet payload matches the filter.
</p><p>Another important issue that filter writers should be aware
of is that the filter must be written depending on the type of
socket (PF_PACKET, raw IP or TCP/UDP) that the filter will be
attached to. In fact, filter memory accesses use offsets that are
relative to the first byte in the packet payload as seen at a
specific level. Filter memory base addresses corresponding to the
most common families are reported in Table 1.</p><p><a href="5617t1.html" target="_self">Table 1. Filter Memory Base
Addresses</a></p><p>Moreover, the method described in the June 2001 article to
obtain the filter code (i.e., using <b  >tcpdump -dd</b>)
does not apply anymore if non-PF_PACKET sockets are used, as it
produces a filter working only for layer 2 (since it assumes that
address 0 is the start of the link layer frame).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b1d580.0x1c16b00"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>Following a packet's journey through the kernel can be an
interesting experience. In our trip we encountered typical kernel
data structures (such as skbuffs), discovered idiomatic programming
techniques (such as the use of structures with function pointers as
an efficient alternative to C++ objects) and met some new 2.4
mechanisms (softirqs).</p><p>If you are eager to learn more on the subject, arm yourself
with kernel sources and a comfortable editor, swallow a good cup of
coffee and start peeking here and there. The price is cheap, and
fun is guaranteed!</p><p><a href="5617s1.html" target="_self">Creation of PF_PACKET
