    Reuven continues his exploration of Zope, and this month
    shows how Zope products provide reusable functionality.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27b5580.0x28ad500"></a></h2></div></div><p>Last month we took an initial look at the
open-source Zope application server. In particular, we saw how you
can use Zope's DTML (dynamic template markup language) tags to
create simple dynamic sites, as well as how you can manage a web
site using nothing more than a web browser.
</p><p>But anyone who has worked with DTML knows that it ceases to
be wonderful when you want to create something relatively complex.
DTML is best when it is used sparingly or when its functionality is
obvious; writing pages of DTML that contain a half-dozen nested
conditional (&lt;dtml-if&gt;) tags quickly becomes unreadable and
difficult to maintain, not to mention very nonmodular.</p><p>Another problem is that DTML exists inside of individual
documents, rather than in a central location. If we want to reuse
functionality in multiple places, then we must copy our DTML
methods and documents. This means that when we want to add or
change some functionality, we must go through each of the copies
and modify them as well.</p><p>The solution to this problem is the Zope product. Each Zope
product is actually an object class (or a set of classes) that can
be instantiated any number of times in our web site.</p><p>This month, we look at Zope products, which form the core of
Zope's flexibility. After installing and working with some existing
products, we will write our own simple product in Python.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27b5580.0x28ad768"></a>What Can a Product Do?</h2></div></div><p>A Zope product is a package of code, graphics and DTML that
provides a piece of reusable functionality. For example, if we were
interested in creating a simple page that displays the current
time, we could create a DTML document:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;p&gt;It is now &lt;dtml-var name="ZopeTime" fmt="fCommon"&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
</pre><p>But what if we want to expand our page, displaying a weather
forecast retrieved via HTTP from another server? DTML is not the
answer here; even if we could use it to create our custom
functionality, the result would be difficult to manage, as well as
ugly to write. Because Zope products are written in Python, they
can use any Python module they like, displaying their output in
HTML or any other compatible format.</p><p>Because each product is treated as a single entity, we can
install and remove them as a single unit even if it defines and
uses a number of classes. However, this doesn't mean that each
product stands on its own; on the contrary, it is possible for one
product to use functionality provided by another product.</p><p>In addition to products and DTML documents, Zope provides two
other means for creating dynamic content: Python scripts
(implemented by a product, no less) allow us to write and use small
Python programs within Zope. We also can create, edit and use new
products using a system known as ZClasses. ZClasses allow you to
create new products (and their associated classes) using nothing
more than your web browser and DTML.</p><p>While these four options provide a great deal of flexibility,
deciding which one to use can sometimes be difficult for beginning
Perl programmers. Beehive's <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Book of Zope</em></span>,
which I review in this issue of <i  >Linux Journal</i>,
suggests using ZClasses at the beginning of a project, migrating
the code to a full-fledged product after everyone has agreed upon a
design. The more complex your functionality is, the more likely it
is that you will want to use or write a product rather than rely on
DTML and Python scripts.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27b5580.0x28adad8"></a>Managing Products</h2></div></div><p>You can run almost every aspect of Zope products via the Zope
management screen, which you can reach via the /manage URL of your
Zope server. Click on the control panel link in the left-hand frame
to bring up the Zope control panel and on the Product Management
link in the main frame to bring up the product management
screen.</p><p>You should see a list of Zope products, along with a button
marked &ldquo;Add product&rdquo; at the top of the screen. Products that you
can modify through the Web (including ZClasses, which we briefly
mentioned above) are identified with an open box, whereas standard
Zope products have a closed-box icon. A closed box simply means
that you cannot modify the product itself via the Web. However,
most products will let you customize them by setting one or more
properties via a web-based interface. But the product itself
remains unchanged, unless you modify the source code.</p><p>Each product is actually a directory under your Zope
installation directory in lib/python/Products. The Sessions product
is under lib/python/Products/Sessions, while the Transience product
is in lib/python/Products/Transience. (I installed Zope under
/usr/local/zope/ on my system, so Sessions is actually in
/usr/local/zope/lib/python/Products/Sessions/.) A product directory
contains Python code, text files and directories, including:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>__init__.py: this is what Zope scans and executes
when it loads your module. Among other things, the initialize
method in __init__.py invokes context.registerClass, which (as its
name implies) tells Zope that your product exists, what text to
display in the Add menu on the /manage screen (with the meta_type
parameter) and how to create a new instance of your product when
the Add button has been pressed (with the constructors
parameter).</p></li><li><p>README.txt: as its name implies, this is the README
file for a particular product. Clicking on a product name from
within the control panel will display a README tab, among others.
This tab allows you to look at README.txt without having to look at
the filesystem. If the product directory contains no file named
README.txt, then no README tab will appear at the top of the
screen.</p></li><li><p>version.txt: this file contains the name and
current version number of your product, separated by minus signs
(-). Version 1.2.3 of the product Foo thus will have a version.txt
with the following contents: Foo-1-2-3. This version information is
displayed in the control panel.</p></li><li><p>Help files: a product may contain a help directory,
which contains the text displayed by Zope when you click on the
help link. Help files are often written using structured text, a
minimalist formatting system similar in spirit to Perl's POD
documentation system. Structured text is easy to write with a
simple text editor and equally easy to read with a standard Linux
tool like less.</p></li></ul></div><p>Zope only looks at the current list of products when it
starts up. This means that if you install a new product, you will
need to restart your Zope server. This is done most easily from
within the control panel.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27b5580.0x28ae000"></a>Installing Products</h2></div></div><p>Now that we have seen what a typical product may contain, we
will install a product by downloading it from the Zope web site,
unpack it within lib/python/Products and restart Zope. If all goes
well, our newly installed product should then appear in our control
panel screen. Moreover, we will be able to create new instances of
this product anywhere we want in our web hierarchy.</p><p>For example, let's create a Slashdot clone using the
Squishdot product for Zope. Our first task is to retrieve a copy of
Squishdot from
<a href="http://www.zope.org/Products" target="_self">www.zope.org/Products</a>.
Squishdot is listed under the Feedback category, among others, and
probably will be one of the first products listed. Click on the
links that lead to a downloadable version of Squishdot; the latest
version as of this writing is 1.3.0. Notice how even a product of
moderate complexity is relatively small; the Squishdot version that
I downloaded was a little more than 256KB.</p><p>To install Squishdot, we must unpack it into
lib/python/Products. Assuming that we place newly downloaded files
in /downloads, this means that we can unpack Squishdot in the
following way:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# Set this to your Zope home
export ZOPE=/usr/local/zope
# Switch into the products directory
cd $ZOPE/lib/python/Products
# Unpack Squishdot into the current directory
tar -zxvf /downloads/Squishdot-1-3-0.tar.gz
</pre><p>Older Zope products expect to be unpacked from the Zope root
directory, rather than from within lib/python/Products.
Unfortunately, there does not seem to be any obvious way to know
how a product was packaged without looking at it:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
tar -ztvf /downloads/ProductName.tar.gz
</pre><p>If each filename begins with the lib/python/Products
pathname, then you will want to switch into $ZOPE, rather than
$ZOPE/lib/python/Products, before unpacking the product.</p><p>Unpacking the archive is all we need to do in order to
install Squishdot. However, Zope only looks for products when it
starts up; we must restart the server before we can create
instances of Squishdot on our system. The best way to do that is to
click on the Restart button from within the control panel. Don't
panic if your browser complains that the server is no longer
running after you click on Restart, or if you see an
obscure-looking Python exception backtrace after clicking on the
Restart button. Rather, wait several seconds before clicking again
on the control panel link in the left-hand frame, and it should
work.</p><p>You can check to see if your product has been added by
returning to the Product Management page within the control panel.
If the newly installed product (Squishdot, in this case) does not
appear on the list, double-check that it was unpacked correctly and
that the permissions allow the Zope user access to the product's
files.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27b5580.0x28ae420"></a>Using a Product</h2></div></div><p>At this point, we should be able to create a new Squishdot
site by moving to the root (/) directory of the Zope server,
selecting Squishdot site from the selection list and clicking on
Add. This invokes the methods named in the constructors parameter
to context.registerClass, invoked by the initialize function in
Squishdot's __init__.py.</p><p>And indeed, we could move ahead and create our Squishdot site
at this point. But Squishdot uses the Zope MailHost object (which
represents an SMTP server) to send e-mail notifications. If you
have not yet created and defined a MailHost, the Squishdot
configuration screen will remind you to do so.</p><p>When Squishdot looks for a MailHost, it begins its search in
the current directory. If it does not find a MailHost object, the
search continues up the directory tree, stopping when Squishdot
reaches / or when it finds a MailHost object. While this might
appear to be a simple issue, it demonstrates the concept of
acquisition, which is central to Zope. Moreover, it means that
different Squishdot sites can send e-mail via different SMTP
servers, simply by creating more than one MailHost object. Indeed,
we can define a global default MailHost in /, overriding it as
necessary by placing additional MailHost objects in subdirectories.
The concept of acquisition permeates Zope and means that we can
define or redefine nearly anything&mdash;MailHosts, users, headers and
stylesheets&mdash;at a local level.</p><p>In this particular case, we will create an instance of
MailHost in the / directory by choosing MailHost from the new
product list and clicking on Add. Because a MailHost object
represents an SMTP server, the configuration of this object is
pretty straightforward, requiring that we enter the name of our
Zope server's SMTP server. Most Linux machines run their own mail
servers, so &ldquo;localhost&rdquo; is probably a reasonable value.</p><p>The mandatory ID field is used to identify this MailHost
uniquely within the current directory, which is why Zope uses IDs
to identify objects in URLs uniquely. Just as a filename is a
unique identifier within a directory, a Zope object ID is a unique
identifier within a folder or other object. The optional Title
field is meant for humans, rather than for the underlying Zope
server; if it is defined, an object's title is displayed from
within the Zope server interface.</p><p>After you have created your MailHost object, you will be
returned to the main Zope management screen for /. You should see
your new MailHost object (represented with a small envelope icon),
along with any title that you defined, in the list of
objects.</p><p>We are now ready to create our Squishdot site. Add a new
Squishdot site object using the selection list and Add button in
the upper right-hand corner, choose an ID (i.e., URL pathname),
optional title and mailhost, and then select some other basic
parameters for your Squishdot site. For example, I chose an ID of
atf and otherwise left the configuration options with their default
values.</p><p>To enter my Squishdot site, I now tell my web browser to
display http://localhost:8080/atf/. Zope receives this request for
/atf and sees that we are referring to a Squishdot object. Zope
then asks this object to display itself. Sure enough, we see an
introductory screen that looks something like Slashdot but is
powered by Zope.</p><p>We can create as many Squishdot sites as we might like,
keeping in mind that every new site must have its own unique ID. In
this way, we can set up one moderated site, one unmoderated site
and another internal site for our organization's own uses&mdash;each
with its own URL, potentially protected with its own set of users
and groups.</p><p>To modify the Squishdot site, simply append /manage to the
name of the object you want to modify, as in
http://localhost:8080/atf/manage. This invokes Zope's management
system on our Squishdot site. Using tabs at the top of the screen,
you can modify nearly any parameter having to do with Squishdot,
from moderation rules to the color of the text in which the site
name is displayed.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27b5580.0x28ae840"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>This month we discussed Zope products and saw how to
download, install and configure products on our system. While
products are inherently more complex than simple DTML pages, their
centralized code and additional flexibility make them more suitable
for serious tasks than DTML.</p><p>Next month we will look at how we can write our own Zope
products using a combination of Python and DTML.</p><p><a href="5687s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
