But, the embedded Linux community quickly responds to the
challenge.</p><p>by Rick Lehrbaum</p><p>
Monopolist Microsoft was up to its old tricks in the fourth quarter
of 2001, publishing a lengthy and one-sided comparison of their
newly introduced Windows XP Embedded with embedded Linux. The
document, titled &ldquo;Why Microsoft Windows XP Embedded and Not
Embedded Linux?&rdquo;, compares XP Embedded to embedded Linux:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Selecting an operating system (OS) platform is
one of the first decisions an embedded developer must make for any
given device design. Whether you are considering migrating from a
proprietary to commercial platform, or from one commercial platform
to another, the objectives are the same: accelerated time to
market; a solid, extensible OS core that can be used across all
projects; superior technologies that support differentiation and
address emerging opportunities; and predictability over the device
lifecycle. In addition, you want it at the lowest possible total
cost from a reputable vendor who will support you throughout the
process.</p></blockquote></div><p>The document then proceeds to compare XP Embedded to embedded
Linux, claiming, as you might expect, that XP is superior in each
case: Integrated, Comprehensive, Unmatched, Interoperable, Proven,
Global, Linux Is Not Free and OEM Licensing.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1661580.0x17597c0"></a>The Embedded Linux Community Responds</h2></div></div><p>After learning of the Microsoft anti-embedded-Linux document,
<a href="http://LinuxDevices.com" target="_self">LinuxDevices.com</a>
issued a call to action, noting that &ldquo;embedded Linux is not the
product of a single dominant vendor, but rather is the result of
the collaborative (and competitive) efforts of an entire market
consisting of dozens of large and small companies plus thousands of
individual developers&rdquo;, and urging the embedded Linux community to
respond <span   class="emphasis"><em>en masse</em></span> to Microsoft's attack.</p><p>The embedded Linux community quickly rose to the challenge,
responding with sharply worded talk-backs, as well as in the form
of lengthy, detailed and sometimes entertaining rebuttals from
Lineo and LynuxWorks. Below are excerpts from a few of the many
talk-back posts received.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>This is not the first time that MS tries to
discredit Linux by the means of a self-made comparison of features
Windows supposedly has and Linux lacks. For someone living in
Germany (like me), this type of PR is completely strange, as
comparative advertisement is not allowed here. With Linux, we
started seeing this kind of ad in newspapers, as Linux is not a
company but a free product that can't sue another company for any
sort of commercials. I always wondered why they are doing this. If
we put away our natural preference for everything that represents
freedom and individuality, we could thank MS for telling us where
Linux can be improved and where we find good arguments to sell
Linux to potential customers. Every article of this kind generates
the same reaction&mdash;and at the end, MS seems to be the loser.</p></li><li><p>Microsoft is doing what it does best: going above
the developers' heads to the managers and CxOs who have the power
to Hand Down Decisions From Above. Embedded guys like to roll their
own custom solutions and with good reason: horses for courses.
Different devices have different requirements. PhBs like to
purchase the one-size-fits-all solution and make it the
company-wide standard. PhBs have enormous clout, otherwise MS would
likely not be a monopoly. I don't know how much they have in the
embedded space, but I figure with devices like cell phones, PDAs,
kiosks, etc., gaining prominence, the PhB-to-clueful-manager ratio
is increasing.</p></li><li><p>Microsoft has very valid reasons to be worried
about its long-term importance and future fiscal profits with
regard to its diminishing relationship and relevance to the IS
&ldquo;Backend Iron&rdquo; and embedded products markets. Microsoft dominates
the x86-32 desktop market and that is where it will die.</p></li><li><p>Well, speaking of PR or political support for Linux
depends on where you look at it. Within the European Union Linux is
getting more and more heavyweight political support. The
governments of France, Germany, Spain, Portugal and Finland have
started a lot of open-source projects that are evaluating the
possibility of getting rid of MS.</p></li><li><p>Microsoft's idea of &ldquo;embedded&rdquo; is...something
heavier than a thin PC client. The Microsoft Toaster would be a
quad P4, two for each side of the toast, and would actually do the
toasting by dropping to command-line mode for the required amount
of time. The idea of fitting a whole OS, web browser, et. al., into
4MB of NVRAM and 8MB of real RAM is anathema to them. Embedded, to
them, means maybe be able to squeeze into 32MB of RAM if pared back
to the bone. They spec enough resources for their minimal system to
run a decent e-commerce site on if you used Linux instead. If you
don't wrap your mind around that perspective, you'll never
understand where they're coming from.</p></li><li><p>Microsoft decries the fact that Linux provides
developers with a choice: &ldquo;For example, there are at least five
different window managers and at least four competing
browsers....&rdquo; In Microsoft's mind, it would appear that for a
developer to have a choice as to which window manager or browser
best suits their needs is a bad thing. For some applications, the
massive&mdash;and often unused&mdash;features of something like Microsoft's
Internet Explorer may be overkill, and its multi-megabyte footprint
would be prohibitive. For Microsoft, these issues seem to be
secondary to the mindset that having choice is a bad thing.</p></li></ul></div><p>From LynuxWorks:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>We did some investigating of our own and are
adding some commentary on the new [Windows XP Embedded] release as
a contender in the embedded market. In general, we found that the
operating system has limited applicability in embedded markets and
doesn't have the clout to really take on embedded Linux in head-on
comparisons. XP...has shortcomings as an embedded offering. There
are some places it can go, but those are limited for reasons you
will see below. The bulk of Microsoft's issues continue to be in
size and performance.
</p><p>[This is followed by a long discussion of specific features
and issues.]</p><p>In summary, Windows XP is not as good an embedded solution as
embedded Linux for the following reasons:</p><p>Memory footprint&mdash;Windows XP has a memory footprint between 5
and 15MB, where Embedded Linux has a memory footprint of
259KB.</p><p>Performance&mdash;the market has proven that Linux offers
performance superior to or equal to Windows for servers. Given the
additional factors against Windows XP for embedded (size and
complexity), this comparison will be more in favor of Linux for
embedded applications.</p><p>Maturity&mdash;Linux subscribes to an OS model proven through 40
years of innovations. Interoperability issues, performance and
general design have had an extremely long time to be tried and
improved. Moreover, all these improvements have been done in a very
diverse set of platforms.</p><p>Configuration&mdash;Linux is highly configurable, having been
developed and deployed in memory-limited environments, in
comparison to Windows XP, which has operated in memory-hungry
monolithic environments.</p><p>Innovation&mdash;because of the open nature of Linux source code,
it has become a nexus of activity in regards to innovative
computing to a far greater degree than any Windows product.</p><p>Third-party support&mdash;thousands of applications, drivers and
kernel extensions are available from open source as well as
commercial vendors for Linux. The number is certainly comparable
with Windows XP.</p><p>Networking&mdash;all major networking protocols, security features
and extensions are available for Linux. In fact, many are
implemented on Linux before other platforms.</p><p>Security&mdash;open-source nature of Linux allows the &ldquo;many
eyes&rdquo; approach to be used to incredible effect. Security
protocols, in particular, benefit greatly from this approach
because their design and implementation are well documented and
understood. A very stunning example of this is the NSA's recent
release of a secure Linux.</p><p>Interoperability&mdash;Linux servers are among the key
participants in the evolution of the Internet and, as such, offer a
state-of-the-art interoperability solution. With Java providing all
the benefits of Windows XP's .NET framework, Linux has a much
greater degree of interoperability than Windows XP.</p><p>Cost effectiveness&mdash;development in any environment is the
greatest expense. Having a diverse community for testing and
deployment figures greatly in the success of Linux. Also, because
of the highly custom nature of many embedded solutions, the highly
configurable nature of Linux makes it particularly cost
effective.</p><p>Support&mdash;Microsoft provides a single source of support for
their product, limiting competitive offerings. In the Linux world,
however, there are many choices among vendors who will provide
support, solutions and software.</p><p>Development tools&mdash;while Windows XP is primarily constrained
to development under an IDE environment, Linux provides the
powerful UNIX development environment in addition to IDE
environments.</p><p>Reliability&mdash;the deployments speak for themselves. Windows is
rarely considered for mission-critical applications, where Linux is
routinely considered for them.</p></blockquote></div><p>From Lineo:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Historically, such comparisons from Microsoft
have consistently attempted to show negative elements about a
competitor's solution while ignoring Microsoft's own shortcomings
altogether. In this paper, the Microsoft authors seemingly forgot
to address the relevant community of intelligent and capable
software engineers, device manufacturers and media editors who
would care about embedded system software. The content and spin of
this Microsoft paper seems to assume an audience unfamiliar with
competitive offerings....
</p><p>[This is followed by a long discussion of specific features
and issues.]</p><p>Microsoft has tied the web browser and windowing environment
to the underlying operating system and defines these items as major
OS components. Apparently they do not believe in product
differentiation or choice. This philosophy runs strong throughout
this Microsoft document.</p><p>On the other hand, Lineo does not attempt to dictate to its
customers what must be included in the final configuration. For
example, many embedded products do not require a GUI or a web
browser; therefore it would be presumptuous for any embedded
operating system company to conclude that these are major
components required in every system. Instead, the Lineo Embedix
embedded operating system offers a &ldquo;core&rdquo; set of features
necessary to provide a fully functional operating system, allowing
the developer to pick and choose elements that distinguish a
product from the competition. The truth is that this flexibility
allows developers to innovate far beyond what is possible under
Microsoft's closed-source model.</p><p>Lineo provides fully open-source Linux with no per-unit
costs. The developer is free to modify and use thousands of
existing applications for their specific device. [Optional] license
bearing components are negotiated in a way that best suits both the
customer and Lineo. Windows XP Embedded uses a one-size-fits-all
technique with a commensurate royalty structure, restricting the
ability of the development team to limit costs.</p><p>Support for Linux is also competitive. The open-source nature
of Linux means that effective support can be provided from a wide
range of resources including internal, contractor, public access
(internet-based resources) and commercial Linux corporations. What
do these things mean to the developer? They mean that Linux vendors
will be vying for your business, giving developers more choice to
match their unique time-to-market, cost and feature
requirements.</p></blockquote></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1661580.0x175a738"></a>Why Attack Embedded Linux?</h2></div></div><p>As the dust begins to settle, it's interesting to consider
this question: Why has Microsoft's Embedded group aimed their big
guns at embedded Linux at this time? Here are some clues:</p><p>Clue number one: Microsoft is losing to Linux in the general
embedded market. A number of market studies, such Evans Data
Corporation's &ldquo;2001 Embedded Systems Developer Survey&rdquo;, have
consistently begun to report that tremendous strides have been made
by embedded Linux over the past one to two years.</p><p>Specifically, Evans Data Corporation's latest data says that
embedded Linux was the third-most popular OS choice for new
embedded system designs among 500 developers polled in 2001--behind
Wind River's VxWorks and Microsoft's DOS, and ahead of Microsoft's
WinCE (see Figure 1).</p><p>Of greater significance, though, is that the results of the
study suggest that embedded Linux is poised to jump into first
place, ahead of both Wind River's and Microsoft's offerings, within
the next 12 months.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="5698f1.large.jpg"><img src="5698f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Evans Data Corporation 2001 Embedded Systems Developer Survey
</p></div></div><p>Clue number two: the stakes are extremely high in emerging
&ldquo;post-PC devices&rdquo; markets. Another likely reason for Microsoft's
growing concern with embedded Linux is that major manufacturers
like Hewlett-Packard, Sharp and Motorola recently have begun
delivering new consumer devices that contain embedded Linux. These
include handheld computers and TV set-top boxes&mdash;emerging markets
with extremely high-volume potential, which Microsoft undoubtedly
wants to dominate.</p><p>In the PDA space, where Microsoft has steadily gained ground
on market-leader Palm, embedded Linux may well be perceived as a
&ldquo;dark horse&rdquo; disruptive technology. This is especially of concern
given the growing popularity of embedded Linux in the Far East,
where most high-volume consumer products are manufactured.</p><p>In contrast to the handhelds market, there is no established
leader in the emerging markets for set-top entertainment systems
and auto-PCs. These markets clearly have the potential to absorb
more OS royalty stickers than desktop PCs, so it is not surprising
that Microsoft would want to nip the early embedded Linux lead in
the bud.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1661580.0x175ac08"></a>More to Come</h2></div></div><p>Watch for the action to heat up further in these and similar
high-volume &ldquo;post-PC&rdquo; markets in the coming months. According to
rumors from embedded Linux vendors such as Lineo, MontaVista and
Red Hat, there are literally hundreds of embedded Linux-based
consumer devices in the pipeline&mdash;products that can't be discussed
publicly until they're about to be shipped by their
manufacturers.</p><p>All in all, 2002 promises to be another exciting year for
embedded Linux!</p><p><a href="5698s1.html" target="_self">For Further Reading</a></p></div></div>
