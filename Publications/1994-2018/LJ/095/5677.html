    David looks at compatibility problems with distros, kernels

user. I guess I have to ask, who is? But, I hope most users don't
have some of the problems I see regularly. At home, I usually have
five systems connected, and my business has a fair number of
servers and access points on the Internet. What I've been finding,
and with greater frequency, is that between software not being
available on some distros and software that only builds on some
kernels, I have four different distros running seven different
kernels just on the five systems I have at home. As of this writing
(latest kernel version 2.4.17-pre6), the latest (CVS) Internet
PhoneJACK software wouldn't build on any of the four most recent
kernels I installed; other software required kernels 2.4.4-2.4.8 to
build. Non-overlap of kernel versions needed to build and run some
software is why I have seven kernels on five systems. FreeS/WAN
compiles on some, but not all kernels. Then some distros have their
own problems. Mandrake 8.1, which has a lot of bells and whistles,
didn't include wireless utilities or support for CardBus or my
ORiNOCO card&mdash;easily remedied, but not necessarily so for newbies.
Caldera has a nasty habit of providing upgrades, such as those to
the kernel, but not upgrading the kernel version itself. They patch
it up with security patches, then leave the source as 2.4.2.
Needless to say, some software refuses to build when 2.4.4 or
better is required. Most readers already will be aware of the
numerous problems with Red Hat. Solution? I'm afraid I don't have
one. But I do know that what I consider only niggling annoyances
can become show-stoppers for newbies. And, no amount of support
will push Linux into the Microsoft strongholds if these problems
aren't resolved.
</p><p>Vipul's Razor
<a href="http://razor.sourceforge.net" target="_self">razor.sourceforge.net</a></p><p>Last month I railed against spammers. This month I have a
cure. If you're running an MTA (I run several), you can stop spam
via a simple global /etc/procmailrc recipe (or you can do the same
just for your mail with your own personal ~/.procmailrc). Mine
shunts all spam received to a spam box. I've checked the messages
sent to this spam folder for over a month, and not one legitimate
mail has been misdirected. Now I'm averaging one spam every three
days, which I report to the razor servers, and with spams
reportedly up 650% over last Christmas season, I'm happy. Requires:
Perl, Perl modules Net::Ping, Net::DNS, Time::HiRes, Digest::SHA1,
Mail::Internet and a strong desire to be spam-free.</p><p>XNetworkStrength
<a href="http://gabriel.bigdam.net/home/xnetstrength" target="_self">gabriel.bigdam.net/home/xnetstrength</a></p><p>Running a wireless card? Want to know how good or bad your
signal strength is without running
<span   class="bold"><b>iwspy</b></span> every few seconds? Well,
XNetworkStrength will do it for you if you're on an X screen. You
can keep an eye on your connection while you're working. Requires:
libX11, glibc.</p><p>CGIpaf
<a href="http://stafwag.f2g.net/cgipaf" target="_self">stafwag.f2g.net/cgipaf</a></p><p>Need a simple, safe way for users to change their password?
These CGI tools are compiled C programs that provide security, but
you'll want them accessible only via https (not much sense changing
a password over an insecure link). They also allow for users to
forward mail and return a mail message (<span   class="emphasis"><em>&agrave;
la</em></span> vacation). Unfortunately, this program won't take
mailing lists into account (as vacation will). Requires: libdb1,
libpam (optional), libdl, glibc, web server with PHP.</p><p>NorthStar
<a href="http://www.brownkid.net/NorthStar" target="_self">www.brownkid.net/NorthStar</a></p><p>NorthStar will help you keep track of your IP allocations,
equipment and locations of same. In fact, one of the nicest things
about this is the way you can view your networks, devices and
locations. If you have more than a few IPs or systems or locations,
you'll want to look this program over. Requires: web server, Perl,
PostgreSQL.</p><p>Simplyfied CD Backup
<a href="http://scdbackup.webframe.org/main_eng.html" target="_self">scdbackup.webframe.org/main_eng.html</a></p><p>This backup to CD utility is actually a number of small
programs to permit specific actions. There's scdbackup_home that
permits users to back up just their home directory. There's
scdbackup_sys that permits a backup of the system. There's also
just an scdbackup that can be fed arguments about which directories
to back up and which to exclude from backup. Some backups (home
directories, for example) are backed up as filesystems. Others,
such as the system backup, are done as afio archives. Simplyfied CD
Backup handles multivolume backups as well as single CD backups.
Requires: cdrecord, mkisofs, bash, afio.</p><p>mail-bounce
<a href="http://www.spots.ab.ca/~gary/mail-bounce" target="_self">www.spots.ab.ca/~gary/mail-bounce</a></p><p>This small Perl program will allow you to take mail and
bounce it back where it came from. It also permits you to include a
custom message. While a message can be bounced at any time, it
doesn't make much sense to bounce it back hours later, thus
procmail is suggested as an easy way to bounce the mail, although
any program, even a command line, can be used. Requires: Perl,
procmail (suggested).</p><p>tknotepad
<a href="ftp://ftp.mindspring.com/users/joeja" target="_self">ftp.mindspring.com/users/joeja</a></p><p>I had a difficult time selecting between two excellent
packages I continue to use. And while I think E*Reminders merits
mention, I chose tknotepad. I'm not sure why this hasn't been more
widely adopted, but it provides Windows refugees a familiar haven.
This tool looks, acts and works just like the Windows notepad. In
fact, it's what I use to write this column, and it could be used to
write web pages, edit configuration files and much more. Easier for
most than my favorite editor, vi. Requires: Tcl/Tk.</p><p>Until next month.</p></div></div>
