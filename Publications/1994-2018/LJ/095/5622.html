    Cameron introduces XSLT and shows why it's such a hot topic
    in application development.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24e2580.0x25da6b8"></a></h2></div></div><p>Extensible Stylesheet Language for
Transformations (XSLT) is a computing language specialized for
mapping XML documents into other XML documents.
</p><p>Explanation of XSLT is no small ambition. The problem has to
do with variety; there are many uses for XSLT, many instances of
XSLT engines and many cooperating technologies involved in XSLT
application, so it's important to focus on the essentials.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24e2580.0x25da818"></a>Universal XML</h2></div></div><p>The first XSLT essential is its Extensible Markup Language
(XML) base (also see the &ldquo;Glossary of XSLT Terms&rdquo; Sidebar). XML
is the universal data format designed to encode everything:
algorithmic data, programs and documents from purchase orders to
biblical translations, in any human language, on any kind of
computer and operating system. XML looks like HTML except it's a
bit more complicated. In fact, one of XML's design goals is to
generalize HTML in a way that preserves the comfort of HTML adepts.
There's even a flavor of XML called XHTML that permits direct
interpretation as HTML. <i  >Linux Journal</i>
frequently publishes articles on different aspects of XML.</p><p>A fully XML-ized world is a simpler one, in many ways. To
analyze the operation of an accounts payable department, for
example, you don't need to know who reports to whom, who is due for
a three-week vacation and all those other messy human details. If
you can draw a diagram that shows invoices coming in and payments
going out, perhaps with authorization records spawned along the
way, then you have abstracted what ought to be the essential
information.</p><p>This is an intoxicating insight. It promises that a system
that can transform one XML document (invoice) into one or more
other XML documents (payment check, authorization records) and at
least organizes, and possibly solves, all meaningful organization
automations. That's why XSLT seems so important now.</p><p>Readers with a background in the XML world should generalize
their project experience to get a notion of XSLT's true worth.
Anyone with practical knowledge of XML knows that it's only the
beginning of a solution, not the miracle cure marketing brochures
often make it out to be. XSLT is exactly the same: a useful and
even powerful way to organize the real work of engineering
applications fit for production. The idea of transforming XML
documents is an important one; to see whether it's the right idea
requires close attention to the technical details.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24e2580.0x25daa80"></a>An Engine of Your Own</h2></div></div><p>To start you on your XSLT career and help you get the proper
feel for the language, you'll need an engine, or language
processor, of your own. The most widely used are based on Java
and/or are proprietary. These often are integrated into larger
server products: database servers, application servers and so
on.</p><p>Rather than any of these, this article presents its examples
in terms of the tDOM engine. tDOM has several advantages, among
which the most important are that it's available under a liberal
open-source license, it's exceptionally thrifty on memory and twice
as fast as competing XSLT engines in our benchmarks, its
installation is quick and compact and it exposes a scriptable
command mode that's convenient for instruction. Moreover, tDOM fits
well in the dual-level programming style explained below, and it's
robust enough to be in production use at several demanding sites
already.</p><p>To set up your own copy of tDOM, see the &ldquo;How to Start XSLT
Programming&rdquo; Sidebar. That Sidebar concludes with a first example
of XSLT use, invoked as</p><pre     class="programlisting">
tclsh8.3 xslt.tcl example1.xml example1.xsl
example1.html
</pre><p>This command line says, &ldquo;Use version 8.3 of the Tcl
interpreter to launch the xslt.tcl program. The xslt.tcl utility
applies the example1.xsl stylesheet to the example1.xml document
and produces example1.html as its output.&rdquo;
</p><p>Look at this first as a machine that takes example1.xml as
its input and produces example1.html, which has only a couple of
lines:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;
&lt;datum&gt;first message&lt;/datum&gt;
</pre><p>Think of example1.html as an expansion of this into
well-formatted HTML:
<pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;h1&gt;first message&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>


</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24e2580.0x25dae48"></a>XML as Data and Code</h2></div></div><p>If all you need is a simple HTML document like example1.html,
you can write it directly or use a lightweight macro language,
rather than learn XSLT. The value of XSLT begins to appear when you
look at more complex examples. You can set up the XSLT
transformation to generate example1.html output in a particular
style, perhaps with approved fonts or boilerplate site hyperlinks
and disclaimers.</p><p>XSLT uses the language of stylesheets to specify these
transformations. While stylesheets were in use before XSLT's
invention, this article ignores other uses and consistently
abbreviates XSLT stylesheet as just stylesheet.</p><p>On one level, a stylesheet is a program. Just as</p><pre     class="programlisting">
int main()
{
    puts("Hello.");
}
</pre><p>is the source for a C program, a stylesheet is the source for
an XSLT program. A peculiarity of stylesheets, though, is that they
are themselves XML documents. Rather than looking like normal
computer programs (in the way C, Java and ksh do, say), XSLT source
is a kind of markup text (see Listing 1).
</p><p><a href="5622l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1.
example1.xsl</a></p><p>With a verboseness typical of XML, this says, roughly, &ldquo;act
as a program that pulls out &lt;datum&gt; elements and puts their
contents in &lt;h1&gt; headings of well-formatted HTML.&rdquo; That's
how example1.html is generated.</p><p>The application that implements this XSLT interpretation is
itself a Tcl program. There's little you need to learn about Tcl at
this point. tDOM exposes its XSLT engine with Tcl bindings, and the
xslt.tcl script simply treats command-line variables as the
filenames of XML documents and passes them on to the engine.</p><p>Let's review the example invocation. In</p><pre     class="programlisting">
tclsh8.3 xslt.tcl example1.xml example1.xsl
example1.html
</pre><p>tclsh8.3 is the name of the executable program we're
launching, and xslt.tcl is a minimal Tcl script that wraps the tDOM
XSLT engine. If we wanted to improve the error handling of this
utility, refinement of xslt.tcl would be the natural place to
start.
</p><p>Running xslt.tcl creates an XSLT processor that receives
three filenames. The example1.xml file is a sample XML source
document. This file names the stylesheet we apply to example1.xml.
The process writes the resulting output document to example1.html.
Select different logical contents for example1.html by naming a
different XML source, perhaps example2.xml. To change the style of
the output, rewrite example1.xsl.</p><p>You've now successfully run an XSLT program. All that's left
to learn are the details of XSLT as a language and how it's applied
to real-world problems. Before more on the syntax and semantics of
XSLT, let's look at its uses.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24e2580.0x25db3c8"></a>One Language, Many Applications</h2></div></div><p>Suppose you're responsible for a web site of tens of
thousands of pages. You maintain those pages in an
organization-specific XML vocabulary that strips out formatting
information and HTML blemishes; your documents hold only the
logical content specific to each page. Visitors need HTML, of
course, but you generate that automatically, along with standard
headers, frames, navigation bars, footnotes and all the other
decorations we've come to expect on the Web. XSLT gives you the
ability to update site style instantaneously for all the thousands
of managed documents. Moreover, it partitions responsibility nicely
between XML content files and XSLT stylesheets, so that different
specialists can collaborate effectively.</p><p>That executive-level description masks quite a bit of
implementation variability. Where and when does the XSLT
transformation take place? You might have a back end of XML
documents, which you periodically process with a command-line XSLT
interpreter to generate static HTML documents served up by a
conventional web server. You might keep the XML sources in a
database, from which they're retrieved either as XML, as
transformed HTML or even as full-blown HTTP sessions. Various
application servers, content managers and even XML databases
provide each of these interfaces. Another variation is this: you
might keep only sources on your server and, with the right
combination of HTML extensions and browser, direct the browser
itself to interpret the XSLT you pass. You can make each of these
steps as dynamic as you like, with caching to improve performance,
customization to match browser or reader characteristics and so
on.</p><p>This multiplicity of applications makes vendor literature a
challenge to read. We all adopt different styles of Java
programming depending on whether we're working on applets,
servlets, beans and so on, even though all these fit the label of
Java web software. Similarly, it's important to understand clearly
what kind of XSLT processing different products offer.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24e2580.0x25db580"></a>Complex Site Development</h2></div></div><p>Neil Madden, an undergraduate at the University of
Nottingham, has an XSLT system tuned for especially rapid
deployment and maintenance. His scheme is organized around
multisection sites, authored by teams of administrators, editors
and users. He uses TclKit, an innovative open-source tool that
combines database and HTTP functionality in a particularly
lightweight, low-maintenance package. TclKit also knows how to
interpret Tcl programs, so he wraps up tDOM with standard templates
into a scriptable module. With this, he begins site-specific
development:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Design an XML document structure that captures the
content of the site's data.</p></li><li><p>Compose XSL stylesheets to transform data to meet
each client's needs.</p></li><li><p>Repeat steps one and two for each section that
needs special requirements.</p></li><li><p>Add users, sections and pages.</p></li></ol></div><p>Scripted documents encapsulate these bundles of different
kinds of data (site structure, XML sources, stylesheets) and make
it easy to update and deploy a working site onto a new server or
partition. Madden has plans to offer not just web-based editing but
also a richer, quicker GUI interface. Tcl's uniformity and
scriptability make this dual porting through either web service or
local GUI practical.
</p><p>Well-defined module boundaries are essential to the system.
Designers maintain stylesheets, administrators manage privileges
and editors assign sections without collision. With all of the
functionality implemented as tiny scripts that glue together
reliable components, it's easy to layer on new functionality.
Madden's medium-term ambitions include a Wiki collaborative
bulletin board, and XSP and FOP modules for generation of
high-quality presentation output. Madden proudly compares his
system to Cocoon, the well-known, Apache-based, Java-coded XML
publishing framework. At a fraction of the cost in lines of code,
his system bests Cocoon's performance by a wide margin.</p><p>Even further along in production use of tDOM XSLT is George
J. Schlitz of MediaOne. He prepares financial documents with XSLT
in a mission-critical web environment. While he originally began
publication with Xalan, performance requirements drove him to
switch to tDOM.</p><p>The fundamental point in all this is to be on the lookout for
XML-coded or XML-codable data. Chat logs, legal transcripts,
printer jobs, news photographs, screen layouts, genealogical
records, game states, application designs, parcel shipments,
medical files and much, much more are all candidates for
XML-ization. Once in that format, XSLT processing is generally the
most reliable and scalable way to render the data for specific
uses.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24e2580.0x25dbb00"></a>Learning XSLT</h2></div></div><p>We still have a lot to learn about XSLT as a profession. As
fast as its use is expanding, there remain fewer programmers
competent in XSLT than, say, Object Pascal.</p><p>Another hurdle in XSLT's diffusion, along with its
unconventional XML-based syntax and confusing deployment, is its
functional or applicative semantics. Most computing languages that
appear in <i  >Linux Journal</i> are more or less
procedural: Java and C programs instruct a processor to perform one
operation, then another, then another. Proceduralism is wrapped up
in the how of computation.</p><p>XSLT is related to Lisp in its functionality. Good XSLT
programs express the &ldquo;what&rdquo; of a desired result. Instead of a
focus on sequence-in-time, XSLT operates on whole XML documents or
well-formed fragments to yield results. This is called functional
(to evoke the model of mathematics), where functions turn inputs
into outputs without side effects or variation in time. Moreover,
mathematical functions can be composed (stacked) in combination.
Typical XSLT semantics express several different transformations
without specification of their sequence-in-time. Stylesheets are
applied simultaneously.</p><p>XSLT has variables, but they are immutable. They can receive
only one value and cannot, in particular, be looped, as in</p><pre     class="programlisting">
for (i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++);
</pre><p>Parametrized or repetitive operations are done through
explicit recursion and iteration. The syntax of XSLT variable use
is rather ugly, as it must fit within XML's constraints. In C or
Java we might write
<pre     class="programlisting">
if (level &gt; 20)
    code = 3;
else
    code = 5;
</pre>


To approximate that in XSLT, we need
<pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;xsl:variable name = "code"&gt;
     &lt;xsl:choose&gt;
         &lt;xsl:when test = "$level &amp;gt; 20"&gt;
             &lt;xsl:text&gt;3&lt;/xsl:text&gt;
         &lt;/xsl:when&gt;
         &lt;xsl:otherwise&gt;
             &lt;xsl:text&gt;5&lt;/xsl:text&gt;
         &lt;/xsl:otherwise&gt;
     &lt;/xsl:choose
&lt;/xsl:variable&gt;
</pre>


Such exercises illustrate that, while XSLT has enough abstract
power to handle general problems by itself, it's often best used in
a dual-programming mode. XSLT's strengths generally lie in template
processing, pattern matching and sorting and grouping XML elements.
Steve Ball, a principal for consultancy Zveno Pty. Ltd., does as
much as practical with XSLT, then embeds it in an application with
another language to handle interfaces to external systems,
including filesystems and user view.
</p><p>Most popular among the developers I've encountered during the
last six months are Java and Tcl, although Python, C, Perl and
other partner languages also manage XSLT engines more or less
adequately. Moreover, XSLT also defines extensibility mechanisms
that allow developers to provide new semantics within XSLT:
&ldquo;extension elements&rdquo;, &ldquo;extension functions&rdquo; and &ldquo;fallback
processing&rdquo;.</p><p>XSLT's ultimate destiny remains unclear. In this, also, it's
a bit like Java. Five years ago, Java's purpose appeared to be to
construct cute visual applets. As we've discovered since then,
heavy-duty enterprise servers actually make better hosts for the
best Java programming. We're still at an early stage in deciding
when to use XSLT. ReportLab, Inc., for example, is an enterprise
vendor that delivers products and services having to do with
high-quality report generation to some of the largest organizations
in the world, including Fidelity Investments and American Insurance
Group. ReportLab founder Andy Robinson explained to me the deep
experience his development team has in projects that transform XML.
Each project his company has fulfilled has involved coding in a
lighter-weight scripting language rather than relying on XSLT. Even
though XSLT is specialized for XML transformation, his consulting
teams have found it easier to use Python as a more general-purpose,
but powerful language.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24e2580.0x25d2808"></a>Acknowledgements</h2></div></div><p>My special thanks to Rolf Ade, who contributes both to tDOM
