    A lot of web browsers are available for Linux, and quite a
    few are pre-1.0 versions. Here's what they can do&mdash;and what
    they can't do.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d19580.0x1e11608"></a></h2></div></div><p>Since the open-source Mozilla Project
began a few years ago, the promise of a lightweight, reliable,
standards-compliant browser for Linux has loomed on the horizon.
This article looks at seven Linux web browsers currently under
development and documents how well they performed several browsing
tasks.
</p><p>All of the browsers worked well and were stable, but there
were some disappointing test results, such as the inability to
print a range of pages. As all of these browsers are still under
development, there is hope that these types of problems will be
fixed soon.</p><p>The browser versions covered in this article are:
Beonex-Communicator 0.7-dev-2, BrowseX-1.5.0, Galeon-1.0.1,
Konqueror-2.2.1, Mozilla-0.9.6, Opera-5.0-static and
SkipStone-0.7.7. SkipStone and Konqueror were compiled from source,
the others were installed as RPM packages. Due to the rapid
development of these browsers and the production schedule inherent
in a monthly publication, these versions probably will not be the
latest by the time you read this.</p><p>The system running the browsers was a Red Hat 6.2
installation on a Pentium 133MHz computer with 80MB of RAM. GNOME
1.4 and KDE 2.2.1 also were installed, along with the CUPS-1.1.5
printing system.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d19580.0x1e11818"></a>The Tests</h2></div></div><p>The tests that the browsers were put through were meant to
determine how well they performed tasks such as browsing,
downloading files and printing. The tests and results are
summarized in Table 1, and the actual tests are explained
below.</p><p><a href="5413t1.html" target="_self">Table 1. Browser Test
Results</a></p><p><a href="5413s1.html" target="_self">Table Key and Notes</a></p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Web Banking: this test determined if a browser
could log in to my bank's web banking system and view account
data.</p></li><li><p>PayPal: each browser had to sign in to PayPal
(<a href="http://www.paypal.com" target="_self">www.paypal.com</a>), view
account balances and transfer money from the PayPal account.</p></li><li><p>Encryption: the SSL Check page at Fortify.net
(<a href="http://www.fortify.net/sslcheck.html" target="_self">www.fortify.net/sslcheck.html</a>)
was used to determine the strength of each browser's
encryption.</p></li><li><p>My eBay: passing this test involved signing in to
eBay (<a href="http://www.ebay.com" target="_self">www.ebay.com</a>) using
the Sign In option and viewing multiple pages within My eBay
without having to sign in again.</p></li><li><p>Create an eBay Auction: each browser had to
successfully create a new eBay auction that consisted of the
following steps: clicking on the Sell button, selecting a category,
allowing the sell-item form to be filled out and processing the
form when the Continue button was clicked. Early Mozilla-based
browsers failed this test because of the way they handled
JavaScript errors (Mozilla bug 91018), but this appears to have
been fixed.</p></li><li><p>iPrint: the iPrint site
(<a href="http://www.iprint.com" target="_self">www.iprint.com</a>) allows
the creation of business stationery with a web browser. To
successfully pass this test, the browser had to be able to select
business checks and edit their layout.</p></li><li><p>Printing: printing capabilities of the browsers
were tested by seeing if the browsers could print a range of pages,
print in first-page-first and first-page-last order, print in color
and grayscale, print in portrait and landscape orientations and
print a page to disk.</p></li><li><p>Save Site to Disk: this test simply involved saving
web pages to disk and then being able to view the files.</p></li><li><p>Downloading: the downloading capabilities of each
browser were tested by clicking on download links and by logging in
to FTP sites. The ability to specify external downloading
applications was also noted.</p></li><li><p>Usability Features: this category notes some
features that increase the ease of use of the browser. The
following values were possible: disable animations (it is possible
to disable GIF animations), drag-and-drop (URLs can be dragged to
the browser or to other applications from the browser), ID (the
browser's user-agent string can be changed), mouse wheel (the
browser responded to the mouse scroll wheel), one-click clear
location (the browser provided a method to clear the location text
box with one click of the mouse) and zoom (the browser had the
ability to increase and decrease the size of the text on the
displayed page).</p></li><li><p>Mail: this test indicates how each browser handled
mailto: links. It also indicates which browsers offer the ability
to launch user-defined mail programs.</p></li><li><p>Java: this test determined if the browser could run
Java applets, such as the demo programs from the Sun web site. The
Java2 package used was downloaded from Netscape's site.</p></li><li><p>Plugins: to determine the ability of the browser to
recognize Netscape plugins, specifically the Macromedia Flash
plugin, and successfully display a site that required it was the
purpose of this test.</p></li><li><p>Transparent PNG: to pass this test the browser had
to properly display a web page containing a PNG picture with a
transparent background that was created with The GIMP. The browser
that failed the test showed the picture with a black
background.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d19580.0x1e125d8"></a>Browser Details</h2></div></div><p>The Beonex Communicator is virtually identical to Mozilla in
both appearance and functionality, but it boasts security and
searching improvements. Its default Search tab, located in the
sidebar, provides more default search engines than Mozilla's, and
it allows searches to be run through several search engines at the
same time, displaying the results from all the engines. Additional
search engines can be added to the browser by going to Mozilla's
Sherlock page at
<a href="http://sherlock.mozdev.org" target="_self">sherlock.mozdev.org</a>.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="5413f1.large.jpg"><img src="5413f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Beonex-Communicator Screenshot</p></div></div>
</p><p>According to Beonex's Ben Bucksch, Beonex is targeting their
efforts toward making their browser appealing to users. The browser
is easy to install, and software such as Java can be installed from
the Beonex web site with a couple of clicks. They also have changed
the default settings, things like forced session cookies and HTTP
referrers, to more secure values. The company also tries to keep
users informed of browser exploits and problems via their web
site.</p><p>BrowseX-1.5.0 is one of the most unique browsers tested; it
is written in a combination of Tcl and C, making it resource-light.
It contains its own mail and talk/chat clients, supports HTML 3.2
and handles graphics, secure web sites and JavaScript. Another
unique feature of this browser is that it implements the TML
extension, which provides an embedded web-scripting interface to
Tcl, Perl and Python. BrowseX also can import existing Netscape
bookmarks by selecting Import Netscape Bookmarks from the
File&reg;Util menu.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="5413f2.large.jpg"><img src="5413f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>BrowseX Screenshot</p></div></div>
</p><p>The browser did have some problems with printing and with
eBay. Printing to the printer produced nothing, but printing to
disk worked. The browser displayed extra characters when rendering
eBay pages and had trouble selecting a category when creating an
auction. Drop-down lists in BrowseX don't scroll; instead they have
a More selection at the bottom of the list that displays another
panel containing more list items, much like Netscape. It was
impossible to navigate extremely long category lists in this
way.</p><p>Galeon's motto is &ldquo;The web, only the web&rdquo;, and Galeon is
meant to be only a web browser, not an all-in-one web tool. It is
based on Mozilla code and requires Mozilla to be installed before
it can be used. This was one of the first Mozilla-based browsers,
and its maturity shows in the features provided. One such feature
is the Smart Bookmarks, which have their own toolbar and allow the
user to do things such as search Freshmeat II, Google and Google's
news archive. Another nice feature is the Settings menu on the top
menubar that allows easy access to such settings as proxies,
animation control and JavaScript.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="5413f3.large.jpg"><img src="5413f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Galeon Screenshot</p></div></div>
</p><p>Galeon has a small annoyance when you are using its default
download handler. If the program is set to allow the user to pick
the download destination, the download filename is cleared when a
directory is picked. The filename has to be typed back in after
navigating to the desired directory before the file can be
saved.</p><p>Konqueror is KDE's filesystem/web browser application and is
not based upon Mozilla. The browser has unique features, including
the ability to split the window into panes, with each pane
displaying different web sites or even a web site and the contents
of a local directory. Konqueror allows Java, JavaScript and browser
identification to be controlled on a site-by-site basis. Finally, a
toolbar button (a black button with a white X) is provided to
conveniently clear the location text box.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="5413f4.large.jpg"><img src="5413f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Konqueror Screenshot</p></div></div>
</p><p>Konqueror had a couple of problems with eBay. First, clicking
on the My eBay link caused Konqueror to say it was downloading a
.DLL file, and it then displayed HTML source instead of the correct
page. When creating an auction, clicking on the Books category
always brought up the Antiques category. Clicking on other
categories worked correctly.</p><p>There is a Konqueror + Java HOWTO on
<a href="http://www.konqueror.org" target="_self">www.konqueror.org</a>
that provides information for using Java in Konqueror. Also, when
compiling KDE from source, use <b  >config shared</b>
when building OpenSSL so that the shared libraries needed by
Konqueror are created.</p><p>Mozilla is the browser that was open sourced by Netscape back
in 1998. It does not have lightweight as a design goal, and the
browser's sluggishness can be quite noticeable. According to its
web site, work is being done to speed up the code, and each new
version does seem faster than the previous one. It does support
some notable features, such as a sidebar that contains bookmarks
and search results and the ability to switch themes. It was also
one of the few browsers that could successfully print a range of
pages, but it failed at printing the last page first.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="5413f5.large.jpg"><img src="5413f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Mozilla Screenshot</p></div></div>
</p><p>Version 0.9.6 introduces a print preview function that
contains some oddities. First, the print preview is displayed in
the main browser window, and there doesn't seem to be any way to
switch back to the page display short of reloading the page. Also,
the print preview shows headers, like the page title and URL, which
do not appear when the pages are printed. Mozilla also has added
the ability to show multiple web pages in one window, with tabs
instead of a new window for each site.</p><p>If Mozilla is installed from RPMs, the Personal Security
Manager (psm) package needs to be installed so that Mozilla and
Mozilla-based browsers (e.g., Galeon and SkipStone) can handle
encrypted web pages.</p><p>Long available on Windows, Opera bills itself as the fastest
browser available. The program starts quickly and is very
responsive, but it doesn't seem to render pages significantly
faster than the other browsers. Opera for Linux is built using the
Qt toolkit, and both statically and dynamically linked versions of
the browser may be downloaded from the web site.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="5413f6.large.jpg"><img src="5413f6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Opera Screenshot</p></div></div>
</p><p>Opera shows maturity in its interface and capabilities, but
there are some things to watch out for. One large bug that cropped
up was it occasionally wouldn't erase the old page and display a
new web page, even though it insisted that it had finished loading
it. This happened frequently with Freshmeat
(<a href="http://freshmeat.net" target="_self">freshmeat.com</a>), and the
only fix was to load the requested page again. There were also
problems with printing; printing in landscape orientation produced
no output, and the browser prints in color even if grayscale is
selected. Opera 5.0 doesn't support Java or plugins, but the Opera
6 Technology Preview notes indicate that these items are available
in version 6.</p><p>Also built on Mozilla, SkipStone is younger than Galeon and
sports a sparser, though functional, interface. This browser still
has some quirks, such as there is no way to browse local
directories using the File&reg;Open menu and there are no location
histories for the Forward and Back arrows.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="5413f7.large.jpg"><img src="5413f7.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>SkipStone Screenshot</p></div></div>
</p><p>While other Mozilla-based browsers were able to create an
auction on eBay, SkipStone crashed as soon as the Continue button
was pressed.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d19580.0x1e0a468"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>Quite a few browsers are available for Linux, and the
competition seems to bring out useful features in all of them. For
the most part, all of these browsers are good enough to be used for
day-to-day browsing, but your choices may be limited depending upon
the sites you visit. Several of the programs examined are pre-1.0
versions, so there is hope that any quirks and bugs will be worked
out as development continues.</p><p><a href="5413s2.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
