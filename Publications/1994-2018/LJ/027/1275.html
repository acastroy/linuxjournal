    You installed Windows 95, and now you can't boot Linux.
    Don't panic. The fix is simple, and doesn't require removing
    Windows or Linux.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1393580.0x148b4a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>In spite of all the Linux zealots who
infect the comp.os.linux.advocacy Usenet newsgroup with cries for
the total elimination of MS-Windows&mdash;and usually Microsoft, as
well&mdash;there are many people who want to be able to switch between
Linux and Windows 95. Many users who were using
<span   class="bold"><b>LILO</b></span> to choose easily between
Windows 3.<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> and Linux installed Windows 95,
and then found that Linux would no longer boot. Some who use
<span   class="bold"><b>LOADLIN</b></span> also found that they were
in trouble.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1393580.0x148b6b8"></a>LILO</h2></div></div><p>Windows 95 follows a &ldquo;world domination&rdquo; strategy when it is
installed; it overwrites the <span   class="emphasis"><em>master boot
record</em></span> on the hard drive with one which, by default,
only boots Windows. The master boot record is essentially a very
small program that is loaded from a fixed place on the hard drive
as the first step of loading an operating system from the hard
drive. The boot record installed by old versions of MS-DOS and by
Windows 95 is very limited: it is only capable of allowing the boot
process to proceed to the single partition which is marked as the
&ldquo;active&rdquo; partition.</p><p>In contrast, the LILO loader that comes with Linux installs a
boot record which allows you to choose to continue booting from any
partition quite easily. In fact, LILO even allows you to boot from
partitions on the second drive, something that the DOS master boot
record cannot do. LILO's boot record <span   class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span>
capable of booting Windows 95.</p><p>Notice that I didn't call LILO's boot record a &ldquo;master&rdquo;
boot record. That's because while it can be installed as the master
boot record, it doesn't have to be. On each partition on your hard
drive, there is another boot record. When the DOS master boot
record boots from the active partition, it does so by loading the
boot record on the active partition. LILO's boot record can be
installed either as the master boot records on the hard drive or as
the boot record for your Linux partition.</p><p><a href="1275s1.html" target="_self">See sidebar</a></p><p>In order to use LILO, therefore, you need to either install
LILO's boot loader as the master boot loader, or install it as the
boot loader on your Linux partition and make your Linux partition
active. The advantage to installing it as the boot loader on your
Linux partition and making your Linux partition active is that the
next time you install Windows, all you will have to do to use LILO
to choose your operating system is use the DOS
<span   class="bold"><b>fdisk</b></span> program to make your Linux
partition active.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Recovery recipe:</b></span> Use an
emergency boot floppy or boot from your installation boot/root
floppy or floppy set. Get a shell prompt, probably either by
choosing it from a menu or by pressing Alt-F2 (see the
documentation for your Linux distribution if you don't know how to
get a shell prompt). Then execute the following commands:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
mkdir /mnt
mount -t ext2 /dev/<span   class="emphasis"><em>rootdevice</em></span> /mnt
/mnt/sbin/lilo -r /mnt
umount /mnt
</pre><p>This assumes that /mnt does not exist; if it already exists,
you don't need to create it.
<b  ><i><tt>rootdevice</tt></i></b> is the
name of the device that holds your root filesystem, such as hda2
(second partition of your first IDE hard drive) or sda1 (first
partition of your first SCSI hard drive). If you don't remember
which it is, you may have to use the fdisk program, which should be
included with both installation programs and emergency boot disks,
to find it. The <b  >-r /mnt</b> part means to pretend
that /mnt is your root directory. If your distribution didn't put
lilo into the /sbin directory, you may have to look for it.</p><p>At this point, you should be able to reboot with the same
options that you had before installing Windows 95.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Alternative recovery recipe:</b></span>
Again, boot from your emergency boot floppy or installation boot
floppy, but add the command-line argument
<b  >root=/dev/hda2</b> or
<b  >root=/dev/sda1</b> or whatever partition is your
root partition. This should eventually look as if you just booted
off the hard drive normally. Now, simply log in as root and run the
<b  >lilo</b> command. You should now have the same
booting options you had before you installed Windows 95.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Recipe to avoid future disaster with
LILO:</b></span> In your /etc/lilo.conf file, change
<b  >boot=/dev/hda</b> or
<b  >boot=/dev/sda</b> to point to the primary partition
which holds your boot images. This is important on large hard
drives; you may have partitions which use disk space that is not
part of the first gigabyte on the disk, and that, as you probably
know, is inaccessible to the BIOS which starts the bootstrap
process. With your <b  >boot=/dev/hda3</b> or
<b  >boot=/dev/sda4</b> statement in place in
/etc/lilo.conf, run the lilo command. This will install the LILO
boot sector on the partition named in the <b  >boot=</b>
statement.</p><p>Now, use the fdisk program to make the Linux partition on
which you just installed the boot sector the active partition. You
can do this either with the Linux fdisk program or with the DOS
fdisk program.</p><p>Now, the next time you have to re-install Windows 95 because
your .INI files are hopelessly messed up, or Windows 95 refuses to
run for no reason, you will be able to boot Linux just by running
the DOS/Windows fdisk program and making the Linux partition the
active partition. Reboot, and LILO will be working again.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1393580.0x148c268"></a>LOADLIN</h2></div></div><p>If you are willing to boot DOS in order to boot Linux, you
can use the LOADLIN program. In some cases, this is actually the
best way to boot Linux. In particular, some sound cards will work
under Linux only if they are first initialized under DOS.</p><p>Some people who were using LOADLIN to start up Linux from the
DOS prompt have discovered that after installing Windows 95, they
can't bring up a DOS command prompt window and boot Linux from
there&mdash;and it is no fun to reboot into DOS in order to finally get
into Linux. Perhaps you are one of those people.</p><p>As you have discovered, LOADLIN has some limitations. For
example, you can't use it to boot Linux while you are running
Windows. Even if you aren't running Windows, if you are using an
extended memory manager, it must support VCPI in order for LOADLIN
to work. However, these constraints don't cause problems if you run
it from a CONFIG.SYS menu item. If menu support hasn't been added,
your entire CONFIG.SYS file might look something like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
DEVICE=C:\DOS\HIMEM.SYS
DEVICE=C:\DOS\EMM386.EXE
FILES=40
DOS=HIGH,UMB
</pre><p>Let's call that your <b  >DOS</b> section. You will
also need a <b  >LINUX</b> section, and you will need to
be able to choose between them. In order to cause DOS to allow you
to choose between them while booting, you will need a
<b  >MENU</b> section. The result looks like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
[MENU]
MENUITEM=DOS, Boot DOS
MENUITEM=LINUX, Boot Linux
[DOS]
DEVICE=C:\DOS\HIMEM.SYS
DEVICE=C:\DOS\EMM386.EXE
FILES=40
DOS=HIGH,UMB
[LINUX]
REM Here is where you would load a driver for
REM a sound card that is not completely
REM supported by Linux.
SHELL=c:\LOADLIN\LOADLIN.exe @c:\LOADLIN\params
</pre><p>The <b  >@c:\LOADLIN\params</b> means that the boot
arguments for the kernel are kept in the file c:\LOADLIN\params.
This file might look like:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
root=/dev/hda2
ro
</pre><p>The documentation that accompanies LOADLIN explains this in
much more detail, but you are likely to find this explanation
sufficient to start using LOADLIN under most circumstances.</p><p>Many distributions include a copy of LOADLIN. You can also
ftp a copy of LOADLIN from tsx-11.mit.edu in the directory
/pub/linux/dos_utils/ in the file LOADLIN15.tar.gz.</p></div></div>
