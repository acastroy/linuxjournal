    A look at several of the more flexible filters, probrams
    that read some input, perform some operation on it, and
    write the altered data as output.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x208e580.0x21862f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>One of the basic philosophies of Linux
(as with all flavours of Unix) is that each program does one
particular task, and does it well. Often you combine several
programs to achieve something, either at the shell prompt or in a
script, by piping the output of one program into the next. I'm
talking about things like</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ls -l | more
</pre><p>and</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ps -auxw | \
  grep netscape &gt;&gt; people.who.should.be.working
</pre><p>But what if the output of one program isn't in the format
needed for the next? We need some way of processing the output of
one program so that it is ready for the next.</p><p>Fortunately, there are many Linux programs that do this job:
read some input, perform some operations on it, and write the
altered data as the output. These programs are called filters. Some
filters do quite limited tasks, such as head, grep and sort,
whereas others are more flexible, such as sed and awk. In this
article, we're going to look at several of these more flexible
filters, and give several examples of what can be done with
them.</p><p>The name &ldquo;sed&rdquo; is a contraction of <span   class="emphasis"><em>stream
editor</em></span>; sed applies editing commands to a stream of
data. A common use for sed is to replace one text pattern with
another, as in</p><pre     class="programlisting">
sed 's/Fred/Barney/g' foo
</pre><p>This command takes the file foo, changes every occurrence of
<b  >Fred</b> to <b  >Barney</b>, and writes
the modified version to standard output.</p><p>Note that in this example we have placed the actual sed
commands inside single quotes. Sed doesn't require that commands be
quoted this way, but you will need to use quotes if the sed command
includes characters that are special to the shell, such as
<b  >$</b> or <b  >*</b>. This example doesn't
have any special characters, so we could just as easily have left
out the quotes. Try it and see.</p><p>Without the input file foo, sed reads from standard input, so
we could achieve the same result with the command</p><pre     class="programlisting">
sed 's/Fred/Barney/g' &lt; foo
</pre><p>or</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cat foo | sed 's/Fred/Barney/g'
</pre><p>Note that the first two versions are generally preferred to
the third. Using cat just to send input into a pipe creates an
extra process which can often be avoided.</p><p>We also have to consider the output. By default, the results
appear on standard output, but this isn't always what we want. One
option is to pipe the output through a pager, for example</p><pre     class="programlisting">
sed 's/Fred/Barney/g' foo | more
</pre><p>or to redirect it to a file</p><pre     class="programlisting">
sed 's/Fred/Barney/g' foo &gt; bar
</pre><p>While it is often tempting to write</p><pre     class="programlisting">
sed 's/Fred/Barney/g' foo &gt; foo
</pre><p>the only thing this achieves is to delete contents of the
file foo! Why? Because the first thing the shell does with this
command is to open the file foo for output, destroying what was
there already. When it tries to read from foo, there is nothing
there to read. The result is an empty file. This is an easy mistake
to make when redirecting output in this way, so do be
careful.</p><p>Awk is a bit more flexible than sed; it is a full-fledged
programming language in its own right. However, don't let that put
you off. Writing simple programs in awk is surprisingly easy, and
it often doesn't feel like a programming language [See page 46 of
<i  >Linux Journal</i> issue 25, May 1996&mdash;ED]. For
example, the command</p><pre     class="programlisting">
awk '{print NR, $0}' foo
</pre><p>prints the file foo, numbering each line as it goes. Awk can
also read its input from a pipe or from standard input, exactly
like sed, and also writes on standard output, unless you redirect
it. The bit between the quotes (which are necessary, since the
<b  >{}</b> characters are also special characters to the
shell) is the awk program. I said they can be simple, didn't I? An
awk program is simply a sequence of one or more pattern-action
statements, in the form</p><pre     class="programlisting">
pattern { action }
</pre><p>Each input line is tested against each pattern in turn. When
an input line matches a pattern, the corresponding action is
performed. Either the pattern may be empty, in which case every
line matches, or the action may be empty, in which case the default
action is to print the line.</p><p>In the example above, the pattern was empty, so every line
matched. The action was to print <b  >NR</b>, which is a
built-in awk variable containing the number of lines read so far,
and then print <b  >$0</b>, which is the current
line.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x208e580.0x2187058"></a>Going On</h2></div></div><p>Now that we've seen the basic idea behind sed and awk, we're
going to look at some examples. The best way to learn something is
to actually do it, and I recommend that you try out some of these
examples yourself as you go along, possibly even with one eye on
the man pages. We certainly aren't going to cover everything that
sed and awk can do, but you will, it is hoped, have more confidence
to try things out yourself once you've finished reading this
article.</p><p>Our first example is to remove all the spaces from a
document. This is easily achieved using sed:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
sed 's/ *//g' foo
</pre><p>This is like the earlier example with Fred and Barney, only
here we have used a regular expression: <b  >' *'</b>
(the quotes are included so that you can see the space that is part
of the regular expression). sed's <b  >s</b> (for
substitute) command using regular expressions just like grep. The
regexp <b  >' *'</b> matches one or more spaces, which
are replaced with <span   class="emphasis"><em>nothing</em></span>&mdash;they are deleted.
This command doesn't deal with tabs, as it stands, but you could
modify it to match one or more occurences of either a tab or a
space:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
sed 's/[ {tab}][ {tab}]*//g' foo
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x208e580.0x2187420"></a>Double Spacing</h2></div></div><p>Next, we'll think about doublespacing a text file. We can do
this using sed's substitute command by replacing
<b  >$</b> (the regexp for the end of a line) with a
newline character (which we have to quote with a backslash)</p><pre     class="programlisting">
sed 's/$/\
/' foo
</pre><p>Note that in this example, there isn't a <b  >g</b>
before the second quote, unlike all the earlier examples. The
<b  >g</b> is used to tell sed that the substitution
applies to all matches on each line, not just the first match on
each line, which is the default behaviour. In this case, since each
line only has one end, we don't need the
<b  >g</b>.</p><p>Another way of doing this in sed would be:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
sed G foo
</pre><p>If you look at the man page for sed, it says that
<b  >G</b> &ldquo;appends a newline character followed by the
contents of the hold space to the pattern space&rdquo;. The pattern
space is the sed term for the line currently being read, and we
don't need to worry about the hold space for now (trust me, it will
be empty), so this command does exactly what we want.</p><p>It's quite easy to doublespace in awk, using the print
statement we saw earlier:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
awk '{print $0; print ""}' foo
</pre><p>Here, the pattern is empty again, matching every line, and
the action is to print the entire line, <b  >$0</b>, then
to print nothing, <b  >""</b>. Each
<b  >print</b> statement starts a new line, so the
combined effect of the two commands is to doublespace the
file.</p><p>Awk actions can (and often do) involve more than one command
in this way, but it isn't strictly necessary here. Awk provides a
formatted print statement that gives more control over the output
than the basic <b  >print</b> statement. So we could get
the same result with:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
awk '{printf("%s\n\n",$0)}' foo
</pre><p>The first argument to the <b  >printf</b> statement
is the <span   class="emphasis"><em>format</em></span>, a description of how the output
should appear. The format can contain characters to be printed
literally (none in this example), escape sequences (such as
<b  >\n</b> for a newline), and
<span   class="emphasis"><em>specifications</em></span>. A specification is a sequence
of characters beginning with a % that controls how the rest of the
arguments are printed. For each of the second and subsequent
arguments, there must be a specification. In this example, there is
one specification, <b  >%s</b>, which prints a character
string. The value associated with that specification is
<b  >$0</b>; the entire line. Unlike
<b  >print</b>, <b  >printf</b> doesn't
automatically start a new line, so two <b  >\n</b>'s are
needed: one to end the original line and one to insert a blank
line.</p><p>For this seemingly simple example&mdash;doublespacing a file&mdash;we
came up with four different solutions. There is always more than
one way of solving a problem, and it normally doesn't matter which
one you take. The point is that you usually write an awk or sed
program to do a particular task as the need arises, then discard
it. You don't necessarily want the &ldquo;best&rdquo; solution (whatever that
means), you just want something that works, and you want it
quickly.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x208e580.0x217e808"></a>Being Selective</h2></div></div><p>Another quite common task is to select just part of the
input. Suppose we want the fifth line of the file foo. In awk, this
would be</p><pre     class="programlisting">
awk 'NR==5' foo
</pre><p>which prints the line when <b  >NR</b>, the number
of lines read so far, equals 5. The sed equivalent is</p><pre     class="programlisting">
sed -n 5p foo
</pre><p>By default, sed prints every line of input after all commands
have been applied. The <b  >-n</b> option suppresses this
behaviour, so we only get the line we specifically ask for with the
<b  >p</b> command. In this case, we asked for the fifth
line, but we could just as easily specified a range of lines, say
the third to the fifth, with:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
sed -n 3,5p foo
</pre><p>or, in awk</p><pre     class="programlisting">
awk 'NR&gt;=3 &amp;&amp; NR&lt;=5' foo
</pre><p>In the awk version, the <b  >&amp;&amp;</b> means
&ldquo;and&rdquo;, so we want the lines where <b  >NR&gt;=3</b>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span> <b  >NR&lt;=5</b>, that is, the
third through the fifth lines.</p><p>Yet another approach would be to combine head and tail</p><pre     class="programlisting">
head -5 foo | tail -3
</pre><p>which uses the head program to get the first 5 lines of the
file, and the tail program to only pass the last three lines
through.</p><p>Yet another common problem is removing only the first line.
Remember how the <b  >$</b> character means the end of
the line when it is used in a regular expression? Well, when you
use it to specify a line number, it means the last line:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
sed -n '2,$p' foo
</pre><p>In awk, you can use <b  >!=</b> or
<b  >&gt;</b> to get the same result from either of these
commands:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
awk 'NR&gt;1' foo
awk 'NR!=1' foo
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x208e580.0x217f1a8"></a>When Line Numbers Are Not Enough</h2></div></div><p>Selecting part of a file using line numbers is easy enough to
do, but often you don't know the line numbers you want. Instead,
you want to select lines based on their contents. In awk, we can
easily select a line matching a pattern, with</p><pre     class="programlisting">
awk '/<span   class="emphasis"><em>regexp</em></span>/' foo
</pre><p>Which causes all lines containing
<b  ><i><tt>regexp</tt></i></b> to be printed.
There is a direct sed equivalent of this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
sed -n '/<span   class="emphasis"><em>regexp</em></span>/p' foo
</pre><p>Of course, we can also use grep to do this kind of
thing:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
grep '<span   class="emphasis"><em>regexp</em></span>' foo
</pre><p>but sed can also handle ranges easily. For example, to get
all lines of a file up to and including the first line matching a
regexp, you would type:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
sed -n '1,/<span   class="emphasis"><em>regexp</em></span>/p' foo
</pre><p>or to get all lines including and after the first line
matching regexp:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
sed -n '/<span   class="emphasis"><em>regexp</em></span>/,$p' foo
</pre><p>Remember that $ means the last line in a file. You can also
specify a range based on two regexps. Try</p><pre     class="programlisting">
sed -n '/<span   class="emphasis"><em>regexp1</em></span>/,/<span   class="emphasis"><em>regexp2</em></span>/p' foo
</pre><p>Note that this prints all blocks starting with lines
containing <b  ><i><tt>regexp1</tt></i></b>
through lines containing
<b  ><i><tt>regexp2</tt></i></b>, not just the
first one. If there isn't a matching
<b  ><i><tt>regexp2</tt></i></b> for a line
containing <b  ><i><tt>regexp1</tt></i></b>,
then we get all lines through to the end of the file.</p><p>Now we can select some part of the input, based on a regular
expression.</p><p>We might want to delete some lines that contain a certain
pattern. The <b  >d</b> command does just that:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
sed '/<span   class="emphasis"><em>regexp</em></span>/d' foo
</pre><p>deletes all lines that match the regexp. Or, we might want to
delete a block of text:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
sed '/<span   class="emphasis"><em>regexp1</em></span>/,/<span   class="emphasis"><em>regexp2</em></span>/d' foo
</pre><p>deletes everything from a line that contains
<b  ><i><tt>regexp1</tt></i></b>, up to and
including a line that matches
<b  ><i><tt>regexp2</tt></i></b>. Again, sed
will select all blocks of text delimited by
<b  ><i><tt>regexp1</tt></i></b> and
<b  ><i><tt>regexp2</tt></i></b>, so there is
a danger we could delete more than we want to.</p><p>Inserting text at a given point is possible, too. The
command</p><pre     class="programlisting">
sed '/<span   class="emphasis"><em>regexp</em></span>/r bar' foo
</pre><p>inserts the contents of the file bar after any line that
matches the <b  ><i><tt>regexp</tt></i></b> in
the file foo.</p><p>Now, we can combine these last two commands to replace a
block of text in a file with the contents of another file. We do it
like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
sed -e '/START/r bar' -e '/START/,/END/d' foo
</pre><p>This finds a line containing <b  >START</b>,
deletes through to a line containing <b  >END</b>, then
reads in the contents of the file bar. Because the
<b  >r</b> command doesn't read in the file until the
next input line is read, the <b  >d</b> command is
executed before the new text is read in, so the
<b  >d</b> command doesn't delete the new text, as one
might expect, looking at this command. The <b  >-e</b>
option tells sed that the next argument is a command, rather than
an input file. Although it is optional when there is only one
command, if we have multiple commands, they must each be preceded
with <b  >-e</b>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x208e580.0x2493df8"></a>Columns</h2></div></div><p>These examples have mostly been line oriented, but we are
just as likely to want to deal with columns of data. The filter
<span   class="bold"><b>cut</b></span> can select columns of data.
For example, to list the real names of all the users on your
system, you could type</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cut -f5 -d: /etc/passwd
The <b  >5</b> argument after <b  >-f</b> tells cut to list the
fifth column (where real names are stored), and the <b  >-d</b>
flag is used to tell cut which character delimits the
field&mdash;in the case of the password file, it's a colon. To get
both the username (which is in the first column) and the real
name, we could use
</pre><pre     class="programlisting">
cut -f1,5 -d: /etc/passwd
</pre><p>Awk is also good at getting at columns of data, we could do
these tasks with the following awk commands:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
awk -F: '{print $5}' /etc/passwd
</pre><p>and</p><pre     class="programlisting">
awk -F: '{print $1,$5}' /etc/passwd
</pre><p>where the <b  >-F</b> flag tells awk what character
the fields are delimited by. (Do you see the difference between
using cut and using awk for printing more than one field? If not,
try running the commands again and looking more closely.)</p><p>One advantage of using awk is that we can perform operations
on the columns.</p><p>For example, if we want to find out how much disk space the
files in the current directory take up, we could total up the fifth
column of the output of <b  >ls -l</b>:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ls -l | grep -v '^d' | \
  awk '{s += $5} END {print s}'
</pre><p>In this command, we use grep to remove any lines that begin
with <b  >d</b>, so we don't count directories. We chose
grep, but we could just as easily have used awk or sed to do this.
One pure awk solution could be:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ls -l | awk '! /^d/ {s += $5} END {print s}'
</pre><p>where the awk program only totals the fifth column of lines
that don't begin with a <b  >d</b>&mdash;the exclamation mark
before the pattern tells awk to select lines which
<span   class="emphasis"><em>don't</em></span> match the regular expression
<b  >/^d/</b>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x208e580.0x24946e8"></a>Working with Filenames</h2></div></div><p>Often, many files have the same basic name, but different
extensions. For example, suppose we have a TeX file foo.tex. Then
we could very well have associated files foo.aux, foo.bib, foo.dvi,
foo.ps, foo.idx, foo.log, etc. You might want a script to be able
to process these files, given the name of the file foo.tex. The
basename utility:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
basename foo.tex .tex
</pre><p>will give you the basic name <b  >foo</b>. If we
have a shell variable containing the name of the TeX file, we might
use</p><pre     class="programlisting">
basename ${TEXFILE} .tex
</pre><p>Again, there is more than way of getting the basename of a
file: you could do this in sed using:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
echo ${TEXFILE} | sed 's/.tex$//'
</pre><p>Whichever approach we take, we can construct the name of the
other files once we know the basic name. For example, we can get
the name of the log file by:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
LOGFILE=`basename ${TEXFILE} .tex`.log
</pre><p>This is very useful: I use vi for most of my editing, and it
allows you to get at the name of the file currently being edited in
a macro; <b  >%</b> is replaced with the filename. If I'm
editing a TeX file foo.tex, and I want to preview the dvi file
using xdvi, I can transform <b  >%</b> (let's call it
foo.tex) into <b  >foo.dvi</b> automatically in a
macro</p><pre     class="programlisting">
:!xdvi `basename % .tex`.dvi &amp;
</pre><p>I can bind this to a function key and never worry about the
name of the dvi file when I want to view it, by adding this line to
my .exrc file:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
map ^R :!xdvi `basename % .tex`.dvi &amp;^M^M
</pre><p>The <b  >^R</b> and <b  >^M</b>
characters are added by typing Control-V Control-R and Control-V
Control-M, respectively, assuming you are editing your .exrc file
with vi.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x208e580.0x2494e20"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>In this article, we have looked at the some of the tools
available in Linux for filtering text. We have seen how using these
filters we can manipulate the output of one command so it is in a
more convenient form to be used as the input for another program or
to be read by a human. This kind of task arises naturally in a lot
of shell-based work, both in scripts and on the command line, so it
is a handy skill to have. Although the man pages for sed and awk
can be a little cryptic, solutions to problems can often be very
simple. With a little practice, you can do quite a lot.</p></div></div>
