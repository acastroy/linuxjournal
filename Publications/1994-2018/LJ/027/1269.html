journal. It's my second subscription to <i  >LJ</i>, and it won't be the
last. I found the XForms review and tutorial so interesting that I
decided to test it and will, perhaps, even use it at work. I enjoy
reading tutorials and explanations about the Linux kernel (thanks a
lot to Michael K. Johnson and all the staff of <i  >Linux Journal</i>).</p><p>You try to spread the Linux enthusiasm everywhere. It's a
success. Thank you.</p><p>Eric Bouchut</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x200d580.0x21053f8"></a>Typos in The Devil's in the Details</h2></div></div><p>Juergen Schmidt, an attentive reader, reported a few errors
in the third Kernel Korner article about device drivers,
co-authored by Georg van Zezchwitz and myself. The errors are my
fault, due to the limited time I had to revise the article.</p><p>The code printed within the article comes from a real driver,
and it is known to run, but sometimes, I forgot to substitute the
name of a symbol while copying from the real driver to the
article's text.</p><p>So, <b  >Skel_Board</b> (the structure) should read
as <b  >Skel_Hw</b>; <b  >hwp</b> (the pointer)
is equivalent to <b  >board</b> (replace either one with
the other); in <b  >skel_select</b>,
<b  >file</b> (the <b  >struct file</b>
pointer) should read <b  >filp</b>.</p><p>I'm sorry for these inconsistencies, and I hope they didn't
cause headaches to the readers.</p><p>&mdash;Alessandro Rubini

1996, page 49.</p><p>1) Figure 3 is a duplicate of Figure 2. This is my fault. I
submitted it this way. Obviously, cut-and-paste from one xterm to
another can either be your friend or your enemy. I must have copied
from the wrong window. The correct contents for the figure are
shown here:</p><pre     class="programlisting">

</p><p>I've squeezed that down. Please use a condensed courier font
to make it fit, or somehow make it a wide inline figure.</p><p>2) Several of the ipfwadm commands on page 58 have an
additional character within the command line. The character is a
right angle bracket, and this could cause some undesirable side
effects if typed in that way.</p><p>3) The sentence on page 53 &ldquo;ipfw only supports the deny and
accept policies, not reject.&rdquo; should be corrected to, &ldquo;ipfw only
supports the deny and accept policies for its output. A rule set to
reject will still show up as deny.&rdquo;</p><p>&mdash;Chris Kostick

heard talking about the fact that Linux was installed on a computer
on board the spacecraft. A few weeks later, the computer's function
was disclosed. The software in use was X-based software developed
under Digital Unix and ported to Linux so that it could be used on
board the shuttle. Astronaut Ron Parise said in an e-mail message
to fellow amateur radio operators:</p><p>Pat, et al.:</p><p>Linux was installed on one of the IBM Thinkpads that are
usually flown on the shuttle. This was in support of the tether
experiments. Since the ground-based applications to control those
experiments ran on a DEC Alpha it was easy to just port them to a
Linux system for on-board use.</p><p>73's, Ron WA4SIR</p></div></div>
