    A few months ago, Chris concluded an article on building a
    Linux firewall with an allusion to Linux's ability to hide
    an entire network behind a single IP address&mdash;called IP
    masquerading.  This month, he explains how to enable and
    configure IP masquerading, also known as Network Address
    Translation, for Linux.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a39580.0x2b31500"></a></h2></div></div><p>It seems everyone wants on the Internet
nowadays, and for good reason. There is plenty of information to
obtain, people to send e-mail to, web pages to look at and software
to download. Besides that, businesses are finding acceptable means
of advertising, and in some cases, selling merchandise. But with
all the rush to get on the Internet, people are finding Internet
addresses are not as readily available as they once were. Some
network administrators are experiencing that in many environments;
they don't have enough network addresses to meet the demand.
</p><p>Instead of going through the motions of obtaining another
block or two of class C addresses, some administrators hide a set
of unregistered addresses behind a network address translation
(NAT) device. The Internet is prepared for these &ldquo;private&rdquo;
addresses, and blocks of addresses are reserved for this purpose.
RFC 1597 specifies the addresses 10.0.0.0 through 10.255.255.255,
172.16.0.0 through 172.31.255.255, and 192.168.0.0 through
192.168.255.255 to be used in these instances.</p><p>The RFC strongly recommends that if you, as a network
administrator, are going to use a private address, you should
select addresses from the ranges given. One notably important
reason is that if a packet happens to pass through the NAT with its
original IP address intact, the backbone routers on the Internet
will not forward the packet. If, instead, you were using someone
else's valid IP address, confusion could occur.</p><p>Many firewalls, especially those based on application proxy
gateways, naturally hide addresses because of how they function. It
is no surprise that Linux can also support address hiding through
what is called &ldquo;IP masquerading&rdquo;. Setting up masquerading under
Linux is not terribly difficult, but there are some subtleties to
point out.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a39580.0x2b31710"></a>Getting Ready</h2></div></div><p>If you are running kernel version 1.2.x, you need to obtain
the kernel patch to support masquerading. The patch is available
from ftp://ftp.eves.com/pub/masq, or you can download everything
you need from
<a href="http://www.indyramp.com/masq/" target="_self">www.indyramp.com/masq/</a>.
IP masquerading is supported with 1.3.x kernel versions. For this
article, I was running version 1.3.56, and all examples are based
on this version. For FTP support (mentioned later), you need to
have at least kernel version 1.3.37. There is a patch for
1.2.<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> (where <span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> &gt;= 4)
kernels to support FTP, but I haven't tested it yet. The
masqplus-0.4 &ldquo;jumbo&rdquo; patch that is available from Indyramp fixes
a few bugs and adds support for FTP, RealAudio, and fragmentation
for 1.2.13 kernels.</p><p>When configuring the kernel to support masquerading, it is
important to also say yes to firewall and forwarding support. Here
are the parameters I used for configuring my kernel:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Network firewalls (CONFIG_FIREWALL) [Y/n/?] y
Network aliasing (CONFIG_NET_ALIAS) [Y/n/?] y
TCP/IP networking (CONFIG_INET) [Y/n/?] y
IP: forwarding/gatewaying (CONFIG_IP_FORWARD) [Y/n/?] y
IP: multicasting (CONFIG_IP_MULTICAST) [Y/n/?] y
IP: firewalling (CONFIG_IP_FIREWALL) [Y/n/?] y
IP: accounting (CONFIG_IP_ACCT) [Y/n/?] y
IP: tunneling (CONFIG_NET_IPIP) [Y/m/n/?] y
eP: firewall packet logging (CONFIG_IP_FIREWALL_VERBOSE) [Y/n/?] y
IP: masquerading (ALPHA) (CONFIG_IP_MASQUERADE) [Y/n/?] y
</pre><p>I chose other items not directly related to masquerading such
as multicast and tunneling, but I like to have fun.</p><p>Notice the IP masquerading software is still considered to be
Alpha-quality. This means there are probably still some bugs. The
base functionality is there, but not all of the nuances of TCP,
UDP, and IP, nor the application protocols, have been thoroughly
tested. In addition, the interface may still change as development
proceeds.</p><p>In order to manipulate the masquerading ruleset, you will
need the <b  >ipfw</b> software version 1.3.6-BETA3, or
you can obtain a precompiled binary from ftp.eves.com. Those who
use Linux as a filtering firewall and also use
<b  >ipfwadm</b> should note that software does not yet
support IP masquerading, so ipfw is necessary. [New: ipfwadm
2.0beta2, now available for Linux 1.3.66 and newer from
ftp://ftp.xos.nl/pub/linux/ipfwadm/,
<span   class="bold"><b>does</b></span> support masquerading. Also,
it is necessary to use recent versions of ipfwadm with the most
recent versions of the kernel due to interface changes&mdash;ED]</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a39580.0x2b31be0"></a>Applying the Rules</h2></div></div><p>Let's first define what we're trying to accomplish and see
how IP masquerading is useful in the environment.
<a href="1238f1.html" target="_self">Figure 1</a> shows the networks on
which the examples are based. deathstar is the Linux machine
employing masquerading in order to hide the network
192.168.1.0.</p><p>Masquerading is useful in our architecture because it saves
us a little administrative hassle. A number of people in my
department have home LANs, and through their PPP connection they
can use their other machines to connect to the department lab. We
could easily run a routing protocol, like RIP, to make the machines
on the lab network aware of the home LANs, but that would take some
coordination about who has what network address. It is easier (for
us) to use masquerading.</p><p>To hide the network, we can issue the command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# ipfw a m all from 192.168.1.0/24 to 0.0.0.0/0
</pre><p>This rule indicates that we want to
<span   class="bold"><b>a</b></span>dd a
<span   class="bold"><b>m</b></span>asquerading rule for
<span   class="bold"><b>all</b></span> protocols (which in this case
means TCP and UDP). The network we are hiding is 192.168.1.0, and
we are hiding connections going to any network (0.0.0.0/0). The /24
indicates we are applying a 24-bit netmask, or 255.255.255.0. Since
we specified the network as 192.168.1.0, deathstar will masquerade
for all hosts on the network. That's all we need to do.</p><p>If I had only wanted deathstar to masquerade for enterprise,
then I would have typed in:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# ipfw a m all from 192.168.1.2/32 to 0.0.0.0/0
</pre><p>But what does it really mean &ldquo;to masquerade for&rdquo;? Well,
let's examine the affected files and kernel tables for a typical
masqueraded connection. We'll use telnet for our example.</p><p>Let's verify the rule has been set. We need to look at the
ip_forward file in the /proc/net directory. We can use ipfw to do
this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# ipfw -n list forward
Type    Proto       From           To     Ports
(masqueradeall  192.168.1.0/24  anywhere
</pre><p>This is good. Some administrators mistakenly look in the
/proc/net/ip_masquerade file for the rule and when they don't see
it, confusion sets in.</p><p>For our example, I've started a telnet session from warbird
to enterprise. Also, on mccoy, I'm using the tcpdump program to
monitor the traffic on 20.2.51.0 and sparcbook to monitor the
traffic on 192.168.1.0. We can now look at the ip_masquerade file
to examine what is happening (see <a href="1238l1.html" target="_self">Listing
1</a>).</p><p>Let's decode this stuff. First, the earliest packet is at the
bottom. It is a DNS request (therefore UDP) from 192.168.1.2 to
20.2.51.2. mccoy is warbird's DNS server in this case. The Masq
column shows us the port on deathstar that is used for the
masquerading. For the first DNS request, it is port 60000 (EA60).
After the DNS resolution, the TCP connection is established on the
next available port over 60000, 60001.
<a href="1238f2.html" target="_self">Figure 2</a> illustrates the protocol
time-line for the sequence of events up to the TCP open.</p><p>Even though the protocol time-line shows how the packets
really traverse, the sending and receiving nodes are unaware of
this. Hence, the reason they call it masquerading. From warbird's
point of view, the traffic will look exactly as expected. That is,
packets from enterprise are repackaged by deathstar to look as if
they came from enterprise. <a href="1238l2.html" target="_self">Listing
2</a> shows the tcpdump output of the traffic on the
192.168.1.0 network for the telnet session.</p><p><a href="1238l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3</a> shows the protocol
traffic on the 20.2.51.0 network during the telnet session. Notice
that information originates from deathstar, not warbird. (Another
thing you might notice is I don't keep the clocks synchronized very
well.)</p><p>Another important aspect is maintaining the TCP
synchronization numbers. For masquerading to work properly,
deathstar must keep the synchronization correct. The TCP sequence
number generated by warbird is forwarded by deathstar rather than a
new sequence number being generated.</p><p>Some final observations about the contents of the
/proc/net/ip_masquerade file pertain to the last four fields. The
<b  >Init-seq</b>, <b  >Delta</b>, and
<b  >PDelta</b> fields deal with the TCP synchronization
numbers when ftp data transfers (more in a minute) occur, and the
last field is the expiration timer on the masquerade entry. The
time is kept in hundredths of seconds; TCP is given 90000 or 15
minutes, and UDP is given 300000 or 5 minutes. As long as traffic
is being passed between the two communicating hosts for the masked
port, the timer will remain updated. A minor detail about the
expiration timer has to do with FTP transfers. FTP uses two
connections: a control connection for commands and a data
connection for a file transfer. While the data connection is in use
for data movement, the control connection will sit idle. If the
transfer takes longer than 15 minutes, the masquerading host will
close the control connection. The data connection will go to
completion, but you will have to reconnect if you want to get more
files. This is controlled by the definitions:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#define MASQUERADE_EXPIRE_TCP     15*60*HZ
#define MASQUERADE_EXPIRE_TCP_FIN  2*60*HZ
#define MASQUERADE_EXPIRE_UDP      5*60*HZ
</pre><p>in the file /usr/include/linux/ip_fw.h. Six hours (360
minutes) seems to be a relatively acceptable timeout value, but
change it as you see fit.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a39580.0x2b326e0"></a>Problems</h2></div></div><p>Not all protocols work with IP masquerading. ICMP messages
(such as those used by ping) will not be passed through the
masquerading host. Also, application protocols that pass their
address to the receiving host will not work. The
<b  >talk</b> program is an example of this.</p><p>A major exception to the applications that don't work is
<b  >ftp</b>. The IP masquerading software has been
written to handle file transfers as of kernel version 1.3.37. FTP
clients, under normal operation, will send the server the address
and port number to which the server should connect for a transfer.
This shouldn't work with masquerading for the same reasons that
talk fails. However, the IP masquerading software will intercept
the FTP PORT command and masquerade as the client host awaiting for
the server to connect to it.</p><p>The biggest problem is the most subtle one: IP fragmentation.
Fragmentation occurs automatically within the Internet Protocol. IP
always wants to fit a datagram in the frame size of the network
link it is transmitting over. Most data links define a Maximum
Transmission Unit (MTU) of information that will fit within one
frame. If the IP datagram to be sent out can't all fit into the MTU
size of the frame, it will be fragmented.</p><p>An IP datagram carrying a TCP segment is structured like the
&ldquo;Original Datagram&rdquo; illustration in
<a href="1238f3.html" target="_self">Figure 3</a>. After fragmentation, the
new datagrams appear (also shown in <a href="1238f3.html" target="_self">Figure
3</a>). The most important aspect to notice is the placement of
the TCP header. With fragmentation, it only appears in the first
fragment and not in succeeding ones. Without the header, the host
doing the masquerading has no way of determining whether the
fragment should be forwarded. The same applies for fragmented UDP
packets.</p><p>With TCP, this problem is mostly avoided because of TCP's MSS
(Maximum Segment Size) negotiation. That's not to say it won't
happen, but it doesn't occur most of the time. UDP, however, is
much more susceptible to this type of behavior. Your only solution
as an administrator is to be careful about controlling MTU sizes on
SLIP or PPP networks.</p><p>Other problems also exist for X applications (connections
back to the X server); RealAudio (patches available, however); and
rlogin (rlogind requires a privileged port).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a39580.0x2b32b00"></a>Real World Problem</h2></div></div><p>Actual troubleshooting of masquerading problems is not always
as easy as getting the rules straight. One subscriber to the IP
masquerading mailing list (see
<a href="1238s1.html" target="_self">Sidebar</a>) presented an interesting
problem. It was solved with simple analysis, code knowledge, and a
good hex editor.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a39580.0x2b32c60"></a>The Problem</h2></div></div><p>Greg Priem sent a message to the IP masquerading mailing list
describing a problem in which his telnet sessions would freeze. He
isolated a sequence of events that reproduced the problem&mdash;he would
log into his service provider's main host from a machine behind his
Linux box and type in <b  >ls -l</b>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a39580.0x2b29650"></a>Analysis</h2></div></div><p>Greg did some initial analysis and posted what he found. The
network he was using is illustrated in
<a href="1238f4.html" target="_self">Figure 4</a>. The telnets were from
the Mac to the ISP and other hosts on the Internet. He noticed
telnets from the Mac to the Linux Box worked fine, as well as
telnets from the Linux Box to the ISP.</p><p>Output from tcpdump revealed fragmentation was taking place.
I followed up with a message indicating a possible problem and
asked Greg to check the MTU sizes on each interface of the Linux
Box.</p><p>I thought it strange that fragmentation was occurring on a
telnet session since telnet uses TCP. As mentioned before, when TCP
opens a connection, the MSS negotiation is supposed to eliminate
fragmentation.</p><p>Further debugging with tcpdump (a handy program) showed the
MTU assigned by the ISP was 212. To try to eliminate fragmentation,
the SLIP link was also assigned an MTU of 212 by Greg. When looking
at the MSS negotiation of the connections, Greg found that from the
Linux box to the ISP, the MSS was set to 172, and from the Mac to
the Linux box it was the same. However, a connection from the Mac
to the ISP showed an MSS of 536.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a39580.0x2b298b8"></a>The Solution</h2></div></div><p>Given that information, I was able to deduce the problem and
respond with an appropriate solution.</p><p>The connection scenarios are given in
<a href="1238f5.html" target="_self">Figure 5</a>.</p><p>One thing to note was the MSS advertisement of 536 from the
Mac when it had an immediate link with an MTU smaller than that.
BSD-experienced people will remember this number from the
networking code that chose an MSS value for TCP's negotiation by
seeing if the destination was on the local LAN or a remote LAN. The
code roughly looked like:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
if dest_net == local_net
then
        mss = (link MTU) - 40
else
        mss = 536
        /* determined by 576 - 40 */
fi
</pre><p>If the destination was on a remote network, it would set the
MSS automatically to 536. This was a good number because the RFC
for IP stated that the default datagram size for internetworking is
576, meaning every device should be able to handle it without
further fragmentation. Forty is subtracted to allow for IP and TCP
headers.</p><p>A second thing to notice was the Linux box
<span   class="emphasis"><em>forwarding</em></span> the MSS advertisement. One might
think that since a connection is being made from the Linux box as a
consequence of masquerading, the MSS value would be based on the
network link from the Linux box and not the original value from the
sending host.</p><p>As an aside, there was the one unexplainable instance of
connections made to the ISP host and the ISP sending back an MSS of
1460, as shown at the bottom of Figure 5. It's strange because it
was also connected to the PPP link with an MTU of 212. This may be
attributed to a lack of knowledge on the ISP's side of the
network.</p><p>Since both sides were using an MSS value greater than the MTU
of either link, there was bound to be fragmentation, even for a TCP
connection. Under normal circumstances, this wouldn't matter, but
it does confuse masquerading.</p><p>The simple solution was to have the ISP support an MTU of at
least 576 and for Greg to set the SLIP link with an MTU of 576 or
greater. Therefore, no fragmentation would occur.</p><p>Greg e-mailed his ISP and waited for an answer. When none
arrived he became impatient. Since he didn't have the source to the
TCP code on the Mac, the only way to look at it was with a hex
editor. He started poking around to see if he could find the
BSD-like code where it made the decision for the MSS, and sure
enough, he found it. He changed the hard coded values of 536 to 172
(i.e. 212-40), restarted his Mac, and lo and behold, it worked&mdash;no
more fragmentation! (By the way, the ISP did change the MTU size
later.) His approach was a little more daring than what I would
have done, but it seems to be the nature of Linux users to patch an
existing binary if they can't recompile something.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a39580.0x2b29d88"></a>Conclusions</h2></div></div><p>IP masquerading is an interesting technology, but more
importantly, it serves a very useful function for many Internet
environments. It works well for common services such as telnet,
http, and ftp, but it does not support everything. ICMP messages,
talk, remote X applications, and rlogin do not work with
masquerading. Fortunately, the software is still in its Alpha
versions, and more development is being pursued.</p></div></div>
