    How to easily add to or modify the existing subsystems of

    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe53580.0xf4b500"></a></h2></div></div><p>If you're one of those who took a chance
and got one of the Caldera Previews or got a Red Hat distribution
on your system, one of your original thoughts may have been the
same as mine: What happened to /etc/rc.local? Where am I supposed
to put my custom commands? [One answer: /etc/rc.d/rc.local is
available on Red Hat systems&mdash;ED] What if I don't want the HTTP
server to start?
</p><p>For those of you out there who administer Sun Solaris
machines, this looks quite familiar. But I was just scratching my
head for a while until I wound up administering a system, and it
all became clear. Time to share the knowledge.</p><p>The idea behind the setup is to make everything script-based.
For each run level, scripts are run to start each individual
service, instead of having a few large files to edit by hand. These
scripts are located in /etc/rc.d/init.d, and most take as an option
<b  >start</b> or <b  >stop</b>. This is to
allow the specific programs to start (on bootup) or stop (on
shutdown).</p><p>This setup involves a bunch of directories under /etc/rc.d/.
These are:</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>rc0.d</b></span> Contains scripts to
run when the system shuts down. Technically, halt or shutdown bring
the system to runlevel 0. This directory is mostly made up of kill
commands.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>rc1.d through rc3.d</b></span> Scripts
to run when the system changes runlevels. Runlevel 1 is usually
single-user mode, runlevel 2 is for multi-user setup without NFS,
and runlevel 3 is full multi-user and networking.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Runlevel 4</b></span> is typically
unused.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>rc5.d</b></span> Scripts to start the
system in X11 mode. This is the same as runlevel 3, with the
exception that the xdm program starts, which provides a graphical
login screen.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>rc6.d</b></span> Scripts to run when
the system reboots. These scripts are called by a reboot
command.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>init.d</b></span> Actually contains all
of the scripts. The files in the rc<span   class="emphasis"><em>?</em></span>.d
directories are really links to the scripts in the init.d
directory.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe53580.0xf4bc38"></a>The Boot Sequence</h2></div></div><p>Now that we know where files are located, let's look at what
happens in a normal Red Hat boot sequence.</p><p>Once the system boots, /etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit is run first. The
starting runlevel (specified in /etc/inittab) is found, and the
/etc/rc.d/rc script is run, with the sole option being the runlevel
we want to go to. For most startups, this is runlevel 3.</p><p>The rc program looks in the /etc/rc.d/rc3.d directory,
executing any <b  >K*</b> scripts (of which there are
none in the rc3.d directory) with an option of
<b  >stop</b>. Then, all the <b  >S*</b>
scripts are started with an option of <b  >start</b>.
Scripts are started in numerical order&mdash;thus, the S10network script
is started before the S85httpd script. This allows you to choose
exactly when your script starts without having to edit files. The
same is true of the <b  >K*</b> scripts.</p><p>Let's look at what happens when we switch runlevels&mdash;say from
runlevel 3 (full networking and multi-user mode) to runlevel 1
(single-user mode).</p><p>First, all the <b  >K*</b> scripts in the level to
which the system is changing are executed. My Caldera Preview II
(Red Hat 2.0) setup has seven K scripts and one S script in the
/etc/rc.d/rc.1/ directory. The K scripts shut down nfs, sendmail,
lpd, inet, cron, and syslog. The S script then kills off any
remaining programs and executes <b  >init -t1 S</b>,
which tells the system to really go into single-user mode.</p><p>Once in single-user mode, you can switch back to full
multi-user mode by typing <b  >init 3</b>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe53580.0xf4c1b8"></a>Side-stepping init</h2></div></div><p>There are two additional points I can make here.</p><p>First, you can selectively start and stop scripts, even those
not native to your runlevel. Executing scripts in /etc/rc.d/init.d/
with an option of <b  >start</b> or
<b  >stop</b> will start up or stop the programs or
services which the script controls. This allows you to turn off NFS
from runlevel 3 while keeping all other systems active, for
example. Similarly, you can start NFS back up when you are
ready.</p><p>Stopping NFS in this case would require stopping two
systems&mdash;nfsfs and nfs. The nfsfs script will mount or ummount any
of the NFS-mounted file-systems listed in your /etc/fstab. The nfs
script would then shut down the processes associated with NFS, in
this case mountd and nfsd.</p><p>So the proper procedure for shutting down NFS would
be:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# /etc/rc.d/init.d/nfsfs stop
Unmounting remote filesystems.
# /etc/rc.d/init.d/nfs stop
Shutting down NFS services: rpc.mountd rpc.nfsd
#
</pre><p>And starting NFS would be:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# /etc/rc.d/init.d/nfs start
Starting NFS services: rpc.mountd rpc.nfsd
# /etc/rc.d/init.d/nfsfs start
Mounting remote filesystems.
#
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe53580.0xf4c580"></a>Managing init Files</h2></div></div><p>Do you want to <span   class="bold"><b>not</b></span> start the
HTTP daemon, without removing the file from the rc3.d directory?
Easy. Rename /etc/rc.d/rc3.d/S85httpd to something that does not
start with a capital S or a capital K. Your best bet would be to
rename files using a lowercase &ldquo;s&rdquo; or a lowercase &ldquo;k&rdquo;. This
way, not only will the scripts not be started, but they'll appear
later in an ls file listing, since entries starting with capital
letters are shown separately from those beginning with lower case
letters. So you'd wind up with a file now called s85httpd, which is
somewhat separated from the rest of the entries an an ls -l
listing.</p><p>An important note here, though: make sure you know what the
scripts are doing when you disable them. If you disable something
like the S10network script, none of your networking software will
work. This is why S10network has such a low number: because other
scripts are dependent on the network and must be executed after the
network software is in place.</p><p>You want to make your own init processes to start and stop?
That's easy enough to do. Make a script that accepts the word
<b  >start</b> as an option. Not all scripts need to be
able to stop, but if the script starts a process in the background,
you should almost certainly include a <b  >stop</b>
option as well. For example, a script that polls the time over the
network every time you enter runlevel 3 does not need a
<b  >stop</b>. A script that starts a program to query
the network time every 15 minutes would need a start and a stop
script, since the program the script started is continuously
running. A program for the second example is better suited from a
crontab, but being able to do things your own way is at the heart
of Unix, isn't it?</p><p>Once it's written (<span   class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span> tested), put it
in the /etc/rc.d/init.d/ directory. Let's say it's the program to
check the time on a network machine every 15 minutes, so we'll call
the script &ldquo;netdate&rdquo;. Once it is in the /etc/rc.d/init.d/
directory, you can make links in the directories you want to start
it in. If you want your program to run in runlevel 3, make a link
to your script from
/etc/rc.d/rc3.d/S<span   class="emphasis"><em>??</em></span>netdate. Make
<span   class="emphasis"><em>??</em></span> a number that will fit in the rest of the
directory, such as S55netdate. You'll want it to be above S10 so
that the network is started, and S55 isn't taken, so it seems a
good enough location. It's not required that there be only one
script with each number, but it is good form, since you know
exactly what order the scripts will be started in.</p><p>If you want to stop the process gracefully during a shutdown,
make sure your script accepts <b  >stop</b>, then make a
link to /etc/rc.d/init.d/netdate from /etc/rc.d/rc0.d/K55netdate.
Again, you should make sure the number you use is not being used by
another subsystem to avoid confusion.</p><p>You can test your new setup by using <b  >init
3</b>. Since the other subsystems are already running, the
only one that will start is the one you just added. If the
<b  >init 3</b> command hangs, your script didn't exit;
you probably need to put an ampersand at the end of a line to put
the problem process in the background. You can also run your script
manually from the /etc/rc.d/init.d/ directory.</p><p>Now that you know how the subsystems work, you can easily add
or modify the existing subsystems for your particular Linux
setup.</p></div></div>
