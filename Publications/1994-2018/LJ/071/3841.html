restrictions on the export of strong cryptography will have been
lifted. I was delighted to hear that PGP was given export
permissions, although it still can't go to the T-7 (terrorist
seven) countries. I've never understood the contention that
cryptography was a munition. The folks (including politicians) who
have insisted that the measure prevented terrorists from obtaining
it show a complete lack of understanding of how terrorists work.
Export of a few more packages (FreeS/WAN and OpenSSH, at least)
will result in distributions with adequately secure administration
tools. In the meantime, these tools are still available from sites
outside the U.S.; just don't forget you can't export the tar files
back outside the U.S.
</p><p>note:
<a href="http://www.daemon.de/software.html" target="_self">www.daemon.de/software.html</a></p><p><span   class="bold"><b>note</b></span> is an easy-to-use
utility that allows you to keep notes to yourself in a MySQL
database. You can create notes, edit them (using vi, but it will
honor your <b  >$EDITOR</b> environment variable), delete
them, list them, search them, etc. This utility would also be the
perfect tool for a journal when you need to keep extensive, dated
notes over a long period of time because of the MySQL back end.
Easily extensible, the front end works from a console or xterm and
is written in Perl. This is one of those utilities that causes you
to say, &ldquo;how did I ever get along without it?&rdquo;--a must-have. It
requires Perl, the Mysql-msql module, DBI module and MySQL.</p><p>gnotepad+:
<a href="http://ack.netpedia.net/gnp" target="_self">http://ack.netpedia.net/gnp/</a></p><p>Although the author touts this program as a notepad, he also
admits it is much more, thus the &ldquo;+&rdquo;. Indeed,
<span   class="bold"><b>gnotepad+</b></span> has all the trappings of
an HTML editor. You can customize the button bars to include an
HTML set, including only those buttons you might need. This notepad
can create HTML code more easily than most of the HTML editors I've
used. If you use GTK and need a good editor, give this one a try.
It requires libgtkxmhtml, libgtk, libgdk, libgmodule, libglib,
libdl, libXext, libX11, libm, glibc, libXpm, libjpeg, libpng and
libz.</p><p>WebDownloader for X:
<a href="http://www.krasu.ru/soft/chuchelo" target="_self">http://www.krasu.ru/soft/chuchelo/</a></p><p>This utility gives you complete control over downloads. You
can set it up to download http or ftp URLs at night. You can
interrupt downloads, then pick them up where they left off. You can
limit the download speed from any individual site, or if you're
using it while on-line, you can select any of two configurable
slower speeds. If you are connected to the Internet via cable modem
or DSL and do a lot of downloading, you will want to check this one
out. It requires libgtk, libgdk, libgmodule, libglib, libdl,
libXext, libX11, libstdc++, libm and glibc.</p><p>Yet Another Computer Algebra System:
<a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~apinkus/yacas.html" target="_self">www.xs4all.nl/~apinkus/yacas.html</a></p><p>For all you math geniuses out there,
<span   class="bold"><b>yacas</b></span> provides a convenient,
easy-to-use interface for doing math computations. While I don't
need much beyond simple addition, subtraction, multiplication and
division, I do wish I'd had this 25 years ago while taking
calculus. This program can handle Taylor series, Newton method for
finding zeroes and several other functions. While the author is
still working on improvements (functions with multiple occurrences
of variables), this is an excellent program as it is. It requires
libstdc++, libm and glibc.</p><p>xglobe:
<a href="http://www.rzstud.rz.uni-karlsruhe.de/~uddn/xglobe" target="_self">http://www.rzstud.rz.uni-karlsruhe.de/~uddn/xglobe/</a></p><p>Well, what can you say about another program that puts a
globe on your desktop? I've always been fond of the Earth, and a
satellite's eye view of the world is always nice. Shows the planet
from the sun's perspective. Complete with names and locations of
major cities. It requires libX11, libqt, libstdc++, libm, libXext
and glibc.</p><p>rubix:
<a href="http://sed.free.fr/rubix" target="_self">http://sed.free.fr/rubix/</a></p><p>It's been a while since I played with a Rubik's cube. What
this little toy showed me was that I no longer remember how to
solve it. It is not yet the easiest thing to manipulate and
certainly not intuitive. Hopefully, the author will work on this
aspect. Actually, it's probably more my ineptness at using a mouse
than it is the controls. Hours of entertainment for the easily
amused (even more for the easily confused). It requires libX11,
libm and glibc.</p><p>xzgv:
<a href="ftp://metalab.unc.edu/pub/Linux/apps/graphics/viewers/X" target="_self">ftp://metalab.unc.edu/pub/Linux/apps/graphics/viewers/X/</a></p><p>If you remember <span   class="bold"><b>zgv</b></span>, you
know what <span   class="bold"><b>xzgv</b></span> is. Since most
folks today prefer graphical user interfaces to command-line ones,
this provides them with the power of zgv in X. It does an excellent
job of rendering most image formats. It requires libgdk_imlib,
libgtk, libgdk, libgmodule, libglib, libdl, libXext, libX11, libm
and glibc.</p><p>tkftp:
<a href="http://tkftp.firebird.cx" target="_self">http://tkftp.firebird.cx/</a></p><p>As GTK continues to proliferate on desktops, it's nice to see
Tcl/Tk applications remain. This is especially true for folks with
older PCs who want a GUI interface, but don't want to bog down
their system with larger applications. This particular Tcl/Tk
utility is very handy, easy to use and simple to configure.
Connections options are flexible and powerful. This client can
handle most, if not all, popular FTP servers with ease. It requires
tcl-8.0 and tk-8.0.</p></div></div>
