    A look at how training courses will be taught in the future.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2337580.0x242f3f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>One hundred million. That's the number of
Americans expected to be involved in adult or continuing education
by the year 2004. Many of those individuals will be technology
users who need to be trained on evolving software packages and
hardware systems. A 1998 study published by International Data
Corporation's Information Technology (IT) Training and Education
Service projected that the worldwide IT training and education
market will experience a growth rate of over 11%, surpassing $28.3
billion by 2002.
</p><p>Whether these individuals are CEOs, managers, supervisors or
general staff, all need to stay current in order to perform their
responsibilities with maximum effectiveness and efficiency. To meet
the needs of an expanding marketplace, leaders in IT training will
strive to stay in touch with a basic law of teaching&mdash;take complex
material and make it easy to understand. To accomplish this goal,
the computer training industry needs to be aware of four escalating
trends. Some of them are here already; some of them will loom
larger in the coming decade. The key, however, is to recognize
these trends as the foundation of standards for a rapidly changing
industry.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2337580.0x242f558"></a>Individualized Learning</h2></div></div><p>&ldquo;The initiative has shifted from the corporate structure to
the student, from the trainer to the trainee,&rdquo; says Paul Swanson,
president of Oasys, a corporate training firm in Toronto, Canada.
&ldquo;We're talking about individualized learning for individualized
applications.&rdquo; The traditional classroom setting is more expensive
and less effective than self-paced training videos, CDs or intranet
courses. To meet the growing demand, developers of software
training packages such as Keystone Learning Systems provide
convenient, cost-effective courses on video and CD-ROM which
trainees can use at home or in the office.</p><p>There is still no substitute for excellence in instructional
materials, nor will there be. Red Hat 6.0, an eight-part series of
training videos, was especially helpful for Liz Peterson, owner of
Depco Business Services in Oklahoma City. Peterson works with
trainees in units of about 50 platforms each, where interactivity
is essential for smooth-running sessions in a stable learning
environment. Self-paced training allows the student to go as
quickly or slowly through a course as the need arises. Hands-on
&ldquo;see it, hear it and do it&rdquo; training solutions are the wave of
the future. Peterson is an avid supporter of video-based training,
especially her Keystone program, because the videos hold the
attention of the trainees. She reports, &ldquo;Ordinarily, this stuff is
dry, yet the Keystone videos make it interesting.&rdquo;</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2337580.0x242f6b8"></a>The Move to the Web</h2></div></div><p>The legend of the Internet is growing. On-line training will
escalate in the next decade. Not that there aren't downsides here;
there are. Most suppliers of training materials for hardware and
software applications are moving aggressively onto the Web, trying
to connect training to the world of cyberspace. The development of
speedy, effective and secure Internet applications is becoming a
watchword across the whole world of IT. Office applications,
networking, graphics/design, finance and operating systems will be
affected as companies and independent users shift en masse to the
World Wide Web. Trainers and their suppliers will have to
respond.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2337580.0x242f7c0"></a>Interactivity vs. the Hierarchical Model</h2></div></div><p>The computer industry practically invented the term
&ldquo;hands-on&rdquo;. This trend will continue. The training modules that
will be in demand for effective lab work will continue to emphasize
realistic configuration and administration tasks where, in effect,
the learner is in the driver's seat. &ldquo;The reduction in
instructional time when compared to the traditional instructor-led
approach is typically in the range of 20-75%,&rdquo; wrote Verl E.
Dennis in the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Journal of Instruction Delivery
Systems</em></span> (Winter, 1994). He added: &ldquo;Interactive
instruction offers a solution for minimizing training time without
sacrificing desired training outcomes.&rdquo;</p><p>The benefits are obvious:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>no waiting for scheduled training</p></li><li><p>flexibility of access, no waiting to get to
&ldquo;relevant&rdquo; bits</p></li><li><p>self-paced curricula, not at the mercy of the
slowest or fastest learner</p></li><li><p>time efficiency&mdash;program stops when the trainee has
mastered the skill</p></li><li><p>immediate feedback on mistakes</p></li><li><p>visual and audio aspects work together to reinforce
each other</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2337580.0x242fdf0"></a>Multimedia, Voice Activation and
Simulations</h2></div></div><p>These three terms form a cutting-edge trend all by
themselves. In IT, there is one thing that trainers and executives
can reasonably expect&mdash;the unexpected. Software marketers and
producers are already acting on this notion. Voice activation and
recognition will begin to play a larger role in how we compute.
There is also a trend in the desire for simulations. This
cutting-edge technology allows the learner to &ldquo;try the job&rdquo; prior
to actually &ldquo;doing the job&rdquo;.</p><p>It's a matter of thinking ahead. Red Hat, Inc., which has
been building the enterprise credibility of Linux for several years
now, tells would-be trainers and trainees that &ldquo;staying current
with technology, best practices and user communities are all
essential.&rdquo;</p><p>Not so long ago, Price-Waterhouse introduced a CBT
(computer-based training) Multimedia program as a prerequisite for
a week-long classroom course. The program reduced by 50% the time
needed for users to get up to speed. The cost per learner was $760
for traditional instructor-led training, versus $106 per learner
for multimedia training. Price-Waterhouse estimated that sustained
use of such multimedia instruction could amount to a savings of
some $10 million US.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2337580.0x242ffa8"></a>Top Trainers</h2></div></div><p>Content is important with any course, but high-quality,
competent instructors are also a must. You don't send a boy to do a
man's job, and you don't send an actor to represent the challenging
world of network training. Along with experts in knowledge, you
need expert teachers. It helps if trainers are tops in their
field.</p><p>Paul D. Sheriff, a past president of the Orange County Visual
Basic User Group, has more than 14 years of experience in
programming business applications. &ldquo;I like to teach people
real-world concepts, not just how to use the syntax of the
language,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I stress good programming standards, how to
approach problems, and give real examples that I take right from my
consulting business.&rdquo;</p><p>Dr. Hany Greiss works as a Senior Technical Instructor for
PEAC, Inc., in Ottawa, Ontario. His teaching philosophy shows why
he is a sought-after teacher and trainer. &ldquo;I say to all those I
teach, do not become encyclopedias, but rather understand concepts,
and when you're on the job, you can look things up.&rdquo; In hiring
trainers, he says to look for people with a passion for their
product, people with an eye for conveying the big picture. Small
details can always be tended to in the field.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2337580.0x2430160"></a>Self-Pacing a Plus</h2></div></div><p>Everyone likes to learn at his or her own speed. Taking time
away from an already-crammed schedule to attend a one-week seminar
in a far-flung city requires lots of time and manpower. Here is
where video technology comes to the rescue. For organizations that
prefer quality training at a fraction of the cost of traditional
classroom and web-based training or distance-learning applications,
videos and CD-ROMS are an effective and creative alternative.
Students are able to start, view, stop, review and start again at
their own speed. Even better, there's no one in the front row
dominating the lecture or asking all the questions.</p><p>Individualized learning means the freedom, if not the
necessity, of learning when and where you want. &ldquo;On-line users and
students need specific, detailed and often repetitive
instruction,&rdquo; says Paul Swanson. One of the most valuable
advantages of self-paced training over a classroom setting is that
while the classroom instruction will be over in an hour or two, the
videos will still be around. The material is always there if the
trainee forgets a concept or application.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2337580.0x24302c0"></a>The Certification Equation</h2></div></div><p>A 1998 study by <span   class="emphasis"><em>PC Computing</em></span> Business
Labs found that training increases employee performance by nearly
20% and pays for itself within weeks. The Gartner Group of
Stamford, Connecticut, surveyed 250 enterprise managers in 1997 and
found that 93% of companies surveyed pay for certification and 89%
pay for training. Alert executives are closely scrutinizing trends
in certification and testing.</p><p>It's good to be realistic. Training, too, is affected by the
old law of diminishing returns. Red Hat's web site puts it this
way: &ldquo;Training alone is not enough to become a competent user,
operator, system administrator or engineer. Good training can
provide a foundation; the participant must do the rest.&rdquo;</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2337580.0x2430478"></a>Realistic Training</h2></div></div><p>Some challenges of the 20th century will remain to test
21st-century trainers. Gwen Wakal, president of the Edmonton-based
Active Computer Service, a pioneer in computer training in Canada,
says: &ldquo;It's still not as easy as it seems out there for one
network to talk to another, even with Intranet and CD-ROM going for
you.&rdquo; Training for bridge-building platforms and cross-supporting
technologies will be called for more and more as software packages
try to find the middle of the road between greater complexity and a
call for standardization. This means that at least as far into the
future as we can see, affordable, high-quality, self-paced computer
training products and trainees will be a mainstay as IT enters the
new millennium. &ldquo;On a scale of 1 to 10, I rate training as a 10,&rdquo;
says Liz Peterson. &ldquo;Training will always be necessary,&rdquo; concludes
Wakal. &ldquo;Make sure you get the best you can.&rdquo;</p><p>The age of the laptop learner and the cyber-student is here.
As the 1990s dawned, America's Secretary of Education warned that
traditional learning methods were in a time warp when measured
against the mushrooming explosion in technology. This warning has
specific application for the technology training industry. Too
often, the chalkboard or out-of-town seminars are still the norm.
Yet in this fast-moving world of intranet and Internet education,
it is vital to sort out the glitz from the gold. What's needed is a
holistic and realistic look at the trends affecting technology
training today and in the future.</p></div></div>
