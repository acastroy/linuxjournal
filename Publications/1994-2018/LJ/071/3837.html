almost all of my work space. Juggling all those keyboards and mice
was a hassle, not to mention trying to find enough electrical
outlets. I had thought about getting a KVM (keyboard-video-mouse)
switch, but held off getting one until a friend told me about his
good experience with the Linksys ProConnect CPU switch.
</p><p>I purchased the Linksys ProConnect 4-Station CPU switch, and
currently use it to control two Linux PCs and one Windows PC. The
switch works well, and I have been very satisfied with it.</p><p>The ProConnect 4-Station CPU switch has a relatively small
footprint, measuring just 10.25 x 7 x 3 in inches. The CPU switch
comes with a power adapter and must be plugged into a standard
electrical outlet to work. The ProConnect CPU switch also comes
with a small, but thorough, manual.</p><p>Several companies sell complete keyboard, mouse and monitor
cable sets for KVM switches, so you can get all the cables you need
for your systems in one convenient package. Be sure to check the
mouse and keyboard ports of your PCs before buying the cables. You
can use either a PS/2 or an AT-style keyboard, but you must use the
same style mouse (PS/2 or AT) on the ProConnect switch that your
computers use. If you have a mix of PS/2 and AT-style mice, you
will have to plug two mice (one PS/2 and one AT) into the mouse
console ports of the ProConnect switch, according to the
manual.</p><p>Setting up the ProConnect switch is straightforward. Plug
your keyboard, monitor and mouse into the unit's console ports.
Then connect the keyboard, monitor and mouse patch cables between
the ProConnect switch and each of the PCs you wish to control.
Finally, plug the ProConnect's power adapter into the wall, and
turn it on.</p><p>The ProConnect CPU 4-Station switch has four red LEDs, four
green LEDs and four pushbuttons in addition to the power switch on
the front panel. The red LEDs indicate which PCs are powered up,
and the green LEDs indicate which PC you are currently
controlling.</p><p>Changing the current PC can be done through the keyboard or
by pushing one of the buttons on the front panel. The keyboard
sequence for switching PCs in the ProConnect manual is incorrect.
The correct sequence is to press and release the
<b  >ALT</b> key, press and release the
<b  >CTRL</b> key, press and release the
<b  >SHIFT</b> key, then press and release the number
(1-4) of the PC you want to use, and finally, press the
<b  >ENTER</b> key.</p><p>The ProConnect switch can also scan through all the PCs
connected to it. To start scanning, enter the keyboard sequence
above, but press 0 for the computer number. After the
<b  >ENTER</b> key is pressed, the ProConnect switch will
cycle through all the running PCs. To stop this automatic scanning,
press the space bar.</p><p>ProConnect CPU switches can also be connected to other
ProConnect CPU switches to provide control to many PCs with one
keyboard, mouse and monitor. The instruction manual provides the
proper DIP switch settings and cable connections to use for
cascading.</p><p>If you're using the CPU switch to control Windows PCs, make
sure the Windows PC option is selected on the CPU switch while it
is booting up, or its screen won't have the proper resolution when
you change to it.</p><p>I have used my Linksys ProConnect switch for several months
now, and am entirely satisfied with it. In addition to freeing up
valuable desk space, the ProConnect switch makes it easy to use
multiple PCs without the hassle of finding the right mouse and
keyboard.</p></div></div>
