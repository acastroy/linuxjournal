Bazaar</em></span> (reviewed by Peter Salus in the January issue) is
a fascinating book; I could hardly put it down. Some thirty years
ago when I suggested at Boeing that software should be distributed
in source-code form, the idea was hooted down and rejected out of
hand. Eric's book documents the fundamental validity of that idea
and records for us how it took root, and now provides the very
direction of software development.</p><p>Much as I like Eric's book, it has side tones that could use
a filter. A clue to the source is revealed, I think, on page 39
where Eric tells us that in 1992, his attempt to get some code
merged into the Emacs Lisp library was rebuffed by the Free
Software Foundation (FSF). So Eric has kind of a sour-grapes
attitude toward the FSF, and I think it has caused him to miss-read
(sic) the real relationship of Richard Stallman's
<span   class="emphasis"><em>cathedral</em></span> approach to Linus Torvalds'
<span   class="emphasis"><em>bazaar</em></span> approach to software development. Eric
tells us Linus' approach is &ldquo;much healthier&rdquo; and &ldquo;the very
opposite of cathedral-building&rdquo;. But Eric is comparing an apple to
an orange.</p><p>Linus released his kernel sources into a world brimming with
youngsters who were absolute UNIX experts. Some of them probably
knew more about UNIX bedrock than Linus did. Linus lifted them over
a formidable obstacle. Intel's 386 was equipped with precisely the
hardware UNIX requires, but it was kludged up to be
backward-compatible all the way to day one, so the hoops you jump
through to get it started are just a bit
<span   class="emphasis"><em>hairy</em></span>. These UNIX experts created quite a
different situation for Linus from what Richard Stallman had when
he developed his C compiler or the Emacs editor. The UNIX world was
not brimming with text editor experts, let alone compiler experts.
It doesn't work to share development with people who know little
about what you are trying to accomplish.</p><p>When Eric comments that &ldquo;FSF was not the only game in
town&rdquo;, I think he unnecessarily gives short shrift to the work
Stallman has contributed to the free software movement. The reality
is, without Stallman's compiler and make director, not to mention
Emacs and gdb, there might not be <span   class="emphasis"><em>any</em></span> game in
town.</p><p>Software tools do come first, just as Bob Canup pointed out
in these pages a few issues back. Toolmakers, such as Dennis
Ritchie and Richard Stallman, have been awarded special status in
the programming community, and rightly so. The real relationship of
the cathedral to the bazaar is not antagonistic at all, but
complementary. As the work of Dennis Ritchie stands in relation to
that of Ken Thompson, so the work of Richard Stallman stands in
relation to the work of Linus Torvalds. As a poet long ago
summarized, they are &ldquo;...useless each, without the other&rdquo;. We
need both the cathedral and the bazaar.</p><p>&mdash;Jack Dennon jdennon@seasurf.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27f1580.0x28e9558"></a>Desktop Wars</h2></div></div><p>I look forward to <i  >Linux Journal</i> every
month. It is one of the few publications I take time to read
completely. Please keep up the good work.</p><p>I have been following the thread of KDE vs. GNOME, Red Hat
vs. others, etc. for the last few months. My personal opinion is
that many of the advocates of particular desktops or distributions
are to some degree missing the point. I do have my personal
preferences, but I believe what is really needed is standardized
file formats. That is, if I generate a &ldquo;document&rdquo; in Applixware
or StarOffice or whatever, it must be readable by the other office
suites. Also, enough design has to go into the file formats so that
I do not have to purchase an updated version of the software every
two years. This rationale applies to spreadsheets, presentation
software, etc. It would greatly enhance the portability of
documents between the various office suites and/or distributions
(even other operating systems). The actual desktop (KDE, GNOME,
etc.) would then be the preference of the individual using the
system.</p><p>I know this may have the short-term effect of limiting some
creativity, but it would be a solution to one of the problems
created by the other popular OS. Just my two cents worth.</p><p>&mdash;Dave Underland dunder@earthlink.net</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27f1580.0x28e97c0"></a>Hurrah for Feathers</h2></div></div><p>Loved the January cover! I watched the &ldquo;Wallace and Gromit&rdquo;
special on the tube, and cracked up when I saw Feathers McGraw. A
bit Tux-like, isn't he? I have also spied a
<span   class="emphasis"><em>very</em></span> Tux-like fellow during reruns of
&ldquo;Reboot&rdquo; on the Cartoon Network. This character pops up from time
to time and casually strolls by. I wonder if the folks at Mainframe

2000, was a most enlightening article. However, the given URL
appeared to be www.khaOS.org, while it's actually www.kha0S.org
(note the O/0). The former URL, which I assumed was correct upon
reading, directed me to &ldquo;Diario El Mundo del siglo XXI&rdquo;, which I
was able to infer through my minimal knowledge of the Spanish
language was not KhaOS's web site. Though I found the &ldquo;Diario El
Mundo del siglo XXI&rdquo; most singularly intriguing, it would be
appreciated if your URLs were a tad clearer.</p><p>&mdash;Auknight Colather auknight@postmark.net</p><p>Sorry about that. Depending on the font, a capital O and a

issue of <i  >Linux Journal</i>. How refreshing to read
about a famous person who is normal and intelligent! I love the
questions you chose to ask, as well as the cover title you
chose&mdash;very humorous.</p><p>&mdash;Kimberly Guardino kimberly@zna.com</p><p>Lydia Kinata came up with the &ldquo;Linus is Batman&rdquo; cover. We

<i  >Linux Journal</i> you have sent to me. I am a
researcher and computer programmer at the Higher Politechnical
Institute J.A.E. of Havana (ISPJAE) and specialize in writing
programs for industrial use (most in Delphi).</p><p>We are not familiar with UNIX systems, because these are not
very common in this country. In my university, only a few people
have installed Linux, and some communication servers run
UNIX.</p><p>Most people have Windows 95, 98 or NT. In our country, it is
easier to find an installation CD for Windows than one for Linux,
and most available programs are for the Windows platform. Finally,
at the universities and almost all over the country, no one has to
register and pay for Windows (I do not know what will happen with
this situation in the future). Therefore, people don't have to
worry about cost, and Linux being freely available is not a factor
in decision making.</p><p>Nevertheless, I have installed Linux (not without some
hardware problems) on my computer and find it very nice and
powerful.</p><p>Anyway, thank you again for the journals. They were very
interesting.</p><p>&mdash;Melvin Ayalajre yes@ceis.ispjae.edu.cu</p></div></div>
