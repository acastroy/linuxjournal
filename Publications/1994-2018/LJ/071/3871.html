publisher, it feels strange to write what sounds like a Business
and Finance column. I haven't changed, but the Linux community
certainly has. If you don't believe this, ask around and see how
many geeks you know who bought Andover, Cobalt, Corel, Red Hat or
VA Linux stock.
</p><p>This year has already started out with a bang for the Linux
community. First, there is a rumor that the reason Bill Gates
stepped down as CEO of Microsoft to become its Chief Software
Architect is Linux-related. Okay, maybe &ldquo;rumor&rdquo; is too strong a
word, but the number-two reason according to <span   class="emphasis"><em>Salon
Magazine</em></span> is that Bill needed more time to learn
Linux.</p><p>While I don't believe this is 100% true, things
<span   class="emphasis"><em>have</em></span> changed for Microsoft. Between the
Department of Justice and Linux on the OS level, Microsoft has been
forced into a competitive arena. In the applications arena, Sun's
purchase of StarOffice and making it freely available offers a
difficult-to-match price point. I expect Microsoft will still have
a lot of customers, but it is nice to see them having to work
harder to attract new users.</p><p>The influx of capital into the Linux market is amazing: about
$100 million between Turbo Linux, SuSE and Caldera Systems. Also,
we see interesting players: some of Caldera's money came from Sun
Microsystems.</p><p>Turbo Linux's investors make up another interesting list:
Dell, Compaq, NEC, SCO, Toshiba, et al. For anyone who has tried to
buy a Toshiba computer without MS Windows, this is fairly
surprising. And just a year or two ago, SCO was telling us we could
trade in our copy of Linux to upgrade to SCO UNIX.</p><p>Another interesting company is TiVo, Inc., profiled in last
month's <i  >LJ</i>. The quick summary is they have
created a Personal TV Receiver, a Linux-based system that acts like
the world's smartest VCR, recording up to 30 hours of TV programs
on a hard disk. Why is TiVo hot? First, Phillips is making the
systems, so we have a major manufacturer behind this &ldquo;Linux and
your TV&rdquo; effort. Second, TiVo secured a pact with Blockbuster to
do video-on-demand.</p><p>There's more. Macromedia will likely open source their flash
player. Transmeta (see &ldquo;Stop the Presses&rdquo;) has announced their
Crusoe chip. Huge investments have been made in Linuxcare. The
Caldera IPO is happening.</p><p>Linux has grown up. It is finally being recognized as
something that solves problems, not just for computer geeks, but
also for the mainstream. In the eyes of businesspeople, Linux is
finally more than a web server.</p><p>My prediction is this is just the beginning. More companies
like TiVo will adopt embedded Linux in the mass market. While
Internet Appliances (IAs) will be based on other platforms, a
majority of the IAs will likely run Linux&mdash;it has the functionality
and the right price.</p><p>The acceptance of Linux in the embedded market adds to
Linux's success in the server market. When people access
Linux-based web servers from their Linux-based IA, they are getting
a strong message that Linux, not Microsoft, is bringing them
technology.</p><p>I hate to just conclude we won, but it seems like we are
there. Linux is marketing itself these days. Geeks believe in it,
embedded-systems developers believe in it, and the general public
has gone from not knowing it exists to seeing it as a viable answer
for their needs. I'm not sure if my next toaster or car will run
Linux, but I wouldn't be surprised if it happened.</p><p>Oh, and Bill: if that point in Salon Magazine was right,
please stop by. I will be happy to give you a copy of our new Linux
Command Summary.</p></div></div>
