    A look at the fundamental building blocks of the Linux
    kernel.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c7c580.0x1d745b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>This month, we begin looking at Linux
internals. We will travel the innards of the Linux kernels of the
2.0.<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span>, 2.2.<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> and the new
2.4.<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> series. Although many articles are
written every week on how best to use Linux, very few have reviewed
the internals of the kernel. Why is it necessary to know how the
kernel works?
</p><p>For one thing, understanding your kernel better will enable
you to prevent problems before they occur. If you are using Linux
as a server, most problems will start to appear under stress. This
is exactly when it becomes essential to know your way around the
kernel to assess the nature of the problems.</p><p>If you ever need to check back with the kernel source, you
can either install the source from your distribution's CD or go to
<a href="http://lxr.linux.no/source" target="_self">http://lxr.linux.no/source/</a>
to navigate through all the source code on-line.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c7c580.0x1d748c8"></a>The Linux Process Model</h2></div></div><p>UNIX systems have a fundamental building block: the process,
including the thread and lightweight processes. Under Linux, the
process model has evolved considerably with each new
version.</p><p>The fundamental data structure within the kernel controlling
all processes is the process structure, which grows and shrinks
dynamically as processes are forked and finished or killed.</p><p>The process structure (called task_struct in the kernel
source code) is about 1KB in size. You can get the exact size with
this program:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#define __KERNEL__
#include &lt;linux/sched.h&gt;
main()
{
printf("sizeof(struct task_struct) - %d\n",
   sizeof(struct task_struct));
}
</pre><p>On Intel 386 machines, it is exactly 960 bytes. Please note,
however, that unlike other UNIX systems, this process structure
does not occupy space in the true sense of the word.
</p><p>Since 2.2.<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span>, the task_struct is
allocated at the bottom of the kernel stack. We can overlap the
task_struct on the kernel stack because the task_struct is a
per-task structure exactly as the kernel stack.</p><p>The kernel stack has a <span   class="emphasis"><em>fixed</em></span> size of
8192 bytes on the Intel x86. If the kernel will recurse on the
stack for 8192-960=7232 bytes, then the task_struct will be
overwritten and therefore corrupted, causing the kernel to
crash.</p><p>Basically, the kernel decreases the size of the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>usable</em></span> kernel stack to around 7232 bytes by
allocating the task structure at the bottom of the stack. It is
done this way, because 7KB are more than enough for the kernel
stack and the rest is used for the task_struct. These are the
advantages of this order:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The kernel doesn't have to access memory to get its
kernel structure.</p></li><li><p>Memory usage is reduced.</p></li><li><p>An additional dynamic allocation is avoided at task
creation time.</p></li><li><p>The task_struct will always start on a PAGE_SIZE
boundary, so the cache line is always aligned on most hardware in
the market.</p></li></ul></div><p>Once Linux is in kernel mode, you can get the address of the
task_struct at any time with this very fast pseudo-code:
<pre     class="programlisting">
task_struct = (struct task_struct *) STACK_POINTER &amp; 0xffffe000;
</pre>


This is exactly how the above pseudo-code is implemented in C under
Linux:
<pre     class="programlisting">
/* cut-and-pasted from
linux/include/asm-i386/current.h */
static inline struct task_struct * get_current(void)
{
        struct task_struct *current;
        __asm__(-andl %%esp,%0;
        -:-=- (current) : "0" (~8191UL));
        return current;
        }
</pre>


For example, on a Pentium II, recalculating the task_struct
beginning from the stack pointer is much faster than passing the
task_struct address through the stack across function calls, as is
done in some other operating systems, e.g., Solaris 7. That is, the
kernel can derive the address of the task_struct by checking only
the value of the stack pointer (no memory accesses at all). This is
a big performance booster and shows once again that fine
engineering can be found in free software. The code to this was
written by Ingo Molnar, a Hungarian kernel hacker. The kernel stack
is set by the CPU automatically when entering kernel mode by
loading the kernel stack pointer address from the CPU Task Segment
State that is set at fork time.
</p><p>The layout of the x86 kernel stack looks like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
----- 0xXXXX0000 (bottom of the stack and address
                 of the task struct)
TASK_STRUCT
----- 0xXXXX03C0 (last byte usable from the kernel
                  as real kernel stack)
KERNEL_STACK
----- 0xXXXX2000 (top of the stack, first byte
                  used as kernel stack)
</pre><p>Note that today, the size of the task_struct is exactly 960
bytes. It is going to change across kernel revisions, because every
variable removed or inserted to the task_struct will change the
size. In turn, the upper limit of the kernel stack will change with
the size of task_struct.
</p><p>The memory for the process data structure is allocated
dynamically during execution of the Linux kernel. More precisely,
the kernel doesn't allocate the task_struct at all, only the
two-pages-wide kernel stack of which task_struct will be a
part.</p><p>In many UNIX systems, there is a maximum processes parameter
for the kernel. In commercial operating systems like Solaris, it is
a self-tuned parameter. In other words, it adjusts according to the
amount of RAM found at boot time. However, in Solaris, you can
still adjust this parameter in /etc/system.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c7c580.0x1d75318"></a>What about Linux?</h2></div></div><p>In Linux 2.3.<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> (and in the future,
2.4.0), it is a run-time tunable parameter as well. On
2.2.<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span>, it's a compile-time tunable parameter.
To change it in 2.2.<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span>, you need to change the
NR_TASKS preprocessor define in Linux/include/linux/tasks.h:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#define NR_TASKS 512 /* On x86 Max 4092 or 4090
                        with APM configured. */
</pre><p>Increase this number up to 4090 to increase the maximum limit
of concurrent tasks.
</p><p>In 2.3.<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span>, it is a tunable parameter
which defaults to <span   class="emphasis"><em>size-of-memory-in-the-system</em></span>
/ <span   class="emphasis"><em>kernel-stack-size</em></span> / 2. Suppose you have
512MB of RAM; then, the default upper limit of available processes
will be 512*1024*1024 / 8192 / 2 = 32768. Now, 32768 processes
might sound like a lot, but for an enterprise-wide Linux server
with a database and many connections from a LAN or the Internet, it
is a very reasonable number. I have personally seen UNIX boxes with
a higher number of active processes. It might make sense to adjust
this parameter in your installation. In 2.3.<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span>,
you can also increase the maximum number of tasks via a
<span   class="bold"><b>sysctl</b></span> at runtime. Suppose the
administrator wants to increase the number of concurrent tasks to
40,000. He will have to do only this (as root):</p><pre     class="programlisting">
echo 40000 &gt; /proc/sys/kernel/threads-max
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c7c580.0x1d75840"></a>Processes and Threads</h2></div></div><p>In the last 10 years or so, there has been a general move
from heavyweight processes to a threaded model. The reason is
clear: the creation and maintenance of a full process with its own
address space takes up a lot of time in terms of milliseconds.
Threads run within the same address space as the parent process,
and therefore require much less time in creation.</p><p>What's the difference between process and thread under Linux?
And, more importantly, what is the difference from a scheduler
point of view? In short&mdash;nothing.</p><p>The only worthwhile difference between a thread and a process
is that threads share the same address space completely. All the
threads run in the same address space, so a context switch is
basically just a jump from one code location to another.</p><p>A simple check to avoid the TLB (translation lookaside
buffer, the mechanism within the CPU that translates virtual memory
addresses to actual RAM addresses) flush and the memory manager
context switch is this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/* cut from linux/arch/i386/kernel/process.c */
/* Re-load page tables */
{
        unsigned long new_cr3 = next-&gt;tss.cr3;
        if (new_cr3 !=3D prev-&gt;tss.cr3)
        asm volatile("movl %0,%%cr3": :"r" (new_cr3));
        }
</pre><p>The above check is in the core of the Linux kernel context
switch. It simply checks that the page-directory address of the
current process and the one of the to-be-scheduled process are the
same. If they are, then they share the same address space (i.e.,
they are two threads), and nothing will be written to the %%cr3
register, which would cause the user-space page tables to be
invalidated. That is, putting any value into the %%cr3 register
automatically invalidates the TLB; in fact, this is actually how
you force a TLB flush. Since two tasks in the same address space
never switch the address space, the TLB will never be invalidated.
</p><p>With the above two-line check, Linux makes a distinction
between a kernel-process switch and a kernel-thread switch. This is
the <span   class="emphasis"><em>only</em></span> noteworthy difference.</p><p>Since there is no difference at all between threads and
processes, the Linux scheduler is very clean code. Only a few
places related to signal handling make a distinction between
threads and processes.</p><p>In Solaris, the process is greatly disadvantaged compared to
the thread and lightweight processes (LWP). Here is a measurement I
did on my Solaris server, an Ultra 2 desktop, 167MHz processor,
running Solaris 2.6:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
hirame&gt; ftime
Completed 100 forks
Avg Fork Time: 1.137 milliseconds
hirame&gt; ttime
Completed 100 Thread Creates
Avg Thread Time: 0.017 milliseconds
</pre><p>I executed 100 forks and measured the time elapsed. As you
can see, the average fork took 1.137 milliseconds, while the
average thread create took .017 milliseconds (17 microseconds). In
this example, thread creates were about 67 times faster. Also, my
test case for threads did not include flags in the thread create
call to tell the kernel to create a new LWP with the thread and
bind the thread to the LWP. This would have added additional weight
to the call, bringing it closer to the fork time.
</p><p>Even if LWP creation closes the gap in creation times between
processes (forks) and threads, user threads still offer advantages
in resource utilization and scheduling.</p><p>Of course, the Linux SMP (and even uniprocessor) scheduler is
clever enough to optimize the scheduling of the threads on the same
CPU. This happens because by rescheduling a thread, there won't be
a TLB flush and basically no context switch at all&mdash;the virtual
memory addressing won't change. A thread switch is very lightweight
compared to a process switch, and the scheduler is aware of that.
The only things Linux does while switching between two threads (not
in strict order) are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Enter schedule().</p></li><li><p>Restore all registers of the new thread (stack
pointer and floating point included).</p></li><li><p>Update the task structure with the data of the new
thread.</p></li><li><p>Jump to the old entry point of the new
thread.</p></li></ul></div><p>Nothing more is done. The TLB is not touched, and the address
space and all the page tables remain the same. Here, the big
advantage of Linux is that it does the above very fast.
</p><p>Other UNIX systems are bloated by SMP locks, so the kernel
loses time getting to the task switch point. If that weren't true,
the Solaris kernel threads wouldn't be slower than the user-space
kernel threads. Of course, the kernel-based threads will scale the
load across multiple CPUs, but operating systems like Solaris pay a
big fixed cost on systems with few CPUs for the benefit of scaling
well with many CPUs. Basically, there is no technical reason why
Solaris kernel threads should be lighter than Linux kernel threads.
Linux is just doing the minimum possible operations in the context
switch path, and it's doing them fast.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c7c580.0x216e3d8"></a>Threaded Kernel</h2></div></div><p>Linux kernel threading has constantly improved. Let's look at
the different versions again:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>2.0.<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> had no kernel
threading.</p></li><li><p>2.2.<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> has kernel threading
added.</p></li><li><p>2.3.<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> is very
SMP-threaded.</p></li></ul></div><p>In 2.2.<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span>, many places are still
single-threaded, but 2.2.<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> kernels actually
scale well only on two-way SMPs. In 2.2.<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span>, the
IRQ/timer handling (for example) is <span   class="emphasis"><em>completely</em></span>
SMP-threaded, and the IRQ load is distributed across multiple CPUs.
</p><p>In 2.3.<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span>, most worthwhile code sections
within the kernel are being rewritten for SMP threading. For
example, all of the VM (virtual memory) is SMP-threaded. The most
interesting paths now have a much finer granularity and scale very
well.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c7c580.0x216eab8"></a>Performance Limitations</h2></div></div><p>For the sake of system stability, a kernel has to react well
in stress situations. It must, for instance, reduce priorities and
resources to processes that misbehave.</p><p>How does the scheduler handle a poorly written program
looping tightly and forking at each turn of the loop (thereby
forking off thousands of processes in a few seconds)? Obviously,
the scheduler can't limit the creation of processes time-wise,
e.g., a process every 0.5 seconds or similar.</p><p>After a fork, however, the &ldquo;runtime priority&rdquo; of the
process is divided between the parent and the child. This means the
parent/child will be penalized compared to the other tasks, and the
other tasks will continue to run fine up to the first recalculation
of the priorities. This keeps the system from stalling during a
fork flooding. The code for this is the concerned code section in
linux/kernel/fork.c:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/*
 "share" dynamic priority between parent
 * and child, thus the total amount of dynamic
 * priorities in the system doesn't change, more
 * scheduling fairness. This is only important
 * in the first time slice, in the long run the
 * scheduling behaviour is unchanged.
 */
current-&gt;counter &gt;&gt;= 1;
p-&gt;counter = current-&gt;counter;
</pre><p>Additionally, there is a per-<span   class="emphasis"><em>user</em></span> limit
of threads that can be set from
<span   class="bold"><b>init</b></span> before spawning the first
user process. It can be set with <b  >&nbsp;ulimit -u</b>
in bash. You can tell it that <b  >user moshe</b> can run
a maximum ten concurrent tasks (the count includes the shell and
every process run by the user).
</p><p>In Linux, the root user always retains some spare tasks for
himself. So, if a user spawns tasks in a loop, the administrator
can just log in and use the
<span   class="bold"><b>killall</b></span> command to remove all
tasks of the offending user. Due to the fact that the &ldquo;runtime
priority&rdquo; of the task is divided between the parent and the child,
the kernel reacts smoothly enough to handle this type of
situation.</p><p>If you wanted to amend the kernel to allow only one fork per
processor tick (usually one every 1/100th second; however, this
parameter is tunable), called a jiffie, you would have to patch the
kernel like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">

something, just change it!

kernel. In the next installment, we will take a more detailed look
at how the scheduler works. I can promise you some surprising
discoveries. Some of these discoveries caused me to revalue
