    Accidents, by definition, happen in all walks and trips of
    life....
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f5d580.0x2055500"></a></h2></div></div><p> The recent spate of NASA upsets in the
Martian environment reminds us that, in spite of the many
&ldquo;provable&rdquo; (sez who?) advances in academic risk analysis and
software development, our practical trade remains subject to the
most bizarre glitches. Accidents, by definition, happen in all
walks and trips of life, but once having happened, are revealed by
post-hoc scrutiny to have been eminently, nay, trivially
&ldquo;preventable&rdquo;. Next time, we boast, we'll avoid spilling the
salt, we'll bypass the banana skin under the ladder and we'll
secure the loose horseshoe that lost the last war. More space-age
specifically, we'll watch out for inelastic rubber washers, shun
rash global identifiers, and work around the quirks of FORTRAN FOR
loops, all of which have proved to be life- and dollar-threatening.
</p><p>Of course, digging deeper into fashionable post-Darwinian
theory, we must acknowledge that &ldquo;social evolution&rdquo;, without
which this column might have emerged as a mysterious henge in some
foreign field, is due to a long sequence of fortuitous accidents.
Random memic mutations, some say, guarantee the survival of fitter
crania, neural paradigms, languages, algorithms and software
engineering methodologies. Whether we consciously &ldquo;learn&rdquo; from
our mistakes or not, some argue that there is an ongoing natural
&ldquo;self-correctional&rdquo; process that converges to error-free nirvana.
Fat chance! The optimistic concepts of &ldquo;inevitable improvement&rdquo;
and &ldquo;human perfectibility&rdquo;, fashionable when the previous
millennium started [see Note], are hard to relinquish, although the
alternatives are so damned depressing, leading to a self-fulfilling
why-bother apathy.</p><p>The challenge for historians is selecting and recording
&ldquo;significant&rdquo; events. The so-called random elements (Luther's
constipation, Napoleon's insomnia, Hitler's rejected
watercolors...) seem to have a ridiculous, chaotic impact on the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>grand de&eacute;roulement</em></span>. My favorite
historian, Barbara Tuchman, warns against the <span   class="emphasis"><em>post
hoc</em></span> contingent narrative, but it's impossible to feign
ignorance of what happened next. What if, say, Saint Linus had
wealthy parents like Bill Gates? What if he had not grown up in the
fractal Swedish-Finnish isogloss?</p><p>One of the most expensive, embarrassing lessons from the
missing Mars probe mishaps was the lack of &ldquo;unit safety&rdquo;. We've
spent all these years ensuring type-safety (not to mention the
oxymoronic thread-safety), whereby oranges and lemons cannot be
added without deliberate, fruitless miscasting, yet it seems that a
given floating-point value was interpreted as
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Newtons</em></span> rather than
<span   class="emphasis"><em>pounds</em></span>. Or vice versa. Or was it an
understandable confusion between parsecs, meters, yards, chains,
rods, perches and poles? We'll get it right next time, unless there
are bright Martians anxious to resist our inferior
technology.</p><p><a href="3849s1.html" target="_self">Note</a></p></div></div>
