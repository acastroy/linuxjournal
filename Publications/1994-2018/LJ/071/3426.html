    Are you having trouble keeping your network under control?
    This article introduced NOCOL: the freeware network
    monitoring system which will help you keep instability at
    bay.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15fb580.0x16f33f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>NOCOL, Network Operation Center On-Line,
enables a designated machine to host a collection of network
monitoring agents. These agents can perform a variety of tasks,
from checking that a machine is &ldquo;up&rdquo; using the ICMP ping method
to ensuring that a remote web server is operating as it should by
requesting a test page. This allows problems on a network to be
diagnosed and reported in a variety of ways, be it by e-mail, web
page or dedicated terminal.
</p><p>The alerting system works via escalation. Normally, any data
reported is classed as INFO. However, if a service starts
misbehaving, it can be flagged as either WARNING, ERROR or
CRITICAL. If a problem is not dealt with, it will escalate (WARNING
will move up to ERROR, ERROR will move up to CRITICAL). For
example, you may have a machine which has to reboot itself
periodically. You would therefore expect NOCOL to complain that the
machine stops responding now and then. In this situation, you would
class such an event as a WARNING. You will then be kept aware when
reboots occur: if the event escalates up to ERROR or beyond, you'll
know something has gone seriously wrong.</p><p>Most routers and similar equipment today are SNMP (simple
network monitoring protocol) compatible, and several of the NOCOL
agents have the ability to interrogate such devices.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15fb580.0x16f35b0"></a>Security Considerations</h2></div></div><p>NOCOL does <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> need to run as root. The
few binaries that do need to be privileged are set SUID root during
the installation process. It is recommended that you create a user
called &ldquo;nocol&rdquo; on your system for all NOCOL-related activities,
including using it during installation.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15fb580.0x16f3710"></a>Preparing for Make</h2></div></div><p>NOCOL is available from ftp://ftp.navya.com/pub/. At the time
of this writing, the latest stable version was nocol-4.2.tar.gz,
which will be used for the purposes of this article.</p><p>NOCOL makes extensive use of Perl, so ensure that Perl is
installed before continuing. In the unlikely event your Linux
system does not already have Perl, obtain it from
<a href="http://www.perl.com/CPAN" target="_self">http://www.perl.com/CPAN/</a>.</p><p>Once you have the NOCOL archive safely sitting on your
proposed monitoring server (a 486/66DX machine with 32MB of memory
sufficed for us), perform the magic:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
gzip -dc nocol-4.2.tar.gz | tar xvf-
</pre><p>We installed NOCOL on a Red Hat 5.2 system, upgraded to allow
use of the Linux 2.2.1 kernel. Enter the freshly generated
nocol-4.2 directory, and then type:
<pre     class="programlisting">
 ./Configure
</pre>


You will then be asked a few simple questions regarding your
system:
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>Enter top-level
directory:</b></span> The NOCOL tree defaults to being located at
/usr/local/nocol, but you may adjust it to suit. Make sure the
&ldquo;nocol&rdquo; user has permission to write to any directory you
specify.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>Enter location of man
pages:</b></span> These reside under the main tree by default, but
you may prefer them in the more &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; location on your
system.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>Enter extension for man
pages:</b></span> I stuck with the default of <b  >n</b>
for this option.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>Enter FULLY QUALIFIED name of
your log host:</b></span> The server I set up for the main NOCOL
monitors was also used for logging purposes, and this option does
default to the host name of the installation machine. For
simplicity, accept the default.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>Where is your MAIL program
located?</b></span> For NOCOL's e-mail alerting system to function,
it needs access to the <span   class="bold"><b>mail</b></span>
binary. The default of /bin/mail should work with most Linux
installations.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>Where should the operational
e-mail go?</b></span> This e-mail address is for general NOCOL
messages. Set it as appropriate.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>Where should urgent/critical
e-mail go?</b></span> Similarly, this e-mail address is for the
urgent stuff (e.g., &ldquo;The web server has exploded!&rdquo;).</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>Which compiler would you like
to use?</b></span> Parts of the NOCOL system have been coded in C.
The default choice of <b  >cc</b> should suffice.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>Which compiler options do you
want (</b></span><b  >-DDEBUG</b><span   class="bold"><b>)?</b></span> This is actually for
developers, so accepting the default of <b  >-O</b> will
be fine.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>Where is Perl located on your
system?</b></span> Enter the path to your Perl binary here,
accepting the default of /usr/bin/perl if that is correct.</p></li></ul></div>

Once this is done, you are ready to compile the software.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15fb580.0x16f46e0"></a>Compilation and Installation</h2></div></div><p>Predictably, the compilation process can be set in motion by
typing:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
make
</pre><p>On our systems, <span   class="bold"><b>etherload</b></span> (a
tool to monitor Ethernet load) fails to compile.
<span   class="bold"><b>etherload</b></span> is not covered here, we
hope this problem will be rectified in a future release.
</p><p>Now install the software:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
make install
</pre><p>Use <span   class="bold"><b>su</b></span> to log in as root and
type:
<pre     class="programlisting">
make root
</pre>


Expect another failure due to etherload not compiling.
</p><p>That completes the installation procedure. Now all that
remains is getting NOCOL to do justice to your network.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15fb580.0x16f4b58"></a>Configuring the Monitors</h2></div></div><p>Sample configuration files for the monitors are installed in
/etc/samples under your proposed NOCOL tree. Take a look at these
to become familiar with how it works.</p><p>One of the first things you may want to monitor is whether
machines on your network are up and running. The traditional way to
do this is to see whether they are responding to a ping
request.</p><p>To deal with UNIX machines on your network (those running an
RPC port mapper), create a file called rpcpingmon-confg in the /etc
directory, typing something like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
POLLINTERVAL    300
kenny           kenny.your-network.com
kyle            kyle.your-network.com
cartman         123.123.123.123
</pre><p>The <b  >POLLINTERVAL</b> indicates how often NOCOL
should &ldquo;sweep&rdquo; the network. In our example, it will sweep every
300 seconds (5 minutes). Following that is a list of the machines
to monitor: the first column is the &ldquo;friendly name&rdquo; and the
second column contains the TCP/IP host name or IP address.
</p><p>For non-UNIX machines (routers, Windows boxes, etc.), you
should create a separate file called ippingmon-confg. The format is
the same.</p><p>NOCOL includes many other monitors (see The NOCOL Suite)
which you should investigate and configure to suit your needs. The
sample configuration files do a good job of explaining their
actions and how to set them up.</p><p><a href="3426s1.html" target="_self">The NOCOL Suite</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15fb580.0x1aed1c8"></a>Final Preparations</h2></div></div><p>A few minor scripts must be tweaked before NOCOL can start
analyzing your network. Again, these are all located under the
directory where you installed NOCOL.</p><p>The Perl script bin/keepalive_monitors handles the
auto-starting of the monitors. Around line 32, you will find the
following two lines (ignore wrapping):</p><pre     class="programlisting">
PROGRAMS="noclogd etherload ippingmon rpcpingmon nsmon ntpmon
portmon"
PROGRAMS="$PROGRAMS radiusmon hostmon tpmon"
</pre><p>Alter these lines to include only the monitors you have
actually configured. To match the two discussed here, you could
condense them to one line:
<pre     class="programlisting">
PROGRAMS="ippingmon rpcpingmon"
</pre>


The script bin/notifier deals with sending warning e-mails to the
addresses specified during configuration. By default, it will send
a single e-mail when a site has been marked &ldquo;critical&rdquo; for more
than two hours. If you are feeling confident with Perl, you can
specify additional addresses to contact after even more time has
elapsed. Specify these addresses in the AFTER<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span>
lines:
<pre     class="programlisting">
AFTER2="
AFTER3="
AFTER5="<span   class="emphasis"><em>emergency-team</em></span>@<span   class="emphasis"><em>your-network</em></span>.com"
</pre>


NOCOL comes with a custom crontab file which will automatically
carry out any housekeeping required, such as ensuring all the
monitors are running and rotating logs. To install it, enter the
/bin directory in your NOCOL tree and type:
<pre     class="programlisting">
su nocol
crontab crontab.nocol
</pre>


</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15fb580.0x1aed5e8"></a>Starting the Sweep</h2></div></div><p>To finally get NOCOL going, run the
<span   class="bold"><b>keepalive_monitors</b></span> script located
in the bin directory. Provided everything has gone well, the
monitors will get to work.</p><p>If this fails, type <b  >ps aux | grep nocol</b>
(to see if the monitors are running), go back and check that you
followed the instructions correctly.</p><p>Chances are, you will want to see what NOCOL is reporting.
The simplest tool is <span   class="bold"><b>netconsole</b></span>
which can be run either at the console or via a TELNET session. Run
it and enter your terminal type when prompted (vt220, for example).
The console screen will appear and will most likely be empty. The
default is to show only CRITICAL events.</p><p>Pressing the <b  >l</b> key lets you change the
viewing mode. Set it to level 4 (INFO), and you will see all the
information your configured monitors have gathered. See Listing 1
for an example. Play around with the levels until you find the one
that most suits your needs. The <b  >h</b> key will
display a comprehensive help screen.</p><p><a href="3426l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15fb580.0x1aeda60"></a>Linux's Serial Console Support</h2></div></div><p>During the installation here, I found an old ICL DRS-10
serial terminal hiding in a cupboard. This terminal, or an
equivalent, can be attached to a Linux box and used as a dedicated
monitoring screen.</p><p>The exact settings required in /etc/gettydefs depend on the
specifications of your terminal. For the DRS-10, we used the
following entry for Red Hat:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# 9600 baud Dumb Terminal entry
DT9600# B9600 CS8 CLOCAL # B9600 SANE -ISTRIP \
CLOCAL #@S login: #DT9600
</pre><p>Now we need to edit the /etc/inittab file to present a login
screen on the terminal. Be careful when playing with this file: it
is possible to render your Linux system unbootable. Add the entry:
<pre     class="programlisting">
S1:3456:respawn:/sbin/getty ttyS0 DT9600 vt220
</pre>


for a terminal connected to the first serial port (ttyS0).
</p><p>Finally, force <span   class="bold"><b>init</b></span> to
re-examine its configuration file by typing:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/sbin/telinit q
</pre><p>If all is well, your terminal should bring up a login prompt.
From there, you can bring up netconsole in the usual fashion.
</p><p>Setting up such a serial terminal is described in more detail
in the Text-Terminal HOWTO
(<a href="http://www.linuxhq.com/HOWTO/Text-Terminal-HOWTO.html" target="_self">www.linuxhq.com/HOWTO/Text-Terminal-HOWTO.html</a>).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15fb580.0x1aeded8"></a>Getting More Advanced</h2></div></div><p>NOCOL has a web interface, included in the archive, and
instructions for setting it up are found in the INSTALL file. In
essence, this is a web version of netconsole which can be
customized to look a bit more flashy (see Figure 1).</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="3426f1.large.jpg"><img src="3426f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1. Web Version of Netconsole</p></div></div>
</p><p>The <span   class="bold"><b>hostmon</b></span> part of NOCOL is
also very powerful. It allows you to install a Perl-based client on
machines on your network in order to monitor aspects such as
available disk space, mail queues, etc. The scripts can be extended
to monitor any custom software you may be running. (We added an
extension to monitor queues on our X.400/SMTP mail gateway
software.)</p><p>An API to the system is provided that allows you to script
your own monitors in Perl. Because of this, NOCOL has the power to
monitor anything.</p><p>As an example of NOCOL's flexibility, I coded an extension to
the <span   class="bold"><b>notifier</b></span> tool, which utilized
our internal SMS messaging system. This allowed text messages
describing CRITICAL problems to be sent to my mobile phone. This
was done by coding an e-mail front-end to the SMS gateway, so all
<span   class="bold"><b>notifer</b></span> had to do was fire off an
e-mail in the correct format.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15fb580.0x1aee400"></a>To Conclude</h2></div></div><p>In essence, NOCOL has proven itself to be an extremely useful
tool. It has alerted us to network problems as soon as they
occurred, and the fact that it is freeware (it comes under a
&ldquo;not-quite-GPL&rdquo; agreement) is just another example of great
software under Linux being available for no cost.</p><p><a href="3426s2.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
