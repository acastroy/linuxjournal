    Here's a way to store your CDs and tapes away forever, while
    still enjoying the music.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21ee580.0x22e6660"></a></h2></div></div><p>Imagine lying back on your sofa in the
living room with your remote control unit. You press the channel
selection button, and a synthesized voice speaks out,
&ldquo;Alternative&rdquo;. You keep pressing the channel-up button and the
voice speaks out different music categories: &ldquo;Children's&rdquo;,
&ldquo;Classical&rdquo; and others. You chose the &ldquo;Classical&rdquo; category and
press <b  >ENTER</b> on your remote control, and the
voice starts listing the albums in the same manner. You select
&ldquo;John Williams, Spanish Guitar Music&rdquo;, and the near CD-quality
guitar music starts playing.
</p><p>No, the music is not playing off some CD changer, and the
synthesized voice is actually interactive, responding to your
remote controller actions. The music stored is your complete CD
collection, plus those old tapes (somehow still around), digitized
and compressed as MP3 files. The whole show is controlled and
played by a Linux server hidden in your closet, connected by an
audio cable to your home entertainment amplifier.</p><p>As soon as I realized the scenario described above is already
within our reach, I decided to code the missing pieces and somehow
glue it all together.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21ee580.0x22e6870"></a>MouseREMOTE from X-10</h2></div></div><p>The remote control unit is the central part of my design. The
controller I used, called &ldquo;MouseREMOTE&rdquo;, is part of the
&ldquo;BigPicture&rdquo; package that lets you transmit audio/video signals
from your computer remotely to your TV. Being a &ldquo;control freak&rdquo;,
I purchased the whole package some time ago and set up all the
house lights to be remotely controlled. The remote mouse is
especially useful, as it performs like any other controller for
audio/video components (it can also control X-10-based home
automation devices). In addition to every other button commonly
found on a universal remote, it has a rubber mouse pad on the face
and two buttons on the back of the unit. The controller sends RF
signals when its buttons are pressed to the receiver unit which,
when its buttons are pressed, has a regular computer mouse
pass-through, so you can still use your regular serial or PS/2
mouse. The remote-mouse software packets will be inserted in the
stream of packets sent by your regular computer mouse.
Unfortunately, the MouseRemote comes with only the MS Windows
software to assign actions to different keys. I installed a
high-quality audio cable from the Linux sound card line-out
connector in the server room down to the living room amplifier
unit's RCA input.</p><p>That was all I had to do on the hardware side. For software
support, I had to modify the mouse-server program to accept the
codes sent by the MouseRemote unit and pipe them to an MP3 player
program, which will perform different functions depending on the
remote-mouse selections.</p><p><a href="3690t1.html" target="_self">Table 1</a></p><p>I determined the MouseRemote specification by reading codes
using the modified <span   class="bold"><b>gpm</b></span> program.
MouseRemote is detected as a bare-mouse type, and it returns
packets of three bytes per event. Table 1 shows the codes returned
for the events. As you can see, almost all of the keys return some
code, giving this remote unit tremendous potential
versatility.</p><p>There are few peculiarities: mouse button codes (left/right
buttons located at the bottom of the controller unit) are
transmitted three times in a row. Only one button can be pressed at
a time; the other one is ignored while the first one is being
pressed. You can press and hold one mouse button and press any key.
If you hold down mouse buttons, the codes will not start repeating;
only mouse pad (mouse move) codes repeat with no apparent delay.
All other keys are repeating with a short delay of approximately
1/20 of a second.</p><p>The mouse movement pad detects three levels of pressure that
can be used by the mouse driver software to accelerate movement.
These levels set bits 0, 1 and 2 of the second and third byte in
the mouse packet. Those bytes are used to determine the difference
in movement between two consecutive packets, so the firmer the
pressure, the faster the movement appears.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21ee580.0x22e6be0"></a>Modifying gpm</h2></div></div><p>I decided to modify mouse server gpm (version 1.13). The key
function added is <span   class="bold"><b>x10codes</b></span> in the
file gpm.c (see Listing 1). The function argument
<span   class="emphasis"><em>data</em></span> is an array of three bytes making up the
current mouse packet. The detection of the MouseRemote device is
not deterministic. I rely on the property that all its buttons
return codes in the specific range; that is, the range of the
possible, but not probable, combination of codes returned by the
normal mouse movement. In particular, the first code is always in
the range of 44 to 47, with the third code always being 0x3F. A
regular mouse would have to be moved quickly at just the right
speed in order to get the same code out. In the unlikely case it
happens, the second level of safety is the existence of a named
pipe, /dev/x10. If the pipe does not exist, the packet will be
passed on for normal processing. I used that named pipe to connect
to a reader of remote-mouse codes.</p><p><a href="3690l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21ee580.0x22e6e48"></a>Transforming mp3blaster into Remote
Player</h2></div></div><p>Of all MP3 player programs available for Linux, only
<span   class="bold"><b>mp3blaster</b></span> has a user interface
nice enough for easy control of directories and files to be played.
The program supports multiple groups and can interactively select
among directories. I decided to use both features. All albums are
stored in separate groups, and at any time, I can toggle to
directory browsing and select albums hierarchically. The
prerecorded voice files are good guides for where you are and what
you are doing (see Speech Synthesis).</p><p>Given that all your MP3 files reside in some hierarchical
directory structure, say at /home/mp3, you need to set the
environment variable <b  >MP3_ROOT</b> to it. That way,
the player will know where the files are, and during the directory
browse, it will not allow you to accidentally change directories to
one above it. (Remember, we are physically too far from the
keyboard and display to fix any mishap.)</p><p>The mp3blaster is invoked with the option
<b  >-x</b> which I added to activate all the remote
features.</p><p>In order to get full use of the groups features of
mp3blaster, you need to manually set the current working directory
to the MP3_ROOT directory (where your music hierarchy starts),
start mp3blaster and press the <b  >F1</b>,
<b  >F5</b> keys. The <b  >F5</b> function key
will add all directories as groups, thus effectively listing all
your albums. Then, you can save the list by pressing the
<b  >F6</b> key. So now, you would start mp3blaster with
the following syntax:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/usr/bin/mp3blaster -l
</pre><p>You can run the program from the
<span   class="bold"><b>init</b></span> script if you wish, or from
an idle console; it doesn't matter, since it will connect to the
remote control unit and perform its function in the background.
Now, using your remote controller, you are able to browse the
directories and play songs. As you will see, the speech synthesis
is also coded in to give you feedback.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>mp3blaster</b></span> has two modes of
operation: group and file. The group mode of operation accepts the
following remote controller keys:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Channel +: selects next album (group). Voice will
announce album name.</p></li><li><p>Channel -: selects previous album (group). Voice
will announce album name.</p></li><li><p>Play/Enter: plays the whole album.</p></li><li><p>A*B: this key toggles between group and file
selection modes.</p></li></ul></div><p>The file selection mode is more complicated, as we are
allowed to traverse directory structure and play arbitrary albums.
The remote keys accepted in this mode are:
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Channel +: selects next subdirectory. Voice will
say its name.</p></li><li><p>Channel -: selects previous subdirectory. Voice
will say its name.</p></li><li><p>A*B: this key toggles between group and file
selection modes.</p></li><li><p>POWER: switch to groups mode.</p></li><li><p>Play/Enter: enter the subdirectory and play all mp3
files there.</p></li><li><p>Shift: step back one directory level.</p></li></ul></div>

During play, the following keys are available:
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Play: continue playing after a pause.</p></li><li><p>Stop: stop playing, return to the mode where we
initiated playing.</p></li><li><p>Pause: temporarily stop playing.</p></li><li><p>Volume +: increase volume.</p></li><li><p>Volume -: decrease volume.</p></li><li><p>Rew: play previous song.</p></li><li><p>FF: play next song.</p></li></ul></div>

Technically speaking, I added two threads to the mp3player program.
One thread is always busy waiting for the remote codes from the
/dev/x10 pipe. As soon as it gets them, it sets some variables used
by the player class. The other thread is looking for the sound
files (I call them voice files) that need to be &ldquo;spoken&rdquo;. In
essence, via some mutexes and signals, the player requests
presynthesized sound waves to be sent to /dev/audio, and this
thread is making sure they actually end up there. (All voice files
are pre-recorded and stored in a known location.) Voice files are
spoken representations of directory names, named after the music
categories and artists, and contain their songs.
</p><p>Looking at the code, the process of inserting actions into
the input loop of mp3blaster can be viewed as somewhat hacky, but
most codes are just inserted as keys that would be pressed for an
equivalent action from the keyboard anyway. The number of changes
is rather large to be printed here, so please see the file
src/main.cc for details.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21ee580.0x26e0430"></a>Speech Synthesis</h2></div></div><p>When wanting to browse your mp3 music albums with no computer
monitor to guide you, the natural substitute for vision is the
voice. I decided to use <span   class="bold"><b>festival</b></span>,
an excellent speech synthesis package. It is not only a current
research development project that is growing and improving daily,
but one you can actually use as soon as you install it.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>festival</b></span> can generate speech
on the fly, as you type any text interactively, or you can pipe in
a text file and it will synthesize it. None of these real-time
approaches seems to be fast enough for interactive menu selection.
I needed immediate voice response, and generation on the fly
introduced a delay proportional to the length of the album names,
noticeable and annoyingly long for normal use. The solution was to
create a subdirectory containing all voice files to be used during
the browsing. This way, the MP3 player program does not have to
call festival to generate each album name as we browse it, but can
use wave files cached in that specific directory. A drawback to
this approach is the disk space taken up for the voice files, but
that space is negligible in comparison to the actual MP3 files
which amount to 50 to 60MB per album.</p><p>Once you generate voice files using the festival program, you
can test each of them by simply piping them to /dev/audio. Also,
you may want to change diphone for some albums (I found the Spanish
diphone to make much better pronunciation for the groups of
International albums). Alternatively, you could manually record all
your voice files, thus eliminating the need for a speech synthesis
program.</p><p>The Perl script in Listing 2 is used to traverse all the
subdirectories under the MP3 files root directory and in creating
all necessary voice files used by the mp3blaster player.</p><p><a href="3690l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2</a></p><p>In order to generate necessary voice files, you would run
this script every time you add an album or change the directory
structure. You can run the script with the option
<b  >-clean</b> to ensure all old files are deleted
before creating a new set.</p><p>All voice files are stored in your root mp3 directory under
the subdirectory .vocals. They are vocalized interpretations of all
subsequent subdirectories, and thus all the album names as well
(they are just subdirectories at some terminal node, and they
contain only MP3 files).</p><p>The Perl script first creates text files (original
subdirectory name with the extension .txt). They contain a slightly
modified name stripped of all non-alpha characters. This is done to
help the speech synthesis program generate more precise sounds.
Lastly, the u-law audio files are created based on the content of
those files. If you are not satisfied with how it sounds, you can
change the phonetics inside the text files, delete the voice file
and rerun the script in order to get the optimal
pronunciation.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21ee580.0x26e0900"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>The technology to do almost anything with the music is
already available. In my opinion, without Linux and open-source
software, the task of building such a remote-directed MP3 player
would be much more difficult. Since my Linux server is up 24/7, it
makes sense to use it any time I want to listen to music as well.
Although the system I dedicated for it is a rather modest one
(Cyrix 6x86 running at 166MHz), the MP3 player is using around 40%
of the CPU time when playing, and there are no audible
interruptions even when concurrently serving web pages. In addition
to compressing all my CD collections and storing them on my Linux
server as MP3 files, I also digitized my old tapes and, after some
processing of the sound in order to improve it, stored them in the
same music hierarchy tree. Finally, I could remove all the CDs and
tapes from my living room and store them away for good. Now, every
musical piece is quickly accessible by a touch of a
remote-controller button.</p><p><a href="3690s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
