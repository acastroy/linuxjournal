    If you find Internet advertising annoying, time wasting and
    resource-consuming, get rid of it.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2362580.0x245a4a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>No matter how much you have, Internet
bandwidth never seems to be enough. At home, I dial up on an oldish
analog exchange to the Internet, rarely getting connections better
than 4800 bps; at the office, I have a (shared) 64KB leased line to
our U.S. office and thence to the Internet. However, no matter
where I surf (it's part of my job), I have always wished there were
a way to avoid waiting for pages to display while loading banner ad
graphics from the remote server.
</p><p>I am running an old, completely hacked version of Red Hat
(2.0 to be precise) with kernel 2.2.10 on my 66MHz 486 PC at home.
I use this system for browsing (mainly using Lynx), software
development and fooling around with Linux. My wife and two children
also use it, primarily for browsing and e-mail using one of the
web-based e-mail services with Netscape Communicator.</p><p>Since I first installed Linux on this system a few years ago,
I've been running the Apache web server to serve local content.
More recently, I've also enabled Apache's caching Proxy module to
maintain a local cache of commonly accessed documents, speeding up
Internet access somewhat. The version of Apache I'm running is
1.3.3 (yes, I should upgrade to the latest and greatest, but
there's no pressing hurry).</p><p>The Apache web server
(<a href="http://www.apache.org" target="_self">http://www.apache.org/</a>)
is a well-known HTTP server and is part of most, if not all, Linux
distributions. Along with being the world's most popular web
server, running on over 56% of web sites (Netcraft survey at
<a href="http://www.netcraft.com" target="_self">http://www.netcraft.com/</a>),
Apache also has features which helped me replace graphics from
well-known banner ad sites with an innocuous local graphic.</p><p>Since the distribution I'm running is so old, I will describe
the methodology of replicating this on a more modern distribution,
namely Red Hat 6.0. Most other popular distributions of Linux will
require the same or similar steps.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2362580.0x245a7c0"></a>Background</h2></div></div><p>In order to use Apache for this purpose, I had to set it up
as an HTTP Proxy, using <span   class="bold"><b>mod_proxy</b></span>,
and enable and use the URL rewriting engine built into Apache
(<span   class="bold"><b>mod_rewrite</b></span>).</p><p>In a nutshell, you must first set up Apache to act as a proxy
server for the browsers on your local network (or for a single
system, which is what I do at home) and tell the client browsers to
use that Apache host as a proxy. Then use the powerful mod_rewrite
URL rewriting engine to search for banner ad HTTP requests (these
match the URLs of well-known banner ad server hosts) and substitute
a local graphic for them. With this done, you can sit back and
watch your web pages flow into your browser, while that irritating
advertising is automatically replaced with a more soothing and
altogether more relevant graphic.</p><p>You will need to be root while following the steps discussed
here.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2362580.0x245aa28"></a>Enabling Proxy</h2></div></div><p>The first step is loading and enabling the proxy module
(mod_proxy) which is part of Apache. In most distributions, you
enable mod_proxy by appending the following line to your Apache
server's configuration file (/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf or
/usr/local/apache/etc/httpd.conf):</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ProxyRequests on
</pre><p>To check if the module was loaded okay, restart the web
server with the command:
<pre     class="programlisting">
killall -1 httpd
</pre>


Check the last few lines of the Apache error log (usually in
<span   class="bold"><b>../logs/error_log</b></span> or
<span   class="bold"><b>../var/log/error_log</b></span> relative to
the <span   class="bold"><b>httpd.conf</b></span> file), and if there
are no errors, celebrate! Apache's proxy feature is enabled. This
has been tested on Red Hat Linux 6.0 and Debian's &ldquo;Potato&rdquo;
GNU/Linux 2.2, and it should work with SuSE Linux 6.1.
</p><p>If you get an error message like:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Invalid command 'ProxyRequests', perhaps misspelled or defined
by a module not included in the server configuration
</pre><p>then you need to either locate the Apache Proxy module, or
download and install a version of Apache which has mod_proxy
available. Installation is outside the scope of this article. See
the Apache HOWTO at
<a href="http://www.apache.org/docs-1.2/mod/mod_proxy.html" target="_self">www.apache.org/docs-1.2/mod/mod_proxy.html</a>.
</p><p>Once you have the Apache proxy configured and running, you
can tell your client browsers to use it. In Netscape Communicator,
select Edit/Preferences/Advanced/Proxies and &ldquo;Manual Proxy
Configuration&rdquo;. Click on the &ldquo;View&rdquo; button, and enter the name
of the host running Apache in the text entry boxes for &ldquo;FTP
Proxy:&rdquo; and &ldquo;HTTP Proxy:&rdquo;, using 80 as the port number for
each.</p><p>For Lynx, edit the global Lynx configuration file found by
default in /etc/lynx.cfg or /usr/local/lib/lynx.cfg and change
these lines</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#http_proxy:http://some.server.dom:port/
#http://some.server.dom:port/
#ftp_proxy:http://some.server.dom:port/
</pre><p>to look like:
<pre     class="programlisting">
http_proxy:http://apache.my.dom:80/
http://apache.my.dom:80/
ftp_proxy:http://apache.my.dom:80/
</pre>


Then, replace apache.my.dom with the name of the host running the
Apache server. Similar techniques will apply to other web
browsers&mdash;consult the browser's manual for details.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2362580.0x245b058"></a>Configuring the Rewrite Engine</h2></div></div><p>Now that you have the Apache Proxy configured and the
browsers set up to use it, you can get to the heart of the matter,
which is redirecting banner ads to a local graphic, saving yourself
bandwidth, time and money.</p><p>Before you actually decide which URLs to redirect, you need
to do the basic setup for
<span   class="bold"><b>mod_rewrite</b></span>. Add the following
lines to Apache's configuration file, httpd.conf:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
RewriteEngine on
RewriteLog logs/rewrite_log
RewriteLogLevel 1
</pre><p>You may need to twiddle the file name in the RewriteLog
directive a bit to conform to your distribution's file system
conventions. For example, in the default Apache build, the
appropriate directive would be:
<pre     class="programlisting">
RewriteLog var/log/rewrite_log
</pre>


In addition, you can increase the RewriteLogLevel from 1 up to a
maximum of 9 to get more detailed information on what the rewrite
engine is doing, which helps in debugging. However, once you are
satisfied with the way it is working, it is a good idea to reduce
the RewriteLogLevel to 0. This will stop all logging and reduce the
load on the Apache server.
</p><p>Having done this, you are now ready to redirect banner ads.
Let us assume you want to redirect all graphics originating from
URLs
http://<span   class="emphasis"><em>anything</em></span>.unclick.net/adi_<span   class="emphasis"><em>anything</em></span>,
http://<span   class="emphasis"><em>anyhost</em></span>.unclick.net/jump_<span   class="emphasis"><em>anything</em></span>
and
http://image_<span   class="emphasis"><em>anything</em></span>.click2com.net/<span   class="emphasis"><em>anything</em></span>.
I chose to display the &ldquo;Powered by Apache&rdquo; logo (which comes with
Apache in the file icons/apache_pb.gif) in place of the
advertisements. Add the lines shown in Listing 1 to your httpd.conf
file to display the Apache GIF instead of images from these
sources, where, of course, you replace apache.your.dom with the
name of the Apache server you have set up.</p><p><a href="3657l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a></p><p>As you can see, each redirection consists of two parts: a
RewriteCond and a RewriteRule. The RewriteCond identifies the host
(<b  >%{HTTP_HOST}</b>) we want to redirect from. The
third string in the directive is the name of the host, given as a
regular expression. In regular expressions, the period (.) stands
for any character, so we use <b  >"."</b> to denote a
literal period in the domain name. <b  >".*"</b> stands
for any arbitrary string, and the caret (^) forces a match at the
beginning of the host name. Thus, for example, the regular
expression <b  >^image.*\.click2com\.net</b> matches the
hosts image.click2com.net, images.click2com.net and
images05.adverts.click2com.net, but does not match
ads.image.click2com.net.</p><p>Once we have found a host with RewriteCond, we use the
following RewriteRule directive to see if any part of the URL
matches the first string (regular expression) in the rule; if it
does, we redirect to the appropriate (local) graphic. For example,
having found a host in the unclick.net domain in the first
RewriteCond, we then check in the RewriteRule which follows it if
the string
<b  >/ad<i><tt>anything</tt></i></b> occurs
anywhere in the URL. If it does, we redirect the Apache proxy to
send instead the image /icons/apache_pb.gif from the proxy host. Of
course, you can use any image you like, and it need not necessarily
be on the proxy server host&mdash;any URL is fine. The final [R]
converts the HTTP request into an HTTP REDIRECT (302). Don't worry
if you don't know HTTP; I don't either, but it's required.</p><p>You can add as many rewrite conditions and rules as you like
to redirect banner ad sites. I'm still looking for a comprehensive
listing of well-known ad URLs&mdash;let me know if you can add
some.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2362580.0x245b948"></a>Notes</h2></div></div><p>The method of setting up the Apache proxy I have described is
purely for the sake of redirecting banner ads. The Proxy module has
many other features which are not covered here. Perhaps the most
useful of these is its ability to cache often-accessed documents on
a local disk, and further reduce bandwidth and time needed to
browse the Web. Try playing around with the cache directives in
httpd.conf, and judge the effect on your browsing speed.</p><p>Also, the method of configuring the rewrite engine I have
described here is only one way. This method may not be optimal, as
it is the result of one day's fooling around with mod_rewrite, but
it works and serves my purpose.</p><p>mod_rewrite is an extremely powerful and versatile rewriting
engine, and we have seen only one application of its features in
this small redirection application. More information on Apache, its
modules in general, and mod_rewrite in particular, can be found in
Resources.</p><p>Another tip you may find useful is to combine the two
secondary Apache config files, access.conf and srm.conf, into the
primary config file, httpd.conf. This speeds up Apache quite a bit,
especially on heavily loaded servers. In order to do this, copy the
contents of access.conf and srm.conf into httpd.conf, preferably
somewhere at the end, although location doesn't really matter. Now
add the following two lines near the beginning of
httpd.conf:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
AccessConfig    /dev/null
ResourceConfig  /dev/null
</pre><p>Again, location isn't very important, as long as you don't
insert those lines into the middle of a multi-line directive.
</p><p>A rather whimsical description of this approach is available
at the Apache site, listed in Resources (see &ldquo;why are there three
config files?&rdquo;).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2362580.0x245bc60"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>I have been using Apache to redirect Internet advertising for
a while now, and am very happy with the results. Browsing on my
slow link at home is a much more enjoyable experience with highly
reduced wait time.</p><p>When I first started using Apache, I never expected I would
be able to use it pro-actively for this particular purpose. Ralf
Engelschall, the author of mod_rewrite, didn't expect his
brain-child to be used for this purpose, either. The fact that it
can underlines once again the beauty of the philosophy behind UNIX,
Linux and Apache&mdash;if you make the parts general purpose enough and
give the facility of combining them, their sum invariably becomes
greater than the whole.</p><p><a href="3657s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
