generator) is a software development tool that connects programs
written in C, C++ and Objective-C with a variety of high-level
programming languages. It is often used with common scripting
languages such as Perl, Python and Tcl/Tk. In addition, it has been
extended to include languages such as Java, Eiffel and Guile.
</p><p>SWIG is used to create high-level interpreted programming
environments for systems integration, and as a tool for building
user interfaces and testing. It is distributed as open source and
can be downloaded from
<a href="http://www.swig.org" target="_self">http://www.swig.org/</a>.</p><p>In the following sections, I will discuss some of SWIG's
features and my personal experience with it as a testing engineer
at Zero Knowledge Systems
(<a href="http://www.zeroknowledge.com" target="_self">http://www.zeroknowledge.com/</a>)
for the Freedom Software.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f8e580.0x20868c8"></a>Environment and Mission</h2></div></div><p>At work, I have to test e-mail, web, IRC, FTP, proxy servers
and TELNET clients. My machine is a Pentium powered by a 266MHz
processor running Red Hat Linux with 128MB of RAM. My
responsibilities include testing the source code currently being
developed&mdash;hundreds of thousands of lines of code in a
mission-critical system, with no room for errors. Given that &ldquo;the
strength of a security system is the strength of its weakest
link&rdquo;, there was no place for flaws. The code cannot be tested
manually, because of the distributed architecture of client and
servers. Thus, there was an urgent need for an efficient tool that
would automate testing procedures. This tool had to be
platform-independent and compliant with both C and C++.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f8e580.0x20869d0"></a>Then There was Light!</h2></div></div><p>Shopping around, I learned about SWIG from its web page. The
source can be easily compiled for Linux; it is about 2MB in size.
SWIG is multi-platform, i.e., there is no need to duplicate test
procedures for Linux and Windows; it supports C and C++; and it can
be integrated into MSVC++ (Microsoft Visual C++). SWIG proved to be
the perfect tool.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f8e580.0x2086ad8"></a>Let Us SWIG Together</h2></div></div><p>SWIG accepts as input an ANSI C-like interface file that
describes the functions and objects constituting the program to be
tested. The interface file can also include SWIG directives and
documentation. SWIG wraps the functions in another C program. When
both of these programs (the source code and the wrapped source
code) get compiled, SWIG creates a library file that can be called
from the Tcl shell.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f8e580.0x2086be0"></a>Step By Step</h2></div></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The Program: start by writing your C program to be
tested. One thing to note is you have to modify the name of the
&ldquo;main&rdquo; function. Listing 1 is an example of a C program.</p></li></ul></div><p><a href="3535l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Interface file: in order to allow SWIG control over
this program, we have to write an &ldquo;interface file&rdquo;. An interface
file for our C functions might look like the one in Listing
2.</p></li></ul></div>

<a href="3535l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2</a>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Build a Tcl module: at the prompt, type the
following:</p></li></ul></div>

<pre     class="programlisting">
swig -tcl8 my_interface.i
</pre>


This command will create a Tcl 8.0-compliant library.
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Compile wrappers for Tcl using the commands</p></li></ul></div>

<pre     class="programlisting">
        gcc -fpic -c example.c example_wrap.c\
           -I/usr/local/include
        gcc -shared example.o example_wrap.o\
           -o example.so
</pre>


<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Call the Tcl shell by typing
<b  >tclsh</b>.</p></li><li><p>Load the example.so library with the command</p></li><li><p><b  >load ./example.so example</b></p></li></ul></div>

Now, feel free to call the functions implemented in the C program:

calling it provides. The company had a secure mail system to be
tested. In this system, all e-mail messages go through several
servers before they reach their final destination, and they are
encrypted each time they pass through a new routing server.</p><p>My approach toward testing this environment was to write an
e-mail generator program in C which I called GenerateMail.
GenerateMail accepts several options such as the number of To, CC
and Bcc copies, the number of file attachments, etc. It produces a
file ready to be piped to Sendmail.</p><p>A typical GenerateMail run would be something like:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
tclsh generate_mail -Attachments 3 -CC 2\
   -output file msg.txt
tclsh send_mail msg.txt
</pre><p>The first line creates an e-mail message file. The message
has three target addresses and two carbon copies. Three binary
files were attached as MIME attachments. By default, GenerateMail
uses bitmaps that are in its current directory.
</p><p>The second line calls Sendmail with the appropriate options
to accept that mail message and send it on to the wire. Doing that,
it was easy to generate a large number of mail messages. In
addition, comparing the source and destination message checksums
was very easy with the help of SWIG.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f8e580.0x2087898"></a>SWIG Advantages</h2></div></div><p>SWIG's advantages are evident in a number of ways. It adds
flexibility to testing procedures, it can be used for prototyping
and helps in system integration. Very few modifications of the code
are needed. Moreover, SWIG directives can be easily
extended.</p><p>On the other hand, the wrapper has some limitations when it
comes to C and C++ programs, because SWIG's author did not mean it
to be a fully blown parser.</p><p>The following are some examples of unacceptable input.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Functions with variable-length parameters will not
work.</p></li><li><p>Function pointers and array declarations are
problematic; they could be hidden from the interface file by using
typdef.</p></li><li><p>Most features of C++ such as templates and operator
overloading are not supported.</p></li></ul></div><p>Nevertheless, SWIG is still a powerful tool, especially since
it can be integrated with Microsoft Visual C++.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f8e580.0x207e5a0"></a>The End</h2></div></div><p>SWIG is a powerful tool that runs on multiple platforms and
supports multiple languages. It served my goal of testing the
system within the specified time constraints. It is a neat tool
that still has much room for expansion. If you are in the business
of testing, prototyping SWIG is the way to go.</p></div></div>
