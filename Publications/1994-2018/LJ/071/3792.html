Wait! This cannot be, for Linux has no applications! This is
well-known, a fact we've heard since the days of &ldquo;Windows is the
future, get used to it!&rdquo; and is probably the reason Linux has no
user base and has failed miserably in the server market and the
stock market. Hence, one must conclude that this spreadsheet is in
actuality a spectre, and although you <span   class="emphasis"><em>think</em></span>
it's real, it is a fantasy, as are the millions of Linux users you
thought existed and the newbie Linux gazillionaires.
</p><p>The subject for today is the Xess Spreadsheet for Linux,
Standard Edition. We must specify Standard Edition, because there
is also a professional edition which handles very large projects.
However, the standard edition deals with up to 1024 columns and
99,999 rows per sheet, with 512 sheets per workbook, which should
be more than enough for your next stat class assignment. Xess has
been good about supporting several distributions of Linux, so you
can almost certainly run it regardless of what distribution you
have (which is, if I may opine, the way things ought to be). What
is so special about this spreadsheet, and why might you prefer it
to the StarOffice or Applixware spreadsheets?</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb5b580.0xc53df0"></a>First Impressions</h2></div></div><p>To be honest, my very first impression was &ldquo;Ack! What a
stupid license!&rdquo; You know the kind, those last-minute &ldquo;installing
this software indicates agreement&rdquo; licenses full of the weirdest,
off-the-wall restrictions, including a ban on un-assembling (do
they mean disassembling?), de-compiling (if you figure out how to
do this, let me know) and reverse engineering. Forbidding these
things is rather absurd, and the legal reasoning behind these
last-minute licenses is about as meaningful as the reasoning of
little kids who always say, &ldquo;I called it!&rdquo;</p><p>Disassembly of a program (though not necessarily of a
spreadsheet) is a superb way to begin learning assembly code, while
reverse engineering had a very large hand in promoting the PC
phenomenon (imagine if no one had reverse engineered the first IBM
PC to enable cloning). De-compiling would be so clever and an
excellent way of open sourcing binaries, but as far as I know, it
hardly works. So why forbid these things, since they're no threat
at all and the last-minute license probably isn't legally binding?
Just in case. Gotta call it. The other problem is the bit about
reserving the right to revoke the license, which is irritating. I'd
certainly not depend on a product if someone had the right to
revoke it whenever, but apparently that's how commercial software
is. CD manufacturers don't bother with this licensing nonsense, and
it hasn't hurt them any. At least the license is short, as is the
small-footprint installation of the spreadsheet.</p><p>My second impression was &ldquo;Geez, I wish we had this in
college.&rdquo; Instead, we had silly Windows boxes, with &ldquo;blinky the
dancing paper clip&rdquo; et al. UNIX has such an academic history, I
don't understand why it isn't the de facto standard in
universities, but for some reason it isn't, although recent student
protests may chase Windows out of colleges. Now that we have Linux,
a free and superior OS, there's no excuse to keep running Windows
in the schools (besides, a free-source OS is politically very
correct). And, what with high-quality applications like Xess (or,
for example, Word Perfect and the office suites), there's even less
of an excuse.</p><p>Even though it comes from the commercial sphere, Xess is one
more brick in a solid foundation of Linux applications. A free OS
running a high-quality commercial application is, after all,
preferable to a buggy, proprietary OS running a bloated proprietary
application (with embedded flight simulator). What you may infer
from the preceding sentence is that Xess is a high-quality
spreadsheet, so operating from this assumption, let's have a
look-see.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb5b580.0xc54000"></a>Xess Can Do</h2></div></div><p>It's honestly a bit dull to list everything a package can do,
and it risks sounding more like an advertisement than any sort of
review. Still, if you're thinking of using a spreadsheet, you
probably want to know what it's capable of doing. There isn't room
to list everything, so I recommend going to
<a href="http://www.ais.com/Xess/xess4_features.html" target="_self">www.ais.com/Xess/xess4_features.html</a>
for the complete list. I'll try to cover the major points
here.</p><p>Xess looks like any other spreadsheet (Excel, Lotus,
StarCalc, Applixware Spreadsheets, etc.), so its interface is
obvious and intuitive. Xess has all the functions one expects of a
spreadsheet, including some outstanding ones. At the basic level,
Xess has the standard functions complete with conditional and
Boolean operators, iterative and double-precision calculation,
inter-sheet cell linking and formula constraint checking. The
mathematical functions include the standards found on a good pocket
calculator, such as exponents, logs, trig, matrices, as well as
sigmoid, gamma and log gamma functions. The matrix operations in
particular are extensive, even including Fourier transforms,
correlation matrices, curve fitting and linear equation solving.
Financial functions include the usual exciting things like rates of
return, present and future values, interest rates, yields and all
that. Statistical functions are thorough, and on the whole, there
is more offered than I remember finding in StarOffice or
Applixware.</p><p>Maybe it's funny that Xess is distributed by a company called
Business Logic Corporation, because Xess, while wholly adequate in
the financial department, is rather well-suited to scientific,
statistical and mathematical operations. In any event, the test of
whether a spreadsheet could be useful to me is if it can be my
pocket calculator. Xess comes closer to substituting for my pocket
calculator than other Linux spreadsheets, and even has some stat
and matrix functions my calculator doesn't have.</p><p>Xess is largely a calculation-oriented spreadsheet. The
calculation engine must be praised, because it's actually fast,
although the graphing capabilities are less extensive. The graphics
basics are covered, and you can make the standard scatter, line,
area, bar, stacked bar, histogram, pie, surface, contour, polar,
hi-lo, control and box graphs, and there is much technical
flexibility. Still, there isn't much aesthetic control beyond
standard representation, which is fine. As for calculation, there
are more functions than I can count, nearly 250, all of which are
nicely referenced in the manual. I would be more than surprised if
someone found the calculation capabilities inadequate.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb5b580.0xc54268"></a>Xtensible</h2></div></div><p>Xess is endowed by its creators with certain indispensable
utilities, such as direct read and write of Excel and Lotus
spreadsheets (Excel 97 and WK4, but don't count on VB macros coming
across), filtered text import and export, as well as HTML and LaTeX
output. Obviously, it can print and do the usual generic
things.</p><p>One big advantage for business users is that through the use
of xsBasic, you can have macros to automate repetitive tasks (and
many people find business boring precisely because of the endless
streams of repetitive tasks). xsBasic is an expensive add-in ($200
US), but it's not bad for a Basic.</p><p>As a language, Basic has been constantly maligned, but I
found the linear thinking involved in using Basic made the jump to
assembly code particularly easy and obvious. The newer versions of
Basic are similar enough to C that again, the transition is easy.
In fact, when I finally had a computer with a hard drive and enough
memory for a C compiler, I used to tell would-be C programmers,
&ldquo;Don't get intimidated; it's just like Basic.&rdquo; (Of course,
hackers who overheard would remark, &ldquo;What Basic are you using,
man?&rdquo;) So, I think Basic is not such a bad language. It's
particularly simple, and for some reason the business world demands
simplicity to the point of idiocy, so (pardon the half-pun) Basic
fits the bill. This particular implementation concentrates on
dealing with the objects of the spreadsheet, from the borders and
buttons to boxes, graphs and widgets. If you need this, you can buy
it; contact AIS for information.</p><p>Apparently, some people are making interesting integration
projects with Xess, although it's odd to me that anyone gets
excited over spreadsheets. If you get really excited, there's even
an API you can use that's based on the X Window System
protocol.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb5b580.0xc54478"></a>Across Platforms</h2></div></div><p>Another characteristic of Xess is that it is available across
platforms. This includes not only the typical Linux and Windows NT,
but also SunOS, Solaris, HP-UX, IRIX 5 and higher, SCO UNIX,
Digital UNIX, Ultrix, OpenVMS, VMS, DG/UX and AIX. Check the web
page for chip set and version specifics. You can probably put this
spreadsheet on all the computers, even at extraordinarily diverse
offices (and if you're using an unsupported platform such as C64
for some mission-critical application, I'd sure like to hear about
it). This is probably more than the StarOffice and Applixware
spreadsheets support.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb5b580.0xc54580"></a>Ad Infinitum</h2></div></div><p>While it pains me to take sides in commercial affairs
(because this implies siding against people who have put part of
their lives into creating something which gets labeled
&ldquo;second-rate&rdquo; or &ldquo;not as good&rdquo;), I am always compelled because
it's important to help people make informed decisions; in this case
the choice between Xess and other spreadsheets such as StarOffice
and Applixware. While it's true that with the latter two you get
whole office suites, their spreadsheet packages do not really
compare. Applixware is probably the easiest to use, and StarOffice
has a <span   class="emphasis"><em>lot</em></span> of features (not to mention being
free of charge, which makes it nearly impossible to compete with),
but Xess delivers more functionality and appears to calculate
faster (it's hard to be sure on Linux boxes, which are already so
fast). AIS concentrates exclusively on this one spreadsheet,
whereas StarOffice and Applixware have whole office suites, so it
stands to reason that the latter two would be hard-pressed to pay
as much attention to the spreadsheet parts of their suites, while
AIS can go beyond the basics and develop according to user needs
faster. I should mention Xess pricing also goes beyond the basics;
you can spend a fortune on it if you have such a mind. Still, one
must economize, so it should be mentioned that most people will not
find the StarOffice and Applixware spreadsheets to be limited at
all; like many things in life, this is a case of good vs. better.
But, if you do find other spreadsheets limited for your purposes,
Xess is one solution. At the very least, get rid of Windows
already&mdash;you don't need it anymore!</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb5b580.0xc546e0"></a>Further Rambling</h2></div></div><p>For myself, the neat thing about Xess is that it brings to
Linux a genuinely high-quality spreadsheet, like we'd expect to
find on any other platform. Hopefully, this indicates that Linux
users will no longer be stuck with almost-there-quality commercial
wares. Too many producers go into business selling proprietary
software that isn't up to par, and when I see their products, my
only question is &ldquo;why does this exist?&rdquo;, because their packages
are usually worse than the free offerings, not to mention being
gratuitous (one point of free source is that we don't have to
develop the same software several times over). While I usually
can't stand proprietary software and seldom touch it outside the
office (which makes some of my favorite activities completely
impossible), I don't feel bad about recommending Xess to people who
are willing to use commercial wares. AIS (the developer group) has
actually delivered a high-quality proprietary application. A troupe
of free software coders is hard at work on a spreadsheet named
Gnumeric (part of Gnome Office), while the KDE folks are developing
KSpread (a component of KOffice), so if you wish to contribute to a
project, or just wait for the free spreadsheets to be delivered,
those are your options. In the meantime, if you have a lot of money
to spend on a commercial spreadsheet and aren't afraid to use it,
Xess is probably your best bet.</p></div></div>
