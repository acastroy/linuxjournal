    What's happening in the Education Department at Caldera
    Systems? Read on...
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1116580.0x120e450"></a></h2></div></div><p> In 1985, Jim Higgins joined the Novell
Education department as an instructor/course developer and, except
for a three-year period as an independent CNI, continued with
Novell until 1998. In April 1999, he accepted an invitation to join
the Caldera Systems team to further develop their Education
Department. I &ldquo;talked&rdquo; to him by e-mail on December 23, 1999.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: Training seems to
be a popular issue in the Linux world today, and no one can doubt
its importance. What motivated Caldera to begin giving Linux
training?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Jim</b></span>: We have always focused
on &ldquo;Linux for Business&rdquo; (now eBusiness), and as we used an
indirect distribution model, we had channel partners who needed
training on how to use Linux and make money with Linux. We started
in September 1998 and had Ford, Boeing, MCI and others who ended up
becoming direct end users as well as partners. Business has been
booming since.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: That's good to
hear. How did you go about designing your classes? Deciding what to
offer, what to emphasize, etc.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Jim</b></span>: Both of the first two
courses were designed as an introduction to many of the solutions
Linux provides. At the very start, Caldera decided to support an
independent certification effort instead of creating our own
proprietary version of certification, so we helped the key
proponents of Linux Professional Institute (LPI) get together and
form an organization. With this decision made and the process put
in motion, we needed to provide training that would prepare
students for the certification examinations. We focused first on
teaching about the objectives to be tested by LPI, and then added
appropriate materials to round out the courseware and make it
instructionally sound. We ended up with three one-week
certification preparation courses, and then many additional courses
to take care of advanced and specialty issues.</p><p>We also focused on the needs our partners had for integration
into existing environments, and we ultimately set product training
and technical training high on our priority list.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: When did Caldera
first start offering Linux training classes?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Jim</b></span>: The first class was
taught as a beta in September of 1998.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: That was an early
start&mdash;you must have been one of the first to offer it. How many
classes do you offer? Subjects?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Jim</b></span>: Education is an
ever-evolving product and process. By the end of 1999, we will have
ten courses completed out of more than 15 currently planned. The
completed courses include both of our week-long overview courses
entitled:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Linux Administration for UNIX Professionals</p></li><li><p>Linux Administration for Network
Professionals</p></li></ul></div><p>Neither of these courses is designed to prepare a student for
certification. The first two of the three one-week-long
certification preparation courses are also complete:
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Linux System Administration</p></li><li><p>Linux Network Administration</p></li></ul></div>

The third certification preparation course, Linux Enterprise
Administration, will be complete by mid-January 2000.
</p><p>Two elective courses are also complete:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The very complete and in-depth five day course
entitled Linux TCP/IP Internetworking, for those wanting to know a
lot more than the basics about TCP/IP.</p></li><li><p>Since Linux literally runs on shell scripts, a
thorough approach to Linux Shell Scripting makes this four-day
course essential for complete integration and management.</p></li></ul></div><p>Four additional one-day specialty courses designed primarily
for VARs and system integrators will also be complete. They include
the following:
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Linux TCP/IP Essentials</p></li><li><p>Linux Scripting Essentials</p></li><li><p>Linux and Windows with Samba</p></li><li><p>Linux Solutions for eBusiness</p></li></ul></div>

Several additional solutions-based courses are being defined and
developed.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: Sounds like you
have a wide selection of all the essential courses. How often do
you give classes? Can schedules be found on your web site?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Jim</b></span>: Classes are taught
nearly every week at our Authorized Linux Education Centers (ALEC)
in various locations around the world. In addition, we conduct
&ldquo;Train the Trainer&rdquo; courses for our Authorized Linux Instructors
(ALIs) at our Lindon, Utah education center. These instructors then
go out to teach even more classes at their own centers, or under
contract for customized training situations. Class schedules for
most centers can be accessed through our education web pages at
<a href="http://www.linuxeducation.com" target="_self">http://www.linuxeducation.com/</a>.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: I think on-line
training is the wave of the future. Do you offer any sort of
training on-line? If not, do you think you will in the
future?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Jim</b></span>: A wide range of
alternative learning methods is a part of our overall education
strategy, with some of them already in development. On-line
subscription services, as well as free access to certain pieces of
educational materials, are definitely part of our plans. Beside
providing the largest number of Linux training centers worldwide,
Caldera Systems recognizes the various needs and training styles
required by individuals and is developing a full range of options
to help meet those needs. No matter where someone is located or how
they like to learn, we feel Caldera Systems is the full-service
solutions provider of choice.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: What do you
consider the most important class you offer? That is, if a person
could take only one class, which one should it be?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Jim</b></span>: Some may consider this
a political sidestep, but there is no one way to answer this
question. What someone wants and needs to do with the information
they learn in class will determine the type and length of class
they attend. For example, if you are starting from scratch and your
main goal is to become LPIC (Linux Professional Institute
Certified) so you can assure others of your abilities, you would
take the full series of three certification courses:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Linux System Administration</p></li><li><p>Linux Network Administration</p></li><li><p>Linux Enterprise Administration</p></li></ul></div><p>On the other hand, if you're already well-versed in UNIX or
have used Linux in a minor role, you can usually learn what's
needed by attending only the second and third certification
preparation courses. If you want just an introduction to Linux and
why it should be considered for either a part of your overall
network or how it can provide the best solutions for your clients,
then the Linux Solutions for eBusiness class is the best to attend.
</p><p>The options continue to depend on your experience and your
purposes for learning. You can read a description of each course by
visiting
<a href="http://www.calderasystems.com/partners/alec/courses" target="_self">http://www.calderasystems.com/partners/alec/courses/</a>.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: Well, that
certainly makes good sense&mdash;sidestep or not. Do classes concentrate
on Caldera OpenLinux or do they cover most (major)
distributions?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Jim</b></span>: We provide
distribution-neutral courseware for certification preparation
training. Actually, there are two questions in one here. In
essence, you're asking if we teach on our own platform,
&ldquo;OpenLinux&rdquo;. The answer is, &ldquo;Yes, of course we do.&rdquo; Do we teach
about, explain, demonstrate or use any other distributions in our
classrooms? The answer again is, &ldquo;Yes, of course we do.&rdquo; While
Linux is Linux, there are important differences among OpenLinux,
TurboLinux and all the rest. System and network administrators are
kidding themselves if they think they'll experience only one
distribution of Linux. Just like Windows and NetWare, UNIX and
Macintoshes co-exist on the same networks, so do various
distributions of Linux on the same networks.</p><p>Because of this, Caldera Authorized Curriculum provides
experiential learning on multiple Linux distributions. As an
example, in the Linux Network Administration course, students
actually install up to six different Linux distributions as part of
the lab exercises. Beside installing them, they must make each
distribution run different services such as DHCP, Sendmail, Apache,
etc.</p><p>Then, in the Linux Enterprise Administration course, that
concept is expanded and multiple LANs are created using different
Linux distributions. All of the different LANs must then be made to
communicate with each other and share those services across a
WAN.</p><p>As students progress to some of our specialty courses, the
classes focus only on Caldera Systems' OpenLinux. This will be true
for such courses as those specific to our new eServer product.
There is no need to teach about other distributions in situations
like this.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: Red Hat offers Red
Hat Linux training and certifies its students as Red Hat
Linux-certified. Does the successful student receive some sort of
certificate? What does it say?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Jim</b></span>: Caldera Systems does
support and use certification. This is where LPI and Caldera
Systems' ALECs come together. As I said before, multiple
distributions will coexist on LANs and WANs around the world. Most
of this will take place over the Internet. For all those who find
themselves dealing with situations like this, they need a broad
coverage with in-depth knowledge and experience about multiple
Linux distributions.</p><p>LPI certification (LPIC) provides that &ldquo;proof&rdquo; of knowledge
and experience. The bar for passing has been set very high. This is
intentional so that the Linux industry doesn't have to go through
the growing pains experienced by Novell and Microsoft when the
&ldquo;paper CNE&rdquo; syndrome threatened to destroy the value of
certification.</p><p>Obtaining LPIC status says, &ldquo;I know my stuff and I've proven
it. If you want an employee who can actually do what needs to be
done, I'm it. You don't have to pay me for several months while I
experiment with theory I learned in class. I've already done it and
can do it again, <span   class="emphasis"><em>now</em></span>!&rdquo;</p><p>That's a powerful statement to an IT manager. They can no
longer afford the time and money to train someone new. In today's
computer environment, LPIC will mean more than any certification
available to date, and Caldera Systems proudly supports LPI.</p><p>Additionally, ALIs (our own Authorized Linux Instructors)
must pass another exam specifically targeted to help us identify
those good enough to represent Caldera Systems Education and to
teach our clients.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: I'd say the
cooperation between LPI and Caldera is a win/win situation for
everyone. There's a book on Red Hat Linux certification and what
you need to study to pass (author Kara Pritchard). Is there a
comparable book for your training courses? If not, is one planned
in the future?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Jim</b></span>: Specifically, we do not
provide exam cram books to prepare for passing exams. Caldera
Systems has not sponsored any such book, but numerous other books
from Caldera Press about OpenLinux provide necessary background and
detail information to help students and existing administrators.
These books are often used as supporting references for those
studying on their own. Our own course manuals have been developed
from scratch to thoroughly and intelligently provide the best
in-class text and still provide an excellent reference for use
after class.</p><p>While there can be great value in texts such as the one you
mentioned, when someone bases their exam-passing ability on such
material alone, they are cheating themselves out of the hands-on
experience absolutely essential for businesses to continue to be
successful today. As easy as Linux can be for most users, in the
background is the same depth and complexity existing in every other
operating system. And that depth and complexity is what makes Linux
so powerful and reliable at the same time.</p><p>Our classes are unique and well-sought-after because we spend
considerable time with hands-on, practical, solutions-based
exercises that books alone cannot duplicate.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: Do you offer
different levels of classes, i.e., beginner, intermediate,
advanced?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Jim</b></span>: Yes, we do. For
certification purposes, there are three different classes, each
building on the experience of the one before. If you know Linux
somewhat in general, but need to learn more details on Linux shell
scripting or TCP/IP, then you can take the longer, more detailed
specialty courses to provide the expertise you need. On the other
hand, if you need to learn only a little about how scripting works,
the one-day course provides a fast, solutions-based experience that
you can take back and use immediately.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: What are your
requirements for entry? Can they be rank beginners who don't know
what a keyboard is or do you expect computer literacy?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Jim</b></span>: There are many
qualified, high-quality training companies where individuals can be
taught about computers and applications in general. We do not offer
classes at that level. However, many of our ALECs offer those
classes. Our focus is squarely on making Linux and its associated
uses an integral part of a LAN and WAN administrator's expertise.
Again, students leave our classes actually knowing how to
accomplish the tasks given them.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: What are the costs
for taking your training classes? Do you have any sort of
scholarship program for those who can't afford the entry
fees?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Jim</b></span>: The SRP (suggested
retail price) for our five-day courses is $1995 US. Each ALEC has
the right to offer our courses at any price they choose. While most
centers charge the SRP, they do have promotional ideas from Caldera
Systems, and they can implement their own whenever they have
reason. Scholarships have not yet been provided by Caldera Systems.
There are suggested discounts for students signing up for multiple
classes. There are often discounts for companies sending multiple
employees registering concurrently. These options are entirely up
to the individually owned and operated ALECs.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: Anything you would
like to add in closing?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Jim</b></span>: By using my experience
to eliminate the mistakes made by other companies entering the
technical education market, we can provide even more of the
potential benefits from the very start of our program. In designing
an entire program with multiple offerings before we ever started
pushing our classes and educational products, I believe we're ready
to roll out the very best program with the most complete offerings
ever available.</p><p>Students, no matter which path they take to learning from
Caldera Systems, will be better prepared to advance in industry
than they would by following any other path. I welcome everyone
interested in learning why Linux Education from Caldera Systems and
Linux certification through LPI are the two best moves they can
make in their lives right now.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: I'm sure many will
take you up on that. Thank you very much for your time.</p></div></div>
