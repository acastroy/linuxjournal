    Need to be Linux certified to get that dream job? The LPI
    provides the means to obtain certification.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e9a580.0x1f92500"></a></h2></div></div><p>Back in the July 1999 issue of
<i  >Linux Journal</i>, I introduced the community
project known as the Linux Professional Institute (LPI) and its
efforts to establish a program for certification of individual
expertise with the Linux operating system. Since that time, a great
deal of activity has occurred, and it is time to provide an update
on what has been going on.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e9a580.0x1f92660"></a>A Brief Review</h2></div></div><p>For those of you who have not followed the growth of LPI, the
project started in the fall of 1998 from a series of mailing lists
where people were discussing what a certification program for
professionals might look like for Linux. It was agreed that a solid
and well-respected certification program would help increase the
pool of people who could support Linux and accelerate the corporate
adoption of Linux.</p><p>Throughout early 1999, the lists discussed the matter and
emerged with a series of &ldquo;consensus points&rdquo; about how a program
should be constructed. These points included:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The cost of attaining Linux certification should be
as minimal as possible.</p></li><li><p>The certification program should be global and
scalable to accommodate as many people as possible who want
certification.</p></li><li><p>The program should be distribution-neutral and
vendor-neutral.</p></li></ul></div><p>As part of the development, it also became clear that LPI
would specify only the certification standards, and
<span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> the education one undertakes to prepare
for certification. We would publish the exam objectives on our web
site, but leave the education up to the individual and third
parties. If someone simply wanted to prepare on their own, they
could. Alternatively, they could buy books, take training classes
at a training vendor or participate in on-line or computer-based
learning.
</p><p>We also undertook to pursue the development of our program
using as open a process as possible, by using public mailing lists,
our web site and any other means to involve and include many more
people.</p><p>In March 1999, we created an Advisory Council
(<a href="http://www.lpi.org/ac.html" target="_self">www.lpi.org/ac.html</a>)
that included individuals and companies within the Linux community
who were interested in helping us move the project forward. Shortly
afterward, we created a sponsorship program to help provide the
financing.</p><p>Later in the spring, we performed an extensive job-task
analysis that involved over 1000 people completing surveys and
helped us extract the data to back up the choices we made for exam
objectives.</p><p>By the middle of 1999, we had solid funding in place, thanks
in large part to our initial Platinum Sponsors of Caldera Systems,
IBM, Linuxcare and SuSE. We had also outlined a program consisting
of three levels of certification, with multiple exams at each
level.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e9a580.0x1f92c90"></a>Progress Through 1999</h2></div></div><p>Throughout the summer and fall of 1999, LPI activity took
place on a number of levels.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Program</b></span>: as we developed the
program further, we found our first exam was going to be too long
for most people, so we wound up dividing it into two exams called
&ldquo;T1a&rdquo; and &ldquo;T1b&rdquo; and making the T2 distribution-specific exams a
bit shorter. A candidate now must take both T1a and T1b, as well as
one of the T2 exams.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Exams</b></span>: with our objectives
clearly defined and available on our web site, we started
soliciting test questions from the larger Linux community. Over 60
people participated in submitting questions, which were then
reviewed by a team of 20 reviewers before being compiled into the
format for test deployment. By November, our first exam was ready
to go, and we formalized our contract with VUE
(<a href="http://www.vue.com" target="_self">http://www.vue.com/</a>) to
deliver the exams at their 1700 test centers worldwide. Active
development continued on the other exams.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Publicity</b></span>: as we started to
increase our development activities, we also worked to increase our
publicity. We began to generate news releases more actively and
maintain a presence at Linux-related trade shows and conferences.
We had booths at the Linux Business Expo, the Atlanta Linux
Showcase, Oracle OpenWorld, the Bazaar and other events. We also
unveiled our new logo and created buttons as giveaways. Many
volunteers joined in and helped us out tremendously.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Web Site</b></span>: as part of our
publicity, we assembled a team of people to help redo our web site,
and came out with a new design in the fall. Development continues
with more features added all the time.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Financial Sponsors</b></span>: the fall
of 1999 also brought us SGI and TurboLinux as Platinum Sponsors, as
well as Wave Technologies as a Gold Sponsor and a series of other
companies coming in at our Silver, Bronze and Contributor levels
(see
<a href="http://www.lpi.org/sponsors.html" target="_self">www.lpi.org/sponsors.html</a>
for a complete list). More companies have committed to joining, and
we are continuing to recruit even more.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Advisory Council</b></span>: by the end
of 1999, our Advisory Council was around fifty members, including
representatives of all major distributions, prominent Linux and IT
service companies, publishers, training vendors and many other
companies. The Council had three face-to-face meetings in
conjunction with conferences, and started to become active on a
number of issues supporting LPI.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Other Certification
Programs</b></span>: in 1999, two other companies started up Linux
certification programs, but then decided to merge their program
with that of LPI. DigitalMetrics had developed a web-based
certification program, but decided they wanted to avoid
fragmentation of the market and join. They contributed test
questions and helped in a number of other ways. Likewise,
ProsoftTraining.com developed courseware that led to a
certification exam. They, too, agreed to merge their efforts with
those of LPI and began working with us to make that happen.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Training</b></span>: while we were
working on matters within LPI, our partners and supporters were out
developing education materials to prepare for LPI exams. Caldera
Systems, Linuxcare and SGI all developed comprehensive training
programs to teach people through instructor-led classroom courses.
Wave Technologies started developing courseware to be sold to other
training companies. Several publishers, especially Macmillan USA,
publicly announced upcoming books to prepare individuals for LPI
certification. The Linux Training Resources web site
(<a href="http://www.linuxtraining.org" target="_self">http://www.linuxtraining.org/</a>)
I maintain grew to over 100 training companies offering Linux
training, many of them preparing for LPI certification. It was
clear the necessary education people would be available.</p><p>Throughout, a hard-core group of volunteers has stuck with
the project and spent incredible amounts of time bringing the
program to reality.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e9a580.0x1f93478"></a>Moving Forward</h2></div></div><p>As I write this (December 1999), the year is drawing to a
close, and a new certification program is being rolled out early in
2000. Although our first exam was completed in November, it has
taken a while for the exam to be deployed, and we expect it to be
out globally in January 2000. The second exam, T1b, should be out
shortly after that, with the T2 exams coming during February and
March. By the time you read this, all the exams of LPI Level 1
should be out and people will be getting certified.</p><p>There will, however, be much more to do. Throughout the early
part of 2000, we will be defining LPI Level 2 and undertaking the
surveys and other steps necessary to define the objectives and
develop the actual exams. We will be doing a great deal of
publicity to get the word out in every way, shape and form
possible. We may even be thinking about Level 3 by April.</p><p>It will be an exciting time, and there will be many
opportunities to become involved. We will need the help of many
people to complete everything we wish to do. Please visit our web
site to learn more about how you can become certified and help us
move the program forward.</p><p>We are very thankful to the hundreds of people who have
helped us so far, and we look forward to working with many more as
the program progresses. Thank you all for your support!</p></div></div>
