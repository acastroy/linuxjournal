Programming Tricks! Fate conspires against our would-be monthly
column, but we get fired up to do it again. Last month we
recklessly forked and killed processes to play midi files, before
burning CPU cycles like venture capital by playing MODs and S3Ms
with the MikMod library. If we're quite clever, we can figure out
how to put the simple playmidi or MikMod calls into, for example,
the scrolltext demo from last December. Well, it
<span   class="emphasis"><em>would</em></span> look cool. Still, since we've touched on
audio already, let's finish up with it before we get into something
else exciting.</p><p>Digital audio in Linux comes to us by way of /dev/dsp, which
shows up as a file but is actually an interface to your sound card.
The kernel interface makes dealing with /dev/dsp fairly easy, if a
tad latent. You just open it as you would a normal file, set some
parameters, and make ioctl calls, a bit like filling address and
data registers before calling a library function in assembly code,
not that anyone would do <span   class="emphasis"><em>that</em></span> anymore...
(haha, what was it, a whole year ago you last used asm?) So, we get
all the thrills of appearing to do something exceedingly clever,
while we're actually just following procedure. The audio half of
Linux multimedia <span   class="emphasis"><em>does</em></span> exist, and it
<span   class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> easy to use; it's just been a tad ignored
on account of visual preoccupations.</p><p>If you wish to make sound truly from scratch, you must first
invent the universe <span   class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span> compile your kernel
for sound support (or insmod the right module with correct IRQ and
DMA values). Hopefully, you already have a universe and sound
support (find out with <b  >cat  /dev/sndstat</b>);
otherwise, prepare to be frustrated. Compiling your kernel for
sound support is a royal pain, so check the Sound-HOWTO and perhaps
also the Kernel-HOWTO. For now, let's assume (read: really, really
hope) you've already got sound working.</p><p>The first thing to do, when you want to use digital audio, is
to open your audio device, which is accomplished by using
<span   class="bold"><b>open</b></span> on /dev/dsp. We'll start
simply with playing sound, rather than recording and playing back,
so we just need to set the <b  >WRITE_BITS</b> (8 or 16),
<b  >WRITE_CHANNELS</b> (mono or stereo) and
<b  >WRITE_RATE</b> (typically 8000Hz, 22050Hz or
44100Hz). For clear sound quality, having 16 bits is most important
(exponential quality improvement for linear CPU cost), followed by
sampling rate (linear quality improvement for linear CPU cost),
followed by stereo (enables cool effects at double the CPU cost).
Obviously, this is a gross generalization and everyone knows we
have to balance the elements, so I recommend 16 bits at 22KHz mono
for optimizing performance for CPU cost. However, unless you have a
computer from the neolithic, you can afford full quality
stereo.</p><p>The way audio works is rather simple&mdash;all sounds are just
collections of different frequencies. You can break down
essentially any periodic function into a series of sine functions,
the technique known as Fourier analysis. Conversely, you can
<span   class="emphasis"><em>create</em></span> anything out of a series of sine
functions. At a very simple level, if you want to hear a pure 220Hz
tone, just play a sine function that repeats 220 times per second.
To play an octave higher, just play a sine function that repeats
440 times per second. To play an octave chord, add the two
functions together. (If you have a graphing calculator, you can add
sines of different periods together and see the results.) This is
additive synthesis, a simple, resource-intensive idea that is also
the most powerful and flexible synthesis technique. I thought I'd
share that with you, since we'll use simple additive synthesis in
our demo to generate a wave table to play via /dev/dsp.</p><p>How does this work? Your speaker vibrates according to the
signals it receives from your sound card, and as anyone who lives
with dying appliances knows, vibrations make noise. If the speaker
moves forward and back in a perfect sine pattern many times each
second, you'll hear a pure tone at the frequency corresponding to
the speed of the impulses (440 times each second would be A 440,
the most common frequency of tuning forks). So, the values in
digital audio are just amplitude data for the speaker, and these
values are ultimately just composites of many, many sines. When
dumped to the speaker, these generate complex tones, producing
familiar sounds like human voices, snare drums and brass ensembles.
All digital audio, including CDs and mpegs, works this way.</p><p>In our example code, we'll generate an additive wave table of
a chord using sine tones. The function for equal-tempered, 12-tone
intervals is simply freq*(12th root of
2)&lt;+&gt;<span   class="emphasis"><em>n</em></span>&lt;+&gt;, where
<span   class="emphasis"><em>n</em></span> is how many intervals up you want to go from
freq, your starting frequency. For an A major chord (meaning the
1st, 5th, 8th and 13th tones of the 12-tone scale, the 13th tone
being an octave on top) starting at 220Hz, these are our values:
220 277 330 440.</p><p>We'll generate the wave table by adding the sines together.
(Remember, our wave table contains 44100 16-bit values (88200
bytes), which is exactly 1 second of audio data at 44.1KJz 16-bit
mono.) Then, we'll open the digital audio, loop for a few seconds
while playing our chord, then close up shop and go home. By
replacing our wave table with an audio file, we could add a sound
effect to a game, such as the &ldquo;intoxicating&rdquo; sound that occurs
after blasting one of the turrets in Fleuch. The code for our
project is in Listing 1.</p><p>Compile with</p><pre     class="programlisting">
gcc -Wall -O2 sound.c -lm -o sound
</pre><p>meaning gcc, warnings all, optimization level two, from the
source sound.c, linked to the math library, producing executable
object named sound.

games</h2></div></div><p>Imagine if computers had a use: if you could walk in, turn
one on, and use it for something. Case in point: suppose that on
your wall lived an enormous, flat panel monitor, and controlling
it, a Linux box&mdash;very fast, faster even than normal. What to do?
Revel in high culture! What's that, you say? Play games, that is,
bigger and better than you've ever seen them before. What games?
Antique games. Vintage games. Aged rarities. Far more than just
games, these are cultural entities, which so many of us grew up
with, and which once resided in arcades and pizza parlors when
games cost a quarter to play. As is well-known, aging does a lot
for software. Unlike people, who grow old and die, computer
programs gain in energy with age, and when double-compiled and then
stored in silicon casks for several years, the bits reduce and
compress, leaving stronger elemental semiconductor properties,
while taking out the fire. A fine vintage game is more fun than
vi!</p><p>Oh, but arcade machines were often 6502-based, or even
68000-based (and a host of others); at any rate, not x86. How can
we possibly run these programs, and where <span   class="emphasis"><em>are</em></span>
we going to get the code? Fortunately, in 1997 a very cool Italian
hacker by the name of Nicola Salmoria began a project to write an
emulator for old hardware in order to preserve classic games so
that they would never be forgotten, but enjoyed and shared around
the world. Within a short time, MAME had grown to support over a
thousand games, with 1951 at last count.</p><p>MAME can be played in X or console mode, and on several
different platforms (including DOS, Macintosh and Amiga). You need
to have a fairly fast machine in order to get the best performance
on complicated games, but the farther back in time you go, the less
processor-intensive the games are. If you have anything halfway
decent in terms of hardware, you can enjoy the finer elements of
computer culture.</p><p>The one problem is that MAME is only an emulator; it doesn't
include the ROM images. You have to get ROMs, but apparently it is
quite illegal (a felony) to duplicate these things. Hence, instead
of openly distributing these images, we have to make secret hunts
over the Web to find them. Fortunately, it's very easy to find huge
ROM repositories, even though Dave's Classics, which used to be the
most complete location, was coerced into taking the ROMs off-line a
couple of years ago. Major gaming companies are upset with ROMs,
probably since they see emulation ultimately encompassing the
console games they currently make (or maybe they realize the older
games are superior in game play anyway). Either way, it's a major
greed issue. Many of them have taken steps to make
<span   class="emphasis"><em>emulation</em></span> itself completely illegal, which
would be such an abuse of government authority that it rather
invalidates any arguments against ROMs based on &ldquo;moral&rdquo; or
&ldquo;ethical&rdquo; grounds, since holding civil liberties hostage at
corporate or economic whim is probably not ethical, and one who is
flagrantly unethical has little validity to impose moral censure on
others. But then, we've seen it before when lobbyists tried to make
mpegs illegal, simply because the record industry might lose money,
and without any regard to the technological implications of
outlawing algorithms for being too efficient, let alone the civil
libertarian issues involved.</p><p>Nevertheless, every now and then some fool makes a big fuss
over emulation and how immoral it is, and tries to spoil everyone's
fun, so we're forced to distribute games underground. I've always
considered copyright law to be illegitimate. I even opted out of
becoming a professional programmer because I decided it would be
immoral for me to write proprietary software, so you can imagine
where I stand on this issue. Nevertheless, the world is swarming
with particularly evil people in whom the money drive has taken
hostage all forms of reason and compassion, and these people are
legally allowed to lock you in an iron cage for five years if you
get convicted. In addition to stealing your life, the feds can
abscond with $50,000 (or perhaps more) for every count. How's that
for thievery? Maybe &ldquo;piracy&rdquo; is a better name for how the
government behaves than for the act of duplicating bits. But I
digress.</p><p>Games, games, games! We can have so much fun as long as no
one catches on. Fortunately, even if the Web goes down, so many
people have stockpiled ROMs and burned them onto CDs that you can
probably get them from anyone. But what can we do to protect our
hobby?</p><p>One technique that works is cyber-squatting; no, not
bad-faith domain name squatting, but merely claiming the unused
&ldquo;property&rdquo; as our own by using it. People took over abandoned
farms after the plague, and no one complained. By mixing their
labor (&lt;\#224&gt; la ESR's perennial favorite, John Locke), they
made the farms their own (and MAME was certainly a lot of labor).
Or we can use the law of the sea, sunken-treasure metaphor,
whatever ways we can possibly think of to justify it! If we
continue in this vein for long enough, the so-called &ldquo;property&rdquo;
will fall into public domain on account of disuse. (The squatter
tradition ensures that wasted resources are put to good use, and in
the case of video games, these wasted treasures could bring so much
entertainment to so many.) Get ready for homesteading the
arcade-o-sphere.</p><p>Another technique is one that was most effective in the DeCSS
situation. One Slashdotter called it the &ldquo;whack the mole&rdquo;
phenomenon, whereby every time one site is closed, two more pop up.
(The name comes from a popular carnival game where in poor little
plastic moles get bopped.) What with Don Marti's Great
International DVD Source Code Distribution Contest, maybe we'll
find some truly clever ways to get information passed around. As
with DeCSS and mpegs, authoritarians soon found it was impossible
to win, and either gave up (with mpegs) or lost (with DeCSS).
Commercial forces will fight hard on this one, and the situation is
a bit unclear, nowhere near as pure as the GNU/Linux movement.
Maybe it will even make the movement look bad if we participate in
ROM trafficking, but we as a society have an interest in seeing
that these games are preserved. After all, they are part of the
culture of a developing technology and relate much about our
times.</p><p>If, of course, you believe in &ldquo;intellectual property&rdquo; and
that copyright restrictions have to be respected no matter what, or
you just don't want to commit felonies, what should you do? Well,
rather than writing hate mail or telling the teacher, just ignore
MAME and go develop some completely free wares under the GPL. If
you <span   class="emphasis"><em>really</em></span> have to say angry things and call
people &ldquo;pirates&rdquo; and whatnot, there is a place for people like
you: Usenet.</p><p>For the rest of us, let's dig in
(archaeologically/anthropologically speaking) and enjoy!

MARKET</h2></div></div><p>Applix has been in business for a generation. Its office
suite, Applixware, has been a market leader since the '80s. By
extreme contrast, Cosource has been in business for less than a
year. But it has (along with its competitor SourceXchange) quickly
helped establish a whole new market category: the development
marketplace where buyers and sellers of open-source code can meet
and do business.</p><p>Now Applix and Cosource are one: Applix acquired Cosource in
December. <i  >Linux Journal</i>, which has featured
Cosource development news on its web page for much of the past
year, was curious about the synergies that brought these two
companies together. Doc Searls interviewed Cosource founder (and
now Applix executive) Bernie Thompson on January 3, 2000.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: What did Applix see in
Cosource? The FAQ seems to say that Cosource is mostly a way to
drive Applix development, rather than something for everyone&mdash;a
marketplace. That's a big conceptual shift.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Bernie</b></span>: In doing the
acquisition, I made sure we would still be able to have say over
Cosource and keep it unbiased. So Cosource is and will remain an
independent broker of open-source work. Any other path would be
self-destructive.</p><p>We've been acquired by a great company. Applix&mdash;the name
means &ldquo;Applications for UNIX&rdquo;&mdash;is a software company that's been
around since 1983. It would like to extend this noble history for
another seventeen years. Like most software companies, it has
derived much of its revenue from licenses. It saw that, as open
source gained market share, the revenue balance would tend to shift
away from licenses towards services. Cosource is a web-auction
system that encourages open-source work and can thrive in this new
environment. By having Cosource in the portfolio, Applix can have a
more balanced mix of products and services and be a more healthy
company as a result.</p><p>For things like seeding the development of open-source
applications on our application builder (called SHELF, which we've
released under the LGPL), we'll do that right on Cosource.com as a
sponsor just like everyone else. If Applix wants to do anything
related to their products that requires special logic (which is
quite possible&mdash;like getting pre-commitments to buy copies of our
commercial products), we'll do that by using the Cosource.com logic
on another site like Applixware.com, which is specific to our
company's products.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: What will happen to
Cosource? All kinds of questions come to mind here. In what new
directions will you take it? Will you still run it? If not,
who?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Bernie</b></span>: Our goal for this
year is to take the cooperative marketplace concept that
we&mdash;Cosource&mdash;helped pioneer to the next level. We've done an okay
job so far, but there are a lot of things we want to do better. If
you look at our front page, you'll see that we've got a lot of good
information there about what feature enhancements are in demand.
But we need to do a better job providing customized views of that
data. More importantly, we need to enhance our interface to make it
easier to express interest in projects and commit money to specific
proposals.</p><p>From the business perspective, we need to bring more partners
into the system, and have them share in the risk and the reward. A
site like eBay was able to launch as a largely closed-loop site
that doesn't allow for affiliates or competition. It's an island.
We doubt that will work anymore. We're looking to do a network
approach, where partners like VA Linux, Red Hat and independent
Linux consultants can participate side by side and benefit by
driving the development of open source.</p><p>As far as who's running the show, Cosource.com is still my
baby. The great team that built it is still intact. When you create
something from scratch, there's always a strong emotional
attachment to it. So while I'm responsible for a bunch of other
products now, including the Applixware Office Bundle and Applix
Anyware (an 800KB Java client to access the office suite running on
a server), I'll still be looking over Cosource with the same goals
and the same philosophy as before.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: What exactly is your
new job with Applix? What are your goals there?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Bernie</b></span>: My new role is as
the President of Applix's Linux Division. Whew! It's quite a
challenge, but also a chance to do so much good.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: What kind of changes
should we be looking for from Applix over the next year?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Bernie</b></span>: We're going to be
focused on producing great Linux and *BSD applications. Our
strength is that our applications were developed on UNIX many years
ago. Our focus is on fast, tight, native applications. Toward that
end, we're launching our Applixware 5.0 product this spring and
summer that uses and integrates with GTK, for closer integration
with the Linux desktop. We hope to make it the &ldquo;most native&rdquo; of
all the office suites, and thus the most comfortable and
hassle-free to use. Beyond this one release, it's our intention to
keep up and increase the pace of innovation, since that's our
primary value to customers.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: Do you plan to open
source any of Applix' products?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Bernie</b></span>: We've already open
sourced our application builder platform called SHELF (see
<a href="http://www.applixware.org" target="_self">http://www.applixware.org/</a>).
We've built a complete PalmPilot desktop interface using that tool
and released it as open source. And as part of our Applixware 5.0
product, we have developed a graphical interface to the Pine e-mail
program which will be released as open source. In each of these
cases, we try to use public, well-known licenses such as the LGPL
and GPL, rather than custom &ldquo;Applix&rdquo; licenses. We're going to be
open sourcing more software in the future, as it makes sense. See
Eric Raymond's &ldquo;Magic Cauldron&rdquo; paper for some guidelines. In
particular, we're going to be using more and more open-source
infrastructure in our applications&mdash;to the extent the licenses
allow&mdash;and passing our enhancements to these infrastructures back
to the community. This is the natural process of community
enhancement that licenses like the GPL/LGPL pioneered, and it works
great for us.</p><p>In short, the goal here is to prove that software product
companies can still exist and thrive in this new market that the
Internet and open source have created. They'll look different, but
we still need them. We need companies that can pay programmers for
their hard work and not lose money every quarter. We need companies
that can invest large sums in R&amp;D, with the ability to earn
back that risky investment by winning customers who license the
product. Once that investment has been recouped, we can eventually
shift over to an open-source service model.</p><p>These companies will be different in that they will be more
open with information&mdash;not trying to lock customers in&mdash;and more
focused on empowering the community around the product. Hopefully,
this happy balance can be found between the &ldquo;give it all away&rdquo;
and the &ldquo;keep the customer in the dark&rdquo; camps that divide the
open-source and traditional software communities today. That's what
we're aiming for: we hope to find that middle ground.</p><p>We know as well as anybody that the Open Source movement has
done only good things for customers. It has demonstrated the
amazing power of the community to do great things by working
together. It's up to companies to absorb these lessons and learn
how to apply them back to serving our own customers better. This is
our challenge and mission in the coming year.</p><p>&mdash;Doc Searls</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11ad580.0x15b29f0"></a>VENDOR NEWS</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>Adobe Systems</b></span> announced its

Redwood is about as close as it's going to get. Worse, it may be
getting ready for a big fall. At least that's what Eric S. Raymond
thinks, although as a gun enthusiast, he tends to favor firearm
metaphors. Recently, the alpha hacker and libertarian economist
shared some of his latest thinking in a conversation with
<i  >Linux Journal</i> Senior Editor Doc Searls.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc Searls</b></span>: I heard you've
been saying some new stuff about Microsoft. What's up?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Eric</b></span>: There is a new section
of my talk that I'm doing these days. It's called &ldquo;The Seven
Bullets Microsoft has to Dodge to Survive the Next Eighteen
Months&rdquo;. I haven't written it down yet. The bottom line is that
Microsoft has much bigger problems than either the Department of
Justice lawsuit or Linux. It's just that few people have noticed
these problems yet.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: To keep this short,
what's the biggest bullet?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Eric</b></span>: The margin crunch
problem. Here's how it works: Microsoft's stock price has to rise
every quarter. If that doesn't happen, two very bad things occur.
First, the employee stock options stop rising in value. When that
happens, their talent bails out. All those people stop working
eighteen-hour days in Redmond, and go off to build mansions.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: Which is already
happening?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Eric</b></span>: Yes. The other problem
is that Microsoft makes more money playing option games with its
own stock than it does selling software. Thirty six percent of its
income, and that income goes away if the stock price doesn't trend
reliably upwards. If stock prices must always go up, so must
revenues, quarter to quarter. This is a problem. Every quarter, it
becomes harder and harder to find the additional revenues.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: Why?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Eric</b></span>: They've got 91% of
their market. There isn't enough room for them to get the revenue
they're accustomed to.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: But the overall market
has tended to increase.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Eric</b></span>: Not fast enough. And
we know this without econometric modeling. Microsoft is raising
prices on its high-end customers. In the long term, this is suicide
because it will only drive customers to competing operating
systems. It really only makes sense if they're caught in the
short-term scramble for revenues, and absolutely must have the
money.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: I've heard from
corporate guys in big companies that the real aversion to Microsoft
has less to do with software than licensing fees: expensive
licensing of NT servers that customers would rather avoid.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Eric</b></span>: Today, if you buy a
Windows NT server, they not only charge you per seat for the number
of developers on your site, but they also charge you per seat for
the number of simultaneous web accesses you want to support. You
see where that's going. So we know market expansion won't work for
them. Now, here is where it really starts to bite: the price of
hardware is dropping like a rock. Microsoft makes money from the
hardware vendors&mdash;the OEMs&mdash;they hold captive. These guys are
caught in a bind. From one side, Microsoft has to take a bigger
piece of their margin every quarter just to stay afloat. From the
other side, the price of hardware is falling. If your total system
price is $2500 US, it makes sense to pay the $80-$100 Microsoft
tax. When your total system price is down around $600, the margin
pressure becomes unsustainable. This implies that there is a price
level in the PC and appliance market below which you can't make any
money dealing with Microsoft. The key point is that this price
level is not fixed over time.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: Where does it stand
now?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Eric</b></span>: In appliance
territory. Which is why you see companies like Nokia and GTE
Sylvania defecting from the Windows CE alliance. They've figured
out they can't make any money at that price point, given the
license price of Windows CE. Over time, because the price of
hardware is dropping, the functional point represented by that
price point is going to rise into low-end consumer PC territory.
When the price point at which you can't make any money dealing with
Microsoft passes the average price point of a consumer desktop PC,
the game is over. And I think this is going to happen before the
justice department gets its final verdict.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: Will Zachmann also
predicted this quite a long time ago. He thought the margin squeeze
would hurt their stock and then they would be abandoned by all
those optioneers who have been working the long hours, waiting for
a stock payout.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Eric</b></span>: It's coming. Microsoft
simply can't maintain their existing margins. Stepping back and
looking at economic history, this is what always happens to
monopolies unless the government props them up. They get
comfortable at a certain price level, and get that level built into
their whole financial structure, then collapse when they price
themselves out of their own markets.</p><p>&mdash;Doc Searls</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11ad580.0x182f298"></a>STOP THE PRESSES: Cool Chips for a Hot
Category</h2></div></div><p>After four and a half years, Transmeta has lifted its veil of
secrecy and spilled the beans&mdash;or rather the chips. There are two,
both built to run x86 code at high clock speeds while delivering
unprecedented battery mileage. The larger of the two (TM5400) is
targeted to the notebook and sub-notebook Windows laptop market.
The smaller one (TM3120) is targeted to the new Mobile Internet
Appliance market.</p><p>According to Transmeta, that market wants three things: real
web browsing, real portability and long battery life. The market,
they say, demands Linux, and they are more than equipped to give it
to them. &ldquo;We have a certain amount of expertise with the Linux
OS,&rdquo; says Transmeta co-founder and Chairman David Ditzel.
Transmeta is famous as the employer of Linus Torvalds. Mobile Linux
is a native x86 version small enough to fit into ROM with enough
room left for a browser and other software components. Mobile Linux
runs on the smaller and cooler of the two chips, and the system is
upgradable.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3836sf1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
<div class="mediaobject"><img src="3836sf2.jpg"></div>

</p></div></div><p>The figure demonstrates that an Intel and a Transmeta chip
are as different as a stove and an ice cube&mdash;between 105.5 and 48.2
degrees Celsius. LongRun technology on the TMS400 even regulates
clock frequency and voltage to correspond exactly to the demands of
the application, drastically conserving energy and further reducing
heat load.</p><p>Ditzel, one of the originators of the RISC (reduced
instruction set computer) concept and the leader for many years of
Sun's SPARC effort, co-founded Transmeta to tackle the challenges
of mobile computing. What Transmeta finally delivered not only
meets that challenge, but achieves some RISC ideals as well.</p><p>In effect, Transmeta designed a whole new breed of
microprocessor&mdash;one idealized for mobile computing. The Transmeta
architecture is utterly unlike anything coming out of Intel or its
standard competitors. At its core is a powerful VLIW (very long
instruction word) engine, surrounded by a &ldquo;code morphing&rdquo;
software layer that translates x86 instructions and intelligently
caches them while observing the needs of the system's applications,
so the chip optimizes execution of translated instructions at
extremely high speeds. By replacing millions of transistors with
software, the Transmeta chip is small, fast, efficient and
extremely undemanding in the way it consumes electricity.</p><p>The result is a breakthrough into territory that has remained
closed in the absence of designs featuring the kind of long battery
life that customers now expect of portable radios, telephones and
other popular hand-held devices&mdash;the Mobile Internet Computing
market.</p><p>The big question is: will the market buy it? Linley Gwennap,
a microprocessor analyst with The Linley Group, thinks chances are
good:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>The fundamental problem is the simple fact that
microprocessors are consuming more and more power every generation.
And Dave Ditzel is right: we're headed for a hundred watt chip on
the desktop. So this isn't a problem in the mobile area. This kind
of technology, which gets away from the complexities of doing
everything in the chip, and shifting more of it into software,
makes a lot of sense. It solves a lot of big problems.</p></blockquote></div><p>Note: More Transmeta articles can be found on our web site at
