    possible for the whole family, I recommend that you use one of
    the graphical login programs.

restaurant, &ldquo;Chez Marcel&rdquo;. Please, sit down. In honor of this
month's special educational focus, Fran&ccedil;ois has prepared
your tables (school desks, actually) by putting them all in a big
circle. But of course, he will also be bringing your wine.
</p><p>Fran&ccedil;ois! Du vin. Vite!</p><p>One of the questions I ask visitors to my restaurant is this:
sure, you will cook with Linux at the office, but what will it take
for me to convince you to try some recipes at home? As you can
imagine, I get many answers, but one I hear so often is, &ldquo;Sure,
Linux is tasty, but what will my kids play with? I have all this
wonderful educational software available on that other OS.&rdquo;</p><p>Sacre bleu! Is that all? Well, pull your desks a bit closer,
and together we will cook up an education and entertainment center
for the kids (of all ages, non?) using Linux and open-source
software. And yes, I have tried them all.</p><p>In order to keep things lively, I have asked
Fran&ccedil;ois to hold off giving you the URL for all these
fine recipes until the very end. You may take your souvenir menu as
you leave the restaurant.</p><p>What's that? You think Chef Marcel has been sampling a little
too much wine because he suggests turning the power of Linux over
to a child? I assure you, mes amis, I have been drinking only as
much as is necessary to ensure quality control. As for children,
letting them have access to your system only makes sense.</p><p>Linux is a multi-user system by nature. Although a number of
us instinctively log in to the root account when we start up, this
is actually a very bad idea. The root login is there for you to
perform administrative functions. While this is the first login we
see during an install, for some users it is also the last. This is
not only dangerous, but limits the reach of your Linux system.
While you are logged in as root, create a user login for your
child. Mon Dieu! Create one for everybody in the house! Since
Fran&ccedil;ois is a <span   class="emphasis"><em>child at heart</em></span>, I will
use him for our example.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
adduser francois
passwd francois
</pre><p>In order to make the experience of logging in as simple as
possible for the whole family, I recommend that you use one of the
graphical login programs. For KDE, this is
<span   class="bold"><b>kdm</b></span>, while GNOME uses
<span   class="bold"><b>gdm</b></span>. That old favourite
<span   class="bold"><b>xdm</b></span> is still available, but the
less Linux-savvy may find the default X Window System environment a
little less than friendly. On my Red Hat system, I set my
preference for kdm by modifying my rc.sysinit script. You'll find
that in the /etc/rc.d directory. The section you want looks like
this:
<pre     class="programlisting">
# Set preferred X display manager link
preferred=kdm
if [ -f /etc/sysconfig/desktop ]; then
if [ -n "`grep GNOME /etc/sysconfig/desktop`" ]; then
        preferred=gdm
   elif [ -n "`grep KDE /etc/sysconfig/desktop`" ]; then
        preferred=kdm
   elif [ -n "`grep AnotherLevel /etc/sysconfig/desktop`" ];
then
        preferred=xdm
   fi
fi
</pre>


By default, the <b  >preferred=</b> variable is not set.
I changed mine so that it reads <b  >preferred=kdm</b>.
Another way to do the same thing is to edit the
/etc/sysconfig/desktop file and simply put in the name of your
favourite desktop environment. A couple of lines further on (in the
next paragraph of the rc.sysinit), the system sets the link for
<span   class="bold"><b>prefdm</b></span> which is then started in
your /etc/inittab file.
<pre     class="programlisting">
ln -snf ../..`which kdm` /etc/X11/prefdm
</pre>


During your install, you may have been given the opportunity to let
Linux boot into a graphical desktop. If you chose not to do this,
you can still change your mind. This is the tail-end section of my
/etc/inittab file:
<pre     class="programlisting">
# Run xdm in runlevel
# xdm is now a separate service
x:5:respawn:/etc/X11/prefdm -nodaemon
</pre>


Simply add or edit the last line to the inittab, then run the
following command to activate it for next time and each successive
boot. You will want to do this when your X environment is not
running.
<pre     class="programlisting">
init q
</pre>


The reason for that overview is to get you used to the idea of
logging in and creating different profiles for all the users in
your family, each with their own
<span   class="bold"><b>protected</b></span> environment. Now, from
your own login, you can start adding games. I created a folder for
Fran&ccedil;ois, added and built various games, then copied
these to his desktop. In KDE, when you create a folder on your
desktop (or a link of some sort) you can find those items in a
folder called &ldquo;Desktop&rdquo;. For Fran&ccedil;ois to have the same
folder when he logs in, I simply copy my folder to his desktop.
Since I broke my own rules and am running as root, I will also
change the permissions on his new folder so he is allowed to open
it himself.
<pre     class="programlisting">
cd Desktop
find "Educational Games" -print |
cpio -pduvm
/home/francois/Desktop
cd /home/francois/Desktop
chown -R francois "Educational Games"
# chgrp -R francois "Educational Games"
</pre>

</p></div></div>

</p><p>When he logged in, his desktop had a nice little folder with
all the appropriate links and icons. Incidentally, this is a great
way to maintain (and rebuild if need be) another user's desktop. If
you want my little folder (as an example), you can download it from
the link at the end of the article. I've also included a web page
with links to all the items we will sample, if you don't want to go
hunting for everything on your own. (See Figure)</p><p>When starting your educational games collection for the kids,
look no further than your desktop environment. Both KDE and GNOME
come with several games (as does X), some of which fit the bill
very nicely. (Non. That &ldquo;bill&rdquo; comes later.) Some of the KDE
games will have a counterpart in GNOME and vice versa. Your quest
is to find the one you like best.</p><p>For instance,. . . <span   class="bold"><b>Reversi</b></span>
is a classic strategy game that requires some planning. In this
case, the GNOME version (known as
<span   class="bold"><b>Iagno</b></span>) is more appealing to me for
its animation and graphics. The only drawback (and the KDE
version's plus) is the lack of board lines. For the younger set, it
might require a few tries to get the hang of token
placement.</p><p>In terms of strategy and logic, I am still a big fan of
<span   class="bold"><b>Sokoban</b></span>, the Japanese &ldquo;warehouse
keeper&rdquo; game. You will find this one among your KDE games. The
object is to move large gems into their proper storage in an
increasingly crowded warehouse. Sokoban takes patience, but does
wonders for the analytical process.</p><p>Eventually, you will want to try something not included with
your Linux distribution. While the excitement of Linux hasn't yet
generated the vast amount of educational titles stocking the
shelves for that other operating system, the selection is growing
and will continue to do so. If you want to track what is happening
in the world of children's games specifically, try the
<span   class="bold"><b>Linux for Kids</b></span> web site. For the
bigger kids, keep an eye on the <span   class="bold"><b>Linux Game
Tome</b></span> and <span   class="bold"><b>Linuxberg</b></span> to
name just a couple. Move your desks a little closer together, and
sample what I found in my initial search.</p><p>To not only challenge, but twist and turn a young mind, I
recommend <span   class="bold"><b>Groundhog</b></span>. This is a
wonderful little puzzle where you manipulate tubes (or groundhog
tunnels, I presume) to move little colored balls into their
corresponding little colored pockets. So far, I have managed the
two-ball by two-ball level, but I think I will graduate
soon.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Codebreaker</b></span> is a GPL'ed
version of Mastermind, an old favorite of mine. This &ldquo;guess the
color code&rdquo; game is still a great exercise in logic. For those who
consider themselves experts at the game, I suggest trying it with
eight different colors.</p><p>There are times when I really don't need to learn much. I
just want to save the world from an evil empire, say a large
multinational software empire bent on world domination. Enter
<span   class="bold"><b>XTux</b></span>, a great little game that
teaches some interesting lessons. For starters, CD-ROMs make great
weapons with which to destroy mindless droids, and coffee is all
you really need to keep you going. Several characters are provided
to help you get the job done: Tux, Gown, BSD Daemon, Emacs and Vi.
What can I tell you? It's silly, but fun.</p><p>Probably the most fun I had while putting this together was a
little something called the <span   class="bold"><b>Sticker
Book</b></span>. The concept is so simple, it's brilliant. Like the
sticker books you had as a kid, this one comes with a variety of
images and a handful of different backgrounds. You pick up the
stickers by clicking on the various images, then simply paste them
onto your background with another click. You can also increase the
size of images, shrink them and rotate them. If you don't like the
way it is turning out, you can erase everything and start over. In
the process of writing this article, I had a couple of adults
watching over my shoulder, and they were captivated. The only
downside (and I hope the developers read this) is that the tabs
which let you flip between series of stickers are a bit small for
the large arrow pointer they supply. If it wasn't for the adult
response, I would've said this was a game for the very young. Try
this one. It's deceptively addictive.</p><p>Another selection for the very young is
<span   class="bold"><b>Linux Letters and Numbers</b></span>.
Essentially, this is a board with large tiles representing the
numbers 0 through 9 and the letters of the alphabet. Clicking on a
tile brings up a picture of something starting with that letter, or
a collection of little pictures representing the number (4 apples,
for instance). Letters and Numbers comes with a collection of
tiles, but you can create your own when the kids start anticipating
the image that follows the letter. &ldquo;P&rdquo; is for Penguin!</p><p>For a slightly older audience, try
<span   class="bold"><b>lolit Math Literature</b></span>. This is a
math training program that helps teach addition, subtraction,
multiplication and division. The interface is fairly slick-looking
and the questions go from very simple to fairly complex. Just what
is 87+54, anyway?</p><p>Well, mes amis, it is once again closing time. I sincerely
hope I have whetted your appetite for turning over your Linux
system to the kids (at least every once in a while). Do come back
soon. You are always welcome here at <span   class="emphasis"><em>Chez
Marcel</em></span>.</p><p>Bon App&eacute;tit!</p><p><a href="3860s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
