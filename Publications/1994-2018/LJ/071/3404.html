Corporation)</p></li><li><p>E-mail: sales@raima.com</p></li><li><p>URL:

company's system and why we need a database server. Itres Research
Limited is a developer of the Compact Airborne Spectrographic
Imager (casi), a multispectral imaging instrument that combines the
sophistication of satellite geo-positioning systems (GPS) with the
practicalities of aerial photography. The casi is used worldwide in
a variety of applications, and is distinguished by its high
precision and flexibility of use. The casi is a user-programmable,
all-digital system that is easily installed in light aircraft. It
operates in the visible and near-infrared range of the spectrum.
This makes it an ideal camera for forestry, agriculture,
environmental monitoring, land-use planning and water-purity
applications. It is widely recognized as a valuable tool in remote
sensing.
</p><p>One of the more important features of the casi instrument is
its ability to generate absolute radiance values from the scene. In
simple terms, it can not only generate color photos, but it can
also tell you the absolute spectral signature of the scene. Given
that most plants, minerals and other land-based objects exhibit
different spectral characteristics, it is possible to classify the
type of vegetation and minerals present in the photographed scene,
including estimates of densities, health and concentration.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23b8580.0x24b0be0"></a>Our Problem</h2></div></div><p>Precision does not come without a price. The data collected
has to be passed through a number of processing steps, including
radiometric correction calibration, geo-correction (the projection
of each image pixel to a unique earth coordinate), mosaic (the
tiling of all image strips into a single photograph) and analysis
(the interpretation of the image and creation of a data
product).</p><p>Before one can make use of the data, it is necessary to
obtain detailed information on the casi sensor (camera) used to
acquire the images (e.g., when it was last calibrated, where the
latest calibration files are located, etc.) and associated flight
records.</p><p>When the data processing is complete and the final report is
generated, it is also highly desirable to have the means to review
the parameters and tools used to process the data. This is an
integral and necessary part of the quality-assurance
program.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23b8580.0x24b0d98"></a>Databases Come to the Rescue (Not)</h2></div></div><p>Itres' processing power is based mainly on Red Hat Linux 5.2
and 6.0. There are a number of processing stations, each equipped
with dual processors (400MHz per CPU) and each connected to a
100Mbps LAN (local area network). Access to the workstation is
provided by personal computers, which (unfortunately) run Windows
95. Graphic services are provided through xwin32 (an X-Windows
server for Win32) in conjunction with Samba file access.</p><p>All users of Windows 95 <span   class="emphasis"><em>must</em></span> have access
to Microsoft's Office Suite 97, primarily for editing their mail.
This led to an unfortunate side effect, the availability of MS
Access&mdash;the Microsoft Database engine. The need for a database
solution to the information processing was so great that a number
of users created <span   class="emphasis"><em>private</em></span> MS Access databases,
which contain important processing-related information and product
inventory information. There is a storage requirements database,
component inventory database, customer contact database, on-line
help database, flight-planning information database and the list
goes on. The unfortunate part is that those databases are located
on personal computers and are not easily shared among users. We
attempted to move the data to our main servers which run Linux, but
we met with resistance for basically two reasons:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The appeal, effectiveness and ease of use of the MS
Access database front end.</p></li><li><p>The average user is not attracted to UNIX.</p></li></ul></div><p>As a result, we searched for solutions which would enable the
average user to gain access to their databases using MS Access as
before, while taking advantage of the capabilities of Linux as an
effective file server.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23b8580.0x24b11b8"></a>The Velocis Database Engine</h2></div></div><p>We had a number of minimal requirements for a database
server, and the Velocis database server 3.0 by Raima Corporation
(now Centura Software) met all of them. The key features of Velocis
that match our requirements are as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Velocis application-server architecture supports
multiple network communication protocols, including RPC (Remote
Procedure Calls) and ODBC.</p></li><li><p>The Velocis application can launch and manage its
own threads (starting with beta release 3.0), each thread
controlling one or more Velocis &ldquo;login&rdquo; sessions.</p></li><li><p>Velocis client programs are included to give
third-party ODBC database tools access to the Velocis
database.</p></li><li><p>Velocis is available as both a client and a server
for AIX, Linux, Solaris, BSDI, HPUX, Win95/98 and WinNT.</p></li><li><p>Velocis supports SQL 89 and a subset of SQL
92.</p></li><li><p>It comes with an extensive set of printed manuals
(and a PDF version on CD-ROM), including User's Guide,
Installation/Administration Guide, Reference Library and Language
Reference (SQL and Native).</p></li><li><p>Velocis supports a number of database models:
relational, networked and hierarchical and a combination of the
three (which is how Velocis operates internally).</p></li><li><p>Velocis is a licensed product that is distributed
on a CD-ROM or by download from Centura's web site. The cost of the
license is proportional to the number of concurrent sessions
supported. Without a license, it will support up to eight sessions
for 60 days. During the demonstration period, Velocis is fully
functional.</p></li><li><p>Velocis is a supported product, for a fee. The
support includes product updates and consulting services in support
of limited API development and product integration.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23b8580.0x24b1948"></a>Installation</h2></div></div><p>Velocis is distributed on a CD, and it occupies approximately
10MB installed. The Linux (or UNIX) installation is accomplished in
a few simple steps:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Mount the CD.</p></li><li><p>Extract the appropriate compressed tar file for
your operating system (e.g., Red Hat Linux 6.0) into a directory of
choice (e.g., /opt/velocis3.0).</p></li><li><p>Run the provided installation script.</p></li><li><p>Copy the configuration shell scripts into the
desired locations (either ~/.cshrc, ~/.profiles or
/etc/profile.d).</p></li><li><p>Modify certain initialization files (e.g.,
/catalog/velocis.ini and /bin/connect.ini) to set up the
host-access identification.</p></li></ul></div><p>Installation on Windows 95/98 or NT is similar, except for
the use of winzip and install shield setup programs.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23b8580.0x24a8700"></a>Starting Velocis</h2></div></div><p>Centura Software provides a number of tools (most are
available as C source code in the &ldquo;examples&rdquo; directory) to
invoke, manage and communicate with the Velocis database engine.
With the exception of the administrative tool (admin.exe under
Windows and <span   class="bold"><b>rdsadm</b></span> under UNIX),
all tools are available on all platforms. The most notable tools
are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>rds</b></span>: the velocis
database server, which is started as a daemon process.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>vping</b></span>: an
effective <span   class="bold"><b>ping</b></span> tool. It can be
used to test the socket connection to rds.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>rdsadm</b></span> (Linux) and
admin.exe (Windows): a command-line interface and a graphic user
interface (respectively) for the creation of databases and
user-access management. In addition, it is responsible for managing
the archive and recovery processes.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>rsql</b></span>: a simple
command-line-driven interface, which enables the user to establish
one or more sessions and attach to one or more databases and
interactively execute SQL commands.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>sddlp</b></span>: a Velocis
SQL Schema compiler utility.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>ddlproc</b></span>: a Velocis
non-SQL Schema compiler utility.</p></li></ul></div><p>The steps necessary to start Velocis are as follows:
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Execute the install script in the Velocis root
directory (as superuser).</p></li><li><p>Configure the connect.ini and velocis.ini files
located in the bin and catalog directories. This step is of extreme
importance, since it establishes the linkage between the database
server name (alias), a socket and a computer on the
Internet.</p></li><li><p>Source the
<span   class="bold"><b>rdshome.sh</b></span> or
<span   class="bold"><b>rdshome.csh</b></span> scripts located in the
Velocis root directory.</p></li><li><p>Start (as superuser) the rds application
server.</p></li><li><p>Start rdsadm (UNIX) or admin.exe (Windows) to set
up your databases. Any user can start rdsadm; however, the tool is
password-protected.</p></li></ul></div>

Although the steps above are rather simple to execute, they assume
the user has some knowledge of Linux and networking. It would be
nice if Centura Software used RPM to bundle the package. It would
be even nicer if they were to perform the installation of the
scripts automatically and provide a System V-equivalent Velocis
<span   class="bold"><b>init</b></span> script (with start, stop and
restart) capability.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23b8580.0x24a9468"></a>Running Database Applications</h2></div></div><p>If you have reached this point, you are in business. However,
it is important to note that Velocis is a dual-mode database
server. Since it operates internally as a hybrid-relational model
(network and hierarchical database engine), one has to take care
when creating databases. Two database structures are supported:
database schemas for non-SQL applications (also referred to as
native) and database schemas for SQL applications.</p><p>Both SQL and non-SQL databases are created by defining the
schema in a text file, compiled using the utility
<span   class="bold"><b>sddlp</b></span> for SQL databases and
<span   class="bold"><b>ddlproc</b></span> for non-SQL databases.
Database models are implemented at design time. Interestingly, the
network database model can be implemented in database designs using
the SQL Database Definition Language (DDL). This is done by using
Velocis' <b  >CREATE&nbsp;JOIN</b> statement to create a
permanent, pointer-based join on the primary and foreign keys of
selected SQL tables. This improves performance by eliminating the
runtime need for indexes between tables. The ability to implement
both network, relational or combined network/relational database
models using either the SQL DDL or the non-SQL (C-based) DDL is a
unique feature of Velocis. Adding to this flexibility, the SQL API
and record-level C-API can both be embedded in applications and
used to interact with databases created using either DDL.</p><p>Databases are registered either when compiled, by adding a
parameter to the command line or via the rdsadm (or admin.exe)
tools. These utilities are also invoked when adding or dropping
users.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23b8580.0x24a9728"></a>The Itres Application</h2></div></div><p>As was stated earlier, we desired a database engine that had
a C API interface (for precise, record-level access to the
database) and supported the SQL and ODBC industry standards. The
Itres database is running under Linux, which is the intranet
database server. The server listens to ODBC communication requests
from Windows 95/98 and NT and lets certain individuals run
admin.exe under Windows. Yes, I'm guilty of doing that, but the
Windows administration API is much nicer than the
command-line-driven Linux version. The ODBC interface is provided
primarily to enable Microsoft Access users to access the database,
without yielding to Linux.</p><p>In order to interface with the Velocis SQL engine, we
developed a Microsoft Access database conversion application based
on VBA (Visual Basic for Application). This tool can read the table
structures and data contents of any Microsoft Access 97 database
and generate an ANSI SQL text file for the transfer purpose.</p><p>Any SQL-compatible database engine, such as Velocis, can read
the SQL text files and import their contents from the Microsoft
Access database. The Itres Microsoft-Access-based inventory
database was successfully transferred to the Velocis.</p><p>It was also considered desirable for intranet users to have
access (or views) into databases. The obvious viewing tool of
choice is a web browser. To that end, we wrote CGI (Common Gateway
Interface) scripts using Tcl (Tool Command Language from Scriptics
Corporation). Tcl was extended as a dynamically loadable library,
using Velocis' extensive native C API, to provide access to the
database using SQL. These functions essentially utilized the sample
source code for <span   class="bold"><b>rsql</b></span> found in
Velocis' examples directory. From this point on, the effort shifted
away from API integration with Velocis to a database-design project
using SQL, which was our original goal.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23b8580.0x24a9990"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>In a nutshell, Velocis delivers all we expect of it: reliable
operation, interoperability among computing platforms, a strong C
API that supports complex operations and multithreading,
standards-based ANSI SQL interpreter and reliable archive and
recovery tools. Most importantly, Centura Software provides
customer support (for a fee) necessary for operating in commercial
settings.</p><p>We could use (and actually are using) PostgreSQL for
prototyping SQL code on many computers, but when it comes to
critical code, we prefer to use a supported tool. This preference
also drove our selection of Red Hat Linux as a server
platform.</p><p>Velocis is not perfect, and it does seem to have some
potential rough spots (in the installation area and startup), but
once configured and running, it works smoothly without
complaints.</p><p>[Editor's Note: The company has changed name to Birdstep
Technology, and Velocsis has become Birdstep RDM server
3.5.]</p><p><a href="3404s1.html" target="_self">VAST</a></p></div></div>
