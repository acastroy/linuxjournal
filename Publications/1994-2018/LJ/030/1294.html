It's a mission-critical, gotta-have application today. Survey those
business cards you've been collecting from associates lately. Odds
are most of them are sporting Internet e-mail addresses. In the
April 1996 issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Microsoft Magazine</em></span>, Bill
Gates said, &ldquo;[E-mail] is probably the most mission-critical
application for Microsoft in terms of running the company. If we
had to pick one application that would keep running no matter what,
E-mail would absolutely be it.&rdquo; People want fast, reliable,
written communications with people in their own company as well as
with others across the Net.
</p><p>My job is to keep e-mail running smoothly for my company. A
user recently complained to me because it took a whole 12 minutes
for her e-mail message to be delivered. People have ever-growing
expectations about what e-mail should do for them.</p><p>Providing e-mail in a homogeneous environment is simple. If a
shop consists entirely of Linux workstations, e-mail is practically
automatic. The same is true for all other major variants of Unix.
No special gateways are required to connect to the Internet since
the e-mail protocol spoken, SMTP, is the same across the board.
SMTP stands for Simple Mail Transport Protocol and has been the de
facto standard for Internet mail transmission for years. Exchanging
mail is almost as simple with non-SMTP commercial packages, as long
as everyone in the company uses the same one. The situation is more
complex when several incompatible systems are in use. Getting mail
to flow seamlessly between them and additionally the Internet can
pose a lot of problems. In this article I will explain how Caliber
Technology solved these problems quickly and inexpensively with
Linux and sendmail.</p><p>Caliber System, through its operating units RPS, Viking
Freight, Caliber Logistics, Roberts Express and Caliber Technology,
is a value added provider of transportation, logistics, and
information services. Caliber Technology provides integrated
information services to customers, Caliber companies and other
interested users.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14c1580.0x15b97c0"></a>The Problem</h2></div></div><p>The Caliber companies operate in vastly different computing
environments: IBM mainframes, AS/400s, HP/UX midrange systems,
Novell and NT LANs, Tandem minicomputers and more. The e-mail
platforms in use include Microsoft Mail, Lotus cc:Mail, Tandem PS
Mail, IBM OV/400, TAO/Emc2 and Microsoft Exchange. Unfortunately
these mail systems are generally not compatible with each other. We
have plans to migrate all the Caliber companies to compatible
e-mail platforms, but the migration effort will take at least two
years. The good news is gateways are available for all these
systems. The function of a mail gateway is to translate messages
from one format to another. Some gateways translate messages from
one proprietary format to another: for example, from Lotus cc:Mail
to Microsoft Mail and vice versa. Other gateways translate messages
between a proprietary format and a standard format. An example here
would be cc:Mail to and from SMTP. The two most common standard
formats are SMTP and X.400. X.400 is the CCITT/ISO standard and is
supported by many commercial networks. Since Caliber's goal was to
have all its internal mail systems conversing with each other and
with the Internet, SMTP was the obvious choice as the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>common language</em></span>.</p><p>Here's where it gets complicated. Like many companies,
Caliber Technology uses non-obvious login names for its mainframe
and LAN systems. In a typical Unix environment, my login name might
be <b  >tlowery</b>.</p><p>But in Caliber's multi-platform environment my login name is,
say, <b  >xyz123</b>. This was a legacy decision to
provide better security. There are too many IDs and they're too
ingrained in our systems to let us change them, even if we wanted
to. The problem is, most of the gateways we use do not allow the
SMTP e-mail name to differ from the local login ID. There's just no
way to specify that in the configuration. In other words, my
Internet mail address would have to be
<b  >xyz123@calibersys.com</b>. We found this distasteful
for obvious reasons; Actually, it's even worse. The gateways add
their network host name to the address for outbound mail. My
address would really be
<b  >xyz123@gateway1.calibersys.com</b>. So the first
problem to solve is to convert, for outbound messages, the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>private</em></span> gateway-based addresses to the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>public</em></span> Internet addresses, for example from
<b  >xyz123@gateway1.calibersys.com</b> to
<b  >tlowery@calibersys.com</b>.</p><p>Solving that problem creates another one. The
<b  >calibersys.com</b> e-mail domain is made up of
several mail systems. If mail is coming inbound from the Internet
to <b  >tlowery@calibersys.com</b>, how is the decision
made to send it to <b  >gateway1</b> (say, Microsoft
Mail) rather than <b  >gateway2</b> (TAO/Emc2)? Some
system along the way has to look up <b  >tlowery</b> and
decide to send the message to <b  >gateway1</b>. At
Caliber, we accept mail for <b  >calibersys.com</b>,
<b  >logistics.calibersys.com</b>,
<b  >shiprps.com</b>,
<b  >vikingfreight.com</b> and
<b  >roberts.com</b> and perform name lookups for all of
them.</p><p>Like many companies, our internal TCP/IP network is connected
to the Internet via a commercial firewall. We purchased the
firewall long before deciding to provide Internet mail service to
all the Caliber companies. In a way, it can be thought of as a
legacy system with some of its own drawbacks. Although our firewall
can solve either the first or second problem, it can't solve both
at the same time. According to our firewall vendor, we were their
first customer who needed name mapping and gateway hiding for
multiple domains, all at the same time. Commercial X.500-based
directory systems can be purchased to tie everything together
elegantly; the problem is cost. It doesn't make much sense to plunk
down $200,000 for a solution that, we hope, won't be needed two
years from now. With no quick fix from the firewall vendor in sight
and hoards of users beating down my door for inter-company and
Internet mail, I sat down and studied sendmail to see if it offered
any answers. Luckily it does.</p><p>The solution we have in place today can be seen in Figure 1.
Any mail message, including those to or from the Internet, that
travels from one system to another travels through a central hub.
For added reliability, there are actually two hubs. One serves as
the primary; the other is a backup in case the primary fails. The
sole purpose of these hubs is to hide the e-mail addressing details
from users. Let's look at an example.</p><p>First, let's say I at
<b  >tlowery@calibersys.com</b> want to send a message to
Jane at <b  >jdoe@vikingfreight.com</b>. Both the sender
and recipient addresses exist inside the Caliber firewall, so the
message will not be sent to the Internet. My mailbox name on
Microsoft Mail is <b  >xyz123</b> and the SMTP gateway
for Microsoft Mail is called <b  >gateway1</b>. When the
message leaves my mail system, it looks like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
From: xyz123@gateway1.calibersys.com
To: jdoe@vikingfreight.com
</pre><p>The message is routed to mhub, our primary address mapping
hub. First it looks up
<b  >xyz123@gateway1.calibersys.com</b>. When it finds a
match, that address is changed to
<b  >tlowery@calibersys.com</b>. It then looks at
<b  >jdoe@vikingfreight.com</b>. There are three possible
gateways for <b  >vikingfreight.com</b>,
<b  >gateway1</b>, <b  >gateway2</b> and
<b  >gateway3</b>, corresponding to Tandem PS Mail,
Microsoft Exchange and TAO/Emc2, respectively. The hub looks up the
address and sees that Jane's mailbox (<b  >jdoe</b>) is
on PS Mail and is called <b  >vft1100</b>. So
<b  >mhub</b> changes
<b  >jdoe@vikingfreight.com</b> to
<b  >vft1100@gateway1.vikingfreight.com</b>. The message
header now looks like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
From: tlowery@calibersys.com
To: vft1100@gateway1.vikingfreight.com
</pre><p>The hub then hands the message off to
<b  >gateway1.vikingfreight.com</b> for delivery to
Jane's mailbox. Now let's take a look a closer look at the
hub.</p><p>The primary mail hub is a Compaq Proliant 1500 with a 133 MHz
Pentium processor. The backup hub is a Dell OptiPlex with a 75 MHz
Pentium. Both are running Linux Slackware version 3.0. The decision
to run Linux was an easy one. I wanted a solid, dependable solution
at the lowest possible cost&mdash;that meant Intel-based hardware and
Linux. I've used Linux for various projects over the last three
years and have never experienced a kernel crash. I can't say that
for all the commercial operating systems I've used. The crucial
piece of software for this project is sendmail, available for
virtually all Unix variants. I knew if Linux didn't work out, I
could swap in a Sun, IBM or HP workstation without having to make
software changes. The risk of using Linux as the initial platform
was very small. In the four months since the project went live, I'm
happy to say that we've had zero problems with it. Now it's time to
discuss the nitty-gritty details. Two primary pieces make the hub
work: DNS and sendmail. I'll discuss each in turn.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14c1580.0x15ba948"></a>Enter DNS</h2></div></div><p>What follows is a brief introduction to DNS. If you're
already familiar with it feel free to skip the next few
paragraphs.</p><p>DNS stands for Domain Name System. Its job is to keep track
of each computer's name on the network. Programs that communicate
with other computers require the numerical address of that
computer. If all the program has is a name, it gives that name to
DNS and asks for the corresponding address. For example, the mail
hub has to get the address for
<b  >gateway1.calibersys.com</b> before it can deliver
mail to it. The hub asks DNS for the address and is told something
like 11.22.33.44. As soon as the hub has that address, it can
contact <b  >gateway1</b> to deliver the mail. The DNS
configuration files are filled with lines like these:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
mhub.calibersys.com.        IN A 12.34.56.78
mhub2.calibersys.com.       IN A 12.34.66.88
gateway1.vikingfreight.com. IN A 12.12.12.12
</pre><p>The first column is the name the machine goes by. The second
column, <b  >IN</b>, isn't important for our discussion.
The third column, <b  >A</b>, indicates that this is an
address record. It just means this line maps a name to an address.
The fourth column holds the address of the machine named in column
one. In addition to looking up names and giving back addresses, DNS
can also indicate that one computer accepts mail for another. When
computer A accepts mail for computer B, A is called a Mail
Exchanger for B. Whenever sendmail tries to deliver mail to a given
machine, it first looks for a mail exchanger. If no mail exchanger
is found, it then looks for a regular address. Let's look at an
example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
calibersys.com.    IN MX 10 mhub.calibersys.com.
vikingfreight.com. IN MX 10 mhub.calibersys.com.
shiprps.com.       IN MX 10 mhub.calibersys.com.
roberts.com.       IN MX 10 mhub.calibersys.com.
</pre><p>These lines tell sendmail that any mail addressed to
<b  >calibersys.com</b>,
<b  >vikingfreight.com</b>,
<b  >shiprps.com</b> or <b  >roberts.com</b>
should be sent to <b  >mhub.calibersys.com</b>. That's
how mail addressed to <b  >jdoe@vikingfreight.com</b> is
routed to the hub. The first column can be thought of as a machine
name. There doesn't have to be an actual computer using this name;
think of it as a pseudo-machine for e-mail purposes. It's what you
would see to the right of the <b  >@</b> symbol in an
e-mail address. Again, we don't care about the
<b  >IN</b> for this discussion. The
<b  >MX</b> in the third column tells DNS that this is a
mail exchanger record. Next comes the priority. A machine can have
several mail exchangers, each with a different priority. I'll
discuss that in a moment. Finally, the last column is the name of
the machine acting as the mail exchanger. Any machine acting as a
mail exchanger must be a real machine and must have a corresponding
address record. Now let's talk about multiple exchangers. Remember
that this project involves two hubs, a primary and a secondary, The
primary machine is <b  >mhub.calibersys.com</b>, the
secondary is <b  >mhub2.calibersys.com</b>. Both are
listed in DNS. Remember that the number 10 above referred to
priority. The lower the number, the higher the priority. Let's say
that we see the following lines in the DNS configuration file in
addition to the ones above:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
calibersys.com.   IN MX 20 mhub2.calibersys.com.
vikingfreight.com IN MX 20 mhub2.calibersys.com.
shiprps.com.      IN MX 20 mhub2.calibersys.com.
roberts.com.      IN MX 20 mhub2.calibersys.com.
</pre><p>sendmail would first try to send any mail destined for
<b  >vikingfreight.com</b> to <b  >mhub</b>,
since 10 represents a higher priority than 20. If that failed, it
would then try to send the mail to <b  >mhub2</b>, the
backup hub. After either hub receives the message, it looks up
<b  >jdoe@vikingfreight.com</b> and converts that address
to <b  >vft1100@gateway1.vikingfreight.com</b>. It would
then look up <b  >gateway1.vikingfreight.com</b>. It does
not have a mail exchanger record listed for it, but it does have an
address record. This means that <b  >gateway1</b> accepts
its own mail. Using DNS this way to route mail for a domain, e.g.,
mycompany.com, to an actual computer where the mail is stored,
e.g., mail.mycompany.com, is commonplace. What's different here is
the address mapping. To see how that's done, we need to look at
sendmail.cf.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14c1580.0x15b1cd8"></a>On to sendmail</h2></div></div><p>sendmail.cf is the configuration file for sendmail. So what
exactly is sendmail? sendmail is the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Swiss Army
knife</em></span> of mail systems. Officially it's known as a
message transfer agent, or MTA. There are a few different flavors;
Linux Slackware 3.0 comes with the one known as Berkeley V8. Users
typically don't interact with it directly. (That task is left to a
mail user agent or MUA such as elm or pine.) sendmail runs in the
background, silently routing mail from one computer to another. It
was written in the 1970's and 1980's by Eric Allman at U.C.
Berkeley. Because of Eric's flexible design, sendmail is still the
most widely used MTA on the Internet. It's standard issue software
with just about any Unix-based operating system. All that
flexibility comes at the price of complexity. sendmail is probably
the most complex of all the Unix utilities. I'll cover some of
sendmail's features and how they can be used to solve our address
mapping problems, but a complete discussion of sendmail is beyond
the scope of this article. For more information see the resource
box. The Caliber mail hub makes heavy use of three sendmail
mechanisms: macros, classes, and database lookups. All these are
specified in the configuration file, sendmail.cf. sendmail macros
are similar to C language macros. A primary difference is that the
macro name can only be one character long. For example,</p><pre     class="programlisting">
DG gateway1.vikingfreight.com
</pre><p>defines the macro <b  >G</b> as
<b  >gateway1.vikingfreight.com</b>. Its C language
equivalent would be:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
 #define G gateway1.vikingfreight.com
</pre><p>The macro is invoked later by specifying a dollar sign followed by
the macro name, e.g., <b  >$G</b>. Anywhere the symbol
<b  >$G</b> appears,
<b  >gateway1.vikingfreight.com</b> would be substituted
in its place. Classes are very similar to macros. The difference is
that they can expand to one of many different values. For example,</p><pre     class="programlisting">
CU xyz123 abc789 def444
</pre><p>defines the class U with three values. Alternatively, sendmail can
   read the values from an external text file:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
FU /etc/mail/users
</pre><p>This ability is handy if you want to define a class with a large
number of values. The class is invoked by specifying a dollar sign,
then an equal sign, then the class name, e.g.,
<b  >$=U</b>. I'll explain a little later how classes are
useful. The third mechanism exploited by the mail hub is the
database lookup. sendmail can consult external databases and swap
the lookup key with the value found in the database. A few
different database formats are supported; we use GNU dbm databases.
The records in these databases have only two fields. The lookup key
is the first field. Everything following that is considered a value
field. A dbm database with four records could look like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
xyz123  tlowery
ft1100  jdoe
bc789   asmith
def444  bjones
</pre><p>If sendmail consults the database looking for
<b  >abc789</b>, it will find the value of
<b  >asmith</b> and substitute that value in place of
<b  >abc789</b> in the e-mail address.</p><p>That covers the basic mechanisms. Now let's look at the
configuration file itself. sendmail.cf if filled with lines like
this one:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
R$=U@$G  $:$(mapdb $1 $)@$K
</pre><p>These lines are known as <span   class="emphasis"><em>rules</em></span>. The
rules are grouped together in subroutines, each of which is called
by sendmail to perform a certain task. These subroutines are called
<span   class="emphasis"><em>sets</em></span>. It's a terse programming language based
on regular expression pattern matching. Each rule examines an
e-mail address and may alter it. Rules have two parts, the
left-hand-side (LHS) and right-hand-side (RHS), separated by one or
more tab characters. The LHS is a pattern; sendmail tries to match
the current address with this pattern. If the address matches the
pattern, sendmail will rewrite the address based on what the RHS
says. If there is no match, the RHS is ignored. Now let's look at
the LHS of our sample rule, left to right:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
R$=U@$G
</pre><p>The <b  >R</b> simply states that this is a rule. All
rules start with the letter R. The next three characters,
<b  >$=U</b>, are a class reference. Given the class
definition above, <b  >$=U</b> will match
<b  >xyz123</b>, <b  >abc789</b> or
<b  >def444</b> successfully. If the address begins with
any other string, the match will fail. The next character is a
literal <b  >@</b>. That character must appear in the
address for a match to happen. The following two characters,
<b  >$G,</b> are a macro reference. The macro expands to:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
gateway1.calibersys.com
</pre><p>The address <b  >xyz123@gateway1.calibersys.com</b> would
match the pattern and the RHS would be invoked.
<b  >tza555@gateway1.calibersys.com</b> would not match
since <b  >tza555</b> is not a member of the U class.
Likewise, <b  >xyz123@gateway2.calibersys.com</b> would
not match since <b  >gateway2.calibersys.com</b> is not
the value of the G macro. Now let's move on to the RHS to see how
an address is rewritten. The RHS of our sample rule is this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$:$(mapdb $1 $)@$K
</pre><p>The first two characters, <b  >$:</b> tell sendmail to
only invoke this RHS once. By default, sendmail will invoke the RHS
repeatedly as long as the result still matches the LHS. Following
that is the string,</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$(mapdb $1 $)
</pre><p>which performs the database lookup, tells sendmail to look for a
database named <b  >mapdb</b> and search for the first
item from the LHS. <b  >$2</b> would search for the
second item and so on. The first match from our LHS was
<b  >xyz123</b>. sendmail then searches for that string
and finds <b  >tlowery</b>, so it replaces
<b  >xyz123</b> with <b  >tlowery</b> in the
address. The next character in the RHS, <b  >@</b>, is a
literal. It's written to the new address following
<b  >tlowery</b>. Next comes <b  >$K</b>, a
macro reference. Let's assume the macro <b  >K</b> was
defined like so:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
DK calibersys.com
</pre><p>sendmail will place <b  >calibersys.com</b> after
<b  >@</b> in the new address, completing the rewriting
process.</p><p>From this we see how a private address of
<b  >xyz123@gateway1.calibersys.com</b> can be converted
to a public address of <b  >tlowery@calibersys.com</b>.
The recipient of the message will never know the original sender
address was not the public address. Switching from public to
private can be accomplished in a similar manner. This discussion of
address mapping has only scratched the surface; sendmail's
flexibility can help the e-mail administrator solve virtually any
mail routing task.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14c1580.0x15b33e0"></a>The Result</h2></div></div><p>The mail routing hub has been in operation at Caliber for
about three months, and in that time it has routed over 48,000
messages. Given current traffic statistics, I expect it to handle
about 600,000 messages during its first year. Fortunately, the few
problems we've experienced have been due to configuration problems.
It's too easy to leave out a period here or a dollar sign there.
Linux and sendmail have performed flawlessly.</p><p>In a perfect world this solution wouldn't be needed. If the
Caliber companies used only one common e-mail platform, there would
be no need to look up mailbox names and route messages to the right
gateway. But many large companies have a number of legacy systems
that won't be going away any time soon. Those are exactly the types
of environments where tools like sendmail work best. Due to network
logistics and geography, we will still be using some of our legacy
mail systems until 1998. In the meantime, our Linux e-mail hub will
continue chugging through messages, routing them between disparate
platforms and helping us meet increasing user expectations.</p><p><a href="1294s1.html" target="_self">Sidebar: DNS and Sendmail
