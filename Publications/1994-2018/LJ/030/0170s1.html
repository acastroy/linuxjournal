  <p>Since writing my article, both Red Hat and Craftworks have released newer versions of their products. Craftworks is still in a beta stage; they feel that waiting for Linux 2.0.0 is a good baseline for delivering their finished product. They remain based on Linux 1.3.89, while Red Hat is based on 1.3.90.</p>

  <p>Both kernels are very stable, so you should experience little problem there. Also, Linux has released 2.0.0 source, so, regardless of which baseline you obtain, there's room for some upgrading.</p>

  <p>The major areas of difference between the two packages are the ease of installation and the ability to track current Linux/AXP development efforts. Linux on the Alpha currently supports the statically-linked ECOFF object file format. Work is progressing on ELF support (while not eschewing ECOFF, which provides compatibility with DEC Unix (a.k.a., OSF/1)), as well as use of the glibc libraries. Red Hat, possibly because they run the mail group, seem very involved. Craftworks seems aware of developments and is working on FORTRAN.</p>

  <p>As I was upgrading Red Hat, I had the chance to use glint/rpm. You get much tighter control over what is being installed, to the point of saying &ldquo;yes, I want Emacs&rdquo;, rather than the uninformative &ldquo;Base Installation&rdquo;. Craftworks, too, has an upgrade installation package (CRAFT), but Beta 1 was not compatible with it, so I did a full install.</p>

  <p>Craftworks' strength, however, is in the creation of associative file systems. A panel appears with <tt>/</tt>, <tt>/usr</tt>, <tt>/home</tt>, <tt>/local</tt>, <tt>/pub</tt> and swap defined as potential mount points. For each, you can specify that it is hosted on a different partition/hard drive. This allows for great flexibility in splitting operating systems between hard drives. The information is naturally saved to the <tt>/etc/fstab</tt> file.</p>

  <p>Red Hat finally includes the TGA device driver for X-windows. Sadly, knowledge was not passed down to the install program, so you have to manually install it afterwards.</p>

  <p>LaserMoon has decided to delay the release of its Alpha port until shared libraries are available, pointing out that the lack of this capability is a real performance hit for what should be a very high performance platform.</p>
