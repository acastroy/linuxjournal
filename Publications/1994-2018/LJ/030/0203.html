    Introducing 'Linux Means Business' column.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xde7580.0xedf2f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>It has been called to my attention that
we didn't introduce the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Means Business</em></span>
column that first appeared in <i  >Linux Journal</i>
issue number 26, June 1996. So without further delay, here is a
belated introduction.
</p><p>Anyone who has used Linux needs little convincing that it is
a real software product: it's a complete system; it's reliable;
it's available from multiple sources; and it's documented.</p><p>However, the Linux operating system has a problem&mdash;it's free.
That one fact means some people will not take it seriously. When
reading the Usenet newsgroups, I continue to see people concerned
with questions like &ldquo;Is Linux good enough to do my task?&rdquo; or
&ldquo;How can I convince my boss that Linux is real?&rdquo;</p><p>While our (occasional) <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux in the Real
World</em></span> column has touched on many places where Linux
offered a solution, it has tended to be more of an example of how
one technical person managed to use Linux as a base to do something
fairly unique for them. These columns contain good information.
With LMB, however, we want to address different issues&mdash;what might
be considered ordinary business problems.</p><p>For example, in this issue, LMB covers how a large
corporation has used Linux to reduce the complexities of their
electronic mail handling system. This solution did not require any
add-on software, only the configuring of a Linux system to do the
task at hand. This sort of article can offer a solution to two
different issues: the job addressed in the article as well as the
job of convincing management that Linux is a viable software
system.</p><p>When we came up with the idea for the column, Gena Shurtleff
sent out a query to Usenet looking for articles. Response has been
overwhelming; therefore, we are planning a future issue of
<i  >Linux Journal</i> that will focus on articles in
which Linux has been installed as a solution to a particular
problem. This issue will include both the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Means
Business</em></span> and the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux in the Real
World</em></span> articles. If you have a story to contribute, send
it to us via e-mail at
