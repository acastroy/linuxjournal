computer users everywhere. Some picture flying heads and cartoonish
figures that wave from web pages. Others remember segmentation
faults and hung Netscapes. Most people are left staring at the
steaming cup-o'-joe icon, having no idea what it all really means.
This article will discuss what exactly Java is, and where it fits
in the big picture of computing.
</p><p>The Java programming language is roughly similar to C++,
Objective C and Smalltalk, with some features removed and a few
features added:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>It is <span   class="emphasis"><em>procedural</em></span>, like C, as
opposed to functional like Lisp.</p></li><li><p>It is <span   class="emphasis"><em>object-oriented</em></span>, like
C++. It supports classes, single class inheritance, multiple
interface inheritance, access protection and exceptions. It does
not support operator overloading or templates (though it may
support template-like constructs in the future).</p></li><li><p>All casts are dynamic and safe; it's impossible to
cast an object to an inappropriate type.</p></li><li><p>Everything in Java is class-oriented. There is no
global scope, there are no global variables, and there are no
explicit function pointers.</p></li><li><p>Arrays of arbitrary dimension are supported and act
like objects.</p></li><li><p>It supports <span   class="emphasis"><em>threads</em></span> and
provides <span   class="emphasis"><em>synchronization primitives</em></span>. Threads,
sometimes called lightweight processes, allow several separate
execution paths to run concurrently through a program.
Synchronization primitives ensure that separate tasks are performed
in the correct order.</p></li><li><p>It supports <span   class="emphasis"><em>modules</em></span>, so it
doesn't need a preprocessor. There are no
<b  >#include</b> directives as the equivalent
functionality is built into the languagex), no macros, no
<b  >#define</b>, etc.</p></li><li><p>It supports
<span   class="emphasis"><em>garbage-collection</em></span>, and there is no support
for explicit deallocation. This simplifies programming dramatically
and eliminates <span   class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span> memory allocation
errors.</p></li><li><p>All objects implicitly use <span   class="emphasis"><em>reference
semantics</em></span>, which roughly means <span   class="emphasis"><em>every object
acts like a pointer, but used as if it were a value</em></span>. All
base types (<b  >int</b>, <b  >char</b>, etc.)
use value semantics.</p></li><li><p>Java is <span   class="emphasis"><em>safe</em></span>, meaning it is
impossible to: de-reference a pointer outside a segment; use memory
that has been deallocated; or use an object as the wrong type. A
Java program will never cause a segmentation fault (actually, the
Java interpreter <span   class="emphasis"><em>does</em></span> have a few bugs that can
result in an application crashing, but these are being
fixed).</p></li></ul></div><p>Java comes bundled with a standard library called the Java
API (Application Program Interface) that provides:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Basic file input and output</p></li><li><p>Networking, particularly TCP/IP, UDP, and
HTTP</p></li><li><p>Basic dynamic container classes like Vector,
Dictionary, etc.</p></li><li><p>Graphics and GUI programming</p></li></ul></div><p>Another important component of the Java system is the
compiler. A Java compiler translates source files
(<span   class="emphasis"><em>e.g.</em></span>, Foo.java) into one or more class files
(<span   class="emphasis"><em>e.g.</em></span>, Foo.class). The
<b  >.class</b> files correspond roughly to the
<b  >.o</b> (or <b  >.obj</b>) files in C, but
there is one crucial difference: while <b  >.o</b> files
contain machine-specific instructions, <b  >.class</b>
files contain only a generic pseudo-assembly-code called
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Bytecode</em></span> that is uniform across all platforms.
To enable this, every platform that supports Java must have a Java
runtime that will interpret and execute Java Bytecode.</p><p>The underlying Bytecode to which Java compiles is described
under Sun's Java Virtual Machine (or JVM) specification
(<a href="http://java.sun.com/doc/vmspec/html/vmspec-1.html" target="_self">java.sun.com/doc/vmspec/html/vmspec-1.html</a>)
A Java runtime emulates a JVM, so that it can run the Java Bytecode
contained within <b  >.class</b> files. The JVM is a key
component to Java's ubiquity; rather than require that every
individual application support multiple platforms, developers need
only write one version of a program, and are assured that it will
run everywhere. The only program that needs to be ported across
multiple platforms is the Java runtime. Despite Java's youth, most
major platforms are supported.</p><p>Let's now take a moment to trace the steps involved in
letting you see waving animated characters within your web
browser.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>A programmer on the Web somewhere writes a Java
program, and converts <b  >.java</b> source files into
<b  >.class</b> files using a java compiler. This
programmer puts a reference to these <b  >.class</b>
files within an &lt;APPLET&gt; tag in her web page.</p></li><li><p>You point your browser to her web page, and your
browser sees the &lt;APPLET&gt; tag pointing to the
<b  >.class</b> files. Your browser then downloads her
<b  >.class</b> files over the net.</p></li><li><p>Your browser starts up its Java runtime subsystem
and begins executing the <b  >.class</b> files that it
downloaded.</p></li></ul></div><p>At this point, you might be wondering what prevents a
malicious programmer from doing horrible things to your computer
while the comforting cartoonish character distracts you from the
sound of your hard drive as it's being reformatted. The answer lies
in the Java SecurityManager. This class, a part of the standard,
implements a <span   class="emphasis"><em>security policy</em></span> for all untrusted
programs. Here, untrusted programs are those that are downloaded
over the net. In the current release of Netscape, the
SecurityManager that the Java runtime uses does not allow untrusted
Java programs to read or write files, nor does it allow them to
make network connections anywhere except to the host from which the
program came. This, then, forms a sort of sand box in which the
Java program is confined.</p><p>Another key facet of the Java security model is the Bytecode
Verifier. The Bytecode Verifier checks all incoming programs to
make sure that they satisfy some basic safety constraints
(<span   class="emphasis"><em>e.g.</em></span>, every pointer cast is a safe one, there
can be no stack overflows, etc.). This prevents malicious
programmers from creating bad <b  >.class</b> files by
programming Java Bytecode by hand in an effort to circumvent the
safety features of the Java language. If your Netscape downloads a
<b  >.class</b> file that fails to pass the verification
stage, it will simply refuse to run the code.</p><p>Most people view Java as <span   class="emphasis"><em>the</em></span> programming
language of the Web. Though Java certainly serves well in this
regard, it is actually much more general; it is appropriate for
stand-alone, non-Web programming as well. You can write Java
programs that can be run outside of a web browser, and as trusted
programs they can do everything a C or C++ program might do, such
as access the file-system. In fact, in the Linux development
pre-2.0 kernels there is support for the Java binary format. This
support means that you can run Java Bytecode programs just as you
would run <b  >ELF</b>- or
<b  >a.out</b>-format executables from the command line,
without explicitly invoking a Java runtime. The great advantage of
writing programs in Java is that they are immediately portable
across a wide variety of platforms and architectures.</p><p>One problem with current Java implementations is speed;
performance is many times slower than C under most current
implementations. This is because the Java Bytecode is interpreted,
unlike native assembly code compiled from C programs which is run
directly by the processor. The speed problem is being mitigated,
however, by the development of so-called &ldquo;Just-In-Time&rdquo;
compilers. These compilers (which are actually part of the Java
runtime system) compile <b  >.class</b> files into native
assembly code on the fly. In so doing, they can speed up Java
programs many times. Furthermore, since they only compile classes
as they execute, the typical initial delay associated with
traditional compilation is eliminated. As these compilers mature,
we can expect the performance hit associated with Java to
disappear.</p><p>At this point, you may want to know how you can become
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Java-enabled</em></span>. If you simply want to run Java
applets on your machine, (that is, Java programs transferred over
the Web) you can do so using the latest Netscape beta, available
from
<a href="http://www.netscape.com/" target="_self">www.netscape.com/</a>.
If you'd like to begin experimenting with programming in Java, or
running non-browser stand-alone Java programs, you can do so with
the free Linux port of the Java Development Kit (JDK). Point your
browser at
<a href="http://java.blackdown.org/java-linux/Information.html" target="_self">java.blackdown.org/java-linux/Information.html</a>
to find out where to get this. If you'd like an alternative to the
Java compiler included in the JDK, there is EspressoGrinder, a
drop-in replacement for the JDK compiler. EspressoGrinder is
written in Java, and thus can be run anywhere that a Java runtime
has been ported. You can get it at
<a href="http://wwwipd.ira.uka.de/~espresso/" target="_self">wwwipd.ira.uka.de/~espresso/</a>.

happenings, check out Sun's site at:

A Java FAQ is available from
<a href="http://sunsite.unc.edu/javafaq/javafaq.html" target="_self">sunsite.unc.edu/javafaq/javafaq.html</a>.</p><p>The political and economic significance of Java is enormous,
especially for Linux developers. Because of the high degree of
virtualization in the JVM, developers are free to create their
applications on platforms other than those that they target. Thus,
it is now possible to use your Linux system to develop Java
applications that can effortlessly tap into the popularity of
Windows, Macintosh, HP-UX or SGI machines, to name a few.
Furthermore, Linux will undoubtedly be able to reap the benefits of
applications written under other platforms for exactly the same
reasons. Overall, we can expect Java to usher in a new era of
software interoperability, empowering developers and users alike on
all platforms.</p></div></div>
