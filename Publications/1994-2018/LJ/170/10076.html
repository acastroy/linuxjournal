Use encrypted folders with your custom live CD.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x172b580.0x1823460"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Last month, I described a simple procedure for customizing the standard
Ubuntu Desktop 7.10 live CD. We got as far as uninstalling software packages
to make room for other things, installing some of those other things and
updating all packages on the live CD image.
</p><p>
This month, I go a step further by creating a TrueCrypt-encrypted
Documents directory that you can mount from a USB drive, in conjunction
with your live CD. Although that's handy in and of itself, you'll be able to
use the same method, with only minor modifications, to encrypt other
important directories as well.
</p><p>
As with last month's article, here I use Ubuntu both as the master system to
customize and repackage our live CD and for the source of the live CD ISO
image we'll customize. It's a popular and surprisingly compact
mainstream distribution. So, also like last month's column, much of what
follows will apply directly to other squashfs-based distributions, such as
Linux Mint, SLAX and BackTrack (not to mention Ubuntu variants, such as
Kubuntu and Edubuntu), and indirectly to most other live CD distributions.
</p><p>
I'm going to avoid the temptation to make this article a ground-up tutorial
on volume encryption in general or TrueCrypt specifically. Either topic
would make a substantial article all by itself. Maybe I'll tackle those at
a later date, unless I can persuade the Paranoid Penguin's Minister of
Cryptographic Outreach, Tony Stieber, to tackle them for me. (You may
remember Tony's articles &ldquo;GnuPG Hacks&rdquo; and &ldquo;OpenSSL
Hacks&rdquo; in the March 2006 and July 2006 issues of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span>, respectively). But, I will show you how to install
TrueCrypt on Ubuntu systems, and how to create and mount TrueCrypt volumes.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x172b580.0x1823828"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Ubuntu 7.10 vs. 8.4</b></p><p>
I based the customized live CD in this article's examples on Ubuntu 7.10,
aka Gutsy Gibbon. When I wrote the article, 7.10 was current, but due to
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>'s printing schedule, by the time you read this, Ubuntu 8.4
(Hardy Heron) should be available. However, most, if not all, of the example
commands herein should work fine with Ubuntu 8.4. 
</p><p>
Note that Ubuntu 8.4 includes the packages easycrypt and gdecrypt, two
graphical front ends for TrueCrypt, but no packages for TrueCrypt itself,
on which both easycrypt and gdecrypt depend (though the latter, even
without TrueCrypt, can create non-TrueCrypt-compatible encrypted volumes).
So the instructions I give here on downloading and installing TrueCrypt
itself still are applicable to Ubuntu 8.4.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x172b580.0x1823ae8"></a>
Installing TrueCrypt</h2></div></div><p>
Although I just disclaimed the intention of making this a TrueCrypt primer, a
little introduction is in order. TrueCrypt is a free, open-source,
cross-platform volume-encryption utility. It's also highly portable.
The
TrueCrypt binary itself is self-contained, and any TrueCrypt volume can be
mounted on any Windows or Linux system on which the TrueCrypt binary will
run or compile. TrueCrypt can be run either from a command line or in the X
Window System.
</p><p>
TrueCrypt is becoming quite popular and is held in high regard by
crypto experts I know (it appears to be a sound implementation of
known, good algorithms like AES and Twofish), but its license is a bit
complicated. For this reason, TrueCrypt hasn't yet been adopted
into Debian or Ubuntu officially, even though Ubuntu 8.10's universe packages
easycrypt and gdecrypt depend on it (see the Ubuntu 7.10 vs. 8.4 sidebar).
</p><p>
So, to install TrueCrypt on an Ubuntu system, you need to download it
directly from <a href="http://www.truecrypt.org/downloads.php" target="_self">www.truecrypt.org/downloads.php</a>. When I was writing
this article, TrueCrypt version 5.1 was current, and the Ubuntu deb file I
downloaded was called truecrypt-5.1-ubuntu-x86.tar.gz, though by the time
you read this, it may be something else. Besides an Ubuntu deb package,
TrueCrypt also is available as a SUSE RPM file (that also might work on
other RPM-based distros) and as source code.
</p><p>
Now, it's time to install TrueCrypt. You're going to need to install
TrueCrypt in at least two places: on the master system you're using to
create your custom live CD and either on the live CD image itself or on
whatever removable media (such as a USB drive) you're going to
keep your encrypted volume.
</p><p>
First, let's install TrueCrypt on the master system. Open a command shell,
unpack the TrueCrypt archive in your home directory, and change your
working directory to the directory that gets unpacked:

<pre     class="programlisting">
bash-$ tar -xzvf ./truecrypt-5.1-ubuntu-x86.tar.gz

bash-$ cd truecrypt-5.1
</pre>
</p><p>
Next, use the dpkg command to install the deb file:

<pre     class="programlisting">
bash-$ sudo dpkg -i ./truecrypt_5.1-0_i386.deb
</pre>
</p><p>
With TrueCrypt 5.1, only three files are installed on your system: its
license and user guide, both in /usr/share/truecrupt/doc/, and the binary
itself, /usr/bin/truecrypt. TrueCrypt doesn't require any special kernel
modules; it's a monolothic process. This means that if you copy
/usr/bin/truecrypt to the same Flash drive on which you keep your encrypted
volume, you won't need to install it on your Ubuntu live CD.
</p><p>
You may prefer doing so anyhow. Here's how:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Follow steps 00&ndash;12 in the procedure I described last month
for mounting your custom ISO and chrooting into it (see Appendix).
</p></li><li><p>
From a different, non-chrooted shell, copy the TrueCrypt
deb package truecrypt_5.1-0_i386.deb into the ISO root you just chrooted
into (isonew/custom/ in last month's examples).
</p></li><li><p>
Back in your chrooted shell, run <tt  >dpkg -i
./truecrypt_5.1-0_i386.deb</tt> (no sudo necessary here, as you're already
root).
</p></li><li><p>
Finally, follow steps 19&ndash;33 from last month's procedure to clean up,
unmount and repackage your custom live CD image. And, of course, use your
CD-burning application of choice to burn your image into a shiny new
live CD
</p></li></ol></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x172b580.0x1824328"></a>
Creating an Encrypted Volume</h2></div></div><p>
Now, you can create an encrypted volume. For our purposes here, it will be a
simple &ldquo;file vault&rdquo; to mount as a subdirectory of your home
directory. But, it just as easily could be an <span   class="emphasis"><em>entire</em></span> home directory that you mount
<span   class="emphasis"><em>over</em></span> the one your live CD uses. Come to think of it,
you also could do
that with /etc. For now, however, I'll leave it to you to explore the
technical subtleties of those usage scenarios (see Resources for some
pointers on home directory encryption).
</p><p>
TrueCrypt can be run either in text mode, via the <tt  >truecrypt
-t</tt> command
(followed by various options) or in graphical mode. For now, let's stick to
graphical mode. To start it, simply type the following from within a
terminal window:

<pre     class="programlisting">

bash-$ truecrypt &amp;

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x172b580.0x1824640"></a></h2></div></div><p>
And, you should see what's shown in Figure 1.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10076f1.large.jpg"><img src="10076f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. TrueCrypt 5.1 GUI for Linux
</p></div></div><p>
Click Create Volume to start the TrueCrypt Volume Creation Wizard. We'll
create a standard TrueCrypt volume, not a hidden one (you can hide one
TrueCrypt volume inside the &ldquo;empty&rdquo; space of another, as all unused
space in a TrueCrypt volume is filled with random characters). So, click
Next.
</p><p>
In the wizard's next screen, you can specify the path and name of the file
in which your encrypted volume will be stored or the name of an entire disk
partition to encrypt. Here, we're creating a file-hosted volume, and in our
example scenario, this file will be /home/ubuntu/realhome2 (no
file extension is necessary). After typing that path, click Next.
</p><p>
In the wizard's third screen, we must specify the volume's size. In this
example, I'm creating a 500MB volume.
</p><p>
After clicking Next, you can choose an Encryption Algorithm and a Hash
Algorithm. The defaults, AES and RIPEMD-160, respectively, are good
choices. You also can click the Test button to make sure TrueCrypt's
built-in cryptographic functions work properly on your system.
</p><p>
The next step is to set a volume password. Choose a strong one! You 
also can specify and create keyfiles&mdash;files that TrueCrypt will look for
every time you mount this volume. If any keyfile is missing, or if its
contents have changed in any way since you created the volume, TrueCrypt
won't mount the volume. Properly used, keyfiles can provide another level
of authentication to your encrypted volume. But, we aren't going to use any
in this example. Enter a password (twice) and click Next.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Important note:</b></span> TrueCrypt has no back doors of any kind. For this
reason, if you forget your volume's password, or if any of its keyfiles are
lost or corrupted, you will <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> be able to recover the contents of
your encrypted volume. By all means, choose a difficult-to-guess volume
password, but make sure you won't forget or lose it yourself!
</p><p>
Now we come to the Format Options screen, which asks a subtle question:
which filesystem? The choices here are FAT, which is actually the Windows
95 vfat filesystem (MS-DOS FAT16 with long filenames), and None. If you
select FAT, TrueCrypt will format your new encrypted volume for you.
However, vfat isn't a journaling filesystem; it isn't very resilient to
file corruption and other filesystem errors. 
</p><p>
Worse, strange things can happen if you store certain kinds of Linux system
files on a vfat partition, because vfat can't store certain Linux file
attributes. The only reason to choose vfat is if you intend to use the
volume with both Linux and Windows systems. If you're going to use it
only on Linux, especially if you're going to use it as a home directory (or
/etc), you should choose None, and formate the virtual partition
yourself, which I'll show you how to do in a minute.
</p><p>
For now, click Next to proceed to the Volume Format screen.
This is your chance to generate some entropy (randomness) with which
TrueCrypt can initialize its crypto engine, pursuant to encrypting your
volume. To do so, move your mouse randomly within the window a while, and then
click Format.
</p><p>
That's it! You've created /home/ubuntu/realhome2 and now are ready to
format it. Click Exit to close the Volume Creation Wizard.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x172b580.0x1c1d078"></a>
Formatting the Volume</h2></div></div><p>
My personal favorite native-Linux journaling filesystem is ext3, so that's
what we use here. Before we format our new volume though, we need to
have TrueCrypt map it to a virtual device. This isn't really mounting per
se, but that's the TrueCrypt function we need to use.
</p><p>
Back in the TrueCrypt GUI (Figure 1), type the full path of our new volume
(/home/ubuntu/realhome2) in the text box next to the key icon (or navigate
to it using the Select File... dialog), and click Mount. In the box
that pops up, enter your volume's password, and then click Options &gt;.
Here's where things get a little strange. Click the box
next to Do not mount (Figure 2). Now you can click OK.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10076f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Not Mounting Our Unformatted Volume
</p></div></div><p>
Why, you may wonder, are you telling TrueCrypt &ldquo;do not mount&rdquo; in the middle
of the Mount dialog? Because, of course, you can't mount an unformatted
partition. But, TrueCrypt can map it to a virtual device, and this is, in
fact, what TrueCrypt has just done.
</p><p>
Back in the TrueCrypt main screen, your volume file now should be listed in
Slot 1. To find the virtual device to which it's been mapped, click
Volume Properties. As shown in Figure 3, realhome3 has been mapped to
/dev/loop0.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10076f3.large.jpg"><img src="10076f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Volume Properties
</p></div></div><p>
Now, we can format the new encrypted volume. In your terminal window, type:

<pre     class="programlisting">
05-$ sudo mkfs.ext3 /dev/loop0
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x172b580.0x1c1d758"></a>
Volume Ownership</h2></div></div><p>
Voil&agrave;! You now have a mountable, usable encrypted virtual volume! If you
want to test it or begin populating it with confidential data you intend
to use with your live CD, you can mount it &ldquo;for real&rdquo; by going back to the
TrueCrypt GUI, clicking Dismount, and then clicking Mount (the same
button; it's context-sensitive). (This time, do <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> select the Do
not mount button.) If you don't specify a mountpoint, TrueCrypt 
automatically creates one called /media/truecrypt1.
</p><p>
Note that if you mount different TrueCrypt volumes in succession, the
mountpoints will be named /media/truecrypt1, /media/truecrypt2 and so on, where
the trailing digit corresponds to the Slot number TrueCrypt uses in
creating virtual device mappings (Figure 1). Note also that when mounting
a TrueCrypt volume from the GUI, you may need to click on an empty
slot number before clicking the Mount number, if one isn't selected
already.
</p><p>
By default, TrueCrypt mounts your ext3-formatted TrueCrypt volume with
root ownership. Depending on how you plan to use it, that may be
appropriate. But, as a matter of principle, you don't want to use root
privileges for ordinary tasks like word processing. If you're going to use
this volume as your Documents directory, it's going to need to be usable
by some unprivileged user.
</p><p>
The custom live CD image we created last month has only the default Ubuntu
accounts on it. For now, let's stick with those&mdash;that way, you'll be able
to use this encrypted volume with <span   class="emphasis"><em>any</em></span> Ubuntu 7.10 live CD, not just
your custom image. Here's how to make your volume usable by the default
live CD user account ubuntu.
</p><p>
First, create, map, format and mount your volume as described above. I'll
assume that TrueCrypt mounted it to /media/truecrypt1. 
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x172b580.0x1c1dac8"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
TrueCrypt 5.x Idiosyncracies</b></p><p>
With version 5.0, TrueCrypt added a GUI to the Linux version that is very
similar to that of the Windows version (in prior versions, TrueCrypt for
Linux was command-line-only). But, TrueCrypt versions 5.0 and 5.0a for Linux
both had serious limitations and bugs, including the omission of the -c
option that allows you to create TrueCrypt volumes from a command line and
of the TrueCrypt man page.
</p><p>
Toward the end of the day that I submitted this article for publication,
TrueCrypt 5.1 was released, and the -c option <span   class="emphasis"><em>has</em></span> been restored in this
version. Other bugs in 5.0/a may or may not be fixed (some users have
complained of performance problems and even TrueCrypt-induced system
crashes with the Linux version). Although I have changed the filenames in this
article's examples to reflect the new version, I didn't have time to test
version 5.1 myself, so I can't tell you how significant an improvement it
is.
</p><p>
So, be forewarned. On the one hand, there doesn't appear to be any serious
<span   class="emphasis"><em>security</em></span> issues with TrueCrypt 5 for Linux. Obviously,
as I've
devoted most of this article to it, I think it's useful and trustworthy
enough for the purposes described herein. 
</p><p>
But, TrueCrypt historically has been a very Windows-oriented project, and
this still appears to be the case. So, as with anything, be sure to
test TrueCrypt thoroughly before depending on it in any kind of production
or mission-critical context. One alternative to consider is TrueCrypt
version 4.3, a known, stable release that's still available (at the time of this
writing) on the <a href="http://www.truecrypt.org" target="_self">www.truecrypt.org</a> Web site. But, it's seldom a good idea to trust
obsolete software for <span   class="emphasis"><em>too</em></span> long.
</p></div><p>
Open or switch to a terminal window. If you do an <tt  >ls
-l</tt> of /media, the
listing for your volume should look like this:


<pre     class="programlisting">
drwxr-xr-x  3 root     root  1024 2008-03-09 23:21 truecrypt1
</pre>
</p><p>
As you can see, only root can use this directory. Because we want it to be
usable by our live CD's ubuntu account, and because that account's user ID (UID)
and group ID (GID) are 999 and 999, respectively, we issue this command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
05-$ sudo chown -R 999:999 /media/truecrypt1
</pre>
</p><p>
This performs a bit of magic. The user/group ownerships you just specified
are now embedded in your TrueCrypt volume's filesystem. From this point on,
wherever you mount this volume, regardless of the mountpoint's ownership
and permissions when it isn't in use, your volume will be mounted with UID
and GID both set to 999. 
</p><p>
If you subsequently mount the TrueCrypt volume on a system on which some
user or group other than ubuntu has a numeric ID of 999 (per its local
/etc/passwd and /etc/group files), then that user or group will own the
mounted volume, even if that system has an account or group named ubuntu.
And, if on that system the UID 999 doesn't correspond to
<span   class="emphasis"><em>any</em></span> user, you'll
need to be root in order to use the mounted volume. (But, in that case,
you'll be no worse off than if you had skipped the chown exercise!)
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x172b580.0x1c1e258"></a>
Using the TrueCrypt Volume with Your Live CD</h2></div></div><p>
And now, the moment of truth. To use your encrypted TrueCrypt volume with an
Ubuntu live CD, such as the one we modified last month, simply boot a system
off that CD; insert the USB drive; execute the truecrypt binary from the
USB drive or from the CD, if you installed TrueCrypt on your custom image;
and mount your encrypted volume, specifying a mountpoint of
/home/ubuntu/Documents (Figure 4).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10076f4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Mounting Your Volume on /home/ubuntu/Documents
</p></div></div><p>
If TrueCrypt prompts you for an administrative password, leave it blank and
click OK. By default, the ubuntu account on Ubuntu CDs has no password. 
</p><p>
This brings me to the topic of next month's column: further securing and
customizing your encrypted-Documents-enabled live CD image. Until then, be
safe!
