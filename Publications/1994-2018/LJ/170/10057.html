What are shell script programmers to do when they finds themselves constantly
scaling image dimensions for their blogs? Write a script to automate the
process, of course!
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x194f580.0x1a474b8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
This might be a peculiarity of how I work with the Web, taking screenshots
and then wanting to scale them to fit my page (especially when they're
full-screen images), but I find that I spend a lot of time calculating how to
reduce and scale images down evenly.
</p><p>
For example, I might take a full-size screen capture of the window within
which I'm writing this particular column just to find that it's 722 x 719
pixels across and down, respectively. But if I were to include it on my
Weblog, I would want to reduce it down to no more than 600 pixels so that
it doesn't break my site layout.
</p><p>
I actually could reduce the image within the screen capture application or
use a secondary graphical app, but it turns out that Web browsers can scale
images up or down based on explicit &ldquo;height&rdquo; and
&ldquo;width&rdquo; attributes. For
example, let's say that the doc window is called edit.png. Then, I could
include the image on a Web page with:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;img src="edit.png" alt="editing a file" /&gt;

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x194f580.0x1a47828"></a></h2></div></div><p>
and it would work fine. To scale, it's easy, simply add those height and width
parameters. To make it match the image itself, I'd use:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;img src="edit.png" alt="editing" height="719" width="722" /&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
However, as I said, it turns out that you actually can calculate different
values, and the browser will scale it to match. To reduce the image 50%, for
example, I would tweak it to read:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;img src="edit.png" alt="editing" height="359" width="361" /&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
So that's what I do on my site, and frankly, it's a pain. 
</p><p>
Instead, what I'd really like is a utility that can figure out the current
height and width of an image and then automatically scale it to the new
value I desire based on a scaling factor. That's what we'll dig into for
this column.

Calculating Image Size</h2></div></div><p>
There are some terrific image manipulation packages available in Linux,
most notably ImageMagick, but we don't need anything that fancy because the
pedestrian, old, undersung file command can do the job for us. I'm 
going to be looking at only PNG (progressive network graphic) files, as those are
very much the best for most Web uses, but it's worth noting that many Linux
file commands have a harder time calculating image dimensions for JPEG
images.
</p><p>
Here's an example:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ file edit.png
edit.png: PNG image data, 722 x 719, 8-bit/color RGB, non-interlaced
</pre>
</p><p>
That's quite a bit of information actually, including the key
elements&mdash;the
dimensions of the image file itself. In this case, it's width x height, so
722 is the width, in pixels, and 719 is the height. These can be extracted
from the output in a variety of ways, but the easiest is to use cut:

<pre     class="programlisting">
width="$(file $filename | cut -f5 -d\  )"
height="$(file $filename | cut -f7 -d\  )"
</pre>
</p><p>
If you try this, however, you'll find that the height is wrong. It has a
trailing comma because cut is using spaces as the delimiter (which is
what the weird-looking <tt  >-d\  </tt> is specifying. The backslash escapes the
shell interpreting the space as an arg delimiter. When you type this in,
you'll want a space after the backslash and before the closing parenthesis for
just that reason. It's fixable though, by using sed: 

<pre     class="programlisting">
sed 's/,//'
</pre>
</p><p>
Now that we have numeric values, how do we scale
them automatically? I
like using the bc binary calculator, even though its interface is
so crufty. Multiplying 722 by 0.50 (which is, of course, 50%), is done
like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
echo 722 * 0.50 | bc
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x194f580.0x1a48010"></a></h2></div></div><p>
except that the \* will be expanded. So, in fact, some judicious use of
quotes addresses the problem neatly:

<pre     class="programlisting">
width="$(echo "$width * $multiplier" | bc)"
</pre>
</p><p>
That's certainly more shell-scripty, and it works fine, except I found
that with some implementations of bc, even adding
<tt  >scale=0</tt>, which 
theoretically should remove the trailing fractional element that results from the
multiplication, didn't give us an integer return value. Again, a simple fix
gives us the final script line:

<pre     class="programlisting">
width="$(echo "$width * $multiplier" | bc | cut -d. -f1)"
</pre>
</p><p>
The same thing gives us the newly calculated &ldquo;height&rdquo;, and if the user specifies
a multiplier that's less than one, it scales down. If you specify a greater
value, 
you just as easily can scale up. 
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x194f580.0x1a48328"></a>
Making It Work as a Script</h2></div></div><p>
Here's the basic script at this point:

<pre     class="programlisting">
filename="edit.png"
multiplier="0.75"

width="$(file $filename | cut -f5 -d\  )"
height="$(file $filename | cut -f7 -d\  | sed 's/,//')"

width="$(echo "$width * $multiplier" | bc | cut -d. -f1)"
height="$(echo "$height * $multiplier" | bc | cut -d. -f1)"

echo "$filename scaled: width=$width height=$height"
</pre>
</p><p>
Testing it with the filename specified produces the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sh scale-image.sh
edit.png scaled: width=541 height=539
</pre>
</p><p>
That's not really exactly what I want, however. First, I want to be
able to specify the filename and multiplier on the command line. 
Second, the output needs a slight tweak to be more useful&mdash;the values need
to be surrounded by quotation marks.
</p><p>
Here's what I'd like to see:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sh scale-image.sh 0.75 edit.png
edit.png: width="541" height="539"
$
</pre>
</p><p>
That's not too hard to accomplish given the basic script we already have.
See if you can do it yourself.
</p><p>
Tip: I actually use a &ldquo;for name; do; done&rdquo; loop to step through the file
scaling, so I can specify a group of images and calculate them all en
masse. Try it, coupled with the shift command, to remove the multiplier
value once it's saved into a named variable.
