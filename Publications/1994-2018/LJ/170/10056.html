Minirok (<a href="http://chistera.yi.org/~adeodato/code/minirok" target="_self">chistera.yi.org/~adeodato/code/minirok</a>)</h2></div></div><p>
This is a lovely little application that gives you very little
grief. Think halfway between Amarok and Kaboodle, and you'll get the
idea. For those of you who just want to play a few files at a time and
hate fancy music players with more features than you could ever want,
Minirok is for you. The player is minimalistic and dressed-down, but
it still allows for features, such as playlists, skinning, Last.fm support,
keybindings and DCOP support for KDE integration. According to Minirok's
Web site:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Minirok is a small music player for the K Desktop Environment. As
its name hints, it's modeled after Amarok, but with a reduced set of
features. In particular, it is designed to cover all the needs and wishes
of the author, leaving everything else out. The look and feel is almost
identical to Amarok's, though. The main interface is a tree view of
the filesystem, with a playlist that can be populated only via drag and
drop. There is no collection built from tags, so it's targeted at people
whose collections are already structured in a tree at the filesystem
level. Searches can be performed both in the tree view and the playlist.
</p></blockquote></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10056f1.large.jpg"><img src="10056f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. For those sick of do-it-all players, here's the wonderfully simple Minirok.
</p></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Installation</b></span>
</p><p>
If you head to the Minirok Web site, both tarballs and .debs are
available (the Debian packages are a little bit older than the source
tarballs). As far as dependencies go, aside from PyQt and PyKDE, the only
dependency that's relatively obscure is python-mutagen&mdash;a Python module
that handles audio metadata. Apt users should be able to
install the module via the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# apt-get install python-mutagen
</pre>
</p><p>
After this command, the .deb should install, and the tarball should build with no
trouble. To install the .deb package, open a terminal to the directory
the .deb sits in, and use the command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# dpkg -i minirok_0.7-1_all.deb
</pre>
</p><p>
To install via source, download and extract the tarball. Open a terminal
in the new directory, and enter the command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# ./setup.sh install
</pre>
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Usage</b></span>
</p><p>
Minirok should be in your menu under Multimedia. If not, simply run
the command <tt  >minirok</tt>. Once you're in, just click and drag a folder
or MP3 into the window pane on the right. As far as controls go, the
button on the bottom right that looks like a window clears the playlist,
so if you've made everything cluttered and want to start fresh, there's
your button. Otherwise, it's a simple case of skip forward or back a
track, stop, play/pause and a slider bar. On the left are two buttons:
the first, a downward-pointing arrow, is for repeat, and the second, a
right-pointing arrow, is for randomizing. And, that's about it&mdash;really
nice and minimal!
</p><p>
For the moment, things are fairly stable due to a minimal interface,
with only the occasional bug. I found that it didn't like some kinds of
MP3s, and sometimes it doesn't lead onto the next track on a playlist, but
those issues seemed to be fixed in the latest tarball. Overall, this project's
been my favourite this month. It fills a niche and doesn't give you all
that installation grief.

Perfect Match (<a href="http://pmatch.rubyforge.org" target="_self">pmatch.rubyforge.org</a>)</h2></div></div><p>
If you're looking for a good tool for finding duplicate files, this is
it. I've been researching these tools for a while, but I didn't trust any
to touch my filesystem, as many of my duplicate files are there on
purpose. Perfect Match (or pmatch for short) is non-destructive.
Using the default options simply prints out a list of what files are
duplicated and lets you decide for yourself which ones you'd like to remove.
</p><p>
As for goals and aspirations, according to author Tomasz Muras' Web site:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Some time ago, I was looking for a utility that would
find (and possibly remove) duplicate files. I have found a few of them but
none was complex enough for what I wanted...hence the idea of Perfect
Match! My main requirements were
quick compare&mdash;that is, first compare files based on size, then
hash&mdash;and to perform some logic when choosing which duplicate should be removed.
</p></blockquote></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Installation</b></span>
</p><p>
For the moment, there is no installer available for pmatch, so you'll have
to take a few steps here and there, but thankfully, not too many, as it's
a small project. The main dependency is Ruby, and a subproject called
RubyGems&mdash;a system for managing Ruby software libraries. Chances are
that RubyGems already is in your distribution's repository, so doing a
simple:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# apt-get install rubygems
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1de7580.0x1edff60"></a></h2></div></div><p>
will work for most people. If not, check out the RubyGems home page
(<a href="http://rubgems.org" target="_self">rubgems.org</a>). Once RubyGems is installed, you'll
need a gem
called log4r. Use the following command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# gem install log4r
</pre>
</p><p>
Once those two steps are out of the way, you're ready to download
pmatch. Head to the project's Web site, and save the tarball to your hard
drive. For some reason, none of my GUI archive tools liked the tarball,
so open a terminal to the directory it sits in, and enter the command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ tar -jxf pmatch_0.2.tar.bz2
</pre>
</p><p>
From here, pmatch is ready to use, but only locally via the command
<tt  >./pmatch</tt>. To install pmatch system-wide, enter the following two
commands:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# cp pmatch /usr/local/bin/
# chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/pmatch
</pre>
</p><p>
From here, any user should be able to use pmatch at any time.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Usage</b></span>
</p><p>
To use pmatch in its basic form, enter the command
<tt  >pmatch</tt> followed
by the directory you want to examine. As an example, after doing so, I received the
following shell output:


<pre     class="programlisting">
nhoj@ubuntu:~$ pmatch musostuff/storm-day/
rm musostuff/storm-day//verse2/raw-drums.wav
rm musostuff/storm-day//sessions/steve-17-06-06/verse-drum-track.wav
rm musostuff/storm-day//sessions/nhoj-session-26-2-06/session2.wav
rm musostuff/storm-day//sessions/nhoj-session-26-2-06/session1.wav
</pre>
</p><p>
Don't freak out when you see an rm followed by a
filename. These are
purely recommendations for the moment. If you actually want to perform
these changes, you can do so by piping the command through to bash,
like so:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ pmatch musostuff/storm-day/ | bash
</pre>
</p><p>
Now these commands actually will execute and remove said files. For
more advanced usage and information on how pmatch works, check the
Usage section of the Perfect Match home page.
</p><p>
Overall, this is a handy little project, which probably will make it
into many users' toolkits and hopefully into distro archives. Once
the project has fully matured, I wouldn't be surprised to see some GUI
front ends making their way to our desktops.

FpcBol (<a href="http://fpcbol.sourceforge.net" target="_self">fpcbol.sourceforge.net</a>)</h2></div></div><p>
I thought I'd finish this article with what has to be one of the
quirkiest and most colorful projects I've come across&mdash;FpcBol. A desktop
for children, FpcBol (or bol for short) is designed to be colorful
and easy to use, with icons only (no menus), along with parental
controls, and it's trim enough to work on older PCs. That all sounds cool,
and some of it we've seen before, but the desktop and interface are
the strangest I've come across and unlike anything I've used before&mdash;not necessarily a bad thing! Are you as intrigued as I was? Follow me....

</p></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Installation</b></span>
</p><p>
First things first, the installation side of things is unfinished and
in a state of flux. Florence Mathias (the project maintainer) and I
were actually working together in a way on this one. He was changing
the installation scripts daily while I gave him feedback. I thoroughly
recommend checking out the How-To section on the project's Web site
(itself simply a collection of colorful pictures and screenshots). With
bol being based on Free Pascal and SDL, there are a number of obscure
requirements and the How-To section has pictorial instructions of
steps to take on individual distributions.
</p><p>
When you're ready to download the source tarball, click on the FpcBol
picture on the Web site, which will take you to the SourceForge page's
file archive. Once downloaded, extract the tarball, and open a terminal in
the new directory. To any users of Debian-based systems, such as Ubuntu,
MEPIS and so on, I thoroughly recommend running the
<tt  >install_debian</tt>
script&mdash;it downloads all of the needed dependencies and will save you
a great deal of frustration:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# ./install_debian
</pre>
</p><p>
To start the installation, use the self-proclaimed ugly install script
as follows (as root or sudo):

<pre     class="programlisting">
# ./install
</pre>
</p><p>
The script will go through a series of dependency and configuration
checks. To start, it will see if you have something called
bol.icone and download the latest for you if you don't (you won't,
unless you've been through this process before). This is about 20MB, so
go make a cup of tea and come back again.
</p><p>
A tricky error that probably will come up is a message saying:

<pre     class="programlisting">

jedi-sdl not present
untar sdl.tar.gz (tar xvfz sdl.tar.gz) under
/usr/lib/fpc/&lt;version&gt;/units/&lt;cpu&gt;/sdl

</pre>
</p><p>
Look in the sources directory of bol, and you'll find a file
called sdl.tar.bz. As root, copy it to your needed directory
(/usr/lib/fpc/2.0.4/units/i386-linux in my case), change to that directory
and extract the archive. Rerun the install script, and you should make
it past this stage. If not, check that you have extracted sdl.tar.bz
to the right directory.
</p><p>
If you receive the error, &ldquo;Xmuu library not present !!!!!&rdquo;, check your
local file /etc/ld.so.conf to make sure it has the following lines:

<pre     class="programlisting">
/lib
/usr/lib
/usr/local/lib
/usr/X11/lib
</pre>
</p><p>
If these areas have all passed, a lovely little part of the program pops
up with a spinning cube to test whether certain parts of bol will
work in advance. Click on the small cube, and answer Y if it worked.
If not, you're probably missing some needed libraries. After this,
the script will ask you for the path to your mail reader and provide an
example path for you. Enter the path for your favored mail application,
and this should be the end of the script. Note that a script to install
local configuration files for individual users is also provided. If you
want to do this to make the first run cleaner, run the script by entering
the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# ./install_users
</pre>
</p><p>
Phew! That was a long one, but a cleaned-up installer is on the to-do
list for this project and may well be perfected by the time you read this. 
Some instructions are provided in the script, along with README files
on how to integrate bol into your login menu, but I'll let you read that
yourself.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Usage</b></span>
</p><p>
You can fire this up straightaway on top of another desktop, so let's
go through that for now, and you can take it from there. Open a
terminal, and enter:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ /usr/local/bol/lance_bol 
</pre>
</p><p>
A bunch of initialization info will pass through the terminal before
you're suddenly greeted by a crazy rotating cube in full-screen. I
think this may be some kind of loading screen (I don't know), but the
cube is cool. After a few seconds, your desktop will start changing,
with a new background and a translucent rectangle (the workbench)
at the top of your screen. The workbench is the part that drives bol,
so let's concentrate on that.
</p><p>
The lower icons are application buttons. Hover your
mouse over them, and they'll do a cool animation, and the name of the
application will appear at the top of the workbench. Left-clicking on it
will launch it. The heart icon represents favorites. Clicking it will
change the lower icons to a favorite applications list. If you want
to clear up your screen from clutter, the icon fifth from the right
will show only the desktop and minimize everything else. What's the
important button? Click the blue one with a question mark,
third from the right&mdash;it's the help button! Your screen will suddenly
be taken over by an assortment of writing and colors&mdash;it was so crazy
I had to take a screenshot.
</p><p>
When you've had enough, double-click the red button on the right, and a
confirmation screen will take over the workbench, telling you to
right-click to exit (you'll see what I mean). Upon exiting the desktop,
you'll be greeted by the cube again, but this time in reverse...groovy!
</p><p>
FpcBol is one of the craziest projects I've seen
in a while. Its lack of
menus may appeal to noncomputer-literate users. The graphical intensity
will appeal to children, with moving icons, gorgeous colors and changing
desktop backgrounds of interesting scenery. All in all, everything
is gorgeous-looking and very...French! Kids will love it. The end
result is definitely worth it, even if the installer is cumbersome at
times. At the time of this writing, FpcBol just hit 1.0 alpha, and it may hit
full release by the time this prints. Florence could do with a hand to
complete things, particularly with improving the English and 
the installation scripting, so if any coders out there are fond of the
project, why not help him out? There also isn't much documentation for
the GUI and some of the cooler aspects like Parental Control and its
log files, so I'd be keen to see how FpcBol turns out after gaining a
decent audience.
