Why go through complicated steps to remaster Knoppix, when there are a
number of methods to get the most of the functionality without the fuss?
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c31580.0x1d29300"></a></h2></div></div><p>
If you have used Knoppix for any extended period of time, chances are you
eventually thought about customizing it. You might have simply wanted to make
cosmetic changes with a new background and a different theme, or you might
have wanted to add programs, change what happens at startup, or make any number
of more-intensive changes. Well, you aren't alone. There are more than a hundred
different Knoppix-based live CDs in existence. Some have changed
only a
few tools, and others have performed a complete overhaul of the programs,
the themes and even the file structure.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c31580.0x1d294b8"></a>
Traditional Remastering</h2></div></div><p>
If you had decided to change Knoppix, you quickly would become acquainted
with some of the guides both on-line and in print about Knoppix remastering.
At that point, some of you would have read the complicated set of steps and
decided it just wasn't worth it. Knoppix fits all of its software
within a compressed loopback filesystem on the disc. To remaster Knoppix,
you must make a copy of the uncompressed contents of that filesystem, use
chroot to access the copy as though it were the root filesystem, make any
changes you want to make, and then re-create the new cloop filesystem
and ISO image with a few gigantic commands on the command line.
</p><p>
Of course, I oversimplified and excluded a few steps there. Besides some of
the more technical steps, I also left out that minor bug you undoubtedly
introduced but didn't notice until you booted. That means you get to go
through the remastering process (especially the time-consuming steps of
creating a new cloop filesystem) all over again. I also left out the step
where you notice that even though you made minor changes, your ISO
inexplicably is much larger than it was before and won't fit on a CD, so
back to the remastering process you go to free up more space.
</p><p>
The fact is, traditional Knoppix remastering is a time-consuming,
error-prone, complex process full of trial and error, but there is a better
way. There are a few different methods you can use to tweak the default
Knoppix disc without using the remastering process. I like to refer to
these methods as &ldquo;remastering Knoppix without remastering&rdquo;,
because the
default Knoppix cloop filesystem stays the same throughout the entire
process.
</p><p>
I first became interested in low-impact Knoppix tweaks when I had to create a
custom CD to include with my book, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Knoppix Hacks</em></span>. I
didn't want to do
much&mdash;just change the default background and add a few links to the
desktop. Although I could have remastered the CD, I was concerned about
introducing bugs, even with minor changes. Imagine if I had discovered a
bug after the CD was printed and shipped around the country with the book!
I figured if I could tweak Knoppix but leave the compressed image alone, I
would reduce the risk considerably. 
</p><p>
Ever since my first attempt to remaster Knoppix without remastering, I've
used these methods so much that I actually prefer them and find them
superior to remastering for most people's needs. Not only is the process
much quicker and less complex, it's also simpler to migrate your changes once
the next version of Knoppix is released.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c31580.0x1d29828"></a>
Save Configuration</h2></div></div><p>
The first method you can use to change Knoppix involves a classic Knoppix
tool called saveconfig. This tool creates and lets you choose a number of
different files and settings from your user's configuration files, all of
the files on the desktop, and network, graphics and other settings.
saveconfig then creates a tarball called configs.tbz out of the files and
stores it on a USB key, hard drive or other writeable media of your choice
along with a custom knoppix.sh script. 
</p><p>
To run saveconfig, click K&rarr;Knoppix&rarr;Configure&rarr;Save Knoppix Configuration
or type <tt  >saveconfig</tt> in a terminal. Then, you can choose which settings to
save and to which hard drive to save them. The next time you boot your
computer, type <tt  >myconfig=/dev/sda1/</tt> to point Knoppix to a particular saved
config, or type <tt  >myconfig=scan</tt>, and Knoppix will scan all available
drives for you. At the end of the boot process, Knoppix will run the
knoppix.sh script on the drive, which will extract the tarball and restore
your settings.
</p><p>
For minor, mostly cosmetic changes, the standard saveconfig script might
serve all your needs. Simply make your changes, and then tell saveconfig to
back up your personal configuration. This is useful, but you might want to
back up only a few files, or you might want to add files that saveconfig
doesn't save by default. To do that, you can tweak either the configs.tbz or
knoppix.sh file. First, run saveconfig to create a configs.tbz and
knoppix.sh file. Then, uncompress the configs.tbz file:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ bunzip2 configs.tbz
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, use tar to add new files to the tarball:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ tar -rpPf configs.tar /path/to/file
</pre>
</p><p>
You also can use tar to delete files:

<pre     class="programlisting">
tar --delete -pPf configs.tar /path/to/file
</pre>
</p><p>
Once you are finished with your changes, you can recompress the
tarball:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ BZIP2=-9 bzip2 configs.tar
$ mv configs.tar.bz2 configs.tbz
</pre>
</p><p>
Another way to tweak saveconfig (or even bypass it altogether) is to
realize that when you tell Knoppix to use a particular saved configuration,
all it really does is execute the knoppix.sh file, which is a standard
shell script. That shell script contains the tar commands to extract the
file. This means anything you put in the knoppix.sh file will be executed
at the end of the boot process. What's more, if you create a new Knoppix
disc and place the knoppix.sh in the KNOPPIX/ directory on the disc, it
will be executed <span   class="emphasis"><em>automatically</em></span> every time Knoppix boots.
So, if there's an extra program you'd like Knoppix to have, just track down
the .deb file for it and any of its dependencies, and add them to the disc.
Then, in the knoppix.sh script you can put:

<pre     class="programlisting">
dpkg -i /cdrom/*.deb
</pre>
</p><p>
Knoppix will install all of those programs at the end of the boot
process. If you want to run any other commands or start any services, you
also could put them in this script.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c31580.0x1d29eb0"></a>
Example: Webcam</h2></div></div><p>
Here's an example of a tweaked knoppix.sh file that I made to turn Knoppix
into an instant Webcam server. I first created a webcam directory on the
CD-ROM and put a basic HTML file there that pointed to an image at
/var/www/webcam.jpg. Then, I created a knoppix.sh script and put it in the
KNOPPIX/ directory on the CD. Here is the script:


<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/sh

echo Configuring Apache
cp /cdrom/webcam/index.html /var/www/index.html
/etc/init.d/apache start
echo Configuring Cron
echo '* * * * *  root gqcam -d /var/www/webcam.jpg &gt; /dev/null' &gt;&gt;
/etc/crontab
/etc/init.d/cron start
</pre>
</p><p>
As you can see, there isn't much to this script. I copy the HTML file to
the default Apache document root, start Apache, and then add a job to the
global crontab and start cron. The cron command will run gqcam every
minute, which will capture an image and store it in /var/www/webcam.jpg.
Now, I can just burn the CD and boot it on any machine with a Webcam and
Knoppix will take care of the rest.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c31580.0x1d2a0c0"></a>
Persistent Disk Image</h2></div></div><p>
In addition to the saveconfig script, Knoppix provides an even more
advanced script that creates a persistent disk. The main problem with a
live CD is that all of your changes are erased whenever you reboot.
Traditionally, the persistence script created a loopback filesystem on a
USB key or hard drive of a specified size and then copied your entire home
directory to it. On the next boot, if you selected it with a cheat code,
Knoppix would then mount the filesystem and point your entire home
directory to it. That meant any changes you made to your home
directory were kept through all of your reboots.
</p><p>
The main limitation to that script (as with legacy Knoppix discs) was
that you could write only to certain directories. Beginning with Knoppix
3.8, Knoppix added UnionFS (now replaced with AuFS). This tool essentially
allows you to merge filesystems on top of each other, even if one is
read-only and the other is read-write. If you wrote to the filesystem,
UnionFS/AuFS transparently took care of putting the writes on the correct
filesystem. With Knoppix, this now meant the ramdisk that was
traditionally used for /home and /etc could now be merged on top of the
entire filesystem. You now could essentially write anywhere you wanted,
install programs using the standard Debian package management, and
basically treat the system like any other installed Linux distribution,
limited only by your ramdisk size.
</p><p>
With the addition of AuFS, Knoppix changed its persistence script. Now when
you click K&rarr;Knoppix&rarr;Configuration&rarr;Create a persistent Knoppix disk
image, Knoppix creates a complete copy of the entire ramdisk. This is a
copy of all of the changes you have made to the system since you have
booted. Within the script, you can choose the maximum size of the filesystem, where to store the image, and even whether to use
encryption. The next time you boot, if the USB or local hard drive is
present, Knoppix automatically detects it and prompts you with a few
options:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Home: use only your persistent home directory.
</p></li><li><p>
System: replace the entire /ramdisk mountpoint with the persistent
disk image.
</p></li><li><p>
Overwrite: off by default, but it will replace the /etc directory on
your persistent image if you also enable the System option. You might
want to do this if your system-wide graphics or network settings from a
previous machine interfere with your current one.
</p></li><li><p>
Init: start any persistent init scripts.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
If you don't select any of these options, Knoppix will boot normally. It's
also possible that you might have multiple knoppix.img files on different
drives (or multiple files on the same drive in different directories).
This
actually is a good way to create custom Knoppix settings that are stored in
different directories on a USB key. Say I have a security-focused
persistent image in the security directory on my USB key (which Knoppix
detects as /dev/sda1), I could then boot Knoppix with the
home=/dev/sda1/security/knoppix.img cheat code.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c31580.0x1d2a698"></a>
Tweak Boot Settings</h2></div></div><p>
The saveconfig and knoppix.sh tweaks provide a lot of
functionality, but their main downside is that they execute at the end of
the boot process. Sometimes you want to change Knoppix settings sooner than
that&mdash;whether it's the default screen you see at boot time or Knoppix's
default cheat codes. These options and more are stored in the
boot/isolinux/ directory on the disc and can be changed without much
effort. Below I cover some of the more important files and what you
can change with them.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Boot messages:</b></span>
the boot.msg, f2 and f3 files are text files that define what shows up at
the boot prompt, when you press F2 and F3, respectively. If you
want to add special help or even change the text completely, you can do so
in these files.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>isolinux.cfg:</b></span> this is one of the most
useful files in this directory, as it
defines all the different kernels that can be loaded, along with their
default boot options. For instance, here is the section of the file that
defines the default Knoppix settings and cheat codes if you let the boot
prompt time out or just press Enter:


<pre     class="programlisting">
LABEL knoppix
KERNEL linux
APPEND ramdisk_size=100000 init=/etc/init lang=us apm=power-off vga=791
initrd=m
inirt.gz nomce loglevel=0 quiet BOOT_IMAGE=knoppix
</pre>
</p><p>
For instance, you can see here that the default language is English, but if
you wanted to change it to Spanish, you would change
<tt  >lang=us</tt> to <tt  >lang=es</tt>.
If you scroll down farther in the file, you can not only see other Knoppix
types you can boot, but also listings for memtest and dos.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c31580.0x1d2aab8"></a>
Tweak initrd</h2></div></div><p>
Along with the other boot files, under boot/isolinux/ is the default Knoppix
initrd file called minirt.gz. This file is the initial root image that
Knoppix mounts. Within the image are essential files for the boot process,
including the init executable, but the file of most interest to Knoppix
hackers is the linuxrc file, which acts as Knoppix's general startup
script. First, make a copy of the minirt.gz file (in my example, I assume it
was mounted under /cdrom), uncompress it and then mount the filesystem:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# cp /cdrom/boot/isolinux/minirt.gz .
# gunzip minirt.gz
# mkdir temp
# mount -t ext2 -o loop minirt ./temp
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, if you look in the top-level directory of that mounted filesystem, you
will see the linuxrc file. A lot of the script defines default settings,
such as which filesystems are built in to Knoppix and the process Knoppix
uses to mount them, but you also can see where Knoppix defines system-wide
defaults and also allows you to override them. For instance, the following
lines define the default Knoppix directory and cloop file and the ability
to overwrite them via a cheat code:


<pre     class="programlisting">
KNOPPIX_DIR="KNOPPIX"
KNOPPIX_NAME="KNOPPIX"
case "$CMDLINE" in *knoppix_dir=*) KNOPPIX_DIR="$knoppix_dir"; ;; esac
case "$CMDLINE" in *knoppix_name=*) KNOPPIX_NAME="$knoppix_name"; ;; esac
</pre>
</p><p>
If you want to add some extra functions to the boot process, read
through the script to identify where would be best. For instance, at some
points of the script, the KNOPPIX cloop filesystem isn't loaded yet, nor
are many common modules. If you aren't sure where to add your changes, just
add them to the end of the script before the comment <tt  >#Give control to the
init process</tt>. At that point, Knoppix should have major modules and filesystems loaded and mounted.
</p><p>
Once you are finished with your tweaks, unmount the minirt filesystem and
recompress it. Then, you can overwrite the default version with your custom
edition:

<pre     class="programlisting">
umount temp
gzip -9 minirt
</pre>
</p><p>
These are only a few examples of how to remaster Knoppix without
remastering. One of the great things about these methods is that they are
typically easy to try, so if you make a mistake, you can fix it quickly.
Plus, most of these methods lend themselves well to migration from one
Knoppix disc to the next for when the next version of Knoppix is released.
Finally, because most of your custom tweaks can be self-contained, if you
want to share them with friends, you simply can share your knoppix.sh and
configs.tbz files, for instance, instead of an entire ISO image.
