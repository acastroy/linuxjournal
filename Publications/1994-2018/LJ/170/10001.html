A whirlwind tour through the powerful and diverse world of Firefox
extensions.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21ee580.0x22e6408"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Plugins and extensions&mdash;they're what made Photoshop such a bonanza from the
late 1980s onward, and they gave it the market push to triumph over competitors
who preferred to keep their tools and development completely in-house. It
was a great idea&mdash;make your own product more valuable by letting other
people enhance it for their own benefit&mdash;and it worked famously. In the
graphics world, everyone's got 'em now. But, in the browsing world...well,
it takes an open-source project to apply that kind of functionality across
categories.
</p><p>
Firefox did it, and it's one of the innovations that has helped Mozilla
claw its way up from the bottom of the stack in the browser wars. Even
though Internet Explorer still comes bundled with Windows, and Safari with Mac OS, and
Konqueror with KDE, users across platforms opt for Firefox with greater and
greater frequency. It's not just the tabbed browsing, or the built-in
pop-up blockers, or the standards-compliance or the built-in search box&mdash;it's also the add-ons.
</p><p>
The Mozilla Project's plugin-based architecture turns a solid application
into a customizer's paradise. The projects available on the Mozilla Add-ons
site now stretch into the thousands, which gives the end user the opposite
problem of the no-choice straitjacket of certain other browsers. The
embarrassment of riches means too much choice, and figuring out how to
narrow it down is no mean task.
</p><p>
The extensions come in a variety of flavors&mdash;from add-on applications to
interface tweaks to toolbars. Here are a few that most users will find
very handy. They extend functionality, enhance privacy and give users a
leg up on taking their favorite content with them wherever they wish to go.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21ee580.0x22e6720"></a>
Irritation Reduction and Butt-Covering</h2></div></div><p>
Web pages are great things. The democratization of media that the Internet
brings us means that everyone has a Web site, and it's a great thing.
There's only one problem with everyone having a Web site: everyone has a
Web site&mdash;even people who think it's cute to have their own personal radio
station running any time you log on to one of their pages.
</p><p>
I may be a curmudgeon, but as much as I care about the teeming masses of
humanity on-line, that affection does not extend to being willing to
tolerate someone else's attempt to soundtrack my corner of the
universe.
It's been the case for several years now that if you wanted to surf around
on MySpace or thumb through your Aunt Estelle's family photo albums on her
personal site, you had two choices: endure the autoplay music, or turn your
speakers off.
</p><p>
Not anymore&mdash;not if you surf with Firefox. Sun Chun-Yen's Stop Autoplay
extension automagically toggles off <span   class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span> autoplaying
media, and it allows you
to blacklist Flash media providers if they get on your nerves. With Stop
Autoplay installed, instead of embedded media assaulting you before the
page finishes rendering, you are presented with a little red box with a
Play button inside it. If you are inclined to listen to the embedded
media, you have the option at your fingertips. If you're not, it won't
bother you. It's a beautiful little plugin. It's simple, elegant and
&ldquo;just
works&rdquo;. It also can help save you from vicious attacks by coworkers who
don't like the autoplayed music either.
</p><p>
Protecting you from your boss (who actually expects you to be working when
you're on the clock) is the noble quest undertaken by another add-on, Panic.
Panic sets up a hotkey that, when pressed, will close all open tabs and
open a tab containing the URL of a page you're actually supposed to be
looking at. Note that it closes the tabs, it doesn't hide them. Once you
press your user-definable hotkey, they're gone. Sure, trudging through the
browser history to re-find that amazing article on &ldquo;Linux Home Automation:
the Ultimate Internet-Controlled Gun Cabinet&rdquo; can be a drag, but when it
saves you an unpleasant conversation with your boss, it's worth the price.
</p><p>
On a related note, there is an extension that protects you from
inconvenient questions from young children, nosy roommates and casual
snoopers at neighborhood coffee shops. If you've ever heard the words
&ldquo;Mommy, what does 'stud' mean?&rdquo; or &ldquo;Daddy, what's
burka porn?&rdquo; from a five-year-old who has apparently appeared at your elbow from a neighboring
dimension, you know what I mean. The Net sucks you in, and sometimes
someone walks up behind you and starts reading over your shoulder&mdash;or
worse, reading the names of the other tabs you're saving for later&mdash;and
you don't notice them for a few hours...um, minutes.
</p><p>
Enter TabRenamizer, an extension that lets you protect your privacy by
renaming the tabs in your open browser windows. It integrates seamlessly
with Firefox, sitting as a menu option in the Tools window that lets you
set it either to rename all future tabs or to rename all open tabs
randomly. You also can rename an individual tab selectively by
right-clicking on the tab title and selecting the now-present rename this tab
option from the context menu. This gives you a renaming dialog so that you
can give the tab any name you want.

Taking My Media Everywhere</h2></div></div><p>
If there's anything out there that could push me to buy a video-capable
portable media player, it's the Authors@Google series on YouTube (and
similar lecture series available on Google Video from various think tanks
and science conferences). Science, public policy, arts discussion&mdash;the
Net has everything a growing brain needs. Unfortunately, a lot of it isn't
in easily downloadable podcast form, but it's sequestered in various video
formats behind the YouTube Flash curtain or hiding in other embedded
players. Bringing it down to the hard drive, even just in audio form, used
to be a pain and a half, often requiring some fancy stream ripping
involving speaker wires and mencoder scripts. Not any longer. Now, there
are a bunch of extensions and Greasemonkey scripts for Firefox that let you
rip your beloved content from the cold, uncaring fingers of the Internet
and then load it on your portable media player to take with you to family
reunions. Two of
them are worth special note.
</p><p>
The first is Fast Video Download, which, as its name suggests, will let
you download pretty much any embedded video with the click of a mouse. When
you call up a video on YouTube or Google Video or just about anywhere else,
and it's one you want to take with you for viewing on the commuter train or
for listening to at the gym, simply click on the handy-dandy video downloader
icon that appears at the bottom right-hand corner of the Firefox screen,
and away you go. It pulls the video from the Web server, in whatever format
it's natively stored, and drops it on your hard drive, from where you can
load it onto your portable media player at your leisure. Fast Video Download's philosophy is
no-nonsense and unobtrusive, and it either works on a given site or it
doesn't&mdash;your mileage may vary.
</p><p>
The second is an extension called Download Helper, and it has a different
approach. It maintains a compatibility list and a directory of video sites
from which it can download and file types it keeps an eye out for.
Accessing its submenu through the Tools menu on Firefox allows you to
customize it, to allow or block adult and/or pornographic content, and it
also has
special entries to help you find instructional and tutorial videos. It's a
more comprehensive tool than Fast Video Download, but it's also less
elegantly integrated into Firefox. Although Fast Video Download is the tool
you want on hand when you stumble across something you're going to want to
listen to again later, Download Helper is a tool better suited for
dedicated video hunts (say, if you're doing research or you're going to be
on a long plane ride and want your portable media player loaded up with things you haven't
seen before).

Full-on MozApps</h2></div></div><p>
Not all Firefox extensions are little plugins or interface tweaks. Some of
them are full-on, serious applications that just happen to run in a Firefox
tab. There are quite a few of these, including a number of very
good security auditing tools. However, today I'm focusing on must-haves
for everyday users, so in this section, we're going to look at three tools
that make the life of a normal Web 2.0 Netizen less hassle-prone.
</p><p>
If you're hip deep in new media, you've probably got a blog. And a Flickr
account. And a YouTube channel. And a Box.net file repository. And a
Facebook account. And a...well, you get the idea. There are a lot of
passwords to remember, and a lot of files to upload, and a lot of really
crappy, limiting interfaces through which you have to do that uploading.
</p><p>
File Uploader changes all that. It's essentially a specialized FTP client
that's compatible with a number of on-line file services and social-networking sites. After installing the extension and restarting Firefox,
you are presented on the Tools menu with a File Uploader entry. Click on
it,
and a new tab loads with the application. Using the accounts management and
services menus, you can sign up for new accounts with any of the supported
services (including, but not limited to, the aforementioned YouTube,
Box.net, Flickr and Facebook), or use accounts you already have and manage
your files and photo albums remotely. Reordering, batch uploading, deleting
and renaming are all supported, and, unlike the HTML interfaces offered by
the services, you are not subject to the files-per-upload limits that the
Web interfaces impose. If you are, like me, a working photographer (or
merely an avid hobbiest), and you're dependent on Flickr to showcase your
work, this tool will save you a lot of time. If, on the other hand, you're
a social-networking junkie, File Uploader will let you share
more/better/faster with more people.
</p><p>
Although File Uploader is patterned after a classic dual-paned FTP client, it
is not actually an FTP client. Instead, it emulates an FTP client over HTTP
for particular services. For a true-blue FTP client that runs in a Firefox
tab, you'll need FireFTP.
</p><p>
FireFTP is one of the oldest and most mature Firefox extensions around. It
supports all the essential features you need in an FTP client&mdash;proxy
support, multiple account support, integrity checks, encryption, hash and
time synchronization. It operates on a classic three-pane view: local
filesystem on the left, remote filesystem on the right and console data
scrolling in a wide pane across the bottom. It also will keep local and
remote directories synchronized, and it can do deep-tree comparison, so you can
see what might be present on one filesystem that's absent from another.
It's fast, it's light, and it works very, very well. Some standalone
clients, like GFTP, have a few more bells and whistles, but they're the kind
of features you use so rarely that you'll seldom need to call it up if
you've got FireFTP handy. FireFTP is also cross-platform, unlike some of
the other best open-source FTP clients, which are Linux or *nix only.
</p><p>
The other entry in the oldie-but-goodie pile is ChatZilla, a venerable
in-tab IRC client with all the trimmings. Although it doesn't have the $@%!ing
provocative veneer that bitchX does, it handsomely organizes chat channels,
logs, has an extensive built-in list of available channels, supports DCC
chats and file transfers, and has its own plugin and theming architecture.
After install, just like FireFTP and File Uploader, you'll find it easily
launched with a click from the Tools menu. In a sense, it's nothing really
new&mdash;IRC is old tech&mdash;but it does implement all the standards very well,
and for those who prefer to keep desktop clutter to a minimum but still
enjoy fighting with random strangers on IRC, ChatZilla is a must-have.
</p><p>
The last of our full-on apps that just happen to run in a tab is NewsFox,
an RSS newsreader for Firefox. It's a three-pane Atom/RSS feed reader laid
out very similarly to an e-mail reader: feeds on the left, news items on
the top right and story content on the bottom right. It handily
auto-imports any Live Bookmarks you've got set up as soon as you launch it,
so you don't have to worry about re-adding feeds to which you've already
subscribed. Again, like FireFTP and ChatZilla, it's a solid, no-frills app that
&ldquo;just works&rdquo; and does what it's supposed to do. And, also like ChatZilla and
FireFTP, it doesn't cause a performance drag, which is a welcome change
from the bad-old days when Firefox was new and full of memory leaks all the
time.

Freedom and Anonymity</h2></div></div><p>
As you can see from the above, Firefox extensions give people a lot of
power over their browsing experience&mdash;indeed, a lot more than most anyone
is used to having. But aside from the obvious minor advantages of time
saved, extra utility and fun, it also can be a major force for good in the
world. This is certainly the case with Free Access Plus, a filter-buster
put out by an innovative developer going by the name of MohammedR. It's a
notion that I can only hope someone in Hong Kong picks up on. Imagine
Radio Free Europe in your browser and you get the idea. Free Access Plus
circumvents state censorship of the Internet&mdash;particularly, it circumvents
the Iranian government's content filters that block YouTube, del.icio.us,
Flickr, Technocrati, FriendSter, LiveJournal, MySpace and a number of others.
It also purports to circumvent similar filters imposed by other
governments. It's not a perfect solution, and it doesn't work all the time,
but it is successful some of the time, and it's exactly the kind of thing
open source is best at&mdash;opening the world to all people, even when their
governments think they know better.
