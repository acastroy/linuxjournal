A Flash-drive, mini-portable media player that plays nice with Linux.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15e3580.0x16db2f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
I was on the prowl for a new portable media player. I wasn't happy with
just a music player though. I wanted something that would play videos, FM radio,
show pictures, display text, record my voice, record old LPs via
a line-in jack, record FM radio <span   class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span> play music&mdash;not just MP3s, but
Ogg, FLAC and (yuck) my few WMAs. Finally, it would be great if it
sounded better than, and had double the battery life per charge of, an iPod
Nano. And, I found it, the COWON iAudio 7. This Swiss-Army knife of multimedia
players comes in 4GB, 8GB and 16GB varieties of Flash drives that cost $150,
$200 and $300 retail, respectively, but you easily can find one for less at most on-line
retailers that sell this player. Best of all, this player is very Linux-friendly. 
</p><p>
Its default setting is for use as a UMS device out of the box.
That means you can move your media in and out of this player easily by
dragging and dropping to and (unlike many other players) from this
device. You don't need to install any software to do this, just turn it on,
plug it in to any of your computer's USB ports, and within seconds, it mounts
as an external drive. You will see an icon pop up on your desktop when it
mounts. Open it, and navigate to whatever folder you wish to move files to
and from, and when you're done, simply right-click and unmount it.

Videos do require re-encoding prior to loading them for playback on the
iAudio 7, and there is an open-source Linux solution for this purpose. This is
necessary, due to the small size of the iAudio 7. Smaller than a credit card,
it's about the same size as a large pack of gum. The screen measures 1.3", 160 x 128 dot and is a 260,000 color TFT LCD. Small as this screen
is, it has good detail and color saturation. This makes it relatively
enjoyable to view a TV show or even a movie. An hour of video after
re-encoding is about 178MB, so it's possible to carry quite a few TV shows
or movies in this player and still have room for your music library too. If
you think you'll be carrying a lot of videos, you might want to opt for the
16GB version. Videos need to be encoded in xvid-.avi at 256&ndash;384kbps, at no more than 15fps. 
I provide a step-by-step rundown on how to re-encode later in
this article.
</p><p>
The iAudio 7's best feature is its sound
quality. It puts most other
players to shame. The earbuds COWON packs with this player are of average
quality. To really appreciate the sound quality this player puts out, you
need to buy better earphones, like the Shure e2cs I own or any other
$100+ brand of your choice. Another way to hear this player's
outstanding audio quality is to plug it in to your car's radio, if it's
equipped with an MP3 player (line-in) jack, like many newer models now
have. 
</p><p>
Its equalizer is called Jet Audio, which is a software branch of
COWON. This little player has the most elaborate choices for equalization I
ever have seen on any player. If you can't find a setting you like
listening to, you might want to consider buying a hearing aid
instead&mdash;it's
that good. 
</p><p>
Controlling the iAudio 7 is done with a touch interface to the right of
the screen. It's called a swing-bar, and it's fairly easy to learn how to
use, but it can be a bit difficult getting used to the touch sensitivity.
You can make it better by going to Settings&rarr;General and changing the
touch sensitivity to low. Fortunately, it does have a lock switch, so when
it's locked, you can run it in your pocket without fearing it will switch to
something you don't want to hear. To use the swing-bar, simply stroke the bar
up or down, or hold your finger down at one end or the other to scroll
through the menu. Tapping either end of the bar tells it to skip to the
next file. The play arrow opens any file or function, whether it's music,
video, radio station and so on. You can shuttle forward or reverse with videos
or music, using the swing bar. This is useful if you recorded a TV show
off-air with commercials or if you just want to shuttle over a segment of
video. If the shuttle speed is too slow for your liking, you can make it
faster by going to Settings&rarr;General and increasing the scan speed. 
</p><p>
There
also are three control buttons on the top of the player. The left button is
power on/off/hold. The center button is the master menu control, which
switches
between all folders and playlists. The right buttons are for volume up and
down. On the left side are the earphone and line-in jacks, and on the right
side is the USB port, with a sturdy rubber flap covering it.
</p><p>
Speaking of playlists, you may be thinking that because you would be using it
in UMS mode, you wouldn't be able to save custom mixes of your
favorite songs. You would be wrong. The iAudio 7 has a feature called DPL,
for Dynamic Playlist. To use this feature, simply hold the play button
while playing a song until you see a small box that has a choice of DPL,
Bookmark or Lyrics. Choose DPL, and it saves that song to the DPL folder.
You can arrange the songs in that folder in any order you like, up to 200
songs. Just remember, the last song added always ends up at the bottom of
the list. 
</p><p>
You also can create subfolders on your computer for DPL, if you
want to have special mixes of songs. Simply load the mix folder to the Music
folder on the player. Then, on the player's main menu, click on Music,
navigate to that folder, hold down the play button, and choose DPL on the
drop-down menu. To get to the DPL folder, simply navigate to the Music
folder on the main menu (using the top-center button), scroll down and click
on Dynamic Playlist. 
</p><p>
I'm sure you're curious about those other choices that
appear in the menu box. Bookmark simply bookmarks your song or video
where you paused it, if you want to navigate away to another song or
folder. Lyrics displays the lyrics to the song you are playing. (This works only
for songs that have this feature.)
</p><p>
The line-in, voice and FM recording features also are a nice touch, and they
do make quality recordings. I did find it odd that with
the support for Ogg, FLAC and Xvid open-source files for playback on this
player, it records only line-in, voice and FM radio in unprotected WMA
with a limit of 128kbps. In spite of this, the recordings sound
surprisingly good, thanks to the Jet Audio equalizer. Voice recordings are
done through a built-in mic, which sounds fine on the higher bit-rate
settings. Line-in recording is one of those functions I feel all media
players should offer. Maybe it's because it appeals to those like
myself, who are old enough to have a large collection of music on vinyl
LPs. In any case, you can digitize all your old vinyl records by
recording directly into the iAudio 7 from your analog stereo amp. Simply
connect your amp using standard RCA A/V plugs connected to an
RCA-to-mini-plug conversion jack, and connect the mini-plug end to the
line-in jack on the iAudio 7. If you want to burn a CD of the music you
digitized, simply drag the songs out of the player and on to your computer
for burning. 
</p><p>
The FM radio has good signal pick up and can be used in
several ways. You can scan for stations manually if you want, but it's
easier to auto-scan all the stations it can pick up in your area and then
assign presets for the stations you like. As for recording FM
radio, you can do it on the fly, or you can use the timer settings in the
Settings menu and preset a time to record a station&mdash;like a TiVo for radio.
This same timer also can be used to lull you to sleep with your stored
music or to wake you up with the FM radio&mdash;like a clock radio.
</p><p>
The picture and text display functions are pretty straightforward. Both
can be displayed separately as your music plays. To load text or pictures,
simply drag and drop into the appropriate folder, just like all other content
stored on the player. Pictures are resized automatically as they load.
They also can be used as wallpaper for your screen, or you can hold down the
play button while the picture is displayed to add it to a slideshow of your own
creation.

I know video encoding is a bit of a pain for some of you, but the pay-off is in the
quality of the video on a player this small and portable. 
You may want to watch video on a player this small on a
camping trip or commuting on a crowded train or plane. For me, it beats
lugging around a laptop just to watch a video. I get most of my videos by
recording off a cable box at home using Freevo or by downloading a video
podcast using Rhythmbox (yes, Rhythmbox can catch video podcasts, it just
can't play them). 
</p><p>
Encoding is a two-step process that begins by using
Avidemux. Avidemux is great for converting most videos codecs, and it works
very well for what we're doing here too. The second step involves taking
the finished video conversion to Xvid AVI using Avidemux and reprocessing
it, using a tool called i7remux 0.1. This is necessary, because the iAudio
7 will play only videos made with I frames; b frames are removed by
Avidemux. i7remux is a free, open-source converter made just for the iAudio 7
(see Resources for the download link).
</p><p>
Compiling and installation after extracting from a zip file are easy.
Simply open a terminal, and type <tt  >./configure</tt>,
<tt  >make</tt>, then <tt  >sudo make install</tt>.
i7remux rearranges the internal structure of a given AVI file and rebuilds
the indices. Once i7remux does this, and it does it much faster than the
first encoding using Avidemux, the video is ready to be loaded into the
player. It doesn't take as much time as it may seem, a one-hour show takes
about 30 minutes to encode using these two processes.
</p><p>
First, in Avidemux, open the video file you want to encode. If it's a TV
show recorded with a capture card, it will be an MPEG-2 file. Avidemux runs
an indexing for the video before it's loaded for the next step. Many video
podcasts, however, are m4v files and h264 codec. Avidemux will pop up a
dialog box that says it has detected h264 and will use another mode to bypass
B frame referencing. You don't need to use this alternate mode that loses
frame accuracy, because you will be getting rid of the B frames later
anyway, so choose Cancel to keep the frame accuracy.
</p><p>
Next, choose Xvid4 for conversion, select the Configure box, and on the
Main tab, choose single pass bit rate, and change the default bit rate
to 384 (Figure 2).

Figure 2. Setting the Bit Rate
</p></div></div><p>
Next, choose the Motion &amp; Misc tab, and uncheck all the boxes. Change the I
frame interval to min 2, max 66 (the maximum interleaving time), and reduce
the default amount of B frames to 0 (Figure 3).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9919f2.large.jpg"><img src="9919f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Motion &amp; Misc Settings
</p></div></div><p>
Then, under the Quantization tab, reduce the B frame quantizer to 1 for
both min and max (the lowest setting). Then, click OK, and go
to the Filters box (Figure 4).

Figure 4. Quantization Settings
</p></div></div><p>
Choose MPlayer Resize, and program 4:3 for source and destination, and
program width 160, height 120, and click OK. Do not click Apply. For
some reason, Apply doesn't seem to function; I think it's a bug in
Avidemux. Also, if you have a video recorded in 16:9 ratio, simply change the
source setting to 16:9, and program a width of 160 and a height of 90. That
way, the images will not be distorted (Figure 5).

</p></div></div><p>
Next, choose Resample FPS, enter 15.000000, and choose no linear blend
(Figure 6).

Figure 6. Resample FPS
</p></div></div><p>
For audio, choose Lame for MP3 encoding, and click Configure. The
default settings should be 128kbps CBR 2 channel stereo, and if they are,
don't change them. Then, under Filters, choose Resample, and set it to
44100Hz. Finally, save your project to whatever folder you want, and
be sure to give it a name ending with .avi. Click OK, and Avidemux now
will convert your video to xvid4. When it's done, close Avidemux, and move on to
the next step.

Figure 7. Avidemux Encoding
</p></div></div><p>
Now, you're ready to use i7remux to finish encoding your video. This is a
command-line program, so open a terminal and simply type
<tt  >i7remux</tt> (no
need for sudo), then copy and paste the name of your video from the video
created by Avidemux. Next, copy and paste again, only this time change the
filename of the video by adding a random letter or number to it, then press
Enter. If you don't add a letter or number, it won't let you encode.
i7remux then creates the video you will load to the player when
it's done; this should take about 10&ndash;20 seconds. i7remux sends it to
the same folder to which Avidemux sent your video.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9919f8.large.jpg"><img src="9919f8.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 8. File Copying
</p></div></div><p>
Next, plug in the player to any USB port, and click and drag the video you
created with i7remux to the Movie folder in the player. When you navigate
to Videos in the player's main menu, you should see your video. Simply
highlight it, and touch the play button. You might hear only audio for a few
seconds before the video shows up in the screen. If this bothers you, 
pause the video and start it again.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15e3580.0x1ad50c0"></a>Firmware Updates</h2></div></div><p>
Firmware updates for the iAudio7 are available from the support link at
<a href="http://cowonamerica.com" target="_self">cowonamerica.com</a>. To install one, download it to your desktop and
extract it. Plug in the player to a USB port, and drag the firmware to the
Root folder of the player. Then, unmount the player, and it will power off.
Turn it back on, and it begins to install the firmware update. When it's
done, after about 20 seconds, it turns itself off. When you power it
back up, you should see the new firmware installed, indicated by the new
version number on the boot splash. Firmware updates are a good idea, as the
player always is being tweaked by COWON with improvements. However, a
firmware update deletes all content on the player prior to the
update. So, be sure to have a backup of your content on your computer or an
external drive before updating. If you don't think the update is
worth the hassle, just don't do it, the player still will run fine. 
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15e3580.0x1ad5220"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
This, obviously, isn't the only multimedia player that functions with Linux.
In fact, COWON's D2 player is a good choice if you want a larger 2.5"
screen, but it's also a larger player, so there's a size trade-off. Another
player worth considering is the iriver clix, which now can be used as a UMS
device, unlike last year's model, so it too can function on Linux. The
reason I chose to buy the iAudio 7 is that it had the most bang
for the buck, and it slips into my pocket very easily. I have the 8GB
version, but the 4GB and 16GB versions give everyone a wide range of choice
for personal storage needs, and they're all priced competitively. Not
to mention, a 16GB Flash drive player of any sort is rare, though more are
coming in the near future. It also gives me some peace of mind, using a
player that supports open-source codecs. The best part is not having any
DRM restrictions on how I can use the player for my own personal use. 
</p><p>
I mentioned my desire to have longer battery life at the start of this
article. COWON claims its internal lithium-ion battery will last up to 60
hours on one charge. This claim is based on using it almost exclusively for
music playback. Video playback will knock this claim down to about 40 hours
per charge. Regardless of how you use it, it's a superior amount of battery
power when compared to the competition. It also accounts for why the
iAudio 7 is about three times thicker than an iPod Nano, but that's a trade-off
I don't mind making. It's still relatively thin, as I measured it to be
only .75" thick. The COWON iAudio 7 is a mini-marvel of a media player
that also lets you cast your vote in supporting products that function in an
open-source environment, and that environment just got more inviting with this
player.
