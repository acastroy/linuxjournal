Do you wish that Rails came with more built-in functionality?
Plugins bridge this gap, offering solutions to many common problems.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c1b580.0x1d13358"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Last month, we began to look at OpenID, the open standard for
distributed identification on the Internet. OpenID allows you to have
a single user profile, authenticated against a provider you
trust, and to use that profile with many different Web sites and
Internet applications. OpenID has been growing in popularity during the
past few years, after it was first developed and used by blogging
company LiveJournal. Since then, it has become a more popular and open standard, and is
now supported by
many Web sites, as well as all popular programming languages.
</p><p>
I was hoping to use this month's column to show how easy it is to
make a Web application compliant with OpenID&mdash;or in OpenID
terminology, to make it into an OpenID consumer. It turns out
that adding OpenID capabilities isn't actually that complicated or
difficult, particularly with a popular framework like Ruby on Rails,
for which there are many established plugins.
</p><p>
However, I also found that the OpenID plugin for Rails works
especially well with a plugin called acts_as_authenticated. This
plugin provides a simple, secure and highly customizable
authentication system for Rails applications. So this month, we are 
taking a slight detour, looking at how we can use acts_as_authenticated
in Rails applications. Along the way, we can see how to download and
use Rails plugins, an important part of Web development with Rails.
Next month, we'll build on what we have created, adding OpenID to our
application for a truly flexible set of login options for our users.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c1b580.0x1d135c0"></a>
Rails Plugins</h2></div></div><p>
Although Rails provides a great deal of functionality for developers, it
offers few application-level features. Rather, most of its
functionality is in the form of objects and methods that programmers
can use to create new applications. But, there are no built-in
applications, or application fragments, or even a centralized database
schema that developers can expect to find in every Rails
installation.
</p><p>
The Rails core developers have said that this is done on purpose,
because every application has different needs, and it would be
impossible to please everyone. And indeed, I understand their point.
Each of my applications always has needed to keep a slightly different
type of information about users, let alone other types of data. Any
choice the developers might make will be wrong for some people.
</p><p>
I happen to think there is a middle ground here. Perhaps the
Rails core doesn't need to include a complete solution for users,
groups and permissions. But, given the overwhelming number of
applications that do define and use such objects, it would make sense
to include an easily extensible skeleton within the framework itself.
</p><p>
Such extensions are unlikely to appear in the near future, given the
strong feelings the Rails core team has expressed about them in the past.
However, all is not lost. Rails includes a &ldquo;plugin&rdquo; system that makes
it possible to download collections of code&mdash;including models,
views, controllers and more&mdash;and to install them into an
application. If you can find and install an appropriate plugin, you
get something of a compromise solution. Once installed, the code acts
as if it were an integral part of your application. And, of course, you
can add only those plugins that are important to your particular
application.
</p><p>
Because so many applications require users to register and
authenticate, it should come as no surprise that there are a number of
available plugins. One of the most popular is acts_as_authenticated,
a plugin written by Rails core team member Rick Olson. The name does
not refer to an actual declaration, but is rather a playful way of
saying that it was designed to work with Rails. And, although the README
file (displayed when you install the plugin) indicates that it has
been deprecated (in favor of restful_authentication),
acts_as_authenticated is popular and stable enough, and plays well
enough with OpenID, that it is worth a look.
</p><p>
Rails plugins are installed with the built-in plugin tool, located in
script/plugin. You can list the plugins that are available:

<pre     class="programlisting">
script/plugin list
</pre>
</p><p>
But, this will list only those plugins located at one of the sources
known to the system. To see a list of these sources, simply type:

<pre     class="programlisting">
script/plugin sources
</pre>
</p><p>
To add a new source to the list, simply say:

<pre     class="programlisting">
script/plugin source http://svn.techno-weenie.net/projects/plugins/
</pre>
</p><p>
Sure enough, after doing this, running <tt  >script/plugin
sources</tt> shows
the new URL. And, of course, now typing <tt  >script/plugin
list</tt> shows many
new plugins, from both the old source and the new one.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c1b580.0x1d13c48"></a>
Installing acts_as_authenticated</h2></div></div><p>
To install a new plugin&mdash;say, acts_as_authenticated&mdash;we must
provide its URL to script/plugin. This is as easy as the following:


<pre     class="programlisting">
script/plugin install
http://svn.techno-weenie.net/projects/plugins/acts_as_authenticated
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, what happens when you install a plugin? Rails installs it into
the vendor/plugins directory, under a new directory named after the
plugin. Thus, my installation of acts_as_authenticated installed a
number of files into vendor/plugins/acts_as_authenticated.
</p><p>
In and of itself, installing the plugin doesn't change my Rails
installation or add any new functionality. Rather, a plugin
typically creates one or more generators, which are used to create or
modify files used by the application.
</p><p>
In the case of acts_as_authenticated, it comes with two different
generators, which we can see by going into the generators
subdirectory. Here, there are two generators, named
authenticated and authenticated_mailer. If we go into the
authenticated directory, we see authenticated_generator, which is
what defines the generator. This allows us to go to the root
directory of our Rails application and type:

<pre     class="programlisting">
script/generate authenticated user account
</pre>
</p><p>
The above tells Rails that we want to use the authenticated plugin,
which it finds in the plugin directory. The other arguments to this
command indicate the model (and table name) we will use (user in
this case), and the controller that should be generated to handle
accounts.
</p><p>
The generator creates a migration file, defining the columns of the
Users table using Ruby for greater database independence. In order
to create the columns of the database, we must run the migration:

<pre     class="programlisting">
rake db:migration
</pre>
</p><p>
Using my PostgreSQL database client, I now can see that the migration
did its job:


<pre     class="programlisting">
atf_development=# \d users
                     Table "public.users"
          Column           |            Type             |
---------------------------+-----------------------------+
 id                        | integer                     |
 login                     | character varying(255)      |
 email                     | character varying(255)      |
 crypted_password          | character varying(40)       |
 salt                      | character varying(40)       |
 created_at                | timestamp without time zone |
 updated_at                | timestamp without time zone |
 remember_token            | character varying(255)      |
 remember_token_expires_at | timestamp without time zone |
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c1b580.0x1d14170"></a>
Using the Plugin</h2></div></div><p>
Now that I have incorporated acts_as_authenticated into my
application, I should be able to do several simple things:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Mark pages as open to the public.
</p></li><li><p>
Mark pages as private&mdash;that is, open only to registered users.
</p></li><li><p>
Allow people to register.
</p></li><li><p>
Allow users to log in.
</p></li><li><p>
Allow users to log out.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
All of this is not only possible with acts_as_authenticated, but
it's also quite easy. To make pages require authentication by default, we can
say:

<pre     class="programlisting">
before_filter :login_required
</pre>
</p><p>
Of course, if we require that people log in before they use the login
page, users will find themselves in an infinite loop. So, we can
add an exception for that at the top of account_controller.rb:


<pre     class="programlisting">
before_filter :login_required, :except =&gt; [:login, :signup]
</pre>
</p><p>
Once this filter is in place, trying to visit any page other than
login or :signup bounces us back to the login page.
</p><p>
I'm going to register, by entering my login name, my e-mail address
and my password (twice) into the registration form. Once I click on
the submit button, the application inserts my data into the
database. I'm in there, with ID #1, and my plain-text data as well as
my encrypted data.
</p><p>
Moreover, after registering with the site, I am now signed in as well.
I can view any page I want, without having to log in again. My
login will last until I go to the /account/logout URL. Unfortunately,
the default index.rhtml page that comes with acts_as_authenticated
does not make it clear when you have logged out. We can check that
easily by adding a line to the top, showing the contents of non-blank
notices:


<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;p&gt;&lt;%= flash[:notice] if not flash[:notice].blank? %&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
We now have a basically working version of an authenticated Web
server. People can register (and log in if they are already
registered), and we can add both restricted and unrestricted pages via
the controller and the <tt  >before_filter :login_required</tt> command.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c1b580.0x1d14a60"></a>
Modifying the Default Behavior</h2></div></div><p>
acts_as_authenticated is good enough for many sites as it currently
stands. However, there are a number of plugins, suggestions and
modifications that you can use with acts_as_authenticated.
</p><p>
For example, many registrations systems want to stop bots from
automatically creating user names or e-mail addresses, which can be
used to send spam. Thus, it's common for the registration system to
ask that users confirm their membership requests via e-mail. So, you
enter your information at the site and receive a message that
asks you to click on a link. Only after clicking on that link is your
account actually activated.
</p><p>
This functionality, although not an obvious part of the core
acts_as_authenticated plugin, comes with it and is easy to use.
Basically, we use the other generator that comes with
acts_as_authenticated. This creates the templates and most of the
logic that we need for people to confirm their login status.
</p><p>
There are a wide variety of other things you can do with
acts_as_authenticated. For example, you can set it so that 
passwords are encrypted, but in a way such that it would be
reversible.
Another common task is to let users change their personal information, such as
e-mail addresses and telephone numbers.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
This whole discussion of acts_as_authenticated began because I wanted
to use OpenID in a Rails application. However, I also wanted to
integrate OpenID with an existing authentication mechanism, which
brought me to acts_as_authenticated. Now that we have a working, if
bare-bones, authentication system on our Web site, we can move
on to the next step.
</p><p>
Even if you are not using acts_as_authenticated in your Rails
application, it's useful to see how plugins work, how you interact
with them and how you can use them to build your Rails application
out of parts that have been contributed by other programmers.
</p><p>
Next month, we will look at how we can integrate OpenID into our login
system&mdash;namely, allowing people to log in using either a
user name/password combination or OpenID.

Resources</b></p><p>
If you're still new to Rails, I strongly recommend <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Rails
Way</em></span> by Obie Fernandez. I have found it to be both clear and
comprehensive, and one chapter in the book is dedicated to
acts_as_authenticated.
</p><p>
There are a number of good resources about acts_as_authenticated on
the Web. However, the most comprehensive is the author's Wiki, at
<a href="http://technoweenie.stikipad.com/plugins/show/Acts+as+Authenticated" target="_self">technoweenie.stikipad.com/plugins/show/Acts+as+Authenticated</a>.
