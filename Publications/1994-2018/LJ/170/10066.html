Instead of one large hack, this month, I cover a few of my
favorite smaller hacks to manage windows, switch my display to a projector
and perform binary diffs on large files.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1784580.0x187c3b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
One of the more interesting parts of any conference is the lightning talks.
If you haven't experienced one, a lightning talk typically features a
number of different speakers, each giving a short (5&ndash;20 minutes)
presentation. Lightning talks take advantage of the fact that often a
speaker has an interesting topic to present, but the topic won't fill an
entire hour time slot. So, lightning talks round up each of these speakers
one after the other in the same time slot. Because of the variety of
information and the fast nature of lightning talks, they can be really
informative, interesting and definitely fun.
</p><p>
As I was considering what topic to cover for this month's column, I
realized I had a number of different hacks I'd like to mention, but
none that could really fill a full column. In the spirit of lightning
talks, I
decided to put all of these hacks together in true rapid-fire fashion.

Move Windows to Their Default Location</h2></div></div><p>
In the March 2008 issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>, I introduced the wmctrl tool and
discussed how to use it to move, resize, shade and do all sorts of window
management tasks from the command line. I also introduced a few scripts I had
written and bound to keys to resize and shade a few different windows on my
desktop. Near the end of that article, I mentioned:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
My next project is to create a &ldquo;reset&rdquo; script that moves all the windows
on all of my desktops to precise locations and sizes, in case they all get
moved around and resized. Sure, I could do all this by hand, but then I'd
miss this great opportunity for automation.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Well, shortly after I wrote that, I completed my reset script. This script
goes from desktop to desktop (or because I use Compiz, viewport to viewport)
and moves and resizes windows per my specifications. I've added comments to
explain particular sections:


<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/sh

# First save my current viewport so I can return 
# to it after I'm done
SAVED_VP=`wmctrl -d | perl -ne '/VP: (\d+,\d+)/; print $1;'`

# Then, move to the first viewport (at 0,0). Because it 
# can take a second or two for this to take effect, 
# I've opted to create a while loop that will
# continue to attempt to switch to that viewport 
# until it detects it is actually there.
VP=0,0
while [ `wmctrl -d | perl -ne '/VP: (\d+,\d+)/; 
 &#8618;print $1;'` != $VP ];
do
    wmctrl -o $VP
done

# Now resize, move, and change state of particular 
# windows (see the wmctrl man page, or my wmctrl 
# column for more information on the options).
wmctrl -r 'Eterm Main 1' -e '0,0,0,645,420'
wmctrl -r 'Irssi Term' -e '0,469,0,810,500'
wmctrl -r 'Irssi Term' -b add,shaded
wmctrl -r 'Irssi Term' -b add,below
wmctrl -r 'gkrellm' -b add,sticky
wmctrl -r "Irssi Notify Term" -e '0,1180,550,100,230'

# I now switch to the second viewport. As my screen 
# is 1280x768, the second viewport is at 1280,0. 
# If I wasn't sure, I could switch to that viewport
# and check the output of wmctrl -d for the proper coordinates.
VP=1280,0
while [ `wmctrl -d | perl -ne '/VP: (\d+,\d+)/; 
 &#8618;print $1;'` != $VP ];
do
    wmctrl -o $VP
done

wmctrl -r "Mozilla Firefox" -e '0,5,0,1040,708'

# Finally I switch back to my original viewport 
# so I'm back where I started.
wmctrl -o $SAVED_VP
</pre>
</p><p>
Although there are certainly a lot of commands in that script, it actually
didn't take long to write. Most of the script is simply one wmctrl command
after another, and I spent a majority of the time actually fine-tuning the
locations of each window and figuring out the best way to switch viewports.
If your desktop environment uses multiple desktops instead of one desktop
with multiple viewports, you would use the -s option to change desktops
instead of the -o option, which is used for viewports. You also would need
to change the logic in the while loop to something more like:

<pre     class="programlisting">
DESKTOP=1
while [ `wmctrl -d | perl -ne '/^(\d+).*?\*/; 
 &#8618;print $1;'` != $DESKTOP ];
do
    wmctrl -s $DESKTOP
done
</pre>

Toggle My Display for Presentations</h2></div></div><p>
Although I normally use my laptop with its own built-in screen, I 
frequently give presentations, so I need to display on both the LCD and the
external VGA connector. Unfortunately, my laptop's function keys to toggle
between those states don't currently work in Linux, so I've had to put it
into a script paired with a keybinding. 
</p><p>
The xrandr program works great with my laptop to toggle between displays, so
my script first examines the output of xrandr to see whether the VGA port is
connected, and if so, it adds it as a display. Otherwise, it disables VGA. I
also added a line to echo some text to osd_cat. I installed this program so
that I would get some output on the screen to let me know which mode my
script had chosen. When I'm ready to output to a projector, I just connect
it to my laptop and run the script. When I'm finished with the
presentation,
I disconnect it and run the script again:


<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/sh

if xrandr | grep -q 'VGA connected'; then
    echo "LVDS + VGA" | osd_cat --shadow=2 --align=center 
 &#8618;--pos=bottom --color=green --delay=2 
 &#8618;--font=lucidasanstypewriter-bold-24 --offset 40 &amp;
# choose my laptop screen's resolution by default, 
# if that fails try the auto-detected mode
    xrandr --output VGA --mode 1280x768@60 || xrandr 
 &#8618;--output VGA --auto
else
    echo "LVDS only" | osd_cat --shadow=2 --align=center 
 &#8618;--pos=bottom --color=green --delay=2 
 &#8618;--font=lucidasanstypewriter-bold-24 --offset 40 &amp;
    xrandr --output VGA --off &amp;
fi
</pre>
</p><p>
I also created a separate version of the script that spans across both
screens instead of mirroring. I chose to span below my current screen (with
the --below LVDS option), but most people probably will prefer to use
--right-of or --left-of:


<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/sh

if xrandr | grep -q 'VGA connected'; then
    echo "LVDS + VGA span" | osd_cat --shadow=2 --align=center 
 &#8618;--pos=bottom --color=green --delay=2 
 &#8618;--font=lucidasanstypewriter-bold-24 --offset 40 &amp;
    xrandr --output VGA --mode 1280x768@60 --below LVDS || xrandr 
 &#8618;--output
VGA --below LVDS --auto
else
    echo "LVDS only" | osd_cat --shadow=2 --align=center 
 &#8618;--pos=bottom --color=green --delay=2 
 &#8618;--font=lucidasanstypewriter-bold-24 --offset 40 &amp;
    xrandr --output VGA --off &amp;
fi
</pre>

What's the Difference?</h2></div></div><p>
Recently, I was working on a remastered Knoppix DVD that I had sent out to a
few people. After I had sent out the full remastered DVD, I found out that I
needed to change a few small files on the DVD. Even though my home DSL
speeds are pretty fast, the upload is still slow enough that it took
overnight to transfer the 3GB+ DVD image. I didn't want to go through that
again, especially as I had made only minor changes to the DVD. 
</p><p>
I knew that binary diff tools existed, but I discovered that not all
of them are equal. Some binary diff tools require enough RAM to store
multiple copies of the file, which certainly wouldn't work with a 3GB
image. Lucky for me, I found rdiff, a tool that works well with large files
and doesn't require a lot of RAM. What's better is that rdiff works with
any binary&mdash;you can use it for any large binary files from DVD images to
virtual disks to multimedia files.
</p><p>
rdiff works via a three-stage process. In this example, I have two
files, old.iso and new.iso, that have minor differences from each other. For
the first stage, you create a signature file that rdiff uses to represent
your original file:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ rdiff signature old.iso old.signature
</pre>
</p><p>
Now that you have a signature file, use it with rdiff to create a delta
file that represents the differences between the old and new files:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ rdiff delta old.signature new.iso new.delta
</pre>
</p><p>
This new.delta file is now all that anyone needs to convert old.iso to
new.iso. For me, this file ended up being around 150Kb, because I had 
made only a few changes. The delta file was much simpler to send around than the
full image. If you want to test that the delta file will work, first create
an md5sum of new.iso:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ md5sum new.iso
</pre>
</p><p>
Then, use rdiff to patch the old file with the delta to create the new file.
This is the same command that everyone else with the original file will
use:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ rdiff patch odl.iso new.delta newtest.iso
</pre>
</p><p>
Now that you have newtest.iso, create an md5sum of that file and compare it
with the one you made for new.iso:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ md5sum newtest.iso
</pre>
</p><p>
As I said before, this method works not only with ISOs, but also with any binary
file large or small. It's worth noting that rdiff works with the same
binary diff method rsync uses. rdiff just lets you use the algorithm
step by step on the command line.
