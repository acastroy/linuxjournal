The Readers' Choice Awards take the current pulse of the Linux Community 
year. Here are the tools you use every day in your work and play.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11ed580.0x12e52a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Back in January and February, we surveyed you, our readers, to find out
what Linux-based products, tools and services you prefer these
days. More than 5,900 of you completed the survey, and your favorites are the
worthy recipients of the 2008 Readers' Choice Awards. Although some results
are predictable, many are certain to both interest and surprise you.
</p><p>
In this year's competition, we designated only one winner per
category, with strong contenders receiving honorable mention awards.
For instance, in the categories where a cluster of formidable contenders
followed the outright winner, we designated up to three honorable mentions.
However, if one product clearly dominated a category (for example, OpenOffice.org
with 85% in Favorite Office Program or Apache with 92% in Favorite
Web Server), and the contenders were barely on the radar, there were no
honorable mentions.
</p><p>
The developers among you will want us to weigh in on how we dealt with
languages. We created two categories: Favorite Programming Language
and Favorite Scripting Language. See Technical Editor Michael Baxter's
reasoning in the sidebar, as well as the category contents and winners. Please let
us know what you think of our approach.
</p><p>
And now, without further ado, we present the 2008 <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span> Readers'
Choice Awards.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11ed580.0x12e55c0"></a>
Favorite Primary Linux Distribution of Choice</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Ubuntu</b></span> (37.4%)
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
Honorable Mentions</em></span>
</p><p>
Mandriva (13.9%)
</p><p>
Fedora (11.1%)
</p><p>
In the last <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> Readers' Choice awards, many readers
were &ldquo;shocked&rdquo; and
&ldquo;flabbergasted&rdquo; that the upstart Ubuntu handily took the crown for
favorite distribution. This year, however, there is little surprise
that Ubuntu has won again, garnering nearly triple the votes of its
most able challenger, Mandriva&mdash;supposedly the forgotten distro?
Clearly Ubuntu has morphed from the &ldquo;little distro that could&rdquo; to the
&ldquo;big distro that did&rdquo;. How would the results differ if we asked for
your favorite distribution for servers? 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10065f1.large.jpg"><img src="10065f1.jpg"></a></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11ed580.0x12e5b98"></a>
Favorite Desktop Environment</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
GNOME</b></span> (45.7%)
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
Honorable Mention</em></span>
</p><p>

KDE (42.5%)
</p><p>
Clearly independent decision making is in ample supply in our community,
because (despite Nick Petreley's anti-GNOME rants over the years)
GNOME is your Favorite Desktop Environment. GNOME barely edged out
its also-popular desktop rival, KDE. The result makes sense given that
the GNOME-defaulting Ubuntu trounces all other distributions. However,
the fact that GNOME won by just a few percentage points perhaps means
that many of you use Ubuntu's sister distribution, the KDE-based Kubuntu?
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11ed580.0x12e5e58"></a>
Favorite Web Browser</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Firefox</b></span> (86%)
</p><p>
Given our readers' extreme penchant for tinkering, it's no surprise
that we love Firefox and its ever-growing treasure trove of extensions [see
&ldquo;Must-Have Firefox Extensions&rdquo;, page 80].
Firefox wins Favorite Web Browser with 86% of your votes. But where,
oh where, have the very capable Opera and Konqueror gone? Fewer than 5%
of you named them your favorite browser. Honorable mention for most
creative response in this category goes to &ldquo;All I know is that IE7 is
worse than dreadful.&rdquo;
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10065f3.jpg"></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11ed580.0x12e61c8"></a>
Favorite E-mail Client</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Mozilla Thunderbird</b></span> (44.9%)
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
Honorable Mentions</em></span>
</p><p>
Gmail Web Client (19.7%)
</p><p>
Evolution (13.4%)
</p><p>
KMail (10.1%)
</p><p>
Although Mozilla Thunderbird did not vanquish its opponents as decidedly as
its sibling Firefox did in the browser category, it had more than twice
the support of its nearest rival, the Gmail Web Client, to win Favorite
E-Mail Client. We were a bit surprised to see that only about 7% of you are still
using text-based e-mail clients, such as Alpine (formerly Pine) and Mutt.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10065f4.large.jpg"><img src="10065f4.jpg"></a></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11ed580.0x12e6640"></a>
Favorite Office Program</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
OpenOffice.org</b></span> (85.1%)
</p><p>
OpenOffice.org garnered a whopping 85% of the votes to win Favorite
Office Program, while competitors AbiWord and KOffice squeaked in a barely
perceptible 3% each. Nor did EIOffice, a program that has received much
praise in our pages in the past, register more than a few votes. OpenOffice.org has
become the de facto default office suite for Linux.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10065f5.large.jpg"><img src="10065f5.jpg"></a></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11ed580.0x12e6900"></a>
Favorite Audio Tool</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>
Amarok</b></span> (40.5%)
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Honorable Mentions</em></span>
</p><p>
XMMS (18.1%)
</p><p>
Audacity (12.3%)
</p><p>
Rhythmbox (11.9%)
</p><p>
Perhaps the most feature-rich audio player on any platform, Amarok has
won most of your hearts and minds for Favorite Audio Tool. Meanwhile,
the applications XMMS, Audacity and Rhythmbox each have their loyal
constituencies of a bit lesser but similar size, making each worthy of
an honorable mention.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10065f6.large.jpg"><img src="10065f6.jpg"></a></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11ed580.0x16defc8"></a>
Favorite Media Player</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
MPlayer</b></span> (34.6%)
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>
Honorable Mention</em></span>
</p><p>
VLC (27.4%)
</p><p>
This close race in the Favorite Media Player category may be as much a
testament to MPlayer's legacy to thankful Linux users everywhere as a vote
for excellence. When playing nonfree media content was still a problem
for Linux users, MPlayer was there, leveling the field and making sure
we could play anything our Windows-using friends were playing and then
some. VLC, a close second, is growing in popularity for its friendly
interface and equally adroit ability to play pretty much any format you
can throw at it.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10065f7.jpg"></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11ed580.0x16df390"></a>
Favorite Communications Tool</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Pidgin</b></span> (42%)
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Honorable Mentions</em></span>
</p><p>Skype (17.8%)
</p><p>
Kopete (12.8%)
</p><p>
Pidgin, the messaging tool formerly known as Gaim, readily handled all of
its competitors, garnering 42% of your votes. Pidgin users appreciate
the ability to monitor all of their messaging accounts using one tool.
Currently 15 protocols are available, including AIM, Google Talk, Novell
GroupWise, ICQ, MySpaceIM, Yahoo and others. Despite Skype's popularity,
it remains in Pigin's long shadow&mdash;maybe because its closed-source
credentials tug at our consciences?
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10065f8.jpg"></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11ed580.0x16df7b0"></a>
Favorite Graphics/Design Tool</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>
The GIMP</b></span> (76.4%)
</p><p>
If anything qualifies as a legendary piece of Linux software, then
The GIMP certainly has earned that mantle. Winning 76.4% of the
votes, The GIMP wins for Favorite Graphics/Design Tool. As for the
others? &ldquo;Ouch!&rdquo; is the collective cry from the other graphics applications, such as Inkscape, Scribus and Blender, each of which reached percentages
only in the single digits. Notable for its absence is the increasingly
impressive KDE graphics tool, Krita.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10065f9.jpg"></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11ed580.0x16dfac8"></a>
Favorite Digital Photo Management Tool</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
digiKam</b></span> (24.9%)
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
Honorable Mention</em></span>
</p><p>Picasa (24.5%)
</p><p>
digiKam, at 24.9%, edged out its image-organizer rival Picasa from
Google by a mere 13 votes. Picasa's excellent functionality is powerful
enough to make up for its deficits&mdash;its non-FOSS status and Wine-based
emulation. Like its e-mail cousin Gmail, Picasa is an interesting choice
given that it is not a Linux application, per se. Gmail exists only in
Google's cloud, and Picasa is&mdash;gasp!&mdash;a Windows application.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10065f10.large.jpg"><img src="10065f10.jpg"></a></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11ed580.0x16dfe90"></a>
Favorite Text Editor</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>
vi</b></span> (35.3%)
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Honorable Mention</em></span>
</p><p>
gedit (15%)
</p><p>
Who would have thought that after all these years, the vi editor
would rule the roost? It beat out every other editor, including Emacs
and vim. Three years ago, it didn't even make the top three! Go figure.
It is interesting to note that Emacs, KWrite and Kate all scored about
evenly, clustering around the 10% mark.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10065f11.large.jpg"><img src="10065f11.jpg"></a></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11ed580.0x16e0258"></a>
Favorite Linux Game</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b><span class="emphasis"><em>

</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>

</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Doom</em></span> (12.3%)
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
Tux Racer</em></span> (11.7%)
</p><p>
It is beginning to seem that no game will ever knock <span   class="emphasis"><em>Frozen
Bubble</em></span> from
its lofty perch as Favorite Linux Game. Not only does <span   class="emphasis"><em>Frozen
Bubble</em></span>
lure you in with its pure simplicity, but also those penguins are just too
darn cute! <span   class="emphasis"><em>Doom</em></span> and <span   class="emphasis"><em>Tux Racer</em></span>,
which won honorable mentions, are two
more of your favorites.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10065f12.large.jpg"><img src="10065f12.jpg"></a></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11ed580.0x16e08e0"></a>
Favorite Virtualization Solution</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>
VMware</b></span> (38.7%)
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
Honorable Mention</em></span>
</p><p>VirtualBox (20.4%)
</p><p>
Given VMware's meteoric rise during the past few years, it's no surprise to
see it win the gold for Favorite Virtualization Solution. More surprising
is VirtualBox's showing, the application that a fellow publication called
&ldquo;The best virtualization program you've never heard of&rdquo; in late 2007.
VirtualBox's patron, innotek of Germany, was acquired by Sun Microsystems
earlier this year, giving VirtualBox the marketing injection it needed
to match its technical prowess. Wine and Xen fared decently in this
category too.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10065f13.large.jpg"><img src="10065f13.jpg"></a></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11ed580.0x16e0d00"></a>
Favorite Backup System</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Simple Linux Backup</b></span> (25.5%)
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Honorable Mentions</em></span>
</p><p>
Amanda (16.1%)
</p><p>
Bacula (16.1%)
</p><p>
In this year's competition, we differentiated between comprehensive
applications, or systems, and specific utilities. Regarding the Favorite
Backup System category, most of you prefer the no-frills, low-budget
approach over corporate solutions&mdash;that is, the application Simple Linux
Backup. The open-source applications&mdash;Amanda, with the Zmanda interface
for server backup, and Bacula, for network-based backup&mdash;also got many
of your votes. Backup also is the category in which the most readers
roll their own script-based solutions.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11ed580.0x16e1018"></a>
Favorite Backup Utility</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>

</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Honorable Mentions</em></span>
</p><p>
rsync (22.4%)
</p><p>
k3b (15.1%)
</p><p>
For Favorite Backup Utility, the perpetual winner is the workhorse tar,
tallying 35.4% of the vote. Enough of you love rsync and the CD/DVD-authoring
application k3b to warrant honorable mentions.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11ed580.0x15f1c40"></a>
Favorite Database</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>
MySQL</b></span> (62.7%)
</p><p>
MySQL is not only the world's most popular open-source database, it's
your favorite as well. Although PostreSGL, SQLite, Firebird and others
registered votes, the competition was not fierce. It doesn't hurt that
MySQL runs on more than 20 different platforms.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10065f14.large.jpg"><img src="10065f14.jpg"></a></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11ed580.0x15f1f00"></a>
Favorite Programming Language</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
C</b></span> (26%)
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Honorable Mentions</em></span>
</p><p>C++ (25.7%)
</p><p>Java (22.9%)
</p><p>
'Twas the battle of the Cs in the Favorite Programming Language category,
with C taking first prize, C++ landing in second and Java in the third
spot. Don't see your own wildly
favorite language here? You wouldn't believe the number of
&ldquo;WTFs&rdquo;
we got when readers didn't find Python, Ruby or other languages here
but rather in the scripting language category. Check out that category's
results, as well as Michael Baxter's explanation in the sidebar for how we differentiated
between programming and scripting languages. (No doubt we'll see you
in the on-line comments section too!)
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11ed580.0x15f2270"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Programming Languages and Scripting Languages</b></p><p>
We received a lot of feedback about our on-line survey of favorite
languages. A particular point from this feedback has been why some
languages were called scripting languages, and others not. A criterion
was used to decide this, as will be explained. A plethora of issues
was raised in the responses we received, so highlighting some of the
issues will contextualize how the criteria emerged for this survey.
</p><p>
One simple way of distinguishing computer programming languages is
whether they are compiled or interpreted, which several <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span>
readers pointed out. However, even that is an issue. Java is
considered as a general-purpose programming language, but nominally
the runtime environment is a Java Virtual Machine. This is very
similar to a variety of scripting languages actually, including Emacs
Lisp. However, Java also can be compiled to native machine code. So,
for the interpreted versus compiled issue, one might ask, &ldquo;What kind of
compiled?&rdquo;
</p><p>
A scripting language could generally be a language that is
hosted by another environment. In other words, it's &ldquo;running on top
of something&rdquo;, whether that be a byte-code interpreter or, in the
case of embedded application use, as an adjunct to another software
application. One also might ask whether the breadth and representative
power
are obtained by libraries, or because of built-ins to the language?
</p><p>
Scripting languages also can have object features and work at a higher
level, or work more like a dynamic language, such as Lisp, which does
manifest typing. AWK and Python or Perl are arguably scripting
languages, but they are quite different in their utility. One might
think of AWK as slightly easier to use than bash, with the
particularly nice facet of associative arrays. But, Python or Perl (via
strong libraries) are much more powerful, and they are glued to
numerous layers in the complete FLOSS stack. So, the &ldquo;grain
size&rdquo; of a
scripting language tends to matter as to its utility.
</p><p>
One of the scripting languages that was omitted in the original survey
was Tcl, and this was a mistake. Tcl is very popular, especially in certain
application domains, such as CAD tools, where it is a de facto
scripting language. Similarly, upon further reflection, it might be
argued that the general-purpose programming language BASIC that is
most in use today is not really a later variant of Kemeney and Kurtz'
1964 original, but rather Visual BASIC, arguably a scripting
language. However, that language generally does not run well on Linux,
and efforts to bring this particular language to Linux have provoked
some controversy.
</p><p>
Based on comparative technical criteria, one could make the case that
Java is a scripting language. Its runtime implementation is strikingly
similar to Python, though there are clearly very divergent language
syntax and semantics in both: Python is much less strongly typed. The
problem is that Java users really don't use it as a scripting
language, and its promoters don't promote it that way either. It's
much more ubiquitous in any of its roles, such as middle-ware, for
complete applications, or as a standalone embedded platform. So, a
leading clue is that what defines a &ldquo;scripting language&rdquo; is not
necessarily decided along strictly technical lines.
</p><p>
Perhaps the motivating factor behind what determines whether a language
is a scripting language or programming language is ultimately how a
critical mass of users tend to use it. Other factors include how it's
promoted, whether it's standardized, how the user community is
responded to with emergent problems or technical issues, and how the
primary maintainers allow the language to &ldquo;evolve&rdquo; where necessary. A
really good way to see this is to compare the number of technical book
titles on computer languages and associated libraries or environments
in a modest bookstore.
</p><p>
Finally, it was this &ldquo;tendency of use&rdquo; that was the primary litmus test to
assert which language was selected as a programming language
versus as a scripting language. Some respondents have rightly pointed
out that this was relatively &ldquo;arbitrary&rdquo;, and that there were numerous
dissonances along the axis of &ldquo;compiled&rdquo; versus
&ldquo;interpreted&rdquo;. They
are right. This arbitrariness is borne out, in fact, by the usage
patterns seen; the mass of users themselves really have decided the
use models. Practical and reasonable programmers, in fact, do disagree
on such distinctions.
</p><p>
Such divides cut across much more than compiled or not. A larger
divide would appear to be strongly typed versus dynamic
languages. Another would be functional versus imperative. One divide
that seems to be waning is whether object-oriented is good; we generally seem to
believe that it is. Despite this general consensus, C is not
going away any time soon. C is viewed as the most portable high-level
&ldquo;assembly language&rdquo; there is.
</p><p>
I think a conundrum about languages is benign, and actually good news,
because it reflects the diversity of choice and utility. If the
absolute ultimate runtime performance is not relevant to a programming
problem, modern scripting languages are a strong play. One can get
more done with fewer lines of code, if compared with starting a program
in the C language. Most are easier to learn and use than, say, C++. This
may well be a legacy of highly evolved computer technology. If you
believe that &ldquo;premature optimization is the root of all evil&rdquo;, 
perhaps using a &ldquo;standard&rdquo; programming language is one kind of
premature optimization. A lot of careful thinking has gone into
certain scripting languages, and very strong compilation software is
available to host these languages. But, these advances in computer
science also derive benefit from late-modern hardware
technology. Machines today are so fast that it really is possible to
use scripting languages as general-purpose programming languages for
nearly any purpose on a wide variety of applications.

It's no surprise that Python grabbed top honors in the Favorite Scripting

</p><p>
You know you're reading the right publication when a collective cheer
rises up to celebrate the scanner-generator Flex winning a prize.
Although Flex took top honors for Favorite Language Construction Tool with
18.1% of the votes, its yacc-compatible parser generator, Bison, tallied
enough votes for an honorable mention (14.7%), as did the compiler-compiler
for Java, javacc (12.8%). Although this category registered fewer votes
than other categories, nearly 2,000 of you weighed in with your opinions.

</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Honorable Mention</em></span>
</p><p>
iptables (19.4%)
</p><p>
Just as it did in the last edition of this competition, the hyperversatile
and hyperfavorite SSH wins this year in the Favorite Security Tool
category with 29.5% of the votes. You also showed your love for the
iptables tool for your packet-filtering tasks, which deserves an honorable
mention for garnering 19.4% of the tally.

Favorite Linux Software Development Tool</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Eclipse</b></span> (29%)
</p><p>
This year, Eclipse easily eclipsed all of its competitors to win Favorite
Linux Software Development Tool. Although the rest of the votes were
widely dispersed among many different tools&mdash;KDevelop, Emacs, GNU
autoconf and NetBeans all registered significant vote counts.

</p><p>
RPM (16.5%)
</p><p>

</p><p>
Synaptic (11.6%)
</p><p>
One of the main reasons so many of you love (K)Ubuntu so much is its sweet
package management via Apt, this year's victor in the Favorite Package
Management Application category. Apt won 35.3% of your votes. Many of
you also cast your votes for the classic RPM (16.5%) and its useful friend
Yum (14.9%). Meanwhile, a respectable number of you (11.6%) prefer the
Synaptic front end on top of Apt to perform your package management tasks.

Favorite System Administration Tool</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
OpenSSH</b></span> (52.7%)
</p><p>
The depth of your love for OpenSSH is clear. Not only did you choose
it for Favorite Security Tool (above), but you chose it as Favorite
System Administration Tool as well. With 52.7% of your votes,
it stands head and shoulders above its nearest competitors.

<span   class="emphasis"><em>Honorable Mentions</em></span>
</p><p>
Drupal (21.4%)
</p><p>
Joomla! (18.9%)
</p><p>
Competition was tough for Favorite Content Management System, for you love
your myriad options. Nevertheless, your favorite application in this
category was the blog publisher WordPress (23.8%), which edged out the
able Drupal (21.4%) and Joomla! (18.9%) to take the prize. It appears
that the vast majority of you bloggers are gravitating toward WordPress,
while the Webmasters are splitting into Drupal and Joomla! camps.

Favorite Web Server</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Apache</b></span> (90.9%)
</p><p>
Rather than offer a Favorite Web Server category, we should just ask
&ldquo;Do you use the Apache Web server, yes or no?&rdquo; and leave it at that.
Apache wins with 90.9% of your votes.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11ed580.0x1870310"></a>
Favorite Linux-Friendly Web Hosting Company</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>GoDaddy.com</b></span> (14.7%)

</p><p>
1&amp;1 (9.8%)
</p><p>
DreamHost (9.4%)
</p><p>Rackspace (7.5%)
</p><p>
Given the variety of hosting companies available today, it's no surprise
that none of them dominated the voting for Favorite Linux-Friendly
Web Hosting Company. Although the winner, GoDaddy.com, garnered a
respectable 14.7%, the real winner was &ldquo;Other&rdquo; with a whopping 42.4%.
Nevertheless, hats off to GoDaddy.com for its rapid rise in
popularity&mdash;it was absent from our last awards.

<span   class="emphasis"><em>Honorable Mention </em></span>
</p><p>
Guardian Digital Linux Lockbox (12.7%)
</p><p>
As with hosting, the voting for Favorite Network or Server Appliance
category was diffuse due to the rabbit-like proliferation of useful
products in the marketplace. The top vote-getter at 15.7% was the Avocent
Cyclades ACS Console Server, and following up with honorable mention
(at 12.7%) was the Guardian Digital Linux Lockbox.

</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Honorable Mention</em></span>
</p><p>
OpenMoko Neo (23.7%)
</p><p>
In case you hadn't noticed, many of us <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> editors adore the
Nokia N800. The N800 won the 2007 awards for Ultimate Linux Handheld,
and its predecessor, the N770, would have won the 2006 Editors' Choice
Award for Best Mobile Device, only we were afraid we never talked about
anything else. Well, clearly our readers dig it too, because 43.9% of you
chose it as your favorite handheld. Keep your eye on the newer OpenMoko
Neo 1973, which burst on the scene and grabbed 23.7% of the vote.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10065f21.large.jpg"><img src="10065f21.jpg"></a></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11ed580.0x1870ec0"></a>
Favorite Linux Laptop</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
ASUS Eee PC</b></span> (34.7%)
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Honorable Mention</em></span>
</p><p>
Lenovo T61p (20%)
</p><p>
Is there any surprise that the ASUS Eee PC got 34.7% of the vote to
win the Favorite Linux Laptop category handily? Finally, a company created
a laptop with Linux in mind and didn't consider Linux as a second-rate
afterthought. It also is nice to see that our readers appreciate
Lenovo's better-late-than-never but admirable effort to pre-install
its T61p with SLED. This helped the device win honorable mention.
Hopefully, awards like this will encourage Lenovo and others to pre-install
all of their laptops with Linux from the start. If you accumulate the
various models from our Linux-specialist friends like LinuxCertified,
EmperorLinux and R Cubed, they fared well as a group too.

Dell</b></span> (30%)
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Honorable Mention</em></span>
</p><p>
Hewlett-Packard (12%)
</p><p>
It wasn't surprising to see PC giant Dell win top choice in this category with 30% of
the vote tally. Dell's product line has become more Linux-friendly over the years, which
shows up clearly in your preferences. HP gets an Honorable Mention for its Linux
offerings, and there were lots of write-ins for various verndors in this category, but
they were too diverse to merit a third place award. And of course, many of you chose a
home-brew solution as well.

</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Honorable Mention</em></span>
</p><p>
IBM (14%)
</p><p>
Hewlett-Packard (12%)
</p><p>
The majority of voters in this category give their server business to the big vendors,
such as Dell (winner of both Favorite Desktop Workstation and Server categories), IBM,
HP and Sun. Many readers also like to purchase from the smaller mom-and-pop
shops&mdash;with too many write-ins to list here. And, as with the Favorite Desktop
Workstation category, many readers prefer to build their own servers.

VMware</b></span> (42.6%)
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Honorable Mention</em></span>
</p><p>
PowerTOP (16.3%)
</p><p>
Because virtualization is such a fabulous and popular way to improve the
efficiency of your servers, VMware landed the top spot in the Favorite
Green Linux Product or Solution category. The PowerTOP tool for finding
energy wasters on your systems also is popular and won an honorable mention
at 16.3%. Although many readers earnestly consider energy consumption and
environmental impacts in their data-center strategy, we were surprised
to see the high number of responses like &ldquo;Hummer&rdquo; and &ldquo;I promote global
warming&rdquo;. We wonder with concern, &ldquo;How much good science is necessary
to convince us of the seriousness of our environmental challenges?&rdquo;

Despite the amazing diversity, your clear winner for Favorite Linux Book
is O'Reilly's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux System Administration</em></span> by Bill
Lubanovic and <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> regular
Tom Adelstein. Three other books clustered around the 6&ndash;7% mark, 
one from O'Reilly and two from Prentice Hall. Interestingly, several
of you mentioned that you don't read &ldquo;analog&rdquo; printed books anymore,
only digital materials.

Looks like Marcel Gagn&iuml;&iquest;&frac12; is going to have to be knocked off before
anyone knocks him off the award stand for Favorite <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux

Marcel's Cooking With Linux column, where Linux must be fun and one hand
must remain free to fill the wineglass, has tickled and informed <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span> readers since its inception more than 100 issues ago. The ever-popular
Dave Taylor also fared well (15%) for his Work the Shell column,
and the upstart Hack and / from Kyle Rankin has become quite popular
(14.1%) in its short life.

we congratulate ASUS for making a great Linux product from the ground up
