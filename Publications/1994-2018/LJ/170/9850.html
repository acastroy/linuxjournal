How quickly can thin clients boot over a wireless bridge, and how far apart
can they really be? 
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1386580.0x147e608"></a></h2></div></div><p>
In the 1970s and 1980s, the ubiquitous model of corporate and academic
computing was that of many users logging in remotely to a single server
to use a sliver of its precious processing time. With the cost of
semiconductors holding fast to Moore's Law in the subsequent decades,
however, the next advances in computing saw desktop computing become
the standard as it became more affordable.
</p><p>
Although the technology behind thin clients is not revolutionary, their
popularity has been on the increase recently. For many institutions
that rely on older, donated hardware, thin-client networks are
the only feasible way to provide users with access to relatively new
software. Their use also has flourished in the corporate context.
Thin-client networks provide cost-savings, ease network administration
and pose fewer security implications when the time comes to dispose of
them. Several computer manufacturers have leaped to stake their claim
on this expanding market: Dell and HP Compaq, among others, now offer
thin-client solutions to business clients.
</p><p>
And, of course, thin clients have a large following of hobbyists and
enthusiasts, who have used their size and flexibility to great effect in
countless home-brew projects. Software projects, such as the Etherboot Project and
the Linux Terminal Server Project, have large and active communities
and provide excellent support to those looking to experiment with
diskless workstations.
</p><p>
Connecting the thin clients to a server always has been done using
Ethernet; however, things are changing. Wireless technologies, such as Wi-Fi
(IEEE 802.11), have evolved tremendously and now can start to provide
an alternative means of connecting clients to servers. Furthermore,
wireless equipment enjoys world-wide acceptance, and compatible products
are readily available and very cheap.
</p><p>
In this article, we give a short description of the setup of a thin-client
network, as well as some of the tools we found to be useful in its
operation and administration. We also describe a test scenario 
we set up, involving a thin-client network that spanned a wireless
bridge. 
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1386580.0x147e978"></a>
What Is a Thin Client?</h2></div></div><p>
A thin client is a computer with no local hard drive, which loads
its operating system at boot time from a boot server. It is designed
to process data independently, but relies solely on its server for
administration, applications and non-volatile storage.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9850f1.large.jpg"><img src="9850f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. LTSP Traffic Profile and Boot Sequence
</p></div></div><p>
Following the client's BIOS sequence, most machines with network-boot
capability will initiate a Preboot EXecution Environment (PXE), which will
pass system control to the local network adapter. Figure 1 illustrates
the traffic profile of the boot process and the various different stages, which are numbered 1 to 5. The network card broadcasts a DHCPDISCOVER
packet with special flags set, indicating that the sender is trying to
locate a valid boot server. A local PXE server will reply with a list of
valid boot servers. The client then chooses a server, requests the
name of the Linux kernel file from the server and initiates its transfer
using Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP; stage 1). The client then loads and
executes the Linux kernel as normal (stage 2). A custom init program is then
run, which searches for a network card and uses DHCP to identify itself
on the network. Using Sun Microsystems' Network File System (NFS),
the thin client then mounts a directory tree located on the PXE server
as its own root filesystem (stage 3). Once the client has a non-volatile
root filesystem, it continues to load the rest of its operating system
environment (stage 4)&mdash;for example, it can mount a local filesystem and create a
ramdisk to store local copies of temporary files. The fifth stage in
the boot process is the initiation of the X Window System. This transfers
the keystrokes from the thin client to the server to be processed. The
server in return sends the graphical output to be displayed by the user
interface system (usually KDE or GNOME) on the thin client.
</p><p>
The X Display Manager Control Protocol (XDMCP) provides a layer of
abstraction between the hardware in a system and the output shown to the
user. This allows the user to be physically removed from the hardware
by, in this case, a Local Area Network. When the X Window System is
run on the thin client, it contacts the PXE server. This means the user
logs in to the thin client to get a session on the server.
</p><p>
In conventional fat-client environments, if a client opens a large file
from a network server, it must be transferred to the client over the
network. If the client saves the file, the file must be again transmitted
over the network. In the case of wireless networks, where bandwidth is
limited, fat client networks are highly inefficient. On the other hand,
with a thin-client network, if the user modifies the large file, only
mouse movement, keystrokes and screen updates are transmitted to and from
the thin client. This is a highly efficient means, and other examples, such
as ICA or NX, can consume as little as 5kbps bandwidth. This level of
traffic is suitable for transmitting over wireless links.

How to Set Up a Thin-Client Network with a Wireless Bridge</h2></div></div><p>
One of the requirements for a thin client is that it has a PXE-bootable
system. Normally, PXE is part of your network card BIOS, but if your
card doesn't support it, you can get an ISO image of Etherboot with PXE
support from ROM-o-matic (see Resources). Looking at the server with,
for example, ten clients, it should have plenty of hard disk space (100GB),
plenty of RAM (at least 1GB) and a modern CPU (such as an AMD64 3200).
</p><p>
The following is a five-step how-to guide on setting up an Edubuntu thin-client network over a fixed network. 
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>1. Prepare the server.</b></span>
</p><p>
In our network, we used the standard standalone configuration. From the
command line:
			
<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo apt-get install ltsp-server-standalone 
</pre>
</p><p>
You may need to edit /etc/ltsp/dhcpd.conf if you change the default IP
range for the clients. By default, it's configured for a server at
192.168.0.1 serving PXE clients.
</p><p>
Our network wasn't behind a firewall, but if yours is, you need to
open TFTP, NFS and DHCP. To do this, edit /etc/hosts.allow, and limit
access for portmap, rpc.mountd, rpc.statd and in.tftpd to the local
network:

<pre     class="programlisting">
portmap: 192.168.0.0/24 
rpc.mountd: 192.168.0.0/24 
rpc.statd:  192.168.0.0/24 
in.tftpd:  192.168.0.0/24
</pre>
</p><p>
Restart all the services by executing the following commands:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo invoke-rc.d nfs-kernel-server restart 
sudo invoke-rc.d nfs-common restart 
sudo invoke-rc.d portmap restart
</pre>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>2. Build the client's runtime environment.</b></span>
</p><p>
While connected to the Internet, issue the command: 
			
<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo ltsp-build-client
</pre>
</p><p>
If you're not connected to the Internet and have Edubuntu on CD, use:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo ltsp-build-client --mirror file:///cdrom
</pre>
</p><p>
Remember to copy sources.list from the server into the
chroot.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>3. Configure your SSH keys.</b></span>
</p><p>
To configure your SSH server and keys, do the following:
			 
<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo apt-get install openssh-server 
sudo ltsp-update-sshkeys
</pre>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>4. Start DHCP.</b></span>
</p><p>
You should now be ready to start your DHCP server:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo invoke-rc.d dhcp3-server start 
</pre>
</p><p>
If all is going well, you should be ready to start your thin client. 
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>5. Boot the thin client.</b></span>
</p><p>
Make sure the client is connected to the same network as your server. 
</p><p>
Power on the client, and if all goes well, you should see a nice XDMCP
graphical login dialog.
</p><p>
Once the thin-client network was up and running correctly, we added a
wireless bridge into our network. In our network, a number of thin
clients are located on a single hub, which is separated from the boot
server by an IEEE 802.11 wireless bridge. It's not an unrealistic
scenario; a situation such as this may arise in a corporate setting
or university. For example, if a group of thin clients is located in
a different or temporary building that does not have access to the main
network, a simple and elegant solution would be to have a wireless link
between the clients and the server. Here is a mini-guide in getting the
bridge running so that the clients can boot over the bridge:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Connect the server to the LAN port of the access point. Using this
LAN connection, access the Web configuration interface of the access
point, and configure it to broadcast an SSID on a unique channel. Ensure
that it is in Infrastructure mode (not ad hoc mode). Save these settings and
disconnect the server from the access point, leaving it powered on.
</p></li><li><p>
Now, connect the server to the wireless node. Using its Web interface,
connect to the wireless network advertised by the access point. Again,
make sure the node connects to the access point in Infrastructure mode.
</p></li><li><p>
Finally, connect the thin client to the access point. If there
are several thin clients connected to a single hub, connect the
access point to this hub.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
We found ad hoc mode unsuitable for two reasons. First, most wireless
devices limit ad hoc connection speeds to 11Mbps, which would put the
network under severe strain to boot even one client. Second, while
in ad hoc mode, the wireless nodes we were using would assume the Media
Access Control (MAC) address of the computer that last accessed its Web
interface (using Ethernet) as its own Wireless LAN MAC. This made the
nodes suitable for connecting a single computer to a wireless network,
but not for bridging traffic destined to more than one machine. This
detail was found only after much sleuthing and led to a range of sporadic
and often unreproducible errors in our system.
</p><p>
The wireless devices will form an Open Systems Interconnection (OSI)
layer 2 bridge between the server and the thin clients. In other words,
all packets received by the wireless devices on their Ethernet interfaces
will be forwarded over the wireless network and retransmitted on the
Ethernet adapter of the other wireless device. The bridge is transparent
to both the clients and the server; neither has any knowledge that the
bridge is in place.
</p><p>
For administration of the thin clients and network, we used the Webmin
program. Webmin comprises a Web front end and a number of CGI scripts,
which directly update system configuration files. As it is Web-based,
administration can be performed from any part of the network by simply
using a Web browser to log in to the server. The graphical interface
greatly simplifies tasks, such as adding and removing thin
clients from the network or changing the location of the image file
to be transferred at boot time. The alternative is to edit several
configuration files by hand and restart all d&aelig;mon programs manually.

Evaluating the Performance of a Thin-Client Network</h2></div></div><p>
The boot process of a thin client is network-intensive, but once the
operating system has been transferred, there is little traffic between
the client and the server. As the time required to boot a thin client
is a good indicator of the overall usability of the network, this is
the metric we used in all our tests.
</p><p>
Our testbed consisted of a 3GHz Pentium 4 with 1GB of RAM as the PXE
server. We chose Edubuntu 5.10 for our server, as this (and all newer
versions of Edubuntu) come with LTSP included. We used six identical
thin clients: 500MHz Pentium III machines with 512MB of RAM&mdash;plenty of
processing power for our purposes.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9850f2.large.jpg"><img src="9850f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Six thin clients are connected to a hub, and in turn, this is
connected to wireless bridge device. On the other side of the bridge is
the server. Both wireless devices are placed in the Azimuth chamber.
</p></div></div><p>
When performing our tests, it was important that the results obtained were
free from any external influence. A large part of this was making sure
that the wireless bridge was not affected by any other wireless networks,
cordless phones operating at 2.4GHz, microwaves or any other sources of
Radio Frequency (RF) interference. To this end, we used the Azimuth 301w
Test Chamber to house the wireless devices (see Resources). This ensures
that any variations in boot times are caused by random variables within
the system itself.
</p><p>
The Azimuth is a test platform for system-level testing of 802.11
wireless networks. It holds two wireless devices (in our case, the devices
making up our bridge) in separate chambers and provides an artificial
medium between them, creating complete isolation from the external RF
environment. The Azimuth can attenuate the medium between the wireless
devices and can convert the attenuation in decibels to an approximate
distance between them. This gives us the repeatability, which is a rare
thing in wireless LAN evaluation. A graphic representation of our testbed
is shown in Figure 2.
</p><p>
We tested the thin-client network extensively in three different
scenarios: first, when multiple clients are booting simultaneously
over the network; second, booting a single thin client over the network
at varying distances, which are simulated by altering the attenuation
introduced by the chamber; and third, booting a single client when
there is heavy background network traffic between the server and the
other clients on the network.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
As shown in Figure 3, a wired network is much more suitable for a thin-client network. The main limiting factor in using an 802.11g network
is its lack of available bandwidth. Offering a maximum data rate of
54Mbps (and actual transfer speeds at less than half that), even an
aging 100Mbps Ethernet easily outstrips 802.11g. When using an 802.11g
bridge in a network such as this one, it is best to bear in mind its
limitations. If your network contains multiple clients, try to
stagger their boot procedures if possible.
</p><p>
Second, as shown in Figure 4, keep the bridge length to a minimum. With
802.11g technology, after a length of 25 meters, the boot time for a single
client increases sharply, soon hitting the three-minute mark. Finally, our
test shows, as illustrated in Figure 5, heavy background traffic (generated
either by other clients booting or by external sources) also has a major
influence on the clients' boot processes in a wireless environment. As
the background traffic reaches 25% of our maximum throughput, the boot
times begin to soar. Having pointed out the limitations with 802.11g,
802.11n is on the horizon, and it can offer data rates of 540Mbps, which
means these limitations could soon cease to be an issue.
</p><p>
In the meantime, we can recommend a couple ways to speed up the boot
process. First, strip out the unneeded services from the thin clients.
Second, fix the delay of NFS mounting in klibc, and also try to
start LDM as early as possible in the boot process, which means running
it as the first service in rc2.d. If you do not need system logs, you can
remove syslogd completely from the thin-client startup. Finally, it's
worth remembering that after a client has fully booted, it requires very
little bandwidth, and current wireless technology is more than capable
of supporting a network of thin clients.
