VoIP
    functionality is part of the base product, so there is no special configuration or licensing necessary.  After you
    have initially downloaded and installed the platform package of your choice (
    <a href="http://www.communigate.com/download" target="_self">www.communigate.com/download</a>), you simply need to start the CommuniGate Pro server.  To do this, at a UNIX prompt on your server, type
    <tt  >/etc/init.d/CommuniGate start</tt>.</p><p>Once you have the CommuniGate Pro server up and running, you need to locate the randomly generated postmaster
    password from the postmaster accounts settings file.  For most Linux platforms, the default location is
    /var/CommuniGate/Accounts/postmaster.macnt/account.settings.
    <tt  >cat</tt> this file to obtain the predefined random postmaster password.</p><p>When you have found your postmaster password, open a Web browser of your choice and connect to the
    CommuniGate Pro Web-Administration Interface at either of these locations (where mail.example.com is the name of
    your new CGP system in DNS): http://mail.example.com:8010 or https://mail.example.com:9010.</p><p>The next step is setting up users on the CGP server.  To do this, in the Web-Admin Interface, select the Users
    tab along the top of the window.  CommuniGate Pro will ask you to authenticate&mdash;do so as postmaster, with the
    password you obtained from the postmaster accounts settings file.  Next, select the Domains, sub-tab.  Select the
    domain name corresponding to the domain where the new user(s) will be added.  Find the button labeled Create Account
    (Figure 1).  Enter the login for a new user in the field to the right of the button.  Now, click Create
    Account.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9528f1.large.jpg"><img src="9528f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1.  Create the account.</p></div></div><p>After the account has been created, a Settings page for this new user is displayed.  Enter a Real Name for the
    account, as well as a password.  This will be the new user's password for all client applications, such as e-mail,
    voice and video.  Scroll down to the field labeled Aliases.  In order to assign an
    &ldquo;extension&rdquo; to the new user, enter the desired extension in the Aliases field.  All extensions are
    really just CGP aliases for an account.  Finally, click the Update button located right under the Aliases field.  The
    new user has now been provisioned and already has access to all services, by default, including VoIP.</p><p>Repeat the provisioning process above for additional users by clicking the Objects tab located near the top
    of the tabs.  Enter the login for the next new user and so on.</p><p>Now that users are provisioned on the CGP server, the next step is to install and configure a device or
    service known as a VoIP-to-PSTN gateway.  The function of such a device or service is to route inbound and outbound
    telephone calls through the gateway and convert signaling from IP to PSTN and back.</p><p>There are numerous PSTN gateway devices supported by CommuniGate Pro, including Cisco Routers with SIP
    module, AudioCodes Mediant, Mediatrix, VegaStream and Sipura.  Also, a number of gateway services are available that
    CGP supports, such as VoicePulse, Voxeo and Tario.</p><p>Suppose, for example, you elect to purchase the Sipura 3000.  This device provides decent quality, is well
    valued and supports three ports:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>An analog (RJ-11) line from your telephone provider (such as SBC).</p></li><li><p>A LAN Ethernet connection (RJ-45).</p></li><li><p>A second analog (RJ-11) line for connecting a standard telephone.</p></li></ol></div><p>Note: if you're using a PSTN device such as those listed above, you need to pay for a PSTN line to your
    location.  The smaller devices (such as Sipura and Mediatrix) can use RJ-11 analog lines as input.  The larger
    devices typically require a dedicated T1 PRI to your site.</p><p>To configure the Sipura 3000 to work with CGP, follow these steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Plug in the Sipura&mdash;power, analog line (to your wall socket) and Ethernet (to your LAN).</p></li><li><p>By default, the Sipura should get a DHCP address on your network and start its administration interface
        (accessible via a Web browser).</p></li><li><p>Connect to the administration interface http://IP.address.of.Sipura/admin.  The default login is admin,
        and there is no default password (it should accept a blank password).</p></li></ol></div><p>The Sipura 3000 uses a tabbed administration interface much like CGP.  The Info tab displays the current
    configuration.  The System tab (Figure 2) should be configured for a hostname and any other relevant information to
    your site (DHCP, Domain, DNS and so forth).</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9528f2.large.jpg"><img src="9528f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 2.  Use the Web interface to set up the Sipura 3000.</p></div></div><p>If you are just using the PSTN and Ethernet ports, then the only other configuration changes that need to be
    set are on the PSTN Line tab.  These changes include the following for a very simple setup.  Note that no security
    restrictions have been added here, so any system that can route SIP traffic to the Sipura device will be able to
    initiate outbound calls to the PSTN: </p><pre     class="programlisting">

</pre><p>The dial plans are required with the Sipura device to select a routing destination.  Many PSTN gateway devices
    do not require specific dial plans, as the default VoIP-to-PSTN and PSTN-to-VoIP directions are relatively
    straightforward.  The above dial plans should be entered exactly as listed, except for the hostname of your
    CommuniGate Pro server.  Note too the pbx account name&mdash;if you used a different name as the pbx account on your
    CommuniGate Pro server, it should be used here instead.  Now, all incoming calls from the PSTN line will be routed
    to the LAN network with a destination of this account on the CommuniGate Pro server.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x197b580.0x1a743c8"></a>Routing Outbound Calls to the VoIP-to-PSTN Gateway</h2></div></div><p>Routing some or all numeric addresses (calls to the PSTN) from CommuniGate Pro to your FXO Gateway (Foreign
    eXchange Office&mdash;Sipura, in this case) is very easy.</p><p>First, log in to the Web-Admin Interface: https://mail.example.com:9010.  Then, select the Settings menu
    option, and then Router (Settings&rarr;Router).  Next, add the desired routing table entries for the matched
    numbers you want routed to the FXO gateway.  For example: </p><pre     class="programlisting">
NoRelay:Signal:&lt;1*@example.com&gt; = 1*@192.168.1.136
</pre><p>This special syntax simply says,
    &ldquo; relay all calls starting with a 1 to the device at 192.168.1.136&rdquo;, which for this example would be a
    Sipura 3000.  Similar routing could be done using a 9 prefix, or 011 for international calls: </p><pre     class="programlisting">
      
NoRelay:Signal:&lt;9*@example.com&gt; = *@192.168.1.136
NoRelay:Signal:&lt;011*@example.com&gt; = 011*@192.168.1.136

</pre><p>Note: for the 9-prefix example above, the 9 is stripped from the call when it is routed to the FXO
    device.</p><p>Much more complex signal routing and digit-matching plans can be configured&mdash;see the on-line CommuniGate
    Pro guide at
    <a href="http://www.communigate.com/CommuniGatePro" target="_self">www.communigate.com/CommuniGatePro</a>.</p><p>At this point, you should have your software set up to route calls correctly.  Now, you need either a
    softphone or an IP phone.</p><p>CommuniGate Pro supports SIP (Session Initiation Protocol).  SIP enables real-time communications, including
    instant messaging, Voice-over-IP, video conferencing, multimedia, whiteboard and application sharing.  Required for
    implementation is CommuniGate Pro version 5.0 or 5.1 and a SIP-enabled client device.</p><p>There are many types of SIP-enabled clients.  One type of SIP client is a softphone.  A softphone is a voice
    application run on your desktop computer, laptop computer or mobile computing device that acts just like a normal
    phone, except that you use a microphone or computer headset to talk.</p><p>These clients have all the functionality of their physical counterparts and, in some cases, more.  Here are
    just a few of the softphones available at this time:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>CounterPath's eyebeam and X-Lite products (Windows/Mac).</p></li><li><p>Twinkle (Linux).</p></li><li><p>SJphone (Windows/Mac/Linux).</p></li></ul></div><p>Another group of SIP clients, known as IP phones, are physical devices that look just like any other desktop
    phone.  However, these devices are connected to the Ethernet over Internet Protocol instead of the telephone network
    over twisted pair.  These devices are just as easy to set up and configure as their softphone counterparts and
    typically have an HTML interface for exactly this purpose.</p><p>Finally, there are soft-client applications that are capable of providing multiple types of SIP
    services&mdash;including instant messaging, voice, video conferencing and whiteboarding&mdash;in one package.  Some
    of these applications include Microsoft Windows Messenger, Linphone and KPhone, with more on the way from both the
    commercial and open-source sectors.</p><p>CommuniGate Systems integrates with all SIP-standards-based IP phones.  Phones tested to date include those
    from Polycom, SNOM, Grandstream, ZyXel, Hitachi Cable, Cisco and various other lesser-known IP devices.</p><p>All SIP-standards phones should work with CommuniGate Pro.  However, SIP has evolved and, in the event that a
    specific device is found not to work, CommuniGate Pro provides a SIP Workaround feature that can be implemented
    while the system is running to provide specific workarounds to a specific device.</p><p>The following describes the setup of a common IP phone, the Polycom 501.  Most IP phones use a similar
    configuration process.</p><p>Each Polycom phone contains a built-in Web server for configuration.  After putting the phone on your LAN
    network, it will get a DHCP address, which can be viewed on the phone's LCD screen.</p><p>Use your favorite Web browser to connect to the IP address of the phone.  The default login for the Polycom
    phones is: </p><pre     class="programlisting">http://IP.address.of.phone
username: Polycom
password: 456</pre><p>After logging in, select the SIP Conf.  tab (Figure 3), and enter the hostname or IP address of your
    CommuniGate Pro system for the Outbound Proxy.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9528f3.large.jpg"><img src="9528f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 3.  Set up the Polycom IP phone with the Web interface.</p></div></div><p>Locate the Registration tab (Figure 4), and enter your Display Name (real name), SIP address (same as your
    e-mail address) and Auth User ID and Password.  The Auth User ID could be your short user name, such as demo, or it
    also can work as the fully qualified name, such as demo@example.com.  Also enter the Address of the server, which in
    most architectures is the hostname or domain name of your environment, and often it is the same as your Outbound
    Proxy address above.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9528f4.large.jpg"><img src="9528f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 4.  Finish setting up the Polycom phone.</p></div></div><p>That's it.  After updating each change, the phone restarts.  After your last set of changes, the phone should
    REGISTER as your account, and your account name will be displayed on the phone's LCD screen.  Incoming calls to your
    account or extension will ring the phone, as well as your other SIP devices.</p><p>You are now ready to place a call.  You can dial from one test user to another you've configured either by
    entering the login name or, alternatively, the extension assigned as the alias for that user.  If you want to call
    people who also are using VoIP on the Internet, try calling them with their URI.  For example, on your eyeBeam
    softphone, instead of dialing digits, type an address (JohnDoe@another.example.net).  Of course, your CGP server
    must have access to the Internet.  Enjoy!</p></div></div>
