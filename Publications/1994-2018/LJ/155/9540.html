    <span   class="emphasis"><em>Mon Dieu!  </em></span>Fran&ccedil;ois, look at this phone bill!  Explain these long-distance
    charges.  Yes, I know you have friends and family all over the world, but why are you calling them from the
    restaurant telephone?  <span   class="emphasis"><em>Quoi?</em></span> Because it is too expensive to use your own phone? Fran&ccedil;ois, aside from
    the fact that you have used up two months of your salary with these calls, there are better ways to save money on
    long distance.  How? By using your Linux system and a Voice over IP program, of course. That just happens to be the
    focus of tonight's menu.</p><p>We will discuss this bill later,
    <span   class="emphasis"><em>mon ami</em></span>.  I can already see our guests starting to arrive.  Head to the wine cellar,
    <span   class="emphasis"><em>imm&eacute;diatement</em></span>.  Bring up the 2004 South African Ubuntu Shiraz we were sampling
    earlier today.
    <span   class="emphasis"><em>Vite!</em></span> Perhaps if you are truly efficient, I may re-instate your salary despite these calls.
    Enough smiling.  <span   class="emphasis"><em>Vite!</em></span></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xfd0580.0x10c8710"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
        
      </b></p><p>Yes,
      <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, there really is an Ubuntu wine, distributed by the South African winemaker,
      KWV.</p></div><p>Ah, welcome,
    <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, to
    <span   class="emphasis"><em>Chez Marcel</em></span>, home of fine wine and fine Linux fare.  Please sit and make yourselves
    comfortable.  I have sent Fran&ccedil;ois to the wine cellar, and he should be back with your wine very
    shortly.  While we wait, however, let me ask a question.  Who, besides myself, would like to avoid paying hefty
    long-distance fees? I see.  Well, how does free long distance to anyone anywhere in the world sound? That's what I
    thought.</p><p>VoIP (Voice over IP) programs allow you to communicate with others running similar programs on their
    respective computers.  All you need, aside from a computer, is a microphone and speakers, though it's often a good
    idea to use a headset that combines these two.  Your voice is transmitted via packets over your existing Internet
    connection to a receiving system, wherever it might be.</p><p>Just as with cell phones that include every feature imaginable, from cameras to MP3 players, it's getting
    harder and harder to find a program that's just a phone.  Many offer advanced features, such as call answer,
    conference calling and a whole lot more.  Using the right program, you even can transmit video, just like they did
    back in the 1960s on
    <span   class="emphasis"><em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em></span>.  To transmit video, you also need a Webcam.  These inexpensive USB
    cameras are used for a variety of things, providing glimpses into the life of the individual running a particular
    Web site.  Other sites provide a camera to reassure us that they are indeed working.  Others still are there to let
    parents observe their children playing at day care.  As it turns out, they also help make great video phones.</p><p>Ah, Fran&ccedil;ois, you have returned.  Please, pour for our guests.  Make sure everyone's glass is
    full.  There are a couple of things we should talk about before we look at the phones on today's list.</p><p>Where shall we start?
    <span   class="emphasis"><em>Mais oui</em></span>&mdash;protocols, protocols, protocols.  SIP, or Session Initiation Protocol, is (as
    the name implies) a protocol used to create, manage and end sessions between two or more users.  The sessions we are
    talking about in this case are phone conversations.  All of the programs on tonight's menu are SIP phones.  As you
    know, here at
    <span   class="emphasis"><em>Chez Marcel</em></span>, we love open source and we love open protocols.  A wonderful thing about all these
    programs is that every one of them can call another's SIP address.  The second thing we need to cover is security
    and some of the problems it poses to VoIP programs.</p><p>If you are running these packages on your corporate or home LAN, you should have no problems.  The same holds
    true if you are running them from a single machine connected to the Internet&mdash;odds are this will work without
    a hitch.  The catch comes when you try to work from behind a masqueraded (or NATed) firewall.  Luckily, many of these
    programs use STUN to help with this little problem.</p><p>STUN stands for Simple Traversal of UDP through NATs (which stands for Network Address Translations).  Aren't
    you glad they just call it STUN? The whole point is to provide a protocol that helps systems working from behind a
    NAT firewall route their packets to and from the appropriate place.  To use STUN, your program must register with a
    STUN server, a number of which are public and free to use.</p><p>That should take care of the background information.  Let's take a look at some SIP phones now, starting with
    a little something called Ekiga.  Once upon a time, there was a program called GnomeMeeting.  These days, it's called
    Ekiga, and it is a great VoIP program.
   Ekiga, which supports both SIP and H323 protocols, is an excellent telephone application
    as well as a great video conferencing tool.It even will work with Microsoft NetMeeting.  You'll find that
    Ekiga is rich in features with multiple, simultaneous account support, call hold, call transfer, call forwarding,
    instant messaging and a whole lot more.</p><p>Ekiga is available from its Web site (see Resources), where you'll find binaries for a number of popular
    distributions (and source, of course).  Ekiga also has a .net sister site from which you can get your own SIP
    address so that people can call you or look you up in the on-line directory.  In fact, when starting Ekiga for the
    first time, you are presented with the the First Time Configuration Assistant (Figure 1).  Part of this process
    involves registering a free Ekiga.net SIP account (if you don't already have one).  You can enter your address here,
    or click the link provided to set one up.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="9540f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1.  If you don't have a SIP address yet, Ekiga makes it easy.  Click the link provided, and you'll
        be set up in no time.</p></div></div><p>When you are happy with the information you are presenting, click the Forward button to continue, and you
    will be asked to specify the type and speed of connection you are using.  When you click Forward past this screen,
    you'll come face to face with the issue of security I mentioned earlier.  Click the box labeled Detect NAT Type, and
    Ekiga's Assistant will try to determine what kind of routing assistance you may need.  If the program determines
    that you are behind a NAT firewall, you'll be given the opportunity to enable STUN support.</p><p>Click Forward.  For the next few screens, the Assistant will help you configure your sound card, microphone
    and Webcam.  As you go through the Configuration Assistant, buttons are provided to test your chosen settings,
    whether they be audio or video.  By the way, Ekiga also provides support for FireWire digital cameras (like the
    digital video camera you bought to take videos of your new baby) through pwlib plugins.  If you are going to use one
    of these cameras, make sure you also download and install the pwlib-plugins-avc package.  You always can configure a
    different camera later by clicking Edit on Ekiga's menu bar, selecting Preferences, and then looking under Video
    Devices.  Change the Video Plugin over on the right (Figure 2), and your camera should be detected.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9540f2.large.jpg"><img src="9540f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 2.  With the right plugin, Ekiga can configure and use a FireWire digital camera.</p></div></div><p>Of course, you don't need a Webcam (or any kind of camera) if you just plan to use Ekiga as a SIP phone.
    Click Apply on the final screen, and Ekiga fires up.  You can configure several options with the package through the
    preferences menu.  You also can re-run the First Time Assistant at any time.</p><p>To place a SIP call, type
    <tt  >sip:friendsaddress@ekiga.net</tt> in the address bar just below the menu bar&mdash;this example
    assumes that your friend's SIP address is a registered Ekiga.net address (Figure 3).  A little pop-up window appears
    on the second PC warning the user of an incoming call.  If you accept the connection, the two clients can
    communicate.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="9540f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>Figure 3.  I wonder if Mom and Dad are available for an Ekiga chat</p></div></div><p>Notice the button bar to the left in Figure 3.  You can turn video or audio on and off, and you can bring up a
    chat window for text message exchange.  In fact, Ekiga will work under a number of different configurations.  You can
    run video only, audio only, text only or any combination of the three modes.  If you have a camera and your friends
    don't, that's okay too, because they'll still be able to see you.  Of course, it can be a little disconcerting to
    know that somebody out there can see you, but you can't see them.</p><p>When you run Ekiga, make sure you turn on the control panel.  It opens up to a tabbed window in the
    application, providing support for audio and video controls as well as a dialpad.  This shows the status of calls,
    your registration with on-line directories and other information, and it can be turned on or off at any time
    without affecting the transmission.  Ekiga also provides an address book, so you can search users who are registered
    with Ekiga.net.  Simply click the address book icon on the left icon bar.</p><p>Fran&ccedil;ois, our guests' glasses are looking a little dry.  Please offer everyone a refill while
    I present the next item on tonight's menu.</p><p>WengoPhone is a fantastic VoIP client, and one you must check out.
    First and foremost, WengoPhone has great sound quality, a must for a VoIP
    application.  It features free Wengo-to-Wengo communications worldwide; inexpensive
    Wengo-to-standard-telephone calling (using Wengo credits); conference calling; SMS support; instant messaging to
    Yahoo, MSN, AIM/ICQ and Jabber (such as Google Talk) clients; as well as video chat.  Wengo is a very slick and
    feature-rich application.  I'll tell you all about it, but start by visiting WengoPhone's Web site and downloading a
    copy.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="9540f4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>Figure 4.  WengoPhone aims to be a complete messaging solution.</p></div></div><p>When WengoPhone starts, it asks you to log in using the e-mail address with which you registered and your
    password (Figure 5).  If this is your first time, you likely won't already have a Wengo account, so click the Click
    here if you don't have a Wengo account button.  A browser window appears on the Wengo Web site where you can
    register your account.  On doing so, you'll get a small Wengo credit you can use to call land lines and cell phones
    (to which you also can send text messages).</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="9540f5.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>Figure 5.  If you don't already have an account, this is your opportunity.</p></div></div><p>After you are registered, Wengo starts up, finding and configuring your audio and video automatically.  This
    isn't to say it will find everything you have, but it tries.  Down at the bottom right-hand corner of the main
    WengoPhone window (Figure 4), there are little icons telling you the status of your connection, registration, audio
    and other things.  If there's a problem with the audio, for instance, an icon appears with a tooltip alerting you of
    the trouble.  You can then click the icon to make adjustments to the levels or to visit the configuration
    screen.</p><p>You can fine-tune a number of WengoPhone's features through the configuration dialog.  Click Tools on the menu
    bar, and select Configuration to open the settings window.  In Figure 6, I am using the dialog to enable and
    configure my Webcam.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9540f6.large.jpg"><img src="9540f6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 6.  Use WengoPhone's configuration dialog to enable video support.</p></div></div><p>I mentioned previously that WengoPhone supports instant messaging.  This is a great way to clean up some
    application clutter on your desktop.  If you're using one or more instant messaging clients in addition to a VoIP
    application, Wengo can help you out.  To use WengoPhone as your instant messenger, click Accounts in the
    configuration window's sidebar.  Then, select Add and enter your screen names and passwords for either Jabber/Google
    Talk, MSN, AIM/ICQ or Yahoo.  The configuration dialog also lets you set a call-forwarding address, sounds, language
    or auto-away timeouts.</p><p>To call someone with your WengoPhone, enter a SIP address into the location bar at the bottom (Figure 4,
    again).  Click the green call button, and your party's SIP phone rings.  This could just as easily be a Wengo address
    as an Ekiga address.  To call a standard telephone, enter a plus sign followed by the complete number, including
    country code (where applicable) and area code.</p><p>
    Using WengoPhone, you can send text messages to cell-phone users with the SMS
    feature.  Simply click the SMS icon, and a small composer window appears (Figure 7).  Enter your contact's
    phone number (remember the plus-sign number format) or select it from your address book, then enter your message.  A
    counter lets you know how many characters you have used and how many are available.  When you are done, click Send.
    For people, like your Chef, who avoid text messages because they don't like thumbing, this is a great little
    feature.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="9540f7.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>Figure 7.  Send text messages to your friends without getting your thumbs in a knot.</p></div></div><p>SMS, like calling regular phones of other non-Wengo users, does cost credits, which you can buy directly from
    your WengoPhone, but the price is very reasonable.  In fact, calling the rates inexpensive seems
    unfair&mdash;downright cheap sounds more appropriate.  As I write this, a call from my PC in Ontario, Canada, to
    England is .008 cents (Euro) per minute.  Yes, those are two zeros to the right of the decimal point.</p><p>Directly to the right of your nickname on the status bar, you'll see a counter indicating the amount left in
    your Wengo credits account.  Click the total, and an information window expands below, with a small menu of options.
    One of these is labeled Purchase call out credits.  Click here, and a browser window appears from which you can make
    your purchase or discover rates.</p><p>I fear,
    <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, that closing time is already upon us, with plenty of other VoIP phones left
    uncovered.  Gizmo offers another great softphone rich in features.  Although the Linux client did not yet support
    video at the time of this writing, Gizmo does allow you to record calls (with great sound quality).  It also has
    some amusing features, such as configurable hold music and audio sound effects (for example, rolling thunder or a
    tiger's roar) that you could insert into your calls.  Although it's not as feature-rich as some of the softphones
    covered on today's menu, you also might want to check out KPhone or Linphone.  I'll leave you to explore those when
    you return home, but the clock on the wall is truly insistent.</p><p>Fran&ccedil;ois, kindly refill everyone's glass one more time so that we may raise a toast.  And now,

    <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, raise your glasses and let us all drink to one another's health.
