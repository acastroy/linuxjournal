    the Palm TX, many Treo phones and others.  Although many people are complaining about the difficulty of setting up
    the USB port, this tip doesn't address that particular issue.  Even if you get the USB port working (I use a network
    sync, so it doesn't matter to me), you'll encounter other problems.  For example, in many cases, KPilot copies the
    records from your Palm but erases the records from your Palm in the process.</p><p>At the time of this writing, the good folks at Ubuntu have not yet seen fit to update KPilot.  There's no need
    to wait though.  You can download the latest KPilot, compile and install it yourself.  The version I downloaded works
    fine with my Palm devices.</p><p>You must have the KDE and Qt development libraries to compile KPilot, so you will need to install kde-devel
    at the very least.  You also need cmake, which isn't installed by default in Ubuntu.  You need to install the latest
    version of pilot-link separately as well, and compile it, first.  In this example, I installed pilot-link in
    /usr/local/src/pilot-link-0.12.1.  I also set the following environment variables for my platform (this is optional
    and may not apply to your platform):</p><pre     class="programlisting">export CFLAGS="-march=athlon64 -O2 -pipe"
export CXXFLAGS="${CFLAGS}"
export CPPFLAGS="${CFLAGS}"
export CXX="g++"</pre><p>Here are the commands to download, make and install KPilot:</p><pre     class="programlisting">cd /usr/local/src
svn co svn://anonsvn.kde.org/home/kde/branches/KDE/

cd kpilot
./configure --prefix=/usr --with-pilot-link=/usr/
&#8618;local/src/pilot-link-0.12.1
make -f Makefile.cmake
make -f Makefile.cmake install</pre><p>If you already have KPilot running, you need to exit, and you may even have to kill the d&aelig;mon with the
    command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">killall kpilotDaemon</pre><p>Restart KPilot, and now you should be able to sync without problems.  If you want to keep up to date with the
    latest changes, you can update the source code with the following command (obviously, you need to configure and
    install again afterward):</p><pre     class="programlisting">svn update kpilot</pre><p>&mdash;Nicholas Petreley</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2112580.0x220a500"></a>Linux watch Command</h2></div></div><p>Much open-source software for Linux has good monitoring commands for observing process activity.  Some of the
    commands do not have graphical user interfaces, and in other cases, administrators prefer to use the command line.
    Monitoring the progress of an activity is a continuous task.</p><p>The Linux watch(1) command (
    <a href="http://linux.about.com/library/cmd/blcmdl1_watch.htm" target="_self">linux.about.com/library/cmd/blcmdl1_watch.htm</a>) is a useful tool for monitoring progress.  It
    allows users to run a command and watch the output in a terminal window.  It can execute the monitoring command at
    regular intervals and show differences (option -d) between successive updates.</p><p>Many Amanda (
    <a href="http://amanda.zmanda.com" target="_self">amanda.zmanda.com</a>) users, myself included, use the watch command to observe the Amanda
    backup progress.  The Amanda status command amstatus (
    <a href="http://wiki.zmanda.com/index.php/amstatuscommand" target="_self">wiki.zmanda.com/index.php/amstatuscommand</a>) can be run with the watch command every minute to

    shown in this tip, you need to have PEAR installed along with PHP, and you need to install the Text_Password
    package.  To install the Text_Password package, type:</p><pre     class="programlisting">pear install text_password</pre><p>
      <span   class="bold"><b>The Code:</b></span>
    </p><p>The PHP script that creates the password looks like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
      
&lt;html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Password Example&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;style&gt;
    li {
        font-style: italic;
    }
&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;?php
// require the Text_Password package
// to be included in the page
require_once "Text/Password.php";
?&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Here is a pronounceable password, defaulting
        to 10 characters:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&lt;?php echo Text_Password::create(); ?&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Here are 5 unpronounceable passwords, with
        a length of 15 characters each:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;?php
    $passwords = Text_Password::createMultiple(5,
    15, 'unpronounceable');
    foreach ($passwords as $password) {
    ?&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;?php echo $password; ?&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;?php
    }
?&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

</pre><p>
      <span   class="bold"><b>The Results:</b></span>
    </p><p>When the script is executed, it generates output very similar to that shown here.  Of course, because the
    passwords are generated randomly, your actual results will differ slightly:</p><pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Here is a pronounceable password, defaulting
  to 10 characters:&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Here are 5 unpronounceable passwords, with a

    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

</pre><p>
      <span   class="bold"><b>How It Works:</b></span>
    </p><p>The Text_Password::create() method can be called statically.  It returns a pronounceable password with a
    default length of ten characters, as shown in the output.</p><p>The Text_Password::createMultiple() method, also called statically, can accept parameters that allow you to
    specify how many passwords you want returned, the number of characters in each password and that they be either
    pronounceable or unpronounceable, depending on the desired complexity for the password.  Passwords that are
    unpronounceable have numbers and punctuation marks in them.</p><p>Using the Text_Password package, you quickly can write PHP scripts that allow your application or Web site to
    have the capacity to generate passwords.</p><p>&mdash;Nathan A.  Good and Allan Kent</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2112580.0x220b0b0"></a>Locking Files</h2></div></div><p>This tip comes courtesy of
    <i  >Linux Journal</i> columnist Dave Taylor and No Starch Press.</p><p>Any script that reads or appends to a shared data file, such as a log file, needs a reliable way to lock the
    file so that other instantiations of the script don't step on the updates.  The idea is that the existence of a
    separate lockfile serves as a semaphore, an indicator that a different file is busy and cannot be used.  The
    requesting script waits and tries again, hoping that the file will be freed up relatively promptly, denoted by
    having its lockfile removed.</p><p>Lockfiles are tricky to work with though, because many seemingly foolproof solutions fail to work properly.
    For example, the following is a typical approach to solving this problem:</p><pre     class="programlisting">while [ -f $lockfile ] ; do
  sleep 1
done
touch $lockfile</pre><p>Seems like it should work, doesn't it? You loop until the lockfile doesn't exist, then create it to ensure
    that you own the lockfile and, therefore, can modify the base file safely.  If another script with the same loop
    sees your lock, it will spin until the lockfile vanishes.  However, this doesn't in fact work, because although it
    seems that scripts are run without being swapped out while other processes take their turn, that's not actually
    true.  Imagine what would happen if, right after the done in the loop just shown, but before the touch, this script
    were swapped out and put back in the processor queue while another script was run instead.  That other script would
    dutifully test for the lockfile, find it missing and create its own version.  Then, the script in the queue would
    swap back in and do a touch, with the result that the two scripts both would think they had exclusive access, which
    is bad.</p><p>Fortunately, Stephen van den Berg and Philip Guenther, authors of the popular procmail e-mail filtering
    program, include a lockfile command that lets you safely and reliably work with lockfiles in shell scripts.</p><p>Many UNIX distributions, including Linux and Mac OS X, have lockfile already installed.  You can check whether
    your system has lockfile simply by typing
    <tt  >man 1 lockfile</tt>.  If you get a man page, you're in luck! If not, download the procmail package
    from
    <a href="http://www.procmail.org" target="_self">www.procmail.org</a>, and install the lockfile command on your system.  The script in this
    section assumes you have the lockfile command.</p><p>

      <span   class="bold"><b>Running the Script:</b></span>
    </p><p>Although the lockfile script isn't one that you'd ordinarily use by itself, you can try to test it by having
    two terminal windows open.  To create a lock, simply specify the name of the file you want to try to lock as an
    argument of filelock.  To remove the lock, add the -u option.</p><p>
      <span   class="bold"><b>The Results:</b></span>
    </p><p>First, create a locked file:</p><pre     class="programlisting">$ filelock /tmp/exclusive.lck
$ ls -l /tmp/exclusive.lck
-r--r--r--  1 taylor  wheel  1 Mar 21 15:35
 &#8618;/tmp/exclusive.lck</pre><p>The second time you attempt to lock the file, filelock tries the default number of times (ten) and then
    fails, as follows:</p><pre     class="programlisting">$ filelock /tmp/exclusive.lck
filelock : Failed: Couldn't create lockfile in time</pre><p>When the first process is done with the file, you can release the lock:</p><pre     class="programlisting">$ filelock -u /tmp/exclusive.lck</pre><p>To see how the filelock script works with two terminals, run the unlock command in one window while the other
    window spins trying to establish its own exclusive lock.</p><p>
      <span   class="bold"><b>Hacking the Script:</b></span>
    </p><p>Because this script relies on the existence of a lockfile as proof that the lock is still enforced, it would
    be useful to have an additional parameter that is, say, the longest length of time for which a lock should be
    valid.  If the lockfile routine times out, the last accessed time of the locked file could then be checked, and if
    the locked file is older than the value of this parameter, it safely can be deleted as a stray, perhaps with a
    warning message, perhaps not.</p><p>This is unlikely to affect you, but lockfile doesn't work with NFS-mounted disks.  In fact, a reliable file
    locking mechanism on an NFS-mounted disk is quite complex.  A better strategy that sidesteps the problem entirely is
    to create lockfiles only on local disks.</p><p>Excerpted with permission from the book
