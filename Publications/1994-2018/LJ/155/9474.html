<span   class="bold"><b>Promise</b></span> has released hardware specifications for the full line of chipsets
supported by the <span   class="bold"><b>sata_promise.c driver</b></span>.  This is excellent news, especially
considering that Promise has been reluctant to release any specs until now.
<span   class="bold"><b>Jeff Garzik</b></span> has been negotiating with them on this issue for a while now, and
as this news shows, he has made significant headway.  It's great to see Promise begin
to turn around on this issue.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Karel Zak</b></span> is working toward forking the
<span   class="bold"><b>util-linux project</b></span> or taking it
over from <span   class="bold"><b>Adrian Bunk</b></span>.  Karel maintains the Red Hat package, and Adrian has
not been as active as Karel would like on the project lately.  Karel posted
to the linux-kernel mailing list recently, explaining his plans to create a
git repository and home page for the project and to start merging known
bug fixes into the code base.  His intention is to make the transition as
peaceful as possible and have a good handoff from Adrian.  As <span   class="bold"><b>H. Peter Anvin</b></span>
points out, an outright forking of the code could be the best way toward that
peaceful transition.  As he says, once Adrian sees that Karel is able to do a
good job, he might feel less reluctant to let go of the project.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Mikulas Patocka</b></span> has released an initial
version of <span   class="bold"><b>SpadFS</b></span>, a new filesystem
he created as part of his PhD thesis.  It attempts to solve the problem of
sudden reboots in a simpler way than journalled filesystems.  Mikulas finds
journalling too complex and bug-prone, preferring a method that he calls
crash counting.  In this technique, the filesystem keeps track of whether
it has been mounted or unmounted; it also tags fresh data with this
information, until the data can be written properly into a consistent state.
If the computer crashes and comes back up, the filesystem will notice that
its saved mount state doesn't match its current mount state, and it can then
revert to the most recent consistent state of its data.  SpadFS seems to be
on the fast track to kernel inclusion, with support from <span   class="bold"><b>Linus Torvalds</b></span>, who
has gone so far as to say that it &ldquo;doesn't look horrible&rdquo; to him.
</p><p>
The brand-new <span   class="bold"><b>ext4 filesystem</b></span> has been accepted into the official kernel.
Actually, at its current state of development, it's more just ext3 with some
additional patches, making acceptance a much less difficult prospect than
other filesystems, notably ReiserFS.  But unlike ext3, the ext4 code will
continue to accrue new features and undergo other large changes.  These
large changes were one of the primary reasons why Linus Torvalds insisted
that the developers give the project a new name.  The filesystem, he said,
should be completely trustworthy.  Once stabilization occurs in a filesystem,
he believes that should be the end of it.  Little enhancements and bug fixes
might still be okay, but for larger changes involving greater risk of data
corruption and other problems, a stable filesystem just should not have to
go through that.  This was the motivation behind forking ext2 into ext3, and
probably will be the motivation behind forking ext4 to ext5 in a few years.
</p><p>
Presenting a system's power source to the user via a consistent interface
has not been a high priority in kernel development until recently.  Each
different type of battery has had its own interface into the kernel,
creating a generally hard-to-use mess.  But <span   class="bold"><b>David
Woodhouse</b></span> recently announced
a <span   class="bold"><b>generic battery class driver</b></span>, regularizing the entire interface.  He is
even considering adding an AC power interface to this driver, though there
have been some voices of dissent.  <span   class="bold"><b>Richard
Hughes</b></span>, for instance, feels that
batteries and AC power are sufficiently different to warrant a separate
driver for each.  But as David currently sees it, the two interfaces will be
so similar that there's no point in duplicating a driver for each.  So far,
the debate has not been decided.  Having at least one generic power driver,
however, does seem to have a lot of support among the kernel hackers.

<h2 class="title">Tales of an Asterisk Addict</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Mike Diehl</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #155, March 2007</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
I've been building my Asterisk phone system at home for about a year
and a half now.  I hope that by reading this article, you get an idea
of some of the configurations that can be built with Asterisk and
how each configuration functions, as well as each configuration's
drawbacks.  Asterisk has given me the flexibility to handle incoming
calls in ways that you'd never think possible and to make outgoing
calls more convenient.  For those of you who don't know what Asterisk
is, Asterisk is a software program that can interface with the Public
Switched Telephone Network, PSTN, and provides voice mail, conferencing
and other sophisticated call-handling features, all under your control.
</p><p>
I first got started with Asterisk when I was searching the Web trying to
learn what I could about VoIP.  When I happened upon the Asterisk program,
I couldn't believe it could be everything it was hyped up to be.  Once I
got it installed and configured, I was able to download software that I
could use like a regular telephone, but I could call only other users
on my server.  This was a fun toy, and my young son got a kick out of
hearing his dad's voice on the computer.
</p><p>
As fun as this standalone system was to play with, it wasn't very useful,
so I decided to add an inexpensive interface card to the system that would
allow it to make and receive phone calls over our regular PSTN
phone line.  With this interface card in place, my wife and I were able
to use our computers just like regular telephones.  The computers even
rang when someone called us.  By this time, I was hooked; VoIP was fun!
</p><p>
It was about this time that my wife and I had grown dissatisfied with
our current answering machine, so I configured Asterisk to function in
its place.  As an answering machine, it worked quite well.  My wife and
I were able to put messages into folders, forward them to each other,
and receive our voice-mail messages as e-mail attachments.  As we
both read our e-mail regularly, having our voice mail available from
our e-mail client was very convenient.
</p><p>
People like to have fun with their answering machine
greeting messages, and I'm no different.  Because of Asterisk's flexibility, I was able to do something that couldn't be done with
a conventional answering machine.  My answering machine greeted people
by name! When a call came in, the Asterisk system would answer and play
a recording of me saying &ldquo;Hello&rdquo;.  Then it would use the caller's
caller ID to find a .wav file, 555-1234.wav for example, that contained a
recording of me saying the caller's name.  Then, finally, it would play our
standard greeting.  The result was something like &ldquo;Hello, Tyra Banks, you
have reached my super smart answering machine.  Please leave a
message.&rdquo;
Tyra never actually called me, but I'm sure she's just busy.
</p><p>
It also was nice not to have to get up to see who was calling.  The
Asterisk system was able to send caller-ID information to my MythTV,
which displayed who was calling on our television.  Sending caller-ID
information as a pop-up to my wife's laptop as well as my workstation
was pretty simple.  But what was really nice was having incoming calls
announced over the server's speakers.  We actually were able to hear who
was calling without having to run over to a phone or caller-ID box.  In
hindsight, it sounds rather lazy not wanting to be bothered to get to
a phone to see who's calling.  On the other hand, there are times when
we simply don't want to be bothered.  Why should I get up from the dinner
table to find out who's calling, only to find it's a telemarketer
that I don't want to speak with anyway?
</p><p>
The main problem with the Asterisk system at this point was that
there was a definite disconnect between the Asterisk system and the
&ldquo;real&rdquo; phones in the house.  For example, we weren't able to use our
real phones to check voice mail.  The solution to this problem
was the addition of an Analog Telephony Adapter (ATA).  I chose to buy a
Sipura SPA2002.  The SPA2002 has one Ethernet port, two telephone ports
and speaks the SIP VoIP protocol.  The SPA product line is easy to
configure with a Web browser.  Once the SPA and Asterisk were configured,
I could plug two phones in to the system and dial in and out with them.
</p><p>
Of course, I wanted to make the system as transparent as possible,
so I had to do something a bit different.  I bought a two-line telephone
splitter and plugged both &ldquo;telephone&rdquo; lines from the SPA into the
line one and line two receptacles on the splitter.  Then, I plugged the line
one and two receptacle into the wall, essentially using the splitter as
a joiner.  Now I could use any phone jack in the house, either
line one or line two.  I chose to use line two in the office and line
one everywhere else.  In most houses, if someone is on the phone, no one
else can use the phone.  With this setup, if someone is on the phone on
line one, we simply go to the office and pick up line two to make our
call.  This has proven to be very convenient.
</p><p>
The analog telephones have one minor deficiency.  The only way to know
if you have voice mail waiting for you is to pick up the receiver and
listen for the stutter dial tone.  Of course, being able to receive
voice mail as e-mail attachments is nice, but this situation
is only slightly better than having Qwest's voice-mail service.  Alas,
this minor annoyance didn't improve until I started using standalone
IP telephones, which I describe later.
</p><p>
Once I had gotten the home VoIP system working to our satisfaction,
I decided to make the big jump by cutting our ties to Qwest and
subscribing to a VoIP service instead.  Choosing a provider turned
out to be more difficult than I had expected.  Because I still wanted to
use my Asterisk system for call processing, I was able to eliminate
several providers right away.  Many providers either don't allow you to
use Asterisk or don't support the use of Asterisk with their service.
With something as complex as VoIP, and as important as my home
phone, I really wanted to have support available.  As I researched the
remaining options, I discovered that many VoIP providers won't allow
you to use the service for any commercial calls, including telecommuting
and charitable activities.  These companies don't publicize this type of
policy, but if you read the fine print, you often find that the penalty for
getting busted can be steep.  At this point, I was down to the wholesale
VoIP providers, but this came with the added bonus of being able to get
ridiculously low rates, because the provider isn't providing any call
features and isn't having to manage a voice-mail system.
</p><p>
Finally, I chose to go with a company called Terravon Communications,
although other companies support the use of Asterisk with
their service.  Now that I was essentially my own phone company, this was
when the schooling began.  The first thing to note is that most wholesale VoIP
providers are on a prepaid basis, so if you forget to pay for next month's
service, you get shut off pretty quickly.  The symptoms of failing to
prepay are difficult to diagnose, because you still have a dial tone, but you
can't call anywhere! I also learned, the hard way, that even seemingly
innocuous changes to the Asterisk dial plan can cause major problems.  I
wish I had a dollar for every time I made a late-night tweak to the dial
plan only to wake up the next morning to discover that the phones didn't
work.  Eventually, I learned to test, test, test.
</p><p>
Then there are those rare times that the phones don't work, and you know
you didn't change anything.  After working through the problem,
you decide that the problem must be on the provider's side.  So now
who are you going to call? Well, nobody, because your phones don't work!
Most of your support issues will be handled via e-mail.   This is a mixed
blessing.  On the one hand, it means that you don't get the immediate
satisfaction of talking to a warm body.  On the other hand, it gives
you the opportunity, or obligation, to provide the support staff with
all of the information they need to diagnose the
problem.  I actually have a trouble report template I use
on those rare occasions when I encounter problems on the provider's
side.  I first describe what the problem is.  I confirm that I've made
no changes to my Asterisk, server or firewall configuration since the
last time it worked.  I give a specific example of what I am trying to
do that isn't working, such as providing a phone number or area code that I can't
reach.  Finally, I give them the relevant timestamped log entries from
/var/log/asterisk/messages.  I usually start by truncating the log file
and telling Asterisk to start logging either IAX or SIP debug messages.
Then, I do whatever it takes to repeat the symptoms.  All of the messages
that the servers exchanged, as well as the steps that my Asterisk server
executed are now in the log file, which I send as an attachment to the
tech support staff.  You can save a lot of time by making sure that the
engineers have all of the information they need&mdash;the first time.
</p><p>
One day, I got a call from a coworker who had heard that I had my own VoIP
server.  One of his friends was going to be in Europe for about three
weeks and they wanted to know if I could set him up.  He had a
wireless PDA that ran Windows CE and wanted to know if he could connect
it to my server and use it like a phone to call his friends and family in
the United States, from Italy.  Because this sounded interesting, I agreed
to give it a try.  He installed a copy of SJphone, and I configured it to
talk to my Asterisk server.  Then he went to Europe.  Amazingly, it worked
pretty well! I talked to him for several minutes, and it sounded fine,
though I was a bit jealous to hear that he was sitting in a wireless
cafe in Venice, Italy, while I was sitting in my office.  The whole
experiment cost me only $6 US in line charges, so it was worth it just
for the nerdiness of it.  I shudder to think what it would have cost him to
call home from Europe with a land line, much less what it would cost if
he had tried to use his cell phone.
</p><p>
I was already able to use any phone or computer in the house to make and
receive phone calls, but I wasn't done exploring.  I managed to borrow
a Cisco 7960 IP telephone.  This was a substantial, though temporary,
improvement to our telephone system.  The 7960 is a very attractive,
business-looking phone.  It also features a sharp LCD display that it uses
to display context-sensitive menus as well as caller-ID information.  But
most important for me, it has a bright-red message-waiting indicator
that we can see from across the house.  However, at $300 US, the 7960 isn't
in my budget.
</p><p>
Because the 7960 I had borrowed didn't allow Web-based configuration,
it was a little bit more difficult to configure than the SPA2002.  I
had to create a configuration file that the 7960 downloaded from a TFTP
server, which I also had to install.  Fortunately, example configuration
files are available on the Internet.
</p><p>
Finally, I decided to buy my own IP telephone and chose the Polycom
Soundstream IP501, which I bought at VoipSupply.com for about $180 US.  This
positions the IP501 as a midrange telephone, suitable for either the
office or home.  The IP501 is a nice-looking device, though perhaps not
as attractive as the Cisco device.  It also has a red, blinking,
message-waiting light.  The LCD display seems smaller, but it's functional.  The big plus
with the IP501 is the way it sounds.  Going from the Cisco phone to the
Polycom phone is like going from AM radio to FM; it just sounds better.
</p><p>
The IP501 has a rudimentary Web-based configuration capability, though the
real meat of the device's capability is exposed only via a configuration
file that the device downloads via FTP or HTTP.  Fortunately, the Polycom
Web site contains complete examples of these configuration files as well
as a 166-page Administrator's Guide.
</p><p>
Both the Cisco and Polycom phones feature a two-port switch that allows
you to plug your PC workstation in to the phone, and then plug the phone
in to the network.  In this configuration, the phone will prioritize
the real-time voice traffic over the rest of the network traffic, thus
ensuring that voice quality is as good as it can be.  Also, both devices
are capable of negotiating separate VLANs for both the phone and the
attached PC.  This allows your voice traffic to travel over a separate,
perhaps more secure, network.  The network infrastructure has to support
VLAN negotiation for this to work.
</p><p>
In the year or so that I've been using Asterisk, I've learned a lot
and had a lot of fun.  Starting from a standalone &ldquo;toy&rdquo; system,
I added PC-based softphones.  Later, the system was connected to the
PSTN.  Then, the system was connected to the house phone wiring.  Finally,
I added dedicated IP telephones.  I ended up with a phone system that
rivals those of many large offices.  Each configuration, as well as each
device, has its benefits as well as drawbacks.  They all have their own
unique quirks.  Learning about these quirks is what makes VoIP so much fun.

Manitoba is going open source. And vice versa.
</p><p>
The Manitoba Media Centre is a new &ldquo;Open Source Entertainment
Engineering, Innovation, and Production Research Facility&rdquo; in Winnipeg,
capitalized by a $20 million investment from the Provincial Government
of Manitoba and Linux Media Arts&mdash;a Los Angeles-based media production
company.  The Centre grows out of a trade mission effort between Manitoba
and California.
</p><p>
The Manitoba Media Centre will work on development of multimedia
applications for film, television and the Internet.  It also
will concentrate on the needs of educational institutions and developing
economies.
</p><p>
Michael Collins, CEO of Linux Media Arts, says, &ldquo;Our goal is to leverage
the $20 million into at least a $100 million endowment within 18
months to two years through consulting, product development contracts
and sponsorships.&rdquo; For Linux specifically, he intends to approach
development &ldquo; from the perspective of what is important to multimedia
users.  In other words, tool and applications and kernel changes that
will improve the media experience.  The various distros and the companies
who support them do not have this market specifically in mind.  It's
mainly a support issue.  How best can we support the multitudes of users
worldwide building systems and products for this $1 trillion
market? We think there is room for more.&rdquo;

It's often assumed that putting secret codes in music files to protect

it's not really about that at all.  At heart, digital rights management

We are moving to a world in the 21st century in which the most important
activities that produce occur not in factories and not by individual
initiative but in communities held together by software.  It is the
infrastructural importance of software which is of primary importance in
the move to the post industrial economy....Software provides
alternative modes of infrastructure and transportation that is crucial
in economic terms because the driving force in economic development is
always improvement in transportation....Software is creating roadways
that bring people who have been far from the center of human social life
to the center of that social life....Software can be used to keep
software from being owned.

Now we live in a different world for the first time, all the physics, all
the mathematics, everything of beauty in music and the visual arts, all
of literature can be given to everybody everywhere at essentially zero
marginal cost beyond the cost of making the first copy.
