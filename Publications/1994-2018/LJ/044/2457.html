    Mr. Lasley gives us a handy script tha he created to collect
    system configuration files for one machine and store them on
    another.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2599580.0x26913f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>In issue 39 of <i  >Linux Journal</i> (&ldquo;Is Linux Reliable Enough?&rdquo;, July, 1997),
Phil Hughes writes about down time due to the failure of a hard
disk:
<div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>At some point we had a configuration disk for our
firewall; but when we needed to replace the hard disk, the
configuration disk had vanished. This loss cost hours of work time
and probably a day of uptime. Having a complete backup of
everything, boot disks for all machines, spare cables and disk
drives and other assorted parts can make a big difference in the
elapsed time to deal with a problem.</p></blockquote></div>

</p><p>I've developed a script to simplify the kinds of Linux system
administration difficulties which Mr. Hughes describes. I use the
script on all my Linux systems and feel it would benefit other
system administrators as well as Mr. Hughes.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2599580.0x2691660"></a>The Problem</h2></div></div><p>I've installed Linux on four Intel Pentium-based systems and
seven Intel 486-based systems. All of the 486-based systems had
previously been abandoned because they had neither sufficient
processing power nor sufficient memory for Windows for Workgroups,
Windows 95 or Windows NT, my company's choices for a desktop
operating system. All of these 486-based systems run Linux very
capably.</p><p>I use these Linux systems for network troubleshooting,
testing, research, evaluation, experimentation and program
development. Installing and using Linux in a large corporate
enterprise has helped me learn more about DNS, networking, network
programming, HTML and HTTP, system administration and other aspects
of the Unix environment.</p><p>Although these Linux systems have been extremely useful, the
age and diversity of the equipment involved makes
system-administration tasks difficult at times. Consider the mix of
equipment shown in <a href="2457t1.html" target="_self">Table 1</a>,
&ldquo;Linux Systems and Major Components&rdquo;. (This table also provides a
list of the names of the Linux systems I'll be referring to
throughout this article). The permutations of five computer
vendors, three disk types, seven types of networking cards (the
five NE2000 clones are from three vendors), and four CD-ROM types
create some interesting installation, configuration and
administrative headaches.</p><p>I've encountered other significant, system-administration
difficulties as well:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The various hardware components of these systems
change from time to time as research and evaluation needs
dictate.</p></li><li><p>Because I am trying to win acceptance of Linux
within my organization, I perform most of the system-administration
functions on my own time.</p></li><li><p>None of these systems have a working tape backup
unit.</p></li><li><p>These systems are distributed among three locations
within the Memphis area. All are interconnected via a metropolitan
area network that forms the basis for a method of simplifying
system-administration duties.</p></li></ul></div><p>As if these issues weren't serious enough, soon after
installing my sixth Linux system, its hard disk began failing.
Since the disk was failing slowly, I had time to recover all the
pertinent configuration information to enable me to reinstall and
reconfigure Linux quickly after I replaced the failing disk.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2599580.0x2691c38"></a>The Solution</h2></div></div><p><a href="2457l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a> shows a shell
script I created to ease the chores of maintaining multiple,
disparate Linux systems. The script, which I call
<span   class="bold"><b>collect</b></span>, uses remote shell
commands (<span   class="bold"><b>rsh</b></span>) and remote copy
commands (<span   class="bold"><b>rcp</b></span>) to copy a number of
files (which are described briefly in the &ldquo;Collected Files&rdquo; box)
from a remote Linux system to &ldquo;cuthroat&rdquo;, my primary
system-administration system.</p><p><a href="2457s1.html" target="_self">Collected Files</a></p><p>If I lose any Linux file system (except for cuthroat's), I
don't have to be concerned about losing important configuration
information. As we'll see later, since I propagate all the
collected information on cuthroat to several other systems, I don't
have to worry about losing cuthroat's file system.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2599580.0x2691fa8"></a>Using the Collect Script</h2></div></div><p>After writing and testing the collect script, I created the
/admin directory on cuthroat and moved the script to this
directory. When I wish to collect system-administration information
from a Linux system (barb, for example) and store that information
on cuthroat, I log on to cuthroat and type the following
commands:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cd /admin
collect barb
</pre><p>If the /admin/barb directory doesn't exist, the collect
script creates it, and then begins copying the remote system's
files. In the spirit of UNIX brevity, the only screen output is a
single line:
<pre     class="programlisting">
barb:  copying /proc, .config, lilo.conf, partition info
</pre>


This line, built by several <b  >echo -n</b> command
lines and a final <b  >echo</b> command line, indicates
the progress of the remote operations. Once the collect script
finishes, directory /admin/barb on cuthroat contains a copy of
barb's system-administration files.
</p><p>I could, of course, run collect for an arbitrary number of
systems as follows:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cd /admin
for i in anthrax barb ducktape
do
collect $i
done
</pre><p>After collect executes in the example above, cuthroat's
/admin directory is shown in Figure 1.
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2457f1.jpg"></div>

</p><p>I can run collect on cuthroat to copy cuthroat's own files
(rather than a remote system's files) as shown in the following
example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
logon to cuthroat
cd /admin
collect cuthroat
</pre><p>If cuthroat's .rhost file names itself, the collect script
will execute correctly and copy the collected files into cuthroat's
/admin/cuthroat directory.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2599580.0x2692580"></a>Example 1</h2></div></div><p>If a disk failure were to obliterate one of my machines, the
collected system-administration information would help me reload
Linux with a minimum of confusion and difficulty on the replacement
disk.</p><p>If loyd's disk failed, for example, I would replace the disk
and restore Linux with these steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Reconstruct the partitions from information in
/admin/loyd/fdisk.</p></li><li><p>Reload Linux.</p></li><li><p>Rebuild the kernel from the information in the file
/admin/loyd/kernel.config.</p></li><li><p>File /admin/loyd/lilo.conf contains the information
that the line <b  >append="cdu31a=0x340,5"</b> is
necessary for the proper operation of loyd's ancient CD-ROM
drive.</p></li></ol></div><p>There are, of course, as many deviations from these steps as
there are users of Linux, but the point of showing the steps is to
demonstrate how the collected information is useful in restoring a
Linux system.</p><p>Although the ability to recover from catastrophic errors was
the initial impetus for creating the collect script, the collected
data has a number of other uses as well.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2599580.0x2692b00"></a>Example 2</h2></div></div><p>Recently I needed to add an IBM Token Ring Network 16/4
Adapter to barb. This adapter only works with interrupt request
(IRQ) 2, 3 or 7, so I examined the /admin/barb/interrupt file and
determined that IRQ 3 was unused. Since I had collected this
information remotely and stored it on cuthroat, I established that
barb had an available IRQ without a trip to barb's location and
without logging on to barb. In fact, since barb's information was
stored on cuthroat, I could have located an unused interrupt for
barb even if barb were off-line.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2599580.0x2692c08"></a>Example 3</h2></div></div><p>Suppose I need to inventory some software or hardware
component in each of the various Linux systems. Let's use
networking cards as an example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cd /admin
egrep -i "ne2000|3c|ibm tr" \
        `find . -name interrupts -print`
</pre><p>The egrep command will search the interrupts file in each
Linux system's directory for ne2000 (the NE2000 clones), 3c (3Com
cards), or ibm&nbsp;tr (IBM Token Ring cards) and print all
matching lines in each file.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2599580.0x2689650"></a>Example 4</h2></div></div><p>Several months ago I configured the Enhanced Real Time Clock
(RTC) support into loyd's kernel. Or was it speed's kernel? Could I
have configured RTC support into both kernels? Here's how to tell
which kernels have RTC support:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cd /admin
grep CONFIG_RTC=y \
   `find . -name kernel.config -print`
</pre><p>In a fraction of a second, grep confirms that only loyd has
RTC support:
<pre     class="programlisting">
 ./loyd/kernel.config:CONFIG_RTC=y
</pre>


</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2599580.0x2689860"></a>Example 5</h2></div></div><p>The cuthroat machine has a PC DOS partition. Recently I
booted DOS on cuthroat to configure the autoexec.bat and config.sys
files so that I could use cuthroat's CD-ROM under DOS. The
instructions told me to take one action, if the CD-ROM were
controlled by IRQ 14, and to take a completely different action, if
the CD-ROM were controlled by IRQ 15. Being efficient (or lazy) I
didn't want to turn off cuthroat, rip it open, determine where the
CD-ROM cable plugged into the IDE controller, reassemble it and
turn it on again.</p><p>After pondering a bit, the answer occurred to me: look at a
copy of cuthroat's /proc/interrupt file which was stored on loyd. I
didn't even have to boot Linux on cuthroat. I used a DOS FTP client
to transfer loyd's /admin/cuthroat/interrupts file to the DOS
system on cuthroat. Here are the two relevant lines from that
file:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
14:  9663 + ide0
15:    32 + ide1
</pre><p>IRQ 14 is the first IDE device; at the time the collect
script obtained cuthroat's system-administration information, there
had been 9,663 interrupts on this device. During the same interval,
the second IDE device, attached to IRQ 15, had generated only 32
interrupts. Since I knew cuthroat had only two IDE devices, it was
obvious from the interrupt count that the hard drive was attached
to IRQ 14 and the CD-ROM was attached to IRQ 15.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2599580.0x2689a70"></a>Example 6</h2></div></div><p>As a final example, let's find all the Pentium processors
with Intel's infamous floating-point-division bug:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cd /admin
grep fdiv_bug `find . -name cpuinfo -print`\
         | grep yes
</pre><p>If the Pentium chip in &ldquo;solo&rdquo; had the
floating-point-division bug, then grep would produce the following
output:
<pre     class="programlisting">
 ./solo/cpuinfo:fdiv_bug        : yes
</pre>


</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2599580.0x2689c80"></a>Redundant Copies</h2></div></div><p>Although cuthroat is my primary system-administration site, I
keep the collected files on several systems for redundancy. After
copying the system-administration information from all the Linux
sites to cuthroat, I propagate the collected information from
cuthroat to another system:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
rsh loyd mkdir /admin
rcp -pr /admin/* loyd:/admin
</pre><p>I repeat the rcp for each machine on which I wish to have a
copy of this information.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2599580.0x2689e38"></a>Requirements</h2></div></div><p>Several simple requirements must be satisfied for the collect
script to work:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The first (and most obvious) requirement is that
all systems must be interconnected.</p></li><li><p>Depending on how name resolution is configured, all
system names must be in a Domain Name Server or in each system's
/etc/hosts.</p></li><li><p>Each system needs a properly configured .rhost file
to support remote shell and remote copy operations.</p></li><li><p>And finally, you must configure the /proc file
system in each system's kernel. Note that the kernel build
procedure includes the /proc file system by default.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2599580.0x268a258"></a>Extensions</h2></div></div><p>The collect script can be easily extended if you find that
/proc (or any other directory) contains system-administration
information that is important to you. None of my systems use PPP;
if yours does, modify the collect script to capture your PPP
configuration information.</p><p>Most of my Linux systems run the Apache web server, but I
don't bother to collect any Apache configuration information
because only two lines distinguish one system's configuration from
another. If you're running a web server and you've made a
significant number of configuration changes, you may wish to
collect your web server's configuration data.</p><p>If you are using Linux as a firewall, modify the collect
script to save the firewall configuration. If Mr. Hughes had been
using the collect script, the failure of his firewall's hard disk
might not have cost him &ldquo;hours of work time and probably a day of
uptime&rdquo;.</p><p>Running <span   class="bold"><b>find</b></span> on one Linux
system located about a dozen files with names in the form *.conf.
If you look at your systems closely, you may find additional
configuration files to collect using the collect script.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2599580.0x268a4c0"></a>Security Considerations</h2></div></div><p>All of the Linux systems named in Figure 1 are protected from
the Internet by an industrial-strength firewall. None of these
systems are mission critical. My security considerations are
probably quite different from yours, so you will have to evaluate
whether any information you collect could compromise your systems
and act accordingly.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2599580.0x268a5c8"></a>Conclusions</h2></div></div><p>The collect script simplifies remote system administration of
disparate systems by centralizing configuration information. It is
easy to use and easy to extend. Since the collected file sizes sum
to less than 10KB per system, very little disk storage space is
required. Although I created the collect script to ease recovery
from potential catastrophes, the information obtained by using the
collect script has a number of other uses as well.</p><p><a href="2457s2.html" target="_self">Credits</a></p></div></div>
