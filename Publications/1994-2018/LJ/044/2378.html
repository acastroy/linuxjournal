    The Perforce package goes a long way toward meeting those goals.
    In the sales material, Perforce is said to be, &ldquo;Easier to use
    than Kleenex, runs faster than a red Porsche ...&rdquo; Let's check

when we actually mean software-configuration management systems.
Most of us do have mixed feelings for these systems. We want the
benefits they give us: tracing, branches, stepping back to an old
version and other such options. However, we do not want to pay the
usual price of overhead, complexity and extra work to set up and
use the system. What we really want is a fast, easy-to-understand
system that gives us all the benefits without any of the
grief.</p><p>The Perforce package goes a long way toward meeting those
goals. In the sales material, Perforce is said to be, &ldquo;Easier to
use than Kleenex, runs faster than a red Porsche ...&rdquo; Let's check
if this is a valid claim.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1883580.0x197b9d0"></a>Installation</h2></div></div><p>The Perforce system is a client/server system with just two
binaries. The <span   class="bold"><b>p4</b></span> binary is the
client program. On Linux/Intel the p4 binary is just 55KB. The
server program, <span   class="bold"><b>p4d</b></span>, is just
388KB. These files are the only ones you need. However, it is also
a good idea to get the man pages p4.1 and p4d.1, as well as the
manual (a PostScript file). You can find all of these files at
http://www.perforce.com/.</p><p>The server program, p4d, is started like a daemon and does
not need to be run as root. Personally, I have found it to be a
good idea to create a special user, called
<span   class="bold"><b>Perforce</b></span>, that runs the server
program in its home directory. This user is not necessary, but it
certainly helps to keep the system organized.</p><p>Installing Perforce is easy. First, the client program needs
to be copied to a location that is in the default path (for
example, /usr/local/bin). Then, the server program
<span   class="bold"><b>p4d</b></span> needs to be started by the rc
files at system startup and stopped at system shutdown. The
programs do not require anything special in their
environment.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1883580.0x197bce8"></a>Basic Ideas</h2></div></div><p>Perforce is based on a true networked client/server approach.
To do their work, the client programs connect to a TCP port on the
server. Thus, you only need a TCP route from the client to the
server. There is no need for an NFS-mounted file system.</p><p>The user does all the work (such as editing and compiling) on
local files. These files are kept in syncronization with the server
by a few simple p4 commands.</p><p>Each user of Perforce is a client and has a client view that
is stored in the server. The client view is used by the server to
determine which files in the server database the client wants and
what local names the client wants for those files. The client view
can be changed using the <span   class="bold"><b>p4 client</b></span>
command. The server's database of files is called the &ldquo;depot&rdquo; in
Perforce.</p><p>An interesting idea in Perforce is the notation of a change.
A new numbered change is created each time you submit one or
several files. For example, a bug-fix might require you to edit
several files. By submitting these files together as a single
change, you record the fact that the editing made in these files
corresponds to a single change to the system. The changes have
descriptions, and you can enter a text description of what you have
changed and why. Changes are numbered so that a newer change always
has a higher number.</p><p>You can identify a version of a file in 3 ways with
Perforce:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>You can say foo.c#version, where version is a
file-specific version number.</p></li><li><p>You can also say foo.c@change, where change is a
depot-wide change number. foo.c@115 is a valid identifier even if
foo.c was only changed at change 110 and 120. In this case,
foo.c@115 refers to the version of foo.c that was changed in change
110, i.e., the version of foo.c that was valid the moment change
115 was submitted.</p></li><li><p>As with many other systems Perforce has labels.
Thus, the third way of identifying a version is foo.c@label.</p></li></ol></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1883580.0x197c210"></a>Ease of Use</h2></div></div><p>The normal work with Perforce is done by the following
commands:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>p4 add</b></span> informs
Perforce that a local file in your work area is to be added to the
files in the depot. <span   class="bold"><b>p4 add</b></span> only
registers your intention to add the file, the actual adding is done
by the command
<b  >p4 submit</b>.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>p4 edit</b></span> is used to
open an existing file for editing&mdash;the p4d server is informed that
you are going to edit the file. On many other systems this process
is called checking-out. Changes are actually made by the
<b  >p4 submit</b> command.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>p4 submit</b></span> does the
actual work for the previous two commands.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>p4 get</b></span> is used to
get a file from the depot to the local workspace.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>p4 revert</b></span></p></li></ol></div><p>In addition to the normal commands for editing, there is a
fair number of reporting commands such as
<b  >p4 describe</b> to learn more
about a change, and
<b  >p4 filelog</b> to list the
history of a file. All of these commands are easy and intuitive to
use. There is also a <b  >p4 help</b>
command, as well as the man page.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1883580.0x197cb00"></a>Branches</h2></div></div><p>One of the particularly strong points of Perforce is the way
it handles branches, called &ldquo;inter-file branching&rdquo;.</p><p>On many other systems the branch specification is in some way
part of the version numbering or version selection mechanism. This
is counter intuitive and is often a cause of confusion. Other
systems also make branches of individual files.</p><p>Perforce handles branch naming in the same way that you would
without a code-management system. In Perforce, the directory
my_project/new_branch/ contains the new branch of
my_project/old_branch. By making the branch naming a part of the
directory tree structure, Perforce has created a very natural way
to interact with and think about branches.</p><p>In this way a branch is simultaneously created for the
complete project, not just for an individual file. This method also
helps to keep the branches consistent. A copying algorithm in the
server prevents this approach from using more disk space than other
approaches.</p><p>Above, I have described the normal use of the Perforce
branching mechanism. However, the Perforce branching mechanism is
even more powerful. It is possible to specify that file trees or
individual files are branches of each other. It is even possible to
designate two totally unrelated files or directory trees as
branches and migrate changes between them.</p><p>The specification of branches is done by a branch view. The
branch view can contain a simple or arbitrarily complex mapping
between file names in the two branches.</p><p>Perforce uses the powerful command
<b  >p4 integ</b> and
<b  >p4 resolve</b> to integrate
changes between the branches and to resolve conflicts.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1883580.0x1d75118"></a>Speed</h2></div></div><p>Perforce is a very fast, code-management system.
Code-management actions, such as labelling, checking in
(<b  >P4 submit</b>) and checking out
(<b  >p4 edit</b>) are several
magnitudes faster than ClearCase, another code-management
system.</p><p>With Perforce, all normal work such as editing and compiling
is done on local files in your work area, making Perforce much
faster than most other systems.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1883580.0x1d75328"></a>Advanced Use</h2></div></div><p>Perforce has a number of advanced features. I cannot list all
of them (much less describe them all) in this space, but I will
mention a few.</p><p>Perforce can have distributed depots. You can run Perforce
over WANs, and you can even run it encrypted over the Internet. You
can use Perforce with IP-tunneling and firewalls. Perforce can have
change submission triggers for external processes.</p><p>Perforce has support for off-line clients. That is, it is
possible to disconnect a client computer and make changes to the
local files in the workspace, and afterwards let Perforce detect
the changes and bring them into the depot.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1883580.0x1d754e0"></a>Licensing</h2></div></div><p>You can download all of Perforce, except the license file,
from ftp://ftp.perforce.com/. The license file determines how many
users the server accepts. Without a license file, there can be only
2 users. The cost of purchasing Perforce (i.e., the license file)
is $500US/user. If you purchase Perforce, they e-mail the license
file to you. Perforce has announced:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Non-commercial users of Free-BSD and LINUX may
obtain Perforce servers supporting an unlimited number of end users
gratis. This includes upgrades, but not support. Execution of a
Perforce non-commercial license agreement is required.</p></blockquote></div><p>Answering a direct question, Christopher Seiwald of Perforce,
said:
<div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>We cannot guarantee non-commercial users support,
but we try not to discriminate between commercial users, evaluation
users and non-commercial users.</p></blockquote></div>

Perforce is available for Linux x86 and Linux Alpha, as well as for
Free-BSD and many commercial systems.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1883580.0x1d757a0"></a>Support</h2></div></div><p>Perforce has provided excellent support to me. No matter how
absurd the question or how absurd the task I am attempting, I have
always received a good answer by e-mail within 18 hours. Perforce
has remarkably good e-mail support. I have asked other customers of
Perforce on the Net, and they have all been pleased.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1883580.0x1d758a8"></a>Conclusions</h2></div></div><p>I have used Perforce both professionally (see &ldquo;MYDATA's
Industrial Robots&rdquo;, <i  >LJ</i> Issue 39, July 1997)
and as a home-hobby programmer. I find Perforce to be a good
product with good support. I find other CM products that I have
used professionally to be remarkably poor by comparison.</p><p>Perforce is not just a technically good product&mdash;it is also
easy and intuitive to use. Considering the favorable licensing
policy of Perforce, I recommend you download Perforce and test it
for yourself.</p></div></div>
