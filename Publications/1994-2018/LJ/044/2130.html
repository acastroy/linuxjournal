    Here is how the U.S. military is using Linux to save you
    money.
    </p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2130f1.jpg"></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xfe1580.0x10d95b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>As the Army's demand for real-time,
battle-command information increased, computer systems became more
complex, expensive and unwieldy. To counter the proliferation of
single-use systems, the Army's Battle Command Laboratory
(http://cacfs.army.mil/) at Fort Leavenworth entered into a rapid
prototyping agreement with Mystech Associates to design a new
Maneuver Control System for the Army.</p><p>Maneuver Control System/Phoenix (MCS/P) was approved by the
Department of the Army in November 1995 to be issued to Army units
for training and feedback. While not the final answer, it is the
best system available for providing interoperation between the
Army's &ldquo;command and control&rdquo; computer systems. In January 1996,
MCS/P was used successfully by the 4th Infantry Division and III
Corps in a Battle Command Training Program Warfighter exercise.
MCS/P is currently in use in Bosnia and other theaters around the
world.</p><p>MCS/P and its sister intelligence system, ASAS Warlord
Notebook, share the same underlying code and provide the military
with the applications shown in the &ldquo;Applications&rdquo; box.</p><p><a href="2130s1.html" target="_self">Applications</a></p><p>Originally developed to run on Sun SPARC 20s, MCS/P and
Warlord Notebook have been successfully ported to Linux systems by
Mystech. Porting these applications to Linux provided a
cost-effective solution to employing these systems on a large
scale. The tactical version (hardened and ruggardized) of the SPARC
20 costs the U.S. taxpayer approximately $48,000.00 per machine;
the non-tactical or commercial system about $18,000.00. The
commercial Pentium 166 machines running the Linux port cost
approximately $3,000.</p><p><a href="2130f2.jpg" target="_self">Figure 1</a></p><p>The National Guard Bureau realized the benefits and
importance of training its commanders and their battle staffs to
operate effectively and efficiently in this information-rich
environment. The Leader Development Center (LDC) was given the task
of developing and implementing procedures to infuse these systems
and technologies into the National Guard. In September 1996, the
LDC established a training site at its Fort Leavenworth facility
and issued Linux systems to the National Guard's 34th and 38th
Divisions. These two divisions will use Phoenix and Warlord
Notebook during their 1997 Battle Command Training Program
Warfighter exercises at the LDC.</p><p>Phoenix and Warlord Notebook provide National Guard
commanders at multiple echelons with enhanced situational awareness
and a relevant common picture of the battlefield overlaid on
digital maps. These two systems provide the commander
near-real-time combat information over battlefield communications
from their battle staffs, subordinate commanders and intelligence
assets.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xfe1580.0x10d99d0"></a>System Operation</h2></div></div><p><a href="2130s2.html" target="_self">Systems</a></p><p>The software systems are comprised of government owned, GNU
licensed and other freely distributed software. The current X
Window System is XFree86. To a Linux purist the file structure is
wrong. Since the official platform to run these applications is the
tactical SPARC, the file structure mirrors that of the SPARC. While
confusing at first, this change eliminates the problems caused by
operating on multiple systems with different file-system structures
and simplifies file transfers.</p><p>Each computer has both Phoenix and Warlord Notebook
installed, and is its own mail host and web server. The user ID of
the individual using the system determines which application system
is started.</p><p>Military operations are map and graphic intensive. Instead of
paper maps, digital map products from the National Imagery and
Mapping Agency (http://www.nima.mil/) are used. To reduce the
bandwidth required for communication, full digital maps reside on
each system. The only map or graphic material actually transmitted
are the geo-referenced graphics. Geo-referencing allows the
re-scaling of maps and graphics without loss of clarity or the
danger of graphics being out of position. (See
<a href="2130f3.jpg" target="_self">Figure 2</a>)</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xfe1580.0x10d9c90"></a>Map with Maneuver Graphics</h2></div></div><p>Information on friendly and enemy unit activities and
locations is loaded into the system at the first point of
observation or occurrence and is then sent throughout the network.
Once entered, the data does not have to be re-entered anywhere
along the network. The user is unaware that the majority of
information is sent using normal e-mail. He clicks on the operation
that he needs to be accomplished, e.g., send updated unit
locations, and the system queries the appropriate data bases,
prepares the message and sends it.</p><p>Operations orders are centered around the maps and maneuver
graphics. Now, instead of taking the graphics, converting them to
words, transmitting the words which are then converted back into
graphics on the receiving end, the information is sent as graphics
with a minimum of words. An ingenious use of HTML and CGI provides
the capability to build complex operations orders with full
graphics and map references. Then, with CGI, these orders are
available to be either pushed or pulled throughout the
network.</p><p>A collaborative white board is built in. This provides the
commander with a rapid means to clarify his points or make
last-minute changes.</p><p>One of the most perplexing problems in data entry on tactical
systems used to be that the user had to know a myriad of archaic
formats and had to enter those formats as text. Phoenix and Warlord
Notebook uses simple fill-in-the-blank forms and lets the computer
figure out where the &ldquo;/&rdquo; and &ldquo;.&rdquo; characters should be placed.

a networked suite of twelve student systems and one instructor
system. A 42-inch Mitsubishi monitor allows the students to easily
follow the instructor.</p><p><a href="2130s3.html" target="_self">LDC Classes</a></p><p>The classes are kept small, with two instructors for twelve
students. The students who attend training at the LDC are the key
staff and trainers for their division. Our low student-faculty
ratio ensures that the students master the concepts and skills
required to successfully use these systems with their home units.
The student success rate has been extremely high. Some of those who
have attended are currently using Linux on their home or business
systems or, are systems administrators on Unix or other
systems.</p><p>Using equipment and software provided by the Leader
Development Center, each division has established its own training
facility and program. The experience from these division training
programs is providing the basis for fine tuning the LDC program for
implementation in the other National Guard Divisions.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xfe1580.0x10da2c0"></a>Future</h2></div></div><p>The use of Linux has accelerated the development and issuance
of computer systems to the National Guard and U.S. Army. The
decreased cost of hardware and software actually makes the systems
affordable. Without Linux, these complex and important systems
would not be available.</p></div></div>
