    Where is &ldquo;Stop the Presses&rdquo;?
    Well, that's the confession.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2173580.0x226b138"></a></h2></div></div><p>Where is &ldquo;Stop the Presses&rdquo;? Well,
that's the confession. When we begin layout of an issue of
<i  >LJ</i>, we reserve a page for &ldquo;Stop the
Presses&rdquo;. Although we usually have some ideas, the news for STP
has to happen in that one week between our regular deadline and the
STP deadline&mdash;this month it just didn't happen. Unlike the
supermarket tabloids, we decided to confess instead of just making
something up and printing it. Hence this editorial.
</p><p>Last month I talked about Linux going mainstream. This
morning I received my ballot to vote for the Board of Directors of
UniForum, a Unix trade association. There are five members on the
Board and ten candidates. Two of those candidates are Linux people:
Jon Hall and Bob Young. I voted for both. Having two members on the
board is another good way to get Linux integrated into the greater
Unix community.</p><p>As I write this, the Linux community is preparing for the
Comdex show in Las Vegas. Our own Carlie Fairchild is in charge of
working with Linux International members and the Linux community as
a whole to have a serious Linux presence at the show. At this point
the Linux pavilion includes twelve vendors. With an expected
attendance of 250,000, this show will definitely be a great
opportunity to get the word out about Linux.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2173580.0x226b348"></a>On to Systems Administration</h2></div></div><p>The focus of this issue is Systems Administration. In the
traditional Unix community, systems administration is generally
done by an elite group of individuals. This isn't necessarily bad
as the average user shouldn't have to be concerned with hard
drives, processor interrupts and Ethernet cables. After all,
computers are just tools.</p><p>There are two reasons that systems administration is more
integrated into the domain of the average user in the Linux
community. First, many of the community members are running
stand-alone computers with PPP connections to the Internet or work
in small companies where there is no full-time systems
administration talent.</p><p>The second reason is that many Linux systems are customized
to fit the requirements of a particular company or even embedded
into a product. For example, Schlumberger is using Linux in a
point-of-sale system [&ldquo;Highway POS System&rdquo; by Marc L. Allen,
November 1997]. The user of this system is a convenience store
clerk, but the people who have worked on developing the
applications software are also involved in the operating
system.</p><p>The result of this integration is that there are more people
working on systems administration tools and issues with Linux than
in traditional Unix environments. Thus, more issues are raised, and
more tools are created.</p><p>If you look at the Usenet newsgroups that cover Linux you
will continue to see posts discussing configuration issues,
selection of the best installation methods and other systems
administration issues. This open discussion is what has made
distributions like Caldera, Craftworks, Debian and Red Hat evolve.
The developers get a chance to see real systems administration
issues raised and then create solutions they consider to be the
best way of dealing with them.</p><p>The features in this issue address setting up Linux as a
proxy server, user administration, dealing with pluggable
authentication modules and systems information retrieval. Other
articles focus on RAID disks, tracking system disk usage and an
article on teaching systems administration. Whether you are that
person at home with a Linux system or a systems administrator at a
huge multi-national corporation, there should be something here to
interest you&mdash;you may even learn something new.</p><p>Jump in, take a look and then let us know what you want to
see next year, as we intend to offer an annual systems
administration issue.</p></div></div>
