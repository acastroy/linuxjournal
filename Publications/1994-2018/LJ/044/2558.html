the two processors but I can't tell if Linux (Kernel 2.0.27) uses
both processors. How do I make Linux use its SMP features?</p><p>&mdash;Jon Bishop Red Hat 4.1</p><p>To take advantage of SMP you'll need to recompile your kernel
to use both processors. First make sure the kernel-source RPM is
installed. Then go to /usr/src/linux and edit the Makefile. You'll
find a line that looks like:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# SMP = 1
</pre><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Uncomment that line by removing the hash symbol.
Then build a kernel as you normally would (see the Kernel HOWTO at
http://sunsite.unc.edu/LDP/ for more information).</em></span>

giving me an error message that reads:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
gcc: internal compiler error 11.
</pre><p>Please tell me what this could mean.
</p><p>&mdash;Joe Ortiz Slackware 2.0.30</p><p>It very likely has something to do with your hardware
configuration. There is a web server dedicated to the signal 11

installed on the computer's motherboard. Signal 11 is the Segment
Violation error which generally occurs when a program's pointers go
awry.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>gcc</b></span> is
a stable enough program that this should not occur during a simple
compile, but it does use memory heavily, and Linux (or any Unix) is
quite sensitive to bad memory.</p><p>It is also possible that a library file on your system is
corrupt or incompatible with other libraries. If, however, this was
the case, you should see problems in other programs as well.
Library corruption should only happen if you have recently
installed new libraries or modified your existing system
libraries.</p><p>&mdash;Chad Robinson, Senior Systems Analyst BRT Technologies,

I have plenty of unpartitioned space available.</p><p>&mdash;Casey Woodrum Red Hat 4.2</p><p>The only trick with mixing Linux and NT is configuring the
boot process. Linux will install as usual, but you may need to fix
up the boot setup by hand once the installation is finished. Assume
NT is on partition /dev/sda1 and you install Linux on partition
/dev/sda2. Try to be sure your Linux partition is a primary
partition on a cylinder less than 1024. This isn't necessary, but
it simplifies things.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>You should use Microsoft's master boot record
instead of LILO. Do</em></span> not install LILO onto the master
boot record of the hard disk. NT will crash dump in most cases with
LILO as the master boot record. With all this in mind, take the
following steps:</p><p>1. Edit the /etc/lilo.conf file so that:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
boot=/dev/sda2
</pre><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>is the first line. Selecting /dev/sda2 as the
target for LILO during installation should have done this for
you.</em></span>
</p><p>2. Add an entry to boot NT at the end of lilo.conf:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
other = /dev/sda1
label = nt
</pre><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>If the installation program is smart enough, you
should be able to configure this during installation.</em></span>
</p><p>3. Run LILO to install the new lilo boot
configuration.</p><p>4. Reboot into NT. Use FDISK under NT to mark partition 2
(/dev/sda2) as active. You should get LILO on reboot. From the LILO
boot prompt, you can type <b  >nt</b> to get the NT boot
loader.</p><p>If the installation process doesn't configure LILO correctly,
you may need to boot Linux from floppy and edit the files on the
hard disk from floppy.</p><p>&mdash;Larry M. Augustin, VA Research lma@varesearch.com</p><p>An undocumented FDISK parameter can help you out of tight
spots if you create trouble on your disk. Run:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
fdisk /mbr
</pre><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>to restore the master boot record on your boot
drive. This will remove LILO, allowing you to use Windows NT if you
somehow cause trouble during the installation process.</em></span>

Connection</h2></div></div><p>I cannot get a second PPP connection to work correctly. I
used the X Window tool <span   class="bold"><b>netcfg</b></span> to
set up ppp0 to connect with the University of South Florida. This
setting seems to work properly, connecting and disconnecting fine.
Then, I set up ppp1 to connect to Compuserve. This appears to
connect okay, but I cannot shut down the modem without shutting
down my Linux PC. When I look at the system messages file, I see
that the scripts start out using ppp1 settings for the connection
but once PPP is started it says it is connected to ppp0. I also see
that ppp0 registers with the kernel and not ppp1 as it should. I
have tried to figure out the various scripts involved but can't
make heads or tails of them. I am new to Linux and don't understand
the BASH scripting language well. Help.</p><p>&mdash;Mike Richards Red Hat 4.2</p><p>Red Hat's PPP number assignment scheme is broken. Their
scripts don't guarantee that ppp1, labeled in the setup utilities,
will be activated in the kernel as ppp1. This happens because PPP
connections are assigned dynamically. Although you may have defined
ppp1 in the Red Hat configuration utility, that setup will be
registered as ppp0 inside the kernel if it is the only PPP
connection active.</p><p>I need a little more detail about your setup to suggest the
best fix to your problem, but here's how the scripts work under Red
Hat. This may give you enough information to work out a
solution.</p><p>The file /etc/rc.d/init.d/network is run at boot time with
the argument &ldquo;start&rdquo;. It looks for configuration files of the
form ifcfg* in the /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ directory. As a
result, if you edit (as is common when not running X) one of those
files with an editor that creates a backup file (e.g.,
ifcfg-eth0~), the Red Hat scripts will run the backup file as well
as the new file. For each connection type (Ethernet, PPP, PLIP,
etc.), there are &ldquo;up&rdquo; and &ldquo;down&rdquo; files that start and stop the
connection. The network script runs the &ldquo;up&rdquo; script with the
appropriate ifcfg file as an argument, e.g.,
/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifup-ppp
/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-ppp0.</p><p>There is a corresponding &ldquo;down&rdquo; script to shutdown the
connection called /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifdown-ppp
/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-ppp0.</p><p>You can run these scripts from the command line for testing
purposes.</p><p>&mdash;Larry M. Augustin, VA Researchl mai@varesearch.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c61580.0x1d5a528"></a>My Mouse Won't Work</h2></div></div><p>My new system came with a new Microsoft Mouse. This mouse
