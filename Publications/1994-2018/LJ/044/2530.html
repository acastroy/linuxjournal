    This second article in the series introduces us to the basic
    features of the GIMP, a Linux power tool for the graphics
    artist.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x254e580.0x26465b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>Last month, in the first of this
four-part series on the GIMP, we took a quick tour around the
GIMP's installation and system requirements. This month we'll cover
a few basics about how the GIMP works, which types are included and
how they are used, and a bit about supported file formats. This
information is somewhat condensed, and you may wish to read through
it once, then read it again as you begin playing with the GIMP and
its windows.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x254e580.0x26466b8"></a>How Does the GIMP work?</h2></div></div><p>The GIMP is a raster graphics tool, meaning that it operates
on images as collections of individual points called
<span   class="emphasis"><em>pixels</em></span>. Each pixel is made up of a number of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>channels</em></span>. The number of channels depends on
the image type being processed. For example, RGB (and RGBA) images
consist of four <span   class="emphasis"><em>channels</em></span>, one each for levels
of Red, Green and Blue and one called the Alpha channel which is
used to determine the transparency for a pixel. Transparency for
individual pixels becomes important when working with
<span   class="emphasis"><em>layers</em></span>. Layers are a feature of the GIMP which
permit an artist to create pieces of an image separately; the
pieces can be manipulated on their own without affecting the rest
of the image. This is useful, for example, when creating cover art
for a magazine or CD. The image on the cover of the November issue
of <i  >Linux Journal</i> had many layers. The text for
the word &ldquo;Graphics&rdquo; is made up of 4 layers, each combined with
the layer below in a different way to create the final 3D effect.
We'll talk about layers in more depth next month, when we cover the
Image Window in Part 3 of this series.</p><p>The GIMP supports three types of image formats: RGBA,
Grayscale and Indexed. RGBA was described in the previous
paragraph. RGB images are just like RGBA except they do not contain
an Alpha channel. Grayscale images are similar to RGBA images
except they only function with one channel&mdash;Gray&mdash;that allows
varying levels of gray from black to white. Indexed images use a
color palette to determine which colors are available, and each
pixel's color is represented by an index value into that palette.
For example, a value of 112 for a pixel means that the pixel will
be the color specified by the 112th entry in the color palette.
Each channel of an RGBA image uses 8 bits, allowing for 256 shades
of each channel's color or transparency level. The grayscale
channel uses 24 bits, supplying about 16 million shades of gray.
Indexed images use 8 bits to define the color palette index,
meaning a color palette consists of 256 unique colors.</p><p>Most processing work should be done in RGB (note that the
GIMP usually refers to RGBA simply as RGB) or Grayscale modes to
allow greater flexibility. Some image file formats, most notably
the GIF format, save images as indexed images. If you open a GIF
file for processing with the GIMP, you should consider first
converting it to RGB. Afterwards, if a GIF file is required (say,
for use on a web page), you can convert the image back to indexed.
Conversion of image formats from within the GIMP is done using the
Image Window menus, which we'll discuss at length next
month.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x254e580.0x2646a28"></a>GIMP Windows</h2></div></div><p>When you start the GIMP, you'll find it provides a single,
small window with a set of buttons, called the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Toolbox</em></span>. The Toolbox is the starting point for
creating images and is made up of a menu bar, the tool buttons and
the foreground/background color block. If you are familiar with
Adobe Photoshop then the look and feel of the Toolbox should be
quite familiar to you. Figure 1 shows the default Toolbox
configuration.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2530f1.jpg"></div><p>The GIMP provides a number of other windows with which you
should become familiar. The first is the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Image
Window</em></span>, in which an image is displayed. There can be
more than one of these windows open at a time. You can open the
default Image Window by placing the cursor over the Toolbox and
typing <b  >ctrl-N</b> (N is for New Window). A small
dialog box will open that allows you to specify some parameters for
this new window. Accept the defaults for now so that you can see an
example Image Window. These windows display an image as it will
look in its final form based upon the layers that are currently
marked as visible. Image Windows are resizeable and scrollable. It
is possible, through the use of zooming features, to have an image
that is larger than the display area of an Image Window as well as
an image which is smaller than the display area.</p><p>Image Windows are made up of a number of smaller window
features: rulers, menus and scrollbars. The rulers, along with
their <span   class="emphasis"><em>guides</em></span>, provide a convenient method for
determining location and size of areas of the image. All image
windows have rulers on the left and top sides of the window,
although these can be turned off using one of the pop-down
menus.</p><p>The pop-down menus in the Image Window are not obvious&mdash;you
have to hold down the right mouse button while the cursor is in the
Image Window to open the menus (opening a menu is also known as
&ldquo;posting&rdquo; the menu). These menus contain a wealth of options for
viewing, selecting and manipulating the image. While many of the
options are available directly from the Toolbox, many others, like
the plug-in filters, are only directly accessible from pop-down
menus. You'll probably want to familiarize yourself with the layout
of these menus, since you'll be using them quite often.</p><p>The scrollbars appear on the right side and the bottom of the
Image Window. They are used to move the image around the display
area when the full image cannot be displayed within the current
width and height of the window.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x254e580.0x2646ef8"></a>Dialog Windows</h2></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2530f2.jpg"></div><p>Along with Image Windows, users will find that they interact
repeatedly with various dialog windows. These windows open and
close based on user input. For example, selecting New from the File
menu in the Toolbox opens the dialog for creating a new Image
Window. Most filters (features which manipulate all or part of an
image) use dialogs to allow specifying parameters. Some dialogs
require user action to close them; others are informational only
and close automatically when they finish their work. An example of
an informational dialog is the dialog box that shows the status of
a filter operation. This dialog shows a scale that fills from left
to right to represent the amount of the selected area that has been
filtered.</p><p>There are a number of dialogs in the GIMP; a list of these
dialogs is in the &ldquo;Dialog Windows&rdquo; box.</p><p><a href="2530s1.html" target="_self">Dialog Windows</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x254e580.0x2647210"></a>Cursors</h2></div></div><p>The GIMP uses a number of different cursors to identify what
can be done in different portions of the image when using different
tools. A cross-hair cursor is used by the Selection tools. This
cursor is also used by the Color Picker, Bucket and Blend tools. A
double-crosshair is used by the Crop tool. A pair of curved,
point-to-tail arrows is used for the Transform tool. A two-pointed
arrow (arrowheads on both ends) is used for the Flip tool. The Text
tool uses the traditional I-beam cursor. The Move tool uses two
two-pointed arrows, one pointing left/right and one pointing
up/down. All other tools use a pencil cursor.</p><p>The cursor type also depends on whether a section of the
image has been selected or not. For example, if a section of the
image has been selected, and the cursor is placed over that
selection then the cursor looks like the Move tool cursor. This is
because the Selection tools permit a selected area to be moved
without having to change tools to the Move tool. Note that only the
selection moves&mdash;the non-selected region stays where it is. For
many of the tools the cursor will be the traditional diagonal arrow
over the image until the cursor is moved into a selected region. It
takes a little work to become familiar with the currently active
function based on the look of the cursor, but once you've worked
with the GIMP for a short time they will become second nature to
recognize.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x254e580.0x2647370"></a>Opening/Saving Files</h2></div></div><p>Now that we've introduced the basic layout of the application
we can start to look in depth. Beginning with file input and
output, you have the option of starting with a blank new image or
opening an existing image. In either case, you select the File
pull-down menu from the Toolbox's menu bar. In this menu you'll
find 5 options: New, Open, About..., Preferences and Quit. The
About... option opens a little window that gives credit to the
authors of various pieces of the GIMP. The Preferences option is
used to set the visual cues used for transparent regions of images
as well as the number of levels of undo. Keep in mind that setting
higher levels of undo can use up significant amounts of memory.
Changes to this setting are applicable to the current session
only&mdash;they are not saved between GIMP sessions. There is an undo
level option in the gimprc file, if you wish to make permanent
changes. Finally, the Quit option does the obvious&mdash;it exits the
program.</p><p>The New option opens a dialog that allows the user to select
the dimensions of a new Image Window. The image type (RGB or
grayscale) and the type of background to use are also selectable.
Figure 3 shows the New Image dialog box. As with many options in
the GIMP, you can also open a new window using keyboard
accelerators. For a new Image Window, place the cursor over any
GIMP window and type <b  >ctrl-N</b>.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2530f3.jpg"></div><p>Opening an existing image is similar to opening a new Image
Window. The dialog box presented is the File Selection dialog,
which enables you to change directories and select individual files
for opening. If you've ever used a Motif or Windows-based
application, you will be familiar with the way the File Selection
window is used. Like the New option, the Open option can be
accessed through the keyboard. Place the cursor over any GIMP
window and type <b  >ctrl-O</b> to open an existing
image.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x254e580.0x26476e0"></a>Supported File Formats</h2></div></div><p>In order to open an existing image, you must be familiar with
the file formats supported by the GIMP. Raster images can be saved
in a large variety of formats, each suitable for various functions.
The GIMP supports all of the more popular formats such as GIF, JPEG
and TIFF, and a few lesser-known formats. The GIMP Plug-In API, a
programming interface allowing users to add extensions to the GIMP,
enables the list of supported formats to be extended. All that is
necessary is for a user to write a plug-in to handle the reading
and writing of the new format.</p><p>The list of raster formats supported in the default
distribution for reading and writing includes those shown in the
&ldquo;Raster Formats&rdquo; box.</p><p><a href="2530s2.html" target="_self">Raster Formats</a></p><p>PostScript output is used in conjunction with a Print
Plug-In. This plug-in is not in my distribution, but it will most
likely be part of the basic package by the time this article
reaches the newsstand.</p><p>Four GIMP-specific formats are also supported&mdash;GBR, HEADER,
PAT and XCF. GBR is the format used for brushes, so that you can
create a simple image and save it as a new brush quite easily. The
HEADER format is used internally for the buttons in the Toolbox.
PAT files hold the patterns used for Bucket Fills and other fill
operations. XCF is the format used to save layer information. While
you are working on an image, you should periodically save it as an
XCF image so that, if necessary, you can load it again in the
future with all the layer information intact.</p><p>Saving images can be a little complicated. For example, if
you try to save an image as a TIFF file you might find that only
part of the image gets saved. When specifying any format other than
XCF, the GIMP will save only the currently active layer unless you
<span   class="emphasis"><em>flatten</em></span> or <span   class="emphasis"><em>merge</em></span> the
visible layers of the image. If you save the image using the XCF
format (even without first flattening or merging the layers), all
of the layers will be saved. The moral here is simple&mdash;save your
images frequently as XCF files, and you won't lose any data.</p><p>Some file formats are meaningful only with certain image
formats. An RGB image contains more information about an image than
the GIF format holds, so RGB images cannot be saved in the GIF
format. If you wish to save the image as a GIF, the image must
first be converted to an <span   class="emphasis"><em>indexed</em></span> format. To
accomplish this, flatten the layers (done via the Image menu's
layers<b  >-&gt;</b>flatten option), click the right
mouse button over the image to drop down the image menus and select
image<b  >-&gt;</b>indexed. The image is converted and is
now ready to save as a GIF file. Note that converting from RGB to
GIF means that some of the information in the original image may be
lost, although the loss may not be visible. If you wish to enlarge
or resize the image later, you should first save the flattened
image as a TIFF file. Later you can convert it to an indexed image
and re-save it as a GIF file. You might want to do this when
working with web page graphics, for example.</p><p>Don't let all this confuse you. In short, start with these
simple steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Create your work of art in the GIMP.</p></li><li><p>Save it as an XCF formatted file.</p></li><li><p>Flatten the image.</p></li><li><p>Save it as a TIFF formatted file.</p></li><li><p>Convert the image to indexed format.</p></li><li><p>Save it as a GIF formatted file.</p></li></ol></div><p>At this point you have the original layers information in the
XCF file, a full color, high quality image in the TIFF file and an
image suitable for use on your web pages in the GIF file. Each of
these file formats is a different size. The XCF is the largest; the
GIF is the smallest. As you can see, working with images in this
way tends to be very disk space intensive.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x254e580.0x2a40380"></a>PhotoCD and Digital Cameras</h2></div></div><p>Support for the PhotoCD format, available from Kodak Digital
Cameras, was available in the 0.54 release of the GIMP last year. A
quick check of the Plug-In Registry shows that the plug-in has not
yet been ported (or at least not registered) for the 1.0 release.
If you need this format, you should check with the plug-in author
or check the Registry periodically to see if the plug-in has been
registered. Note that plug-ins written for the 0.54 or 0.60
releases of the GIMP are <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> compatible with
the 1.0 release. They must be rewritten using the GIMP 1.0 Plug-In
API.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x254e580.0x2a404e0"></a>Vector Formats</h2></div></div><p>The alternative to raster graphics is vector graphics. There
are a wide variety of image file formats that the GIMP supports for
raster images, but it does not support any image files that use
vector formats. This is only important if you wish to use one of
the many ClipArt collections available for Windows systems; these
files are often suffixed with .wmf. There are still many CD's
available with image collections in TIFF or JPEG format that can
readily be used by the GIMP. If you must have access to the vector
ClipArt collections, use Applixware's Applix Graphics package or
perhaps a Windows program to read them in and save them in a raster
format such as TIFF, JPEG or GIF.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x254e580.0x2a405e8"></a>PNG</h2></div></div><p>An emerging format that has recently gained wide acceptance
is called PNG, the Portable Network Graphics format. Earlier
releases of the GIMP support this format but, at the time of this
writing, the plug-in providing PNG support has not yet been ported
to the new 1.0 Plug-In API. I expect this to happen by the time
this article is published. Again, check the Plug-In Registry to be
certain.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x254e580.0x2a406f0"></a>Moving On</h2></div></div><p>We've covered a lot of ground but have only managed to open a
file&mdash;we haven't done anything useful with it. Don't despair&mdash;we're
getting there. Next month we'll cover the Image Window in more
detail. A detailed discussion on layers will also be presented,
which is very important to understanding how to get the most out of
the GIMP. We'll briefly cover how filters work and discuss a few of
the more interesting image-processing options available with
filters. After that, in the final installment of this series, we'll
cover the Toolbox in complete detail. At that point you'll have
enough background to begin to do something really useful with the
tools in the Toolbox.</p><p>I realize some readers will wonder why I don't cover the
Toolbox before I cover filters. Well, it has to do with the length
of each of these installments. The best way to fit everything into
reasonably sized articles is to do the layers and filters section
together. Since the Toolbox has so many tools, it will take a very
long installment just to give a short introduction to each of them.
Stay tuned: in the end, having the information from all four parts
will be of benefit as you make the most of what the GIMP has to
offer.</p><p><a href="2530s3.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
