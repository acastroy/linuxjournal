Adobe Systems, the world's leading supplier of graphical software, is gradually
shifting its business to a subscription model, baiting customers with features
and tools available only to Creative Cloud subscribers
(<a href="http://html.adobe.com/edge/creativecloud" target="_self">html.adobe.com/edge/creativecloud</a>). Among the first of
these is Edge Reflow (<a href="http://html.adobe.com/edge/reflow" target="_self">html.adobe.com/edge/reflow</a>), which Adobe expects to become a must-have for Web
designers&mdash;just as Photoshop, Illustrator and other tools in Adobe's
Creative Suite are long-standing must-haves for many photographers and graphic
designers. The difference is that you <span   class="emphasis"><em>own</em></span> Creative Suite when you buy it. You
only <span   class="emphasis"><em>rent</em></span> Creative Cloud when you subscribe to
it.
</p><p>
Microsoft has been doing the same thing with Office 365
(<a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us" target="_self">office.microsoft.com/en-us</a>). Originally built for
enterprise customers, Office 365 now is available for &ldquo;home&rdquo; customers as well.
&ldquo;Your complete Office in the cloud&rdquo;, will work on &ldquo;up to 5
PCs or Macs&rdquo;, and is
priced at $99.99/year or $9.99/month. That's competitive with the price of
Microsoft's boxed Office software, which becomes stale as soon as the next major
version comes out. And, like Adobe's Creative Cloud, Office 365 baits customers
with lots of features lacking in the old-fashioned sold versions of the suite.
</p><p>
What both want you to rent is SaaS: Software as a Service.
</p><p>
The tide of history is with them. Nicholas G. Carr's <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Big
Switch</em></span>
(<a href="http://www.nicholasgcarr.com/bigswitch" target="_self">www.nicholasgcarr.com/bigswitch</a>) accurately
predicted a shift to &ldquo;computing as a utility&rdquo; back in 2004, long before utility
services became known as &ldquo;the cloud&rdquo;. This always has made sense for
enterprises, which can save IT costs by renting software as well as compute and
data storage services. We also have a model for SaaS at the individual level,
in the form of smartphone apps that are either user interfaces for cloud-based
services or highly tethered to clouds for updates and data flows. While
Wikipedia lists a few open-source iOS
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_open_source_iOS_applications" target="_self">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_open_source_iOS_applications</a>) and Android
apps (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_open_source_Android_applications" target="_self">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_open_source_Android_applications</a>), those are just drops in
an ocean of proprietary apps and services.
</p><p>
In fact, even the packages of boxware you buy from Adobe and Microsoft are less
owned than licensed. The collection of bits that come in a box, or are downloaded
from a virtual store, are not tangible property. Instead, what you have is a
bundle of rights for usage, governed by a seller to which the software remains
attached by a service contract. So, the thinking then goes, why bother with
old-fashioned ownership at all? Why not just rent?
</p><p>
We already rent many other things in the digital world, such as domain names.
Here at <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>, we don't own LinuxJournal.com. We
rent it. The same goes for
all the other domain names in the world. Every one is rented for finite periods
of time. They can be bought or sold, but they can be possessed only so long as the
owner keeps paying a domain registrar for the right to use them
exclusively&mdash;meaning we rent them.
</p><p>
Changing software into a subscription business is a slippery slope down
which control of software moves from individual owners to corporate suppliers.
</p><p>
Predictably and correctly, Richard M. Stallman began saying &ldquo;the
cloud&rdquo; was &ldquo;a
trap&rdquo; in 2008 (in this <span   class="emphasis"><em>Guardian</em></span> interview:
<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2008/sep/29/cloud.computing.richard.stallman" target="_self">www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2008/sep/29/cloud.computing.richard.stallman</a>).
Here's a sample:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
But there has been growing concern that mainstream adoption of cloud computing
could present a mixture of privacy and ownership issues
(<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/blog/2008/aug/06/whengoogleownsyouyourdata" target="_self">www.guardian.co.uk/technology/blog/2008/aug/06/whengoogleownsyouyourdata</a>), with users potentially
being locked out of their own files.
</p><p>
Stallman, who is a staunch privacy advocate, advised users to stay local and
stick with their own computers.
</p><p>
&ldquo;One reason you should not use Web applications to do your computing is that
you lose control&rdquo;, he said. &ldquo;It's just as bad as using a proprietary program.
Do your own computing on your own computer with your copy of a
freedom-respecting program. If you use a proprietary program or somebody else's
Web server, you're defenseless. You're putty in the hands of whoever developed
that software.&rdquo;
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Free software and open-source principles and methods don't fit well with
cloud-based models of software development, deployment and money-making.
</p><p>
One name for the end-state of this shift is the &ldquo;subscription
economy&rdquo;. Here at
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>, we've been living in the subscription economy, as have all
subscription periodicals. We also have done our best from the start to make our
goods as free (as in freedom) as possible. We're not perfect at that, and we
may never be, but free is where we come from. (In fact <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span> 
originally was conceived, way back in 1993, as a free software magazine.)
Meanwhile,
most of the rest of the world lacks the same consciousness. Instead, the
general consciousness has moved backward in time. In &ldquo;When It Comes to Security,
We're Back to Feudalism&rdquo; (<a href="http://www.wired.com/opinion/2012/11/feudal-security" target="_self">www.wired.com/opinion/2012/11/feudal-security</a>), Bruce Schneier
says we &ldquo;pledge allegiance to the united
states of convenience&rdquo; when we become &ldquo;vassals&rdquo; to the
&ldquo;feudal lord&rdquo; called
Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple. He explains:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Feudalism provides security. Classical medieval feudalism depended on
overlapping, complex, hierarchical relationships. There were oaths and
obligations: a series of rights and privileges. A critical aspect of this
system was protection: vassals would pledge their allegiance to a lord, and in
return, that lord would protect them from harm....And it's this model that's
starting to permeate computer security today.
</p><p>
Traditional computer security centered around users. Users had to purchase and
install anti-virus software and firewalls, ensure their operating system and
network were configured properly, update their software, and generally manage
their own security. This model is breaking, largely due to two developments:
</p><p>
1. New Internet-enabled devices where the vendor maintains more control over
the hardware and software than we do&mdash;like the iPhone and Kindle; and
</p><p>
2. Services where the host maintains our data for us&mdash;like Flickr and
Hotmail.
</p><p>
Now, we users must trust the security of these hardware manufacturers, software
vendors and cloud providers. We choose to do it because of the convenience,
redundancy, automation and shareability.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
He doesn't mention the phone and cable companies that intermediate our
connections over the Internet, but their hearts are feudal to the core, and
their enclosure plans are clear. While on the one hand they increase speeds and
give us other benefits, they also have a highly vested interest in transforming
the Internet from a free and open space to an enclosed one from which rents can
be extracted to the max&mdash;just like they always were in telephony and cable
television. At risk is the Net itself.
</p><p>
Ten years ago, in my <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> article &ldquo;Saving the
Net&rdquo;
(<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/6989" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/6989</a>), I began with this:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Who Owns What?
</p><p>
That's the fundamental question....Much is at stake, including Linux and its
natural habitat: the Net. Both have been extraordinarily good for business. Its
perceived &ldquo;threat&rdquo; to Microsoft and the dot-com crash are both red herrings.
Take away Linux and the Net, and both technology and the economy would be a
whole lot worse.
</p><p>
Both the Net and Linux were created, grew and flourished almost entirely
outside the regulatory sphere. They are, in a literal sense, what free markets
have done with their freedoms.
</p><p>
Yet, there are some who do not care. Unfortunately, they're driving the
conversation right now. Hollywood has lawmakers and news organizations
convinced that file sharing is &ldquo;piracy&rdquo; and &ldquo;theft&rdquo;. Apple, Intel and Microsoft
are quietly doing their deals with the Hollywood devil, crippling (or
contemplating the crippling of) PC functionalities, to protect the intellectual
property of &ldquo;content producers&rdquo;.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Where we are headed is toward Hollywood's model of the Net: one where we pay on
a subscription basis for everything that matters, and where
everybody&mdash;creators and consumers alike&mdash;need constantly to
&ldquo;clear rights&rdquo; for usage,
whether they know that's what they're doing or not. Here's more from
my &ldquo;Saving the Net&rdquo; article:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Two oddly allied mentalities provide intellectual air cover for these threats
to the marketplace. One is the extreme comfort certain industries feel inside
their regulatory environments. The other is the high regard political
conservatives hold for successful enterprises. Combine the two, and you get
conservatives eagerly rewarding companies whose primary achievements consist of
successful long-term adaptation to highly regulated environments.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Hollywood's latest subscriber-screwing success story is the Copyright Alert
System (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_Alert_System" target="_self">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_Alert_System</a>),
better known as &ldquo;six strikes&rdquo;. If your ISP's narc-ware detects what it
thinks is copyright infringement happening over your Internet data flows, they
can punish you. The details of both detection and punishment matter less than
the fact that they are spying on your private activities and can strangle your
Net connection. And they can easily do that, because they have the upper hand.
</p><p>
So, instead of two hands clapping, we have one hand slapping.
</p><p>
Linux is in that hand, because Linux is in pretty much everything. Same with
the Internet. Both have won, yet the promise of freedom, which drove Linux and
the Net to success, is being traded for away for convenience.
</p><p>
Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty, the saying goes
(<a href="http://wiki.monticello.org/mediawiki/index.php/Eternal_vigilance_is_the_price_of_liberty_(Quotation)" target="_self">wiki.monticello.org/mediawiki/index.php/Eternal_vigilance_is_the_price_of_liberty_(Quotation)</a>). And, right now, the
silence is killing us.
