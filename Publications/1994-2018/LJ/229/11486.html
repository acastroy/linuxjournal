<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #229, May 2013</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Remember the <span   class="bold"><b>SCO lawsuit</b></span>, claiming Linux
used code from <span   class="bold"><b>UNIX System V</b></span>?
Disproving that claim required a tremendous amount of work, partly because
Linux had no revision control system to help track down the original
authors of any given patch.
</p><p>
In response to that whole mess, <span   class="bold"><b>Linus
Torvalds</b></span> implemented the <span   class="bold"><b>Developer's
Certificate of Origin</b></span> (DCO) in 2004, which required people submitting a
kernel patch to include a &ldquo;Signed-off-by&rdquo; header, identifying themselves
and certifying that the code was legal to go into the kernel.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Luis R. Rodriguez</b></span> recently said the DCO was so great, that a lot of
other projects had started using it, but that in some cases, they weren't
using it in a way that actually would help them track the origins of each
patch. He wanted to extract the text of the DCO into its own git
repository, so that other free software projects could access 
the explanatory text more easily and use it better.
</p><p>
This initially met with some resistance from people like <span   class="bold"><b>Alan Cox</b></span> and <span   class="bold"><b>Jiry
Slaby</b></span> who felt that any project wishing to use the DCO could extract it
from the kernel sources without much of a problem. They saw no reason for a
standalone git repository.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>W. Trevor King</b></span> disagreed. He felt a standalone git tree for the DCO would
be a fine idea. But (ironically), he had some copyright questions about the
DCO itself. He said that in the initial patch to add the text of the DCO to
the kernel sources, Linus hadn't used a &ldquo;Signed-off-by&rdquo; header, so he
couldn't be sure the DCO's explanatory text even was legal to release under
the GPL version 2. That might seem like nitpicking, except that Trevor also
pointed out that the <span   class="bold"><b>Open Source Development
Labs</b></span> (OSDL) had put out a
press release announcing the existence of the DCO and had specifically
licensed the DCO under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 2.5
License.
</p><p>
This could have turned out to be a thorny issue&mdash;except it didn't. No one
spoke up to clarify the licensing question on the linux-kernel mailing
list. It went completely unanswered.
</p><p>
Trevor, however, didn't wait. He created a new git repository at
<a href="https://github.com/wking/signed-off-by" target="_self">https://github.com/wking/signed-off-by</a>, exactly along the lines of what
Luis originally had requested. It even preserved the commit history of the
DCO, through to its current version of 1.1.
</p><p>
To address the licensing question himself, he said that the project was
derived from the GPLv2 Linux kernel, so it also was released under that
same license. But, he also said, &ldquo;Because many projects that are not GPLv2
may still want to use the DCO/s-o-b approach, I've included an example
CONTRIBUTING file (and CONTRIBUTING.md for GitHub) that are licensed under
the very permissive Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal. Merge the
'contributing' or 'contributing-github' branch into your project and edit
as you see fit.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Somehow I don't think anyone will start complaining about any leftover
licensing issues that may remain concerning the DCO. Luis certainly won't. He
immediately replied to Trevor, saying he'd already started using Trevor's
repository in his own free software projects.
</p><p>
A fight broke out recently on the linux-kernel mailing list between the
<span   class="bold"><b>kvmtool</b></span> developers (primarily <span   class="bold"><b>Ingo Molnar</b></span> and <span   class="bold"><b>Pekka
Enberg</b></span>) and Linus
Torvalds. The issue was whether kvmtool should go into the official kernel
tree.
</p><p>
kvmtool is used by the <span   class="bold"><b>KVM</b></span> (Kernel Virtual Machine) subsystem to boot up
virtual computers under a running Linux system. It's awesome. Everyone
should use it, whether they have a need for it or not. Create your own
cluster of 20 systems without spending a dime.
</p><p>
There was a lot of heated back-and-forth discussion over what to do. Essentially, Ingo
and Pekka argued that kvmtool should be included in the official kernel
sources, because kvmtool was tightly integrated with kernel development.
They relied on the same pool of developers and used the same mailing
lists. Ports of the KVM subsystem to other architectures would have a
functioning kvmtool immediately&mdash;in some cases before the KVM port 
even had been completed. Ingo and Pekka cited many examples of instances where
the existence of kvmtool in the kernel tree (really in the linux-next tree,
waiting to go to Linus) had resulted in better, stronger, faster
development overall. They argued that this constituted a real benefit that
would be lost if kvmtool had to exist outside the kernel. Without that
tight integration, development would be slower, and the kvmtool developers
would have to implement all the infrastructure required by a standalone
project.
</p><p>
Linus, however, was completely unmoved by any of these arguments. In fact,
the whole idea of speeding up development and making things easier for the
developers didn't register to him as even remotely relevant to whether a
piece of code should go into the kernel.
</p><p>
Instead (which he said over and over again) he needed to have a solid
technical reason why the code &ldquo;belonged&rdquo; in the kernel rather than staying
outside. It had to make sense, not from his personal perspective or from
any other developer's perspective, but from the kernel's perspective
itself. Did kvmtool really belong in the kernel? And that question, he
said, Ingo and Pekka had not even addressed.
</p><p>
Ultimately, he simply refused to merge the code, and the kvmtool developers
probably will extract it from the kernel and create a standalone git
repository and the rest of the necessary infrastructure. Or, they'll
articulate better technical (and less developer-focused) reasons why
kvmtool should be more tightly integrated.

<h2 class="title">Add More Fruit to Your Raspberry Pi!</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #229, May 2013</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Since this is our Raspberry Pi issue, I did some research on
&ldquo;what folks do with their Raspberry Pi&rdquo;. I sent queries out via Twitter,
Facebook, the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> Web site and even the #linuxjournal IRC
room. When it comes to doing extra-geeky projects with the RPi, every
person I spoke with mentioned buying parts from Adafruit.
</p><p>
Anybody familiar with Raspberry Pi development most likely has done
business with Adafruit. I had the pleasure of speaking with Limor Fried,
owner of Adafruit Industries regarding its most popular products.
Although I was expecting the most common Raspberry Pi-related sales to
be cases or SD cards, as it happens, the list of most-popular products
was much geekier!
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11486adaf1.large.jpg"><img src="11486adaf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. The Raspberry Pi can be a building block to nerdery!
(Photo from <a href="http://www.adafruit.com" target="_self">www.adafruit.com</a>.)
</p></div></div><p>
While the low-profile microSD card adapter is popular, Limor told me the
breakout boards and breadboard PCB kits are the most-popular items. This
news both surprised and fascinated me. Although I've certainly done some
cool things with RPi, the notion that folks have been doing elaborate
and complex projects based on the Raspberry Pi is awesome! (A special
thanks to Limor at Adafruit for talking to me about what folks are doing
with their Raspberry Pi devices.)

<h2 class="title">Android Candy: Outer Space, in Your Pocket</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #229, May 2013</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
When the Space Shuttle program shut down, I have to admit, it deflated
my excitement about space exploration just a bit. Although it's not fair to
pin the future of manned missions to space on a fleet of aging crafts
built in the 1980s, the Space Shuttle represented the latest step in a
process that would get us to other planets. Because there wasn't anything
immediately replacing the Shuttle, it felt like we were giving up on
space. (Some might argue we gave up on space after landing on the moon,
but that's an entirely different discussion.)

</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11486androidf1.large.jpg"><img src="11486androidf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
Then the Mars <span   class="emphasis"><em>Curiosity</em></span> rover arrived at Mars, and I remembered how much
I love science! My daughter stayed up late with me, and we passed a jar
of peanuts back and forth while we chewed our nails watching NASA TV. The
seven minutes of hell ended, and after a painfully long wait, we heard from
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Curiosity</em></span>! My excitement was palpable, and that moment sparked a new
generation of space geek in my daughter. The first thing she did was
look on her phone for NASA information, and I'm glad she did.
</p><p>
If you haven't looked at the NASA Android app in a while, you owe
it to yourself to check it out. The last time I tried a NASA app,
it was a simple streaming app that did a poor job of streaming the
NASA TV video. It crashed. It was ugly. It did not inspire awe or
excitement. The current NASA app is amazing!  Not only does it have
high-definition streaming video (which doesn't seem to crash), it also
has information on current and upcoming missions, a launch calendar,
categorized information on moons and planets, and tons of other space-nerd
fodder. It even will change the background photo on your Android
device to the Astronomy Pic of the Day.
</p><p>
I think my favorite feature of the NASA app is its ability to grab your
GPS location and tell you exactly where and when to spot things like the
International Space Station! If you're a space nerd like I am, I urge
you to grab your jar of peanuts and let the NASA app touchdown on your
Android device (<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=gov.nasa" target="_self">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=gov.nasa</a>). It's so much better than the last time I tried it, several
years ago, that the NASA app for Android is this month's Editors' Choice.

<h2 class="title">Non-Linux FOSS: Seashore</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #229, May 2013</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
As Linux users, we tend to take programs like GIMP for
granted. Thankfully, as of version 2.8.2, GIMP is available as a native
application for OS X! Because everyone reading this most likely is familiar with
how awesome GIMP is for photo editing, it's worth mentioning there is
another open-source photo-editing application for OS X named Seashore.
</p><p>
Seashore is an application written in the native OS X Cocoa language,
so it clearly looks like a native application when running (Figure 1).
Although OS X users no longer have to install X11 in order to take advantage
of GIMP, Seashore is a powerful image editor in its own right, and
because it's open source, it's well worth the effort to try it out! You
can download Seashore at <a href="http://seashore.sourceforge.net" target="_self">seashore.sourceforge.net</a>. The native
version of GIMP is available at <a href="http://www.gimp.org/downloads" target="_self">www.gimp.org/downloads</a>.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11486fossf1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

<h2 class="title">Designing Electronics with Linux</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Joey Bernard</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #229, May 2013</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
In many scientific disciplines, the research you may be doing is
completely new. It may be so new that there isn't even any instrumentation
available to make your experimental measurements. In those cases, you
have no choice but to design and build your own measuring devices. Although
you could build them using trial and error, having a way to model them
first to see how they will behave is a much better choice&mdash;in steps
oregano (<a href="https://github.com/marc-lorber/oregano" target="_self">https://github.com/marc-lorber/oregano</a>).
With oregano, you can design your circuitry ahead of time
and run simulations on it to iron out any problems you may encounter.
</p><p>
The first step, as always, is installing the software.
Most
distributions should have a package for oregano available. If you want to
follow the source version, it is available at GitHub. Oregano also needs
another software package to handle the actual simulation. The two packages
it currently can work with are Gnucap and ngspice. Either of these two
packages needs to be installed in order to do the calculations
for the simulation. While this is handled automagically by your
distribution's package manager, you will need to install this dependency
yourself if you are building from source.
</p><p>
Once it's installed, you will get a blank new project when you
first start up oregano (Figure 1). On the right-hand side, you should
see a list of elements you can use to build your circuits. It
starts up with the default library selected. This library provides
all the standard electronic components you likely will want to
use. But, this isn't the only library included. You can select from other
libraries, such as TTL, Linear, CPU or Power Devices, among others. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11486oreganof1.large.jpg"><img src="11486oreganof1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. On startup, you get a blank canvas and a parts list.
</p></div></div><p>
Each
of these libraries contains a list of associated elements you can use
in your circuits. Selecting one of the elements shows a preview of
the schematic drawing of that element in the bottom window. You then
can drag and drop the element onto your canvas and start building your
circuit. Once you have an element on the canvas, you can double-click
the element to edit its properties (Figure 2). 
You need to click on the &ldquo;Draw wires&rdquo; icon at the top of the window
in order to connect the elements together into a proper circuit. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11486oreganof2.large.jpg"><img src="11486oreganof2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. The property window depends on which properties are available for
that element.
</p></div></div><p>
All
circuits have some necessary components to make an actually
functioning circuit. The first of these is the ground. This element is
labeled GND in the default library. Along with ground, you need
some sort of power source. In most cases, you will want some form of
DC current. This is provided by the element labeled with VDC in the
default library. With those two important elements in your circuit,
you can go ahead and wire up the rest of the circuit.
</p><p>
Once you have a circuit made up, you will want to run a simulation to see
how it behaves. Because of the nature of electrical circuits, you need to
put sensors into the circuit to see its behavior. You can click on
the &ldquo;Add voltage clamp&rdquo; icon at the the top of the window to select the
sensor object. Then, you can click on the areas of your circuit where you
want to measure during the simulation. At each point you click, you will
see a new icon on your circuit marking a sensor location. Double-clicking
on the clamp will pop up a window where you can set the parameters
of what is being measured (Figure 3). You need at least one clamp
in your circuit before you can run a simulation; otherwise, you won't
have any measurements to study in your simulation. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11486oreganof3.large.jpg"><img src="11486oreganof3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Here you can select the properties for the clamp.
</p></div></div><p>
Once you have all
of your clamp points selected, you can run the simulation
and see what happens by clicking on the &ldquo;Run a simulation&rdquo; icon at the
top of the window (Figure 4). When you do so, oregano opens a
new window where you can see a plot of the data registered by the clamp
(usually voltage or current).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11486oreganof4.large.jpg"><img src="11486oreganof4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Plotting the results of a circuit clamp.
</p></div></div><p>
When you do analysis, you have the choice of two different circuit
analysis programs: Gnucap and spice. On Ubuntu, the default
analysis program that is installed as a dependency is Gnucap. This
means you need to install spice explicitly if you want to use
it instead. 
</p><p>
To select the analysis engine, click on
Edit&rarr;Preferences. In this dialog, you also can set whether the
log window will open automatically when needed, and you can set the
data paths for the models and libraries that will be available for your
circuits. In most cases, you will want to leave those as is. 
</p><p>
To help you get 
started, oregano comes with several examples. Again, on Ubuntu (since
that is my current desktop), these examples are located in
/usr/share/doc/oregano/examples.
You might want to load one of these examples first. 
</p><p>
Once you have
a completed circuit and want to run a simulation, you will want to set
parameters to control this simulation. Click on the menu item Edit&rarr;Simulation Settings to bring up the dialog window. The first tab lets
you see analysis parameters, such as transient options, fourier options, DC
sweep options and AC options. Clicking on any of the check boxes will open
up a subset of further options for each of those sections. The second tab
lets you set a series of analysis options. You also can set parameters that may
affect your circuit, such as the ambient temperature. 
</p><p>
Once you have all of
the options and parameters set, you can start the simulation by selecting
the menu item Tools&rarr;Simulate or by pressing F11. Don't forget to
attach some test clamps first; otherwise, you will get an error. Your
simulation will run and pop up a new plot window where you can look
at the values generated within your circuit. You can select whether to
look at the transient analysis or AC analysis. 
</p><p>
On the left, you will see
a list of available plotting options. On the right-hand side, you will
find the actual plot of your data. Only the items that you select from
list will be plotted, so that means when this window first opens,
nothing actually will be plotted. 
</p><p>
You also can plot functions of the
available values. For example, you could plot the difference in voltage
between two separate test clamps. These functions will be available in
the list on the left side, so you can select them and have them
plotted on the graph.
</p><p>
Additionally, you can include even more complicated elements like full
CPUs to your circuit. The problem with these is that the way they respond to
electrical signals can be very complicated. These elements need a separate
model file that describes this response to signals. Unfortunately,
the licensing for model files means that many cannot be included with
oregano. You can search the Internet and download the model
files for the elements that interest you, or you can create
your own model file. In either case, you can place the model files into
the directory set in the preferences.
</p><p>
When you actually want to build your circuit, you can export the
associated diagram by clicking on the menu item File&rarr;Export. You
then can export the circuit diagram as either an SVG file, a PDF,
a PostScript file or a PNG. Now, you can go ahead and build your new
test equipment, secure in the knowledge that you did some initial testing
and should get the behavior you need.

<h2 class="title">Raspberry Pi Poll</h2>
<div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
We asked LinuxJournal.com readers about their Raspberry Pis, and the
results are below. We see that 11% indicated that they have multiple
models, and 6% own more than 3 Pis, and at $35 a piece, we can hardly
blame you. Also fun to note is that 77% percent of respondents bought
their Pi with no specific purpose in mind, just to experiment with,
which is yet another fabulous side effect of the low price and wee form
factor. Only 35% of our readers indicated that the Pi is not fast enough to
use as a desktop machine, while the rest found it at least sufficient
enough for basic tasks. Command-liners and GUI users are split down the
middle with 50% each, which is not surprising considering the multitude
of applications for a Pi, each of which lends itself to a different way
of interacting. And finally, Raspian is the favorite operating system by
far, but there are many to experiment with. So, please continue to enjoy

<h2 class="title">They Said It</h2>
<div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
I'd learned enough about circuitry in high school electronics to know how
to drive a TV and get it to draw&mdash;shapes of characters and things.

&mdash;Steve Wozniak 
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
I think it's very comforting for people to put me in a box. &ldquo;Oh, she's a
fluffy girlie girl who likes clothes and cupcakes. Oh, but wait, she is
spending her weekends doing hardware electronics.&rdquo;

&mdash;Marissa Mayer 
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Other kids went out and beat each other up or played baseball, and I built
electronics.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
&mdash;Robert Moog 
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
When I was a teenager in the late 1930s and early 1940s, electronics wasn't a

&mdash;Ken Olsen 
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
I met Woz when I was 13, at a friend's garage. He was about 18. He was,
like, the first person I met who knew more electronics than I did at that
point.
