It's hard not to love the Raspberry Pi. For less money that it takes to
stop at a drive-through, it's possible to buy the top-end RPi model. (Granted,
I have three teenagers, so the drive-through is expensive.) The Raspberry Pi is as
open as the manufacturer can make it, has huge community support, and its
software isn't backed by a huge corporation with mysterious motivations
(<span   class="emphasis"><em>cough</em></span>, Android, <span   class="emphasis"><em>cough</em></span>). It's just a cool little ARM device that runs
Linux. This month, we focus on the Raspberry Pi. The drive-through is
optional.
</p><p>
Dave Taylor doesn't work directly with a Raspberry Pi this month, but his
continuing series on scripting a <span   class="emphasis"><em>Cribbage</em></span> game
certainly will work on an
RPi. Even if you're not a <span   class="emphasis"><em>Cribbage</em></span> fan, Dave's scripting lessons are
infinitely useful for learning. Reuven M. Lerner teaches a thing or two
this month as well&mdash;specifically in regard to running background tasks in
your Web applications. Running things in the background can make a
monstrous Web application perform much more quickly from the end user's
perspective. Reuven shows how with Sidekiq.
</p><p>
Kyle Rankin, who first interested me in Raspberry Pi devices, talks about
redundancy this month. What's better than a Raspberry Pi? Redundant
pies&mdash;or Pis, rather. If you want to bolster your RPi reliability or 
just want an inexpensive platform to learn clustering, Kyle walks 
through the process. I've been writing about my Raspberry Pi
adventures off and on for the past six months, so this month, I decided to
focus on an issue that is near and dear to my heart: RSS. If the Google
Reader shutdown in July has you worried about how you'll browse the Web,
perhaps my column will help. I'm past panic mode, and I've been able to
wean myself off Google Reader altogether.
</p><p>
I'm probably not the only <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> reader who has a full
virtualization system with iSCSI SAN/NAS storage in my basement.
Unfortunately, along with that nerdy power comes a big electricity bill.
Brian Trapp describes the other end of that spectrum with his article on
creating the perfect home server&mdash;with a Raspberry Pi. There are plenty of
reasons powering your Linux server infrastructure with a cell-phone charger
is awesome, and Brian explains how. If you want to add IPv6 to the mix,
Igor Partola follows up with an article on creating an IPv6 router on your
network, even if your ISP doesn't support it!
</p><p>
I realize all my &ldquo;servers in the basement&rdquo; stuff is almost
clich&eacute; when
talking about Linux users. To be fair, I didn't say it was my mom's
basement. Still, Jonathan Brogdon's article on controlling stage lighting
with a Raspberry Pi is a great way to avoid our basement-dwelling
stereotype. Jonathan literally puts RPi in the spotlight with his
hardware/software combination for controlling external lighting. It's a
real-world solution and really cool to read about.
</p><p>
The coming shutdown of Google Reader has made all of us think a little
harder about the dangers of cloud computing. At the very least, it's forced
us to think about trusting cloud-based services we don't directly control.
Diana Marina Cooper talks about the other end of the cloud&mdash;specifically as
it relates to open-source compliance. How does the GPL relate to a world of
&ldquo;Software as a Service&rdquo;? If the cloud obfuscates the software and the code,
what does that mean with regards to FOSS? Diana takes a serious look at a
problem not many of us consider.
</p><p>
Do you have a Raspberry Pi, and are you looking for something to do with it? Do
you already have a rack of clustered-RPi devices in your basement, and
are you looking for tips on optimization? Regardless of your immersion level
into the Pi, this issue should prove useful and entertaining. Even if you
have no interest in the Raspberry Pi, this issue is full of the same
tech tips and Linux news you're used to seeing. This
issue was incredibly fun to put together, and we hope you enjoy it as much as
we did.
