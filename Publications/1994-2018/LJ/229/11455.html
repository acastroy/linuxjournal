Rock your stage lighting with a Raspberry Pi light controller.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27e0580.0x28d81f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
I am the proud parent of twin 13-year-old rock-star daughters. They are
seriously good musicians, and of course, I taught them everything
they know. The girls typically perform indoors &ldquo;coffee-house&rdquo;
style or outdoors in the daylight. But, this fall, the girls booked
a number of outdoor gigs in the evening. This meant we had to
have stage lighting. After a quick trip to the local music instrument
supercenter&mdash;where they know us by name&mdash;we had all the lights, stands
and trusses we needed for a good night-time show. The light system we
purchased had many useful built-in options for creating light shows:
various color chase sequences, variable strobe speeds and sound-activated or
fixed-time sequencing. These are great options. But,
if you are looking for maximum wow-factor from a performance, you want
to have direct control over the light system.
</p><p>
Lighting control hardware is available to control your stage lighting.
In addition, several commercial and open-source software
lighting control packages work with many off-the-shelf lighting
devices. Some of these, such as QLC and QLC+, are available for Linux.
Many of the software light controller packages are based on the Open
Lighting Architecture (<a href="http://www.opendmx.net/index.php/OLA" target="_self">www.opendmx.net/index.php/OLA</a>). If you are looking to set up a
professional light show and need to control several complex devices,
such as movable lights, one of these options is probably the way to go.
</p><p>
I am the sound guy/roadie/driver/financier for this band. So I figured,
what could it hurt to add lighting control guy to my r&eacute;sum&eacute;? Given my
other duties during the show, I wanted something pretty simple to operate,
with capability to add custom features as needed. Commercial lighting
control hardware seemed like overkill for my needs, and I wasn't
real keen on dragging a laptop to a show just to control the lighting.
This sounded like a good Raspberry Pi project.
</p><p>
When I started investigating lighting control options, I quickly found
the language of light control: DMX512. The United States Institute
for Theatre Technology created DMX512 in 1986 as a standard to control
dimmers on stage lights. The standard has had a few updates since
1986 and is now an ANSI standard. DMX512 uses a multi-drop RS-485
bus for the physical layer signaling. There is a single master device
(the controller) and up to 512 slave devices (the lights). The RS-485
differential signaling provides for good noise immunity over the long
cable runs needed to control lights that are spread around a stage
or arena. Each slave DMX512 device has IN and OUT XLR connections,
and devices are daisy-chained together. The last device in the chain
should include an XLR stub connector with a 120-Ohm termination resistor.
For the girls' stage lighting, we used two Chauvet COLORstrip Mini LED
wash lights.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11455f1.large.jpg"><img src="11455f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div><p>
The DMX512 protocol is very basic. Remember, it originally was designed
for light dimmers. The only protocol message, sent by the master,
is a block of unsigned byte values (0&ndash;255)&mdash;one for each
&ldquo;channel&rdquo;.
Each slave device has its own definition of how a &ldquo;channel&rdquo;
is interpreted. For example, channel one may set the general light
mode (fixed color, fixed sequence, random sequence and so on). The second
channel may indicate the sequence transition speed (fixed value,
sound activated and so on). On the other hand, a very simple device might
define the channel values as dimmer values for each light on the device.
The manufacturer's documentation will spell out how each channel
should be used. The DMX512 protocol runs at a fixed 250k baud rate.
</p><p>
One interesting quirk of the protocol is that messages must be sent
continuously. If the master stops sending messages to a device, the
lights go out. This also means that once a device receives a message
with channel values specifying a particular light sequence, it will
run the sequence as long as it keeps receiving messages with the same
channel values. For example, suppose the value for channel 1 is 80,
which indicates that the color sequence is red, green, blue, yellow,
magenta, cyan, white. The value for channel 2 is 10, which indicates
that the color should change every ten seconds. If you want to keep this
sequence running, the master must keep sending messages with channel
1=80 and channel 2=10.
</p><p>
I found a simple USB-RS-485 converter based on the ubiquitous
FT232R USB-Serial chip from Future Technologies Devices International.
You can find these for around $20 or less from several sources. I got
mine on eBay. I attached a three-pin female XLR connector to the RS-485 I/O
pins, and voil&agrave;, I had my DMX512 physical interface. The Entec Open DMX
USB is another popular option (<a href="http://www.enttec.com/open_dmx_usb" target="_self">www.enttec.com/open_dmx_usb</a>). This product also is based
on the FT232R chip and comes in a nice sturdy steel enclosure, all for $70.
The code in this article works with either option. Note that the Open
DMX USB box has a five-pin XLR connector. If you plan on using the less-expensive three-conductor DMX512 cables, you will need to add an XLR
five-pin-to-three-pin adapter.
</p><p>
Now, I needed a software interface for sending DMX512 protocol messages.
The main task here is configuring the FT232R chip for DXM512 communication
at 250 kBaud with eight data bits, no parity and two stop bits. Most Linux
distributions have a driver that supports the FT232 family of devices.
However, if you are thinking about using the serial device interface
presented by the driver (for example, /dev/ttyUSB0), you probably won't get far.
Standard utilities like stty will not support setting the 250-kBaud rate.
Instead, we need to talk to the FT232R as the USB device that it is.
</p><p>
My language of choice for this project was Python. So, I looked around
for Python packages that could address the FT232R chip as a USB
device.
I found PyFtdi (<a href="https://github.com/eblot/pyftdi.git" target="_self">https://github.com/eblot/pyftdi.git</a>). PyFtdi provides a user-space driver for
talking to FTDI devices. The PyFtdi package depends on PyUSB (<a href="https://github.com/walac/pyusb.git" target="_self">https://github.com/walac/pyusb.git</a>),
which depends on LibUSB (<a href="http://www.libusb.org" target="_self">www.libusb.org</a>). I used the standard
Raspian &ldquo;Wheezy&rdquo; image for this project. So, I was able to install
libusb via the package manager. I installed PyUSB and PyFtdi via the
setup scripts included with each package. The source for the DMX512/USB
interface shown in Listing 1. Note that a DMX512 protocol message must
be terminated with two break characters.

The DMX512 controller needed a user interface. My first thought was for
a grand Web interface over an ad hoc Wi-Fi network. The plan was to run
the UI from a browser on my phone or tablet. But, that would mean more
gear to be charged up and dragged to the show. Plus, I've learned
(the hard way) to pick reasonably economical solutions for band support
gear so you can afford a backup. I decided to use a much simpler
UI device: the Adafruit Pi Plate LCD+Keypad. This is a two-line x
16-character LCD with five key buttons: &ldquo;up&rdquo;, &ldquo;down&rdquo;,
&ldquo;left&rdquo;, &ldquo;right&rdquo;
and &ldquo;enter&rdquo;. This device is made specifically for the use with the
Raspberry Pi, and it plugs in directly to the GPIO header. The Pi Plate
uses the Hitachi HD44780 LCD controller. The LCD interface and key
buttons are accessed via an i2c I/O expander on the Pi Plate.
</p><p>
Adafruit provides some example Python code for the Pi Plate (<a href="https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-Raspberry-Pi-Python-Code.git" target="_self">https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-Raspberry-Pi-Python-Code.git</a>),
demonstrating how to write to the LCD and read from the key buttons.
This code is great for a single application that controls all the
LCD resources. I needed the UI to run automatically when the system
boots. I could have adapted the Adafruit Pi Plate example code to run as
a d&aelig;mon. However, I considered LCDproc to be a better choice (<a href="http://lcdproc.org" target="_self">lcdproc.org</a>).
LCDproc is the de facto UI framework for embedded Linux systems that
support LCDs&mdash;with or without keys.
</p><p>
The LCDproc framework is composed of a server d&aelig;mon with
&ldquo;drivers&rdquo;
for specific LCD families and physical connection options (that is, parallel,
serial and so on). Note that these are userspace drivers that use device
interfaces to access the LCD hardware. An LCDproc client application
contacts the server over a socket to output to the LCD or read key
input. A client can allocate an area of the LCD for its output or
map individual keys for its input. For example, you might have a
client that displays the system uptime on the left side of the first line,
another client that displays the current system time on the right side
of the first line, and a third client that displays the IP address on the
second line. I liked the flexibility of having multiple LCD clients for
future applications. The LCDproc communication protocol uses text strings
over a TCP socket connection. This makes for easy protocol debugging.
</p><p>
LCDproc provides a driver for the HD44780 LCD, with several connection
options. Unfortunately, LCDproc did not have driver support for the Pi
Plate's LCD connection via the i2c I/O expander. So, I decided to
add it. See <a href="https://github.com/jlbrogdon/lcdproc-piplate.git" target="_self">https://github.com/jlbrogdon/lcdproc-piplate.git</a>
for the Pi Plate driver patch.
</p><p>
LCDd is the LCDproc server d&aelig;mon. The LCDd configuration file contains
several server and driver options. By default, the path to this file
is /etc/LCDd.conf. For the Pi Plate LCD, the following config options
should be used:

With the LCDproc server up and running, I could focus on the LCD client
side of my light controller. I used the Python lcdproc package (<a href="https://github.com/jingleman/lcdproc.git" target="_self">https://github.com/jingleman/lcdproc.git</a>) for the client interface to LCDproc. This allowed the DMX512 light
controller client to open a connection to the LCDproc server, set up
widgets on the LCD, send output to the widgets and get input from the
key buttons. For this project, I used the &ldquo;up&rdquo; and
&ldquo;down&rdquo; keys to
cycle through light color options and the &ldquo;select&rdquo; key to select the
desired color output (Figure 2).

Listing 2 shows the UI processing for the light controller. This code
opens the LCDproc server connection, defines the UI widgets for the
LCD, displays the light color options, processes the key button input and
updates the UI widgets based on key inputs.

The application has two concurrent threads: the UI thread and DMX512
controller thread. The UI thread runs the LCDproc client shown in
Listing 2. When a new light color is selected, the UI thread builds
a complete DMX512 protocol message, with channel values corresponding
to the user-selected light color and queues the message to the DMX512
controller thread.
</p><p>
The DMX512 controller thread initializes the FT232R device for DMX512
communication and continuously checks for any new protocol messages
from the UI thread. Any new protocol message received from the UI
thread is sent repeatedly to the DMX512 slave devices. Recall that
when the controller stops sending protocol messages, the slave turns
off the lights. Figure 3 shows a collage of the various output colors.

Many of the DMX512 light control systems available today provide a lot
of configurable options for the user, which also adds a learning curve
and potentially many more levers for you to pull during the stage show.
However, if you are looking for something simple to control a few stage
lights for your band, small stage production or holiday lighting display,
this Raspberry Pi-based light controller has the benefits of simplicity,
extensibility, customization and low cost. One of my ultimate goals
is to add a song selection menu and have the controller sequence the
lights according to values in a corresponding file. Until then, rock on!
