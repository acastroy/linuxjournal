NeuroSky's Brainwave Starter Kit</h2></div></div><p>
Another inch toward a <span   class="emphasis"><em>Star Trek</em></span> reality comes in the form of
NeuroSky's Brainwave Starter Kit, a brain-computer interface package
that lets users analyze and visualize their own brain waves on Android
and iOS. Users simply slip on the MindWave Mobile EEG headset and view
their own brainwaves displayed on their handset in the colorful Brainwave
Visualizer. The brain waves visibly change in real time, as one chills out
to relaxing music and then does some intensive programming or imagines
something Marvin Gaye sings about. The MindWave Mobile safely measures
and outputs the EEG power spectra (alpha waves, beta waves and so on),
NeuroSky eSense meters (attention and meditation) and eye blinks. The
device consists of a headset with an ear clip and a sensor arm.
The headset's reference and ground electrodes are on the ear clip,
and the EEG electrode is on the sensor arm, resting on the forehead
above the eye. Next up: when will someone finally make a transporter?

Open-E Data Storage Software V7</h2></div></div><p>
The model for the Open-E Data Storage Software is an all-in-one
universal storage system that allows businesses of all sizes to
leverage off-the-shelf servers to build and operate virtualized storage
infrastructure. The Linux-based Open-E DSS V7 data storage software
is used for building and managing centralized data storage servers&mdash;NAS
and SAN&mdash;and now includes Hyper-V Cluster Support, as well as
the new product Open-E Multiple Storage Server Manager for simplified
central management of all storage resources. Built-in enterprise-class
features include active-active failover, active-passive failover, volume
replication, snapshots and continuous data protection, among others.

AdaCore GNAT Pro Safety-Critical for ARM Processors</h2></div></div><p>
In response to the increasing prevalence of low-cost, low-power ARM
processors in the aerospace, defense and transportation industries,
AdaCore has developed the GNAT Pro Safety-Critical product for ARM Cortex
micro-controllers. This bareboard GNAT Pro Safety-Critical product
provides a complete Ada development environment (or Eclipse plugin)
oriented toward systems that are safety-critical or have stringent
memory constraints. Developers of such systems, says AdaCore, now
can exploit the software engineering benefits of the Ada language, including
reliability, maintainability and portability. The ARM platform adds
to the GNAT Pro Safety-Critical product offering, which already
is available for PowerPC and LEON boards, allowing easy portability among
all three platforms. The technology does not require any underlying
operating system, so it can be deployed on very small memory boards.

Little Apps' Little Software Stats</h2></div></div><p>
The big news from Little Apps is Little Software Stats, a new open-source
software package that enables software developers to track how users are
using their software. Little Apps says that Little Software Stats is
the first program for obtaining runtime intelligence that is both open
source and free. Because the program is designed and developed using MySQL
and PHP, most Web servers can run it. Information that can be gathered
includes executions, installations, exceptions and geographical location.

Rakhitha Nimesh Ratnayake's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Building Impressive Presentations with
Impress.js</em></span>
(Packt Publishing)</h2></div></div><p>
Impress.js is a classic open-source project. The closed-source world
creates a slick app&mdash;in this case, the Prezi presentation tool&mdash;and charges much more than free. Next, creative (and cheapskate)
open-source developer says &ldquo;I want that, and I want it
free&rdquo;&mdash;in
this case, Impress.js. Impress.js, not to be confused with OpenOffice.org
Impress, is a free and open-source JavaScript library inspired by Prezi
that utilizes the CSS3 transitions found in modern Web browsers. If this
sounds interesting, the path to mastery can be found with Rakhitha Nimesh Ratnayake's
new book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Building Impressive Presentations with
Impress.js</em></span>. 
Ratnayake explores the features of Impress.js,
which allows one to create presentations inside the infinite canvas of
modern Web browsers that work anywhere, any time and on any device.
Readers will learn how to build dynamic presentations with rotation,
scaling, transforms and 3-D effects. Advanced users will find out how
to extract the power of Impress.js core API events and configurations to
modify existing functionalities, as well as extend the core library to
create custom functionalities for different types of applications, such
as sliders, portfolios and galleries.

David M. Bourg, Kenneith Humphreys and Bryan Bywalec's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Physics for
Game Developers</em></span>, 2nd edition (O'Reilly
Media)</h2></div></div><p>
Whether or not game development is your vocation, you have to admit
the material in <span   class="emphasis"><em>Physics for Game Developers</em></span>,
2nd edition, is inherently super interesting. In this book, the authors
explore the key knowledge behind bread-and-butter game physics that
go into modern games for Nintendo Wii, PlayStation Move, Microsoft's
Kinect and various mobile devices. Readers also learn how to leverage
exciting interaction gadgets, such as accelerometers, touch screens, GPS
receivers, pressure sensors and optical tracking devices. The updated
2nd edition includes new chapters on deformable and soft bodies, fluids
and the physics of sound for incorporating realistic effects, including
3-D sound. Major topics include digital physics, the physics of sound,
rigid body mechanics, fluid dynamics and the modeling of specific systems
based on real-world examples.

VanDyke Software SecureFX</h2></div></div><p>
VanDyke Software says that many of its customers run Windows just so
they don't have to give up the wide range of functionality found on
its SecureFX secure file transfer client. Now Linux and Mac OS X users
can enjoy that same functionality natively with the new SecureFX 7.1,
which delivers features like multiple file transfer protocols, site
synchronization and easy recovery of interrupted transfers. Secure
file transfers can be performed with SFTP, FTP over SSL and SCP;
FTP is provided for use on legacy systems. Aesthetics also
are important for VanDyke, which offers a tabbed visual user interface in
SecureFX 7.1 allowing for easy learning and organizing for optimum
productivity. Also new for SecureFX 7.1 is a dependent session option
that can be used to link a session to an SSH2 session that it depends
on, which allows connection to a jump host before connecting to other
sessions.

Copernica Marketing Software's MailerQ</h2></div></div><p>
MailerQ is a high-performance mail transfer agent designed to do one
thing: deliver e-mail at blazing speed. Leveraging RabbitMQ to send up
to 10,000 e-mail messages per minute, MailerQ is targeted at users who want the
functionality of programs like Port25's PowerMTA but can't stomach
its high price. With MailerQ, users are limited only by the ability
to process incoming e-mail at the receiving end. The application puts
e-mail messages in a queue and enables its users to manage these messages themselves
and change parameters, such as send rate per receiving domain or IP or the
number of delivery attempts. To be as efficient as possible, MailerQ
stores messages in Couchbase NoSQL, which allows the retrieval
of content only when an SMTP connection has been established, thus
reducing the amount of data being passed back and forth in RabbitMQ
message queues.
