<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #144, April 2006</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>

<span   class="bold"><b>John W. Linville</b></span> has announced a new
<span   class="bold"><b>git</b></span> repository for his fork of the
<span   class="bold"><b>Fedora Core</b></span> kernels. This repository will take the Fedora kernel releases as
its base, and incorporate networking patches from the official kernels on
kernel.org. His goals are to allow Fedora users to access bleeding-edge
patches they otherwise would have to wait for and to convert the Fedora
user community into a testing resource for the kernel (specifically
networking) developers.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Eric Dean Moore</b></span> has assumed
maintainership of the previously unlisted <span   class="bold"><b>LSI
Logic MPT Fusion SCSI Drivers</b></span>. These drivers were split recently from a
single driver supporting SCSI and Fibre Channel to multiple drivers each
supporting a single interface. The irony of this is that although the
developers themselves chose to split the driver this way, the MPT Fusion's
main claim to fame is that it provides a single interface to both SCSI and
Fibre Channel hardware.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Alessandro Di Marco</b></span> has begun work on
<span   class="bold"><b>Sluggard</b></span>, a filesystem intended to
make kernel downloads less painful. As the kernel sources continue to grow,
it takes longer to download. Sluggard addresses this by putting rsync at its
back end. Users read files on the filesystem with their favorite tools, and
Sluggard transparently fetches any changed files just prior to access. In
this way, files that aren't needed are never downloaded. This has saved
Alessandro more than 200MB of disk space, and he says the potential exists to
save even more, depending on what kernel features one needs to compile.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Andrey Volkov</b></span> has coded up support for
the <span   class="bold"><b>ST M41T85 real-time clock chip</b></span>,
basing his work on <span   class="bold"><b>Mark A. Greer</b></span>'s
<span   class="bold"><b>ST M41T00 driver</b></span>. In fact, there is some
talk of merging Andrey's work into Mark's original driver. However, due to
many small differences in the hardware, it's not clear what the best
approach would be to avoid too many #if statements. It may turn out that
merging the two would create more complexity than a unified driver would be
worth. But, both Andrey and Mark have indicated that they'd be happy to do a
merge if it seemed like the right way to go.
</p><p>
Since <span   class="bold"><b>Sun</b></span> released its <span   class="bold"><b>ZFS filesystem</b></span> source code, <span   class="bold"><b>Tarkan Erimer</b></span> recently
asked if this meant it might be ported to Linux at some point in the future.
However, this doesn't seem likely, because Sun used the CDDL license, which
allows linking to other code released under nonfree licenses, thus making
it incompatible with the GPL. Unless Sun decides to dual-license ZFS under
CDDL and the GPL, there is no way a direct port of ZFS to Linux could be
legally included in the official tree. It is still possible that someone
will do a clean-room reimplementation of ZFS, without looking at any of
Sun's sources.
</p><p>
If <span   class="bold"><b>Linus Torvalds</b></span>' stance on <span   class="bold"><b>CVS</b></span> was not clear before, it is now. When it
was suggested that the kernel include documentation about existing CVS-based
kernel repositories, Linus said, &ldquo;I'd argue against it. CVS is a piece of
crap, and anybody who maintains stuff in CVS just makes it harder to ever
merge back. That's not just a theory&mdash;we've had that situation happen in
real life over the years, which is why I definitely don't want to see any
external CVS trees given any kind of recognition at all.&rdquo; There you have it.
</p><p>
One of the strengths of the Linux development philosophy is that it won't
blindly adhere to standards just because those standards exist. The
standards have to make sense as well, and in the case where a good standard
has not been followed for some reason, it has to make practical sense to
change into conformance with it. This came up recently when <span   class="bold"><b>Matthew Wilcox</b></span>
tried to fix the <span   class="bold"><b>NO_IRQ definition</b></span> to bring it into conformance with the
PCI standard. Linus pointed out that the standard had been ignored by
hardware makers for years, and that changing the NO_IRQ definition would
break a lot of existing drivers. In fact, the Linux kernel would be clearer
and simpler if some change were made to at least bring the various kernel
architectures into conformance with each other; and if all drivers could be
fixed to reflect this change, it would be the right thing to do. However, Linus
rejected that proposal, affirming that the existing design was a
mistake, but saying that the fix would break too much outside code.

Need some advice on figuring out the best way to get the most out of
OpenOffice.org? Now that the 2.0 versions are available, more and
more people are using this free office suite. You can find your way
around OOo well enough if you're moving from another suite, but you'll
definitely be more productive with some OOo know-how under your belt.
That's where <i  >LJ</i>.com columnist Bruce Byfield comes in, with his
bi-monthly series OOo Off the Wall. Recent topics include:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Find and Replace (<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/8791" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/8791</a>): how

Regular contributor Colin McGregor is working on a new how-to article for
<i  >LJ</i>.com readers about the Linux Infrared Remote Control (LIRC) Project
(<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/8811" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/8811</a>).
He'll explain what it is, what hardware/software is needed and how to
set up the software. For those of you feeling more adventuresome, Colin
also will share some thoughts on building your own infrared hardware.

Ask the network before you ask the source.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
&mdash;Jeremie Miller, from an IM with me
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
...consider this a warning shot for anyone who is relying on closed
source modules. What you are doing is trying to take from Linux and not
give anything back. The GPL explicitly forbids this, and Linux would not
be good enough today for you to be using it without that protection.
There is a reason why you are wanting to use Linux for your internal
use, and why your customers are asking for it.
