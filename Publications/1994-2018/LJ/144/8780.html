Use a small footprint Linux with some cheap hardware to create
a remote temperature monitor.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe88580.0xf802f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
I started this project to record and access temperature readings
remotely after I had a conversation with a friend who is in the HVAC
business. His job is to make sure the climate indoors is comfortable&mdash;not
too hot and not too cold, depending on the weather outside. He finds
many new installations have startup bugs that must be worked out,
because no two installations are exactly the same. The end of the job is
the most stressful. A customer calls after he is done and lets him know
something is wrong. The customer isn't happy, but he doesn't know where
to start looking for the problem because there isn't any good objective
information about what is going wrong with the installation.
</p><p>
We agreed that it would help to be able to record the outside temperature
and log the readings electronically. This would be one way of improving
the troubleshooting process. I then started the search to purchase
an off-the-shelf recorder that was inexpensive, easy to install and
simple to use. While looking, I found a wide range of commercial products
and kits. Some are standalone and some use a PC for displaying and
recording temperature data. Each of our three
requirements was equally important and I found that most of the products
were too expensive for our budget. Ease of installation was
typically another problem. Some devices had complicated
wiring or the requirement that they be placed where temperature
was measured. Many people consider thermostats to be just clutter on
a wall, so it wasn't going to be easy to convince them to have another box to
record temperature.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe88580.0xf80450"></a>
The Linux Solution</h2></div></div><p>
Finally, to solve the problems of cost and installation, I looked at
the possibility of building a system from components. Following the Linux
idea of assembling and integrating tools to get a task done, I looked
at using a digital multimeter, a PC and software to make them work
together. The digital multimeter with an RS-232 serial port interface would
measure temperature using a sensor. The PC would collect the data from
the multimeter and process it for display.
</p><p>
I was aware of open-source utilities for the multimeter serial port
interface using Linux and had purchased a multimeter earlier for general
troubleshooting. We had a retired PC available, so all the components
were on hand to build a prototype temperature recording system.
</p><p>
The digital multimeter came with a serial port cable and DOS software. I
didn't use the supplied DOS program. There was no way to modify the
program to allow temperature measurements with the sensor. Instead,
I used QuickBasic to write new software from the ground up. I had the
necessary details about the serial port interface for the multimeter, and
QuickBasic had all the features I needed. I got a prototype communication
program to work, but I ran into memory management issues with DOS and
QuickBasic as the application grew in size, especially when I started
dealing with the need to display and record data.
</p><p>
It seemed like a big step backward to struggle with memory management
at this point. I knew Linux would provide an environment where I
wouldn't need to be concerned with memory management, so I looked for
a distribution to use as a replacement for DOS.
</p><p>
I found that the most popular Linux distributions weren't appropriate
for this application. Even a minimal installation of these distributions
would exceed the capacity of the retired PC. The distribution I found that
overcame these restrictions was University Linux from Paul Muller. It
has small memory and disk requirements. I was able to run it on the
retired PC using less than 20MB of DOS formatted hard disk space and 24MB
of RAM. Best of all, the distribution is tolerant to power failures. If
the power goes out, the PC reboots without causing file corruption
problems that need manual help. This saves money and
reduces complexity, because I didn't need a UPS to keep the system running
during power failures.
</p><p>
Once I configured everything on the PC, there was no need for a keyboard
or monitor. I could use a Windows PC and Telnet, along with an Ethernet
connection to communicate with the system PC for development and testing. I
prefer to write and test incrementally, so I chose Perl for the language
for this project. University Linux comes with Perl version 5.003. I
couldn't use Perl modules, the application size was too small, so this was
a minor inconvenience. University Linux also includes Acme Labs thttpd
server. This allowed me to set up the system to use a Web browser
for viewing temperature measurements.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe88580.0xf80710"></a>
Testing Hardware</h2></div></div><p>
I used a Tandy Catalog No. 22-805 digital multimeter that comes with an
operating manual, DOS software, wire test leads and serial cable with
nine
pin connectors. According to the manual, the communication settings are
600 baud, seven data bits, two stop bits and no parity. Important
information was left out of the operating manual, but I found what
I needed on the Web. The DTR and RTS lines need special attention. The
DTR line has to be set low and the RTS line set high for the meter to
communicate through the serial port. It is impossible to get data from
the meter without the two lines set this way.
</p><p>
I could use only stty for serial communication with this distribution
and couldn't explicitly control the DTR and RTS lines in the script. This
meant I needed a hardware hack to make things work.
</p><p>
I found that DTR and RTS change from a low to high state when I call stty
in the script. This works out okay for DTR, but RTS has to remain low.
I realized that the second serial port on the PC has RTS low as it
isn't being used. If I connected the multimeter serial interface cable
RTS to the RTS pin of the second serial port, the multimeter would be
faked into seeing the correct line setting. I simply removed the
RTS line from the multimeter and connected it to the second serial port.
</p><p>
With that problem solved, I powered up the multimeter and put together
a short test script (serialtest.pl), as follows:

<pre     class="programlisting">

# !/usr/bin/perl
#
# serialtest.pl
#
# Script for reading Tandy Model 22-805 meter
# through serial port.

$port = "/dev/ttyS1"; # set to COM1

system ("stty 600 cs7 cstopb clocal -ixon -echo &lt; $port");

open (SERIALPORT, "+&gt;$port") or die "can't open $port. ";

print SERIALPORT ("\n"); #  take a reading

$R = &lt;SERIALPORT&gt;; # read returned string

print "$R" ;

close (SERIALPORT); # close port

exit 0;

</pre>
</p><p>
If the script ran successfully, I would get a string with the same
reading shown in the multimeter LCD. I set the multimeter to the
resistance measurement range and ran the script. The result was:


<pre     class="programlisting">
OH   O.L MOhm
</pre>
</p><p>
A good start! The hardware hack worked. Now it was on to measure a
temperature sensor with the multimeter.
</p><p>
I chose an NTC (negative temperature coefficient) thermistor for the
temperature sensor. Despite the fearsome sounding name, this is just
a small two-wire electronic component that changes electrical resistance
with temperature. With a multimeter, the resistance measurement provides
information to tell temperature. The thermistor is impossible to wire
backward, because it isn't voltage-polarity (+ or -) sensitive. This means one
less thing for the technician installing it in the field to worry about.
</p><p>
The thermistor isn't fragile, but the leads to the body can be broken
with excessive tugging or bending. I used a two-position terminal block
to solve this problem and make the connection to the wiring simple. I placed one
thermistor lead and a wire under a screw terminal and then tightened
the screw to make a solid mechanical and electrical contact.
</p><p>
With the thermistor connected to the ends of the test leads and the test
leads plugged in to the multimeter, I powered up and ran the test script
again. The result was a resistance reading:


<pre     class="programlisting">
OH  34.23kOhm
</pre>
</p><p>
The numeric portion of the reading is 34.23 with a k after it. The k
is an abbreviation for kilo or 1,000. Because the multimeter LCD doesn't
have enough characters to display large numbers, it uses a multiplier. In
this case 34.23k is 34,230 Ohms.
</p><p>
I found that this reading was very close to 0 degrees C by referencing a
table of resistance-to-temperature values supplied by the manufacturer. It
matched the temperature reading of another thermometer with a sensor in
the general area, so I was confident that this assembled system would
work and provide accurate readings.
</p><p>
Now it was time to create a script to to use the data and display the
temperature value.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe88580.0xf80ce8"></a>
Software Choices</h2></div></div><p>
Two choices were available to perform resistance-to-temperature conversion
in the script. I could use a lookup table with pairs of resistance-to-temperature values in an array. The sheer number of elements in this array
would be a drawback to this approach. A span from -40 degrees C to +40
degrees C
requires 81 (don't forget 0 degrees C) pairs of values. There was no
easy way to manipulate a text file available from the thermistor
manufacturer,
and entering the values by hand would take time and be prone to errors.
</p><p>
Instead, I used what's called the Steinhart-Hart equation (see sidebar). The equation
was developed in the late 1960s to help process ocean temperature data
collected with thermistors and provides direct conversion of resistance
to temperature. A spreadsheet utility found on the Web helped with
calculating coefficients unique to each family of thermistors and was used
in the equation.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe88580.0xf80e48"></a>
Display Data</h2></div></div><p>
Once the script calculates temperature from a multimeter reading, it
needs to be displayed or stored. With this in mind, I extended the test
script to convert and display temperature, and show the time and resistance
reading. University Linux uses the 2.0 kernel, and root user login by
Telnet is allowed. When ordinary users attempt to run the grabtemp.pl
script, an error is displayed because of the file permissions used for the
serial port, /dev/ttyS1. I fixed this by changing permissions with:


<pre     class="programlisting">
chmod a+x /dev/ttyS1
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, ordinary users could log in and run the script to check
temperature. They wouldn't need root access.
</p><p>
Here is the output from the resulting showtemp.pl script:

<pre     class="programlisting">
/perlserial: perl -w showtemp.pl
01-05-2006 14:43 34 F 1.3 C 30.52 k Ohms
</pre>
</p><p>
Here you can see the date, time, temperatures in degrees F and degrees
C, along with the actual resistance reading. I checked the temperature
where the sensor was located and found that the reading was accurate,
so the conversion formula part of the script worked.
</p><p>
Not too many computer users are comfortable with using a command-line
program interface. Web browsers with a point-and-click interface are
a lot less intimidating. So, I extended the script once
again to allow users to operate the system with a Web browser.
</p><p>
With the thttpd server configured and running, it was just a matter of
directing the output from the script to build a Web page for display. This
was fairly straightforward as the following code shows:
shows:

<pre     class="programlisting">

print "content-type: text/html \n\n";
print "&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;BODY&gt;&lt;P&gt;";
print "&lt;HEAD&gt;&lt;title&gt;Remote Temperature Measurement Page&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/HEAD&gt;";
print "&lt;H2&gt;Mechanical Room&lt;/H2&gt; ";
print '&lt;form action="webtemp.pl" method=post&gt; &lt;P&gt; &lt;P&gt;';
print "Interior Air Temperature = $out_tempF&lt;BR&gt;";
print "&lt;BR&gt;";
print "&lt;BR&gt;";
print "Date: $out_date  &lt;BR&gt;";
print "Time: $out_time  &lt;BR&gt;";
print "&lt;BR&gt;";
print '&lt;input type=submit value="Update Reading"&gt;';
print "&lt;/form&gt;";
print "&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;";

</pre>
</p><p>
Running the webtemp.pl script from /cgi-bin gives the user a display
like the example shown in Figure 1.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="8780f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. The temperature monitor now has a Web interface.
</p></div></div><p>
This example shows the temperature in the room as well as the time and
the date of the reading. You can press the Update Reading button to
rerun the script and display another temperature value.
</p><p>
It is easy to write an extension to the script to log temperature over
time. I put a line in the rc (boot) script that launches a data logging
script, which then runs continuously in the background. I found that I
could use measurement intervals of 5-10 minutes, because changes in
air temperature are slow indoors in an air-conditioned space.
</p><p>
You can access the temperature log through the command line by using
Telnet. Because the format was space-delimited, the date file was used
with Microsoft Excel to plot graphs and view trends. You can see a
sample output in Figure 2.

Security Concerns</h2></div></div><p>
The overall objective was to create a reliable and easy-to-use electronic
means to display and record temperature data. When you actually deploy
the system, the location of the system and the network connection can
vary widely. Depending on circumstances, you have to evaluate the
security concerns for each installation. You may have to implement
some workarounds to address the security concerns. For example, you can
log temperature readings in the form of text or HTML pages by a script
running in the background and not by a script in the cgi directory,
which isolates the logging process from Web access. Alternately, you
can gather data from this server using another secure server through
FTP or HTTP. This would add another layer to prevent direct access by
the outside world, but still make the information available.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe88580.0xf817e8"></a>
Future Extension</h2></div></div><p>
Digital multimeters are general-purpose electronic measurement
tools. Although I used a thermistor for temperature measurement in this
application, you can use other sensors that have resistance, voltage or
electrical current as outputs. Some other conditions to measure include
flow, pressure, weight, light level and humidity.
</p><p>
You don't need more multimeters to measure more than one temperature. You
can connect a single multimeter to a switching device. You then would create a
script to operate the switching device, which allows you to select one
temperature sensor at a time.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe88580.0xf81948"></a>
Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
This example shows how the tool concept behind Linux works for solving
applications where cost and flexibility requirements are important. The
wide variety of distributions available compared with other operating
systems meant developing a system with all the features needed was
practical. Additionally, you can add features using Perl and the
development environment provided by the University Linux distribution.
</p><p>The system can be duplicated for less than $100 US. The multimeter,
thermistor and wiring accessories are available from numerous electronics
retailers. Many retailers have Web sites, so it's easy to compare
features, specs and pricing before ordering. Purchasing a used digital
multimeter should be done with caution, as there is no easy way to
tell
whether accuracy of the instrument has been affected by the previous
use.

Thermistors and Steinhart-Hart Equation
</b></p><p>
The plot of resistance to temperature on a graph for a thermistor looks a
lot like the curve of a ski jump, and each family of thermistors has their
own unique curve. So, simple y = mx + b algebra won't help to convert
resistance to temperature. The equation of the curve can be described by
a polynomial. The Steinhart-Hart equation is a trinomial or an equation
with three terms. Solving the equation at each resistance measurement
point requires three coefficients; a, b and c. Some manufacturers provide
these for their thermistors. Others provide only tables of resistance
to temperature.
</p><p>
When the coefficients aren't available, a spreadsheet utility is available
to help find them using the manufacturer's tables. No algebra is
required;
simply enter the three values of temperature and resistance into the
spreadsheet and the coefficients are calculated automatically. They are
usually very small numbers, expressed in scientific notation. But the
calculated coefficients can be cut and pasted from the spreadsheet into
the Perl script for use, reducing errors from typing
