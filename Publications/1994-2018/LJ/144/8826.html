The open media revolution is upon us with blogs and podcasts leading the
way.

I'm writing this on the way back from the Consumer Electronics
Show (CES) in Las Vegas&mdash;the biggest tradeshow on Earth. This year, 150,000
visitors came to see 2,500 exhibits spread across 1.3 million square
feet. One of those visitors was Andrew Leyden of PenguinRadio, who
joined me for a day of hunting for Cool Linux Stuff. Andrew is a
consumer electronics veteran, making Linux-based Internet radios since 1999.
</p><p>
Andrew is a walking case study in resourcefulness and persistence, as
well as living proof that, as he puts it, &ldquo;The commercial sphere is
shrinking and the DIY sphere is growing.&rdquo;
</p><p>
You wouldn't have heard a statement like that from the brand-name
companies and keynoters who starred at CES. Not from Bill Gates, who
gave the opening keynote (which, in a long-standing tradition for me, I
missed&mdash;though thousands waited hours to attend). Not from Intel,
which brought Tom Hanks, Danny DeVito, Morgan Freeman and other stars on
stage to promote its proprietary new &ldquo;content delivery&rdquo; system. Not even
from Larry Page of Google, who gave a sincere, human and blessedly
unscripted keynote, guest-starring Robin Williams, who was funny as hell.
</p><p>
CES is a commercial sphere, and most of us continue to live in
commercial environments. That's what proprietary systems are. And, that's
why Google (which runs its massive search infrastructure on Linux and
participates in many open-source development communities) introduced a
raft of products and services at CES that ran only on Windows clients.
One was a new video store that worked only for Windows clients built by
Google, and which required Google's own DRM. When I asked Larry if and
when Google would come out with stuff that ran on other clients, he
admitted that it was &ldquo;a problem&rdquo; and said they're working on it. At
least when Google says that, I believe them. Out on the CES show floor,
when an executive with another company answered the same kind of
question with &ldquo;We're always looking to improve the user
experience&rdquo;,
Andrew and I could barely conceal our utter disbelief.
</p><p>
Of course, everybody talked about &ldquo;putting the user in
charge&rdquo; and
&ldquo;having your media your way&rdquo;, but there was little credit given to users
who really do take charge, operate independently and even produce their
own media. In his 1995 essay &ldquo;Death From Above&rdquo;, John Perry Barlow
wrote, &ldquo;America remains a place where companies produce and consumers
consume in an economic relationship which is still as asymmetrical as
that of bomber to bombee.&rdquo; It's bad enough that this asymmetry persists
in consumer electronics. It's especially discouraging to see leaders in
the computer business&mdash;Intel, Dell, Microsoft, Apple and even
Google&mdash;go Hollywood on us.
</p><p>
I heard about the user-side revolution only from bloggers, podcasters
and wiki writers, most of whom are glad to take advantage of Linux, open
source, free software and free markets. Consumer electronics is
gradually being transformed by all these developments, even as its
largest brand names still labor, with success, to herd consumers into
proprietary silos and walled gardens, now guarded by shiny new DRM systems.
</p><p>
But the revolution will soon become undeniable, even if it isn't televised.
</p><p>
When I first started talking with Andrew, seven years ago, PenguinRadio
was a hardware start-up, making radios for playing .mp3 streams. The
company still does that, but now most of its revenue comes from
advertising in its podcast directory (<a href="http://podcastdirectory.com" target="_self">podcastdirectory.com</a>). Weekly
visitors have gone from 150 to 3 million.
</p><p>
A good starting point for measuring the growth of podcasting appears in
&ldquo;DIY Radio With Podcasting&rdquo;, a piece I wrote for IT Garage
(<i  >Linux Journal</i>'s sister
site) on September 29, 2004. There, I said, &ldquo;... now most of my
radio listening is to what Adam Curry and others are starting to call
podcasts. That last link currently brings up 24 results on Google. A
year from now, it will pull up hundreds of thousands, or perhaps even
millions.&rdquo;
</p><p>
I guessed low. According to Wikipedia, &ldquo;There were 526 hits on September
30, then 2,750 three days later. The number doubled every few days,
passing 100,000 by October 18. A year later, Google found more than
100,000,000 hits on the word 'podcasts'.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Today (in early January 2006), &ldquo;blog&rdquo; brings up 510 million.
Perspective: that's 56 million more than the word &ldquo;consumer&rdquo;.
</p><p>
&ldquo;Weblog&rdquo; brings up 141 million. &ldquo;Wiki&rdquo; brings up 240 million.
</p><p>
Compare those to some of the numbers we tracked in UpFront (p. 20), and
you'll see how big this transformation is.
</p><p>
It has been my privilege to stand several inches away from ground zero
for both the Weblog and podcast explosions. My own blog
(<a href="http://doc.weblogs.com" target="_self">doc.weblogs.com</a>) was launched in October 1999, when
&ldquo;blogfather&rdquo; (of
weblogs.com, RSS and too many other developments to name) Dave Winer sat
me down and insisted I start blogging. Today my blog is in Technorati's
Top 100, out of the 24.7 million blogs (or sources of RSS feeds) tracked
by the service. Of the 3.55 million results Google yields for my name,
2.61 also mention &ldquo;blog&rdquo;. That's compared to 510,000 that also
mention &ldquo;linux&rdquo;.
</p><p>
Technorati was born in November 2003, when David Sifry hacked it up as a
research tool to help write the first <i  >Linux Journal</i> story on blogging.
Today Technorati is the #708 Web site on Earth, according to Alexa's
traffic rankings. That's ahead of the A9.com search engine, which (like
Alexa) is owned by Amazon.com. Technorati is searched several dozen
million times a day. (Disclosure: I'm on the Technorati advisory board.)
</p><p>
As for podcasting, I enjoy membership in the Gillmor Gang, a popular
weekly podcast that began in 2004. Steve Gillmor's gang takes an hour or
so of my time each week. Blogging takes more, but mostly because my
efforts have spread to IT Garage, my <span   class="emphasis"><em>SuitWatch</em></span> newsletter
and <i  >Linux Journal</i>'s own Web site, all of which have RSS feeds and plenty of
subscribers. Although my personal blog might run up to a thousand or more
words a day, it doesn't take much time because I treat it as a form of
public e-mail: a kind of &ldquo;cc:world&rdquo;. In fact, most of what I write in my
blog is in response to e-mails. The rest is in response to subscriptions
to keyword searches in Technorati, Pubsub, Google's Blogsearch and other
engines that operate in the Live Web that updates constantly (rather
than from the relatively Static Web of sites that change slowly and
aren't syndicated).
</p><p>
I say all this because I think that many
people&mdash;even some <i  >Linux Journal</i>
readers&mdash;still don't know the extremely high leverage
blogging, podcasting and wiki writing can provide. If you write
something useful, or provocative, that adds substance to the
world&mdash;and if you link out to others who serve as sources or also have
interesting things to say&mdash;the results can be amazing. Search for
&ldquo;Saving the Net&rdquo; or &ldquo;Linux is a species&rdquo;, and you'll find stuff I wrote
(both for <i  >Linux Journal</i>) at or near the top of the results.
</p><p>
These results aren't due to &ldquo;search engine optimization&rdquo;, but rather to
the fact that I try to write stuff that's useful, funny, moving,
productive or otherwise interesting&mdash;knowing that others will want to
write about the same things.
</p><p>
All three of this month's topics&mdash;blogs, podcasts and wikis&mdash;are
extraordinarily useful levers on the world. One big reason is that
they're personal. Back in the early days of Weblogging, Dave Winer
described a blog as &ldquo;the unedited voice of an
individual&rdquo;.
</p><p>
Blogs and podcasts (and even wikis in some cases) can make us much more
valuable as employees as well. My roommate at CES was Robert Scoble, a
friend of many years who has recently become Microsoft's most well-known
blogger, with around 25,000 readers a day. A few days before we got
together at CES, Robert raised eyebrows by lambasting his employer for
taking down a blogger under pressure from the Chinese government.
Speaking frankly to, as well as for, his employer, has been good for
both Robert and Microsoft.
</p><p>
Yet, we still tend to see companies as the main instruments of progress,
even when the subject is open source.
</p><p>
For example, take a <span   class="emphasis"><em>BusinessWeek</em></span> article
(<a href="http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/dec2005/tc20051228_262746.htm" target="_self">www.businessweek.com/technology/content/dec2005/tc20051228_262746.htm</a>)
from December 28, 2005. The title says &ldquo;A Watershed for Open Source In
2005&rdquo;, and the teaser subhead says &ldquo;The software movement finally gained
traction in Corporate America and saw a new influx of VC cash. How will
2006 shape up?&rdquo; The article lists and describes the &ldquo;five biggest
open-source events of 2005&rdquo;. The five involve 1) Red Hat, 2) Sun
Microsytems, 3) Motorola, 4) Firefox and 5) venture capitalists.
</p><p>
If I had to name five watersheds, I would list developments instead of
events. And I would look at what developers and users are doing together
over a long period of time, rather than what companies, funders and
projects happened to do in the year just past.
</p><p>
Three of my top five developments would be blogs, wikis and podcasts.
Not sure what the other two would be. Why? Because I've heard Linus and
the kernel developers say, &ldquo;That's user space. I don't do user
space.&rdquo; So
my natural response is to say &ldquo;That's not user space. I only do
user space.&rdquo;
</p><p>
The fun thing about blogs, wikis and podcasts is that users and
developers work closely together. In fact, that interaction is essential
to progress. For evidence, look at the collaboration around microformats,
tagging, structured blogging and OPML. The standards and practices of
blogs, podcasts and wikis are all being pushed forward by individuals
and developers, working together.
</p><p>
In fact, my favorite explanation of what's good about the GPL came from
Mark Pilgrim, in a blog post titled &ldquo;Freedom 0&rdquo;
(<a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2004/05/14/freedom-0" target="_self">diveintomark.org/archives/2004/05/14/freedom-0</a>), written
shortly after Six Apart came up with a restrictive new license for
Movable Type, its formerly (somewhat) open-source blogging software.
One excerpt:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Many people misunderstand Free Software and the GNU General Public
License. Many people equate the GPL to the boogeyman, because it's
&ldquo;viral&rdquo;, and that sounds like a bad thing. Here's what viral
licensing means: GPL software has the restrictions that it has, and
that's it. The GPL is quite restrictive on developers, not at all on
end users. (More on that in a minute.) Regardless, GPL software has
the restrictions that it has, but it can never become more
restrictive. An upgrade can't take away freedoms that I enjoyed with
an older version.
</p><p>
A side effect of this is that if I write a GPL program and then
lose interest, and someone else picks it up and continues
development, they are forced to release their version under the GPL.
A new developer can't take away freedoms that I enjoyed with the old
version either.
</p><p>
I mention this because it's exactly what happened with WordPress. It
started life as b2, which was abandoned. But a year ago, a new
community coalesced around a fork of the original b2, and it became
WordPress. The new community included some of the original
developers, and many new developers. Because the original software
was GPL-licensed, WordPress was also GPL-licensed....
</p><p>
...I will never be surprised by the licensing of new versions of
WordPress.
</p><p>
Freedom 0 is the freedom to run the program, for any purpose.
WordPress gives me that freedom; Movable Type does not. It never
really did, but it was &ldquo;free enough&rdquo; so we all looked the other way,
myself included. But Movable Type 3.0 changes the rules, and prices
me right out of the market. I do not have the freedom to run the
program for any purpose; I have only the limited set of freedoms
that Six Apart chooses to bestow upon me....
</p><p>
WordPress is free software. Its rules will never change. In the
event that the WordPress community disbands and development stops, a
new community can form around the orphaned code. It's happened once
already. In the extremely unlikely event that every single
contributor (including every contributor to the original b2) agrees
to relicense the code under a more restrictive license, I can still
fork the current GPL-licensed code and start a new community around
it. There is always a path forward. There are no dead ends.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Today, a search for &ldquo;WordPress&rdquo; brings up 58 million results on Google. A
search for &ldquo;Movable Type&rdquo; brings up 46.3 million.
</p><p>
I give enormous credit to Mena and Ben Trott, who wrote Movable Type
and founded Six Apart, which today hosts millions of MT-based TypePad
blogs. The fact that Movable Type was &ldquo;free enough&rdquo; helped launch and
continues to grow the blogging movement. I also give credit to Google's
Blogger and Userland's Radio Userland (which runs on Manila, which is
written in Frontier, a scripting environment created by Dave Winer, who
open sourced it with the GPL in 2004).
</p><p>
Yet the bulk of development work around blogging (including work on
syndication, tagging, outlining and other standards and practices)
happens outside the corporate context. Matt Mullenweg is better known
for his work with WordPress than for whoever his employer happens to be.
</p><p>
Here's a revealing fact: the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Wall Street Journal</em></span>'s new blogs
(<a href="http://blogs.wsj.com" target="_self">blogs.wsj.com</a>) run on WordPress.
</p><p>
There's a reason this column is called Linux for Suits rather than
Linux for Companies. It's because Linux is about the people who write
and use it, not about companies. Note the distinction Linux kernel
hackers make between &ldquo;kernel space&rdquo; and &ldquo;user
space&rdquo;. My beat here is
the business corner of user space. I'm more interested in what people do
with Linux at companies than in what &ldquo;Linux Companies&rdquo; are up to.
</p><p>
Blogs, wikis and podcasts grow naturally through the contributions of
countless individuals in an environment built and enriched by work on
free and open code. Non-free and non-open code can flourish there too.
But it's important to remember where this environment came from. Plenty
of credit is due to companies. But far more is due to individuals. It's
what they produce that matters most. Not what the rest of us consume.
