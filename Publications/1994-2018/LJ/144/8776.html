Blog-City.com is a Linux-based feature-rich blogging community that
delivers a robust and heavily-customizable blogging experience.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x261d580.0x2715348"></a></h2></div></div><p>
One combination free/pay blog site available on the Internet is
Blog-City.com. This site runs on a farm of Dell PowerEdge Blade
servers, each with six dual-CPU blades running Red Hat Linux
9. Blog-City.com runs Java's JDK 1.4.x underneath BlueDragon
(<a href="http://www.newatlanta.com/products/bluedragon" target="_self">www.newatlanta.com/products/bluedragon</a>). BlueDragon is the
same ColdFusion Markup Language (CFML) application that runs
MySpace.com. MySpace.com is the fifth largest Web site in the world.
</p><p>
Blog-City offers no static content. It dynamically constructs every page
as it is requested by pulling it from a MySQL 4.1.x database that is
replicated for both backup and administrative purposes. Blog-City uses
MySQL 5.0 for a caching server to speed up access time, and it uses MySQL
4.1.x for all of the access and referrer statistics.
These separate
database servers keep the load for particular types of access from
bogging down other types of access.
</p><p>
For Web service, Apache 1.3.x communicates with BlueDragon through
mod_backhand (<a href="http://www.backhand.org/mod_backhand" target="_self">www.backhand.org/mod_backhand</a>) with a Java library
the company wrote and then released back to the community to make
sure that the load balancing works properly for the application
server. The mod_backhand module load balances only the Web server by
default. Blog-City uses additional mini-farms to produce RSS feeds and
answer search engine queries. There is also custom software for handling
spam, denial-of-service attacks and a bug-tracking system.
All in all,
Blog-City is an operation that is spread over a number of time zones
and multiple continents, just like its users.

Creating a Blog</h2></div></div><p>
Before trying to create a blog in Blog-City, try various URLs in the
format of word.blog-city.com to see which ones are already in use (for
example, <a href="http://kleekai.blog-city.com" target="_self">kleekai.blog-city.com</a>). Once you find something you think
is available, go to <a href="http://www.blog-city.com" target="_self">www.blog-city.com</a> (Figure 1) and find the Free Signup
box. Enter the name you want to use for your blog in the text box. For
the above example, you would enter kleekai. Next, click Submit to open the
Create New Blog dialog box (Figure 2) and walk through the rest of the
blog creation process.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8776f1.large.jpg"><img src="8776f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

Figure 2. The Blog-City Create New Blog Dialog Box
</p></div></div><p>
Go to your blog's URL to log in to your blog for the first time. You
also can click through one of the links on the creation page or click one
of the links in your confirmation e-mail. When you do, you will see your
initial blog page (Figure 3).

</p></div></div><p>
Enter your e-mail address and password in the Login Console text boxes,
and then click Login. Once you reach the Main Administration page (Figure
4), bookmark it. This is where you need to go whenever you want to change
something on your blog or check your statistics. Much like UNIX, there
is often more than one way to get to a particular option through this
interface. This article focuses on one path for each.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8776f4.large.jpg"><img src="8776f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. The Blog-City Main Administration Page
</p></div></div><p>
The tabs across the top of this page lead to:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Home: view Main Administration page.
</p></li><li><p>
Blog-It: create a new blog entry.
</p></li><li><p>
Entries: view and delete existing posts, and see how many times each
item has been read and commented on. Blog-City supports a variety of
entry types, including regular blog posts, reviews, photo albums, events
and podcasts.
</p></li><li><p>
Look'n'Feel: control your blog's layout, themes, headers, menus and more.
</p></li><li><p>
Settings: alter your personal and blog settings.
</p></li><li><p>
Extra: access statistics, account details and more.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Along the left, what you see depends on whether you have a premium (paid)
account or not. The top grouping of links leads to:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Home: the Main Administration page.
</p></li><li><p>
Write a new blog entry: the blog entry creation page.
</p></li><li><p>
View Latest Comments: the most recent comments made to your blog,
the entry to which they were made, when they were made and the ability to
delete, reply or report them as spam.
</p></li><li><p>
View Latest Trackbacks: premium-only&mdash;rather than replying in
comments, some people create trackbacks, which are essentially replies
made on their own blogs. By clicking this link and then Change Your
Trackback Options, you can tell Blog-City to send you an e-mail whenever a
trackback is made.
</p></li><li><p>
View Latest Statistics: premium-only&mdash;takes you to your Statistics
page, where you can view the most-read blog posts, the most-commented,
how many hits you have had per month and within a month, the browsers
that have been used to access your blog, what pages referred people to
your blog and which are your top podcasts.
</p></li><li><p>
View Podcast Statistics: premium-only&mdash;see which are your most
popular podcasts.
</p></li><li><p>
Manage Your LinkBlog: a LinkBlog is a list of links with comments
displayed for each. This link lets you create a LinkBlog and manage its
contents. It also provides the URL and RSS feeds where you and
others can find the content.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Beneath this group on the left are:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Hits since date: date is either when the blog was created or the last
time you reset the hit counter. To reset the counter, click the date and
then click OK. This action does not reset any other statistics.
</p></li><li><p>
Total Blog Entries: how many posts you've made on your blog, and a
statistic of how many posts that makes per day.
</p></li><li><p>
Total Comments: how many comments people have posted.
</p></li><li><p>
Mailing-List Subscribers: how many people have signed up to receive
e-mail notifications when you put up a new post. Click through the link
to see non-anonymous subscribers.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
There are many more items in the Main Administration page, including:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Recently Published Entries: the last five blog entries you published.
</p></li><li><p>
Entries not yet published: entries you saved as drafts rather than
publishing.
</p></li><li><p>
My Notes: any notes you have created (go to Extra -&lt; Your Notes to
do so).
</p></li><li><p>
News: the most recent News posting from the Blog-City staff.
</p></li><li><p>
TimeZone: your local time for you to check.
</p></li><li><p>
Quick Tip: a tip that may tell you how to do something you didn't
know you could do.
</p></li><li><p>
Additional information: includes pricing and availability of new
features, such as podcasting.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
You'll find additional options related to RSS, posting by e-mail and
more by clicking the Settings tab. Also, note the link to your own blog
in the upper-left corner. At any time, you can click this link to view your
own blog. Clicking through here makes sure that your test views aren't
counted among your viewer statistics, which is a nice way to make sure
they don't get artificially inflated.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x261d580.0x2b0f4e0"></a>
It's All about Looks</h2></div></div><p>
Most people want to get their blog looking the way they want it before
they start to enter content. To do this, click the Look'n'Feel tab to
change to the Main Blog Layout page (Figure 5). Here, you see a visual
representation of your layout with labels in place. Those that are
clickable are items you can change. Those that aren't are for premium
accounts.

Figure 5. The Blog-City Main Blog Layout Page
</p></div></div><p>
The links along the left of this page are:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Main Blog Layout: the layout chart you're looking at now.
</p></li><li><p>
Custom Home Page: premium-only&mdash;lets you design a new layout chart
completely from scratch.
</p></li><li><p>
Layout Style&mdash;lets you choose how the page should be laid out from
a list of templates. Premium users get many more layout options.
</p></li><li><p>
Theme Editor: lets you change your page's theme.
</p></li><li><p>
Menu Editor: premium-only&mdash;lets you create menus to appear on your site
that can be used for navigation purposes.
</p></li><li><p>

</p></li><li><p>

portlets.
</p></li><li><p>
News Feeds: premium-only&mdash;lets you set what RSS feeds to
subscribe to, and then display it in a subset page (such as
<a href="http://kleekai.blog-city.com/newsfeed" target="_self">kleekai.blog-city.com/newsfeed</a>), or in a portlet.
</p></li><li><p>
Custom Portlets: premium-only&mdash;lets you create and manage portlets of
your own using the HTML editor window.
</p></li><li><p>
Blog Board: lets you access your Blog Board (portlet where users
can leave quick messages or chat) content, clear it out or set delays
on when comments will appear.
</p></li><li><p>
Neighborhood: premium-only&mdash;lets you create a subpage (such as
<a href="http://kleekai.blog-city.com/neighborhood" target="_self">kleekai.blog-city.com/neighborhood</a>) that contains a list of other
blogs you track. You can mark this page to be linked off of your main
page.
</p></li><li><p>
eBAY Listing: premium-only&mdash;lets you show the latest items for sale in
particular categories or by particular users.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
The links within the chart are:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Edit the blog's META data: premium-only&mdash;opens a window letting you
set the META tags for your blog.
</p></li><li><p>
Edit your main blog header: opens a window (Figure 6) that lets
you edit the top of your blog page. Start by changing the Page Title,
which you probably want to make a bit more expressive than just the
single-word term in your blog's name. Mark how you want the header to
behave in the drop-down list box, and then below the formatting buttons,
enter the rest of what you would like to appear on the top of each
page. This box and its WYSIWYG formatting tools essentially will be the
same no matter where you're modifying content for the site. If you prefer
to work with raw HTML, click the Source button on the top left. If you
want to see the changes, click Save Details and then, on the main page,
click the blog name to open your blog as discussed earlier.
</p></li><li><p>
Edit the options for your main home page: opens the Home Page Options
dialog box, which lets you set particular behavior features for the blog.
</p></li><li><p>
Edit the blog entry options: opens the Edit Blog Entry Options dialog
box, which lets you set behaviors for all of your blog posts.
</p></li><li><p>
Edit your main blog footer: premium-only&mdash;opens the Blog Footer
window, letting you set what appears at the bottom of every blog page.
</p></li><li><p>
Insert Portlet: portlets are the fancy widgets along the side of
your blog. Click Insert Portlet to tell the administration console
that you want to insert a new portlet at the exact position you chose,
and it opens an Insert a new portlet dialog box. If you want to move a
portlet up or down, click the up or down button in its box within the
chart. To remove a portlet, click the X in its box. Premium subscribers
have a much longer list of portlets they can use than free subscribers do.

Figure 6. The Blog-City Blog Header Page
</p></div></div><p>
Because so many people like to customize blog themes, it's worth
discussing how to do so in Blog-City. Choose Look'n'Feel -&lt; Theme Editor to access the proper page. Here, you can preview existing
themes available to all Blog-City members by going to the
Community Themes section and choosing one of the themes in the list,
or you can click the right or left arrows to cycle through the list of
themes. If a theme appears as only a white box, it is available, there
is simply no preview. When you find a theme you want to use, click Use
This Theme. Then, in the Save Theme section above, click the check box for
Make this theme my live/public theme, and click Save Current Theme. Load
your blog and you will see the new theme has been put into place.
</p><p>
If you want, you can choose a theme to use as a base and then edit its
contents. To do this, follow the instructions just given, but then in
the Your Themes section, choose the theme from the drop-down list box and
click Load Theme. Once you have done this, you will see all of the styles used in this theme along the left of the Theme
Editor. Click Preview Theme to see how the theme looks. When you mouse over
the preview, you will see pop-ups that show you which of the style tags
applies to which of the sections.
</p><p>
To edit a style setting, click it on the left to bring up the
CSS settings for the particular style (Figure 7), and then alter the
settings. On the left you can type in things directly, or you can use
the selectors on the right to choose from listed options. Once your
changes have been made, click Update &amp; Preview to see the preview pane
with your alterations in place. You can then click Return to edit style
to go back and change what you just did.

Theme's .pagetitle CSS Setting
</p></div></div><p>
When you are finished changing the theme, click save/load at the top
of the style listing. This action takes you back to the Theme Management
main page. Change the name of the theme in the Current Theme Name,
click the box to make the theme your live/public theme, and then click
Save Current Theme. When you update your blog, the new settings should
be in place.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x261d580.0x2b10ae0"></a>
Posting to Your Blog</h2></div></div><p>
Now that you have your blog set up, you probably want to post something. Click
the Blog-It tab at the top of the page to go to your Create New Blog Entry page
(Figure 8), and then fill in the fields:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Title: the title for the post.
</p></li><li><p>
Summary: you either can fill this in explicitly or let the software
do it for you by pulling out the first 250 characters from your post. As
you might imagine, this can end up trailing off in the middle of
a sentence.
</p></li><li><p>
Link to entry: lets you tell Blog-City to use a specific URL instead
of using the title as the URL, which is handy if you need to be able to
spell out the link to people later.
</p></li><li><p>
The content box: enter the content for your blog.
</p></li></ul></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8776f8.large.jpg"><img src="8776f8.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 8. The Blog-City Create New Blog Entry Page
</p></div></div><p>
When you're finished, click Save and publish if you're finished
with the post and ready to put it up, click Save entry in draft if you're not
ready to publish it, or click Preview if you want to see what the post will
look like. If you have people signed up for your mailing list (look in
Extra -&lt; Mailing List to see how many members&mdash;people can sign up right from
your front page), you want to have checked the Send an alert e-mail to your
mailing-list check box before posting. If you saved the entry
to draft, you can post it later by clicking the Home tab, looking in
the Entries not yet published section and clicking the entry title,
and then clicking Publish Entry to the left of the content.
</p><p>
Click the Entries tab to add other types of content. An Entry generally
refers to a blog post, but you also can post reviews, photos
and Events. The administration section changes as often as the Blog-City
staff adds new features, so be sure to explore it as time goes on, so you
don't miss something new and cool.
</p><p>
Happy blogging!
