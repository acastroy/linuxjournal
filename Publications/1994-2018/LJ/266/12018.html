<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #266, June 2016</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
An effort to speed up <span   class="bold"><b>futex locks</b></span> for real-time software has hit a snag,
though possibly not a permanent one. <span   class="bold"><b>Thomas
Gleixner</b></span> posted some patches
to eliminate collisions between the hash values used to track futex state
changes. These collisions didn't break the locks; they just slowed things
down. Thomas' code would speed up the threads that used his code, but
only if most other threads allowed the collisions to take place. His
reasoning was that real-time applications could call his routines,
while normal code could do things the old way.
</p><p>
There were various objections. One was that, as <span   class="bold"><b>Linus
Torvalds</b></span> put it,
&ldquo;the <span   class="emphasis"><em>last</em></span> thing you want is programmers saying 'I'm so important that I
want the special futex'. Because every single programmer thinks they are
special and that <span   class="emphasis"><em>their</em></span> code is special. I know&mdash;because
I'm special.&rdquo;
</p><p>
But his main objection, first voiced by <span   class="bold"><b>Ingo
Molnar</b></span>, was that Thomas'
code introduced an <span   class="bold"><b>ABI</b></span> (application binary interface) change that was
highly specialized, but that would have to be carried into the future
and supported in the kernel on a permanent basis, long after any value
it once possessed had disappeared.
</p><p>
The solution, proposed by Ingo, was to enable Thomas' code for all futex
use by default. This would have the annoying quality of making the code
less useful for real-time applications, because all other applications
would see the same benefit. But, it had the benefit of actually being an
improvement even if everyone used it equally, and also of avoiding the
ABI change.
</p><p>
Binary interface changes are killers. I think Linus would staple
his arm to the table before he'd accept a patch that causes existing
compiled software to break. Application programmer interfaces (APIs)
are different. Those can be deprecated and replaced gradually, as users
update their source code to use the new procedures. It's a hassle and
takes a long time, but it's doable. ABI changes? Not so much.
</p><p>
The nightmare holy grail of <span   class="bold"><b>cgroup</b></span> implementation continues at a breakneck
pace. Trying to make a single piece of hardware look like it's actually
multiple independent systems, and having that be secure, while letting
all software run natively on the original hardware, turns out to be one
of the more insane of the many world-changing things that have found
Linux at their absolute center.
</p><p>
Adding features to cgroups is like trying to climb up a sheer cliff
using only your teeth and the tips of your toes. The cadre of the insane
includes <span   class="bold"><b>Bandan Das</b></span>, who recently submitted some
patches to get <span   class="bold"><b>workqueues</b></span>
running under cgroups.
</p><p>
Workqueues are primarily a coding construct that allows user code to set
certain low-priority tasks in motion, memory allocations and whatnot,
without having to wait for them to finish. Workqueues typically
are handled by dedicated worker threads that plow through them as system
load permits.
</p><p>
One of the features of Bandan's patches was to allow a given workqueue
to be handled by a worker thread that was dedicated to the particular
virtual server that was associated with that workqueue. This way resource
accounting wouldn't break, and the underlying system could track
properly which virtual server should be given how much RAM, CPU time and so on.
</p><p>
Bandan's patch didn't encounter the kind of byzantine security objections
that often hit cgroup features, but it did exhibit some unexplained
slowdowns. Once those are resolved and Bandan submits the code for
actual inclusion in the kernel, the security hawks undoubtedly
will descend from their watchful perches for feeding time.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Shuah Khan</b></span> has been working on stopping media devices from periodically
hanging the system under certain circumstances. Apparently, some of the
existing media device code would allow users to release a device while
it was still in use, after which bad things would happen, up to and
including a full-on system crash. She posted some patches to implement
a proper sequence of events of media device shutdown that also
would account for the fact that any given media device may have multiple users
and various pieces of software waiting to grab it.
</p><p>
During the course of discussion, Shuah, <span   class="bold"><b>Takashi
Iwai</b></span> and <span   class="bold"><b>Mauro Carvalho
Chehab</b></span> discussed how to organize the work so that it could be developed
in an ongoing way and possibly made useful for more than just media
devices. They planned to nail down the API so user code could start using
it, then to begin to flesh out to fixes and features, and finally to put the
whole thing into git, rather than have it be just a set of patches coming
in through e-mail.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Jens Axboe</b></span> hurled his keyboard across the room, ran to the window and
threw it open and shouted into the dark of night, &ldquo;Since the dawn of
time, our <span   class="bold"><b>background buffered writeback</b></span> has sucked!!!!!!!&rdquo; Enough was
enough. He was sick of waiting for background writes to finish while
managers and users screamed at him that their production systems had
locked up. Not only that, but his <span   class="bold"><b>Chrome</b></span> was slower too.
</p><p>
He posted some patches to relegate background buffered writeback to
its proper place in the universe&mdash;a background process that doesn't
interfere with user activity.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Holger Hoffst&auml;tte</b></span> loved the code and backported it to Linux 4.4.x,
reporting wonderful smoothness. <span   class="bold"><b>Dave Chinner</b></span>, on the other hand, concocted
a test suite that was able to expose some performance problems with Jens'
code that made the system a bit worse than it had been before. He and
Jens worked on reproducing and fixing that issue together.

<h2 class="title">Android Candy: More Life Gamification</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #266, June 2016</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
You might remember a couple months ago my mention of Habitica, which is
a gamification of your daily to-do list. One of my friends on Twitter
mentioned an app he uses on Android called Wokamon, which ties in with
your FitBit (or any of several other &ldquo;step-counter&rdquo; devices). Based on
how many steps you take in a day, your Wokamon grows and evolves into
a larger, more powerful...well...Wokamon.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12018androidf1.large.jpg"><img src="12018androidf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
It's absurd, but it's still incredibly fun to see your steps make a
little Tamagachi-like digital critter grow. The other aspect of the game
is that tapping on the screen will earn you crystals, which can be used to
purchase upgrades. Those upgrades make your Wokamon grow faster. You
also can watch short ads to get a treasure chest full of crystals. That
allows you to buy even more things and also gives the game's developers 
a little ad revenue for their efforts.
</p><p>
I have no idea whether Wokamon is something I'll keep playing with, because
there doesn't seem to be much in the way of competition. Maybe that's
just because I'm the only person I know in real life who uses it. Still,
it's fun for now, and it has forced me to consider another project for the
future&mdash;namely, how to create an automated &ldquo;screen
tapper&rdquo; so I can earn
crystals all night long while I sleep. I figure anything that helps me
think of crazy future projects is worth my time. If it sounds interesting
to you, just search for &ldquo;Wokamon&rdquo; in the Google Play store. It's free and oddly entertaining.

I do a lot of my day-job work on a Windows computer. Part of this
involves taking screenshots for training purposes. For years, I've used
the built-in &ldquo;Snipping Tool&rdquo; that comes with Windows, but I've always
hated it.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12018fossf1.large.jpg"><img src="12018fossf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
The other day, I happened across an open-source tool for Windows that
launches with a tap of the &ldquo;Print Screen&rdquo; key, and it offers a flexible,
easy to use screenshot process. You can save the screenshot, but my
favorite part is that it can be dumped directly into a program like
Paint.NET (my favorite Windows graphics editor, and it's also open source).
</p><p>
If you are on Windows and wish you had a simple way to take a screenshot,
check out Greenshot today. It's open source and works amazingly
well: <a href="http://getgreenshot.org" target="_self">getgreenshot.org</a>.

<h2 class="title">Ubuntu MATE, Not Just a Whim</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #266, June 2016</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
I've stated for years how much I dislike Ubuntu's Unity interface. Yes,
it's become more polished through the years, but it's just not an interface that
thinks the same way I do. That's likely because I'm old and inflexible,
but nevertheless, I've done everything I could to avoid using Unity, which
usually means switching to Xubuntu. I actually really like Xubuntu,
and the Xfce interface is close enough to the GNOME 2 look, that I hardly
miss the way my laptop used to look before Unity.
</p><p>
I wasn't alone in my disdain for Ubuntu's flagship desktop manager
switch, and many folks either switched to Xubuntu or moved to another
Debian/Ubuntu-based distro like Linux Mint. The MATE desktop started as
a hack, in fact, because GNOME 3 and Unity were such drastic changes. I
never really got into MATE, however, because I thought it was going to
be nothing more than a hack and eventually would be unusable due to
old GNOME 2 libraries phasing out and so forth.
</p><p>
I was wrong.
</p><p>
I'm very happy I was wrong, and with the advent of Ubuntu 16.04 LTS,
I decided Ubuntu MATE (now officially in the Ubuntu family) was here
to stay. It was the first version of 16.04 that I installed, and I've
never looked back. Running Ubuntu MATE is like living in an alternate
reality where GNOME 3 and Unity were never invented. Imagine if GNOME
2 was still king, and you could tweak your desktop to look exactly like
it always looked when using GNOME. It's glorious.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12018matef1.large.jpg"><img src="12018matef1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
Xubuntu, I still love you. You got me through a rough patch, and I'll
forever be grateful. But I'm now an Ubuntu MATE man, and I have no
plans of changing. And, if MATE 3.0 suddenly changes everything good
about desktop computing again, I'll dust of my Xubuntu installer,
and apologize for ever leaving!
</p><p>
Due to its bringing back of the GNOME 2 interface in a stable, updated
way, Ubuntu MATE 16.04 gets this month's Editors' Choice award (and also
my sincere thanks). You MATE folks are awesome.

<h2 class="title">Nightfall on Linux</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Joey Bernard</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #266, June 2016</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
In my last few articles, I've looked at
general astronomy programs
that are helpful for many tasks you might need to do in your stargazing
career. But, several specific jobs are more complicated and
require specialized software to make relevant calculations, so in this
article, let's look at Nightfall
(<a href="http://www.hs.uni-hamburg.de/DE/Ins/Per/Wichmann/Nightfall.html" target="_self">www.hs.uni-hamburg.de/DE/Ins/Per/Wichmann/Nightfall.html</a>). 
</p><p>
Nightfall is a program that can handle
calculations involving binary star systems.
It can animate binary star
systems, taking into account not only orbital speeds but also rotational
motion and the changing shape of stars due to their close
positions. You can model what it would look like and what kind of light
curves you would register when observing a binary system. You even
can take a set of actual observational data and find a best-fit model for the
system you are studying. 
</p><p>
Most distributions don't include a package for
Nightfall, so you need to build it from source. There are several
dependencies, so the instructions following assume that you are
using a Debian-based distribution. If you are using something else, you
should be able to find the comparable packages for your distribution of
choice. To install the dependencies, run the command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo apt-get install libgtk2.0-0 libgtk2.0-dev gnuplot
</pre>
</p><p>
Nightfall also includes the ability to use OpenGL to handle 3D rendering
of animations of the binary systems you want to model. If you want to
use OpenGL, you also need to install:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo apt-get install libgl1-mesa-dev freeglut3-dev 
 &#8618;libgtkgl2.0-dev libjpeg62-dev
</pre>
</p><p>
Once all of the requirements are installed, you can install Nightfall
itself. You should change directory into a temporary or source directory
where you can do the unpacking and build the code. Once you are
there, download the latest version of Nightfall with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
wget http://www.la-samhna.de/nightfall/nightfall-1.88.tar.gz
</pre>
</p><p>
Then, unpack it with:
   
<pre     class="programlisting">
tar xvzf nightfall-1.88.tar.gz
</pre>
</p><p>
When you go to configure Nightfall, you probably will want to include
the <tt  >openmp</tt> option. This allows Nightfall to use the multiple CPUs
you probably have in your machine to speed up the calculations
involved. You can build and install Nightfall with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
./configure --enable-openmp make sudo make install
</pre>
</p><p>
This installs Nightfall under the /usr/local directory. You then
can start Nightfall with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
nightfall -U
</pre>
</p><p>
The <tt  >-U</tt> option is necessary to force the GUI to be used interactively.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12018nightf1.large.jpg"><img src="12018nightf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. The GUI lets you configure all kinds of options within Nightfall to set up your
model.
</p></div></div><p>
Now that Nightfall is up and running, you will start to see 
just how much control you have over the model that is being simulated. The
first tab is where you can set up the core parameters for your binary
system model. You can set the mass ratio and the inclination of the
two stars. You also can set the surface temperatures and the Roche lobe
filling factors for each of the stars. The temperature helps define their
luminosities, and the Roche lobe filling factors define the distortion of
the stars. 
</p><p>
Depending on the exact conditions, you may have an accretion
disk of material around the central star. The second tab lets you set the
type of accretion disk (that is, how it interacts with the central star),
along with more physical parameters like the inner and outer diameters
and the temperature. 
</p><p>
The advanced tab allows you to set some less obvious
parameters for your model, such as the eccentricity for the orbiting
star and whether you also need to model the atmosphere. 
</p><p>
Now you can click
on the Compute button at the top of the window, and on most modern machines,
it goes pretty quickly. Once the calculations are done, you can
plot the output from the system you just modeled. 
</p><p>
The Output menu item
on the menu bar at the top gives you several options on how to display the
calculated results. The first entry is PlotCurve, which draws the light
curve as seen from a distant observer. Gnuplot is used
to draw the actual plot of the visible amount of light that is seen.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12018nightf2.large.jpg"><img src="12018nightf2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Once the calculation is done, you can plot the observed light curve.
</p></div></div><p>
The
second output option is to select ViewGeometry. 
This plot shows you how the stars themselves are distorted within
their orbits. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12018nightf3.large.jpg"><img src="12018nightf3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. You can plot the geometry of the stars within the binary system.
</p></div></div><p>
The StarView menu item presents a view of how the
binary system would look from your observation point. 
A control box also pops up that allows you to change the inclination
of the orbital plane and the phase of the orbit. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12018nightf4.large.jpg"><img src="12018nightf4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Selecting StarView lets you see the binary system from some distance away.
</p></div></div><p>
The RocheSlicer menu item
provides a way to visualize just how distorted the
stars become. A control box also pops up that lets you
select various slices through the star system. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12018nightf5.large.jpg"><img src="12018nightf5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. The RocheSlicer lets you investigate the distortions in the stars of your
binary system.
</p></div></div><p>
The last menu item is the
DataSheet option. This option pops up a new window
with a text description of the results of all of the calculations that
were made. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12018nightf6.large.jpg"><img src="12018nightf6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. The DataSheet gives you the detailed numerical results of your simulation.
</p></div></div><p>
One of the keys in science is being able to reproduce your
results, both experimental and computational. With this in mind, you
can save the model you just ran and load it again later. These
models are saved as configurations by clicking the menu item File&rarr;Save
Configuration. You can load previous models by clicking the menu item
File&rarr;Open config file. If you compiled and installed Nightfall
using the instructions above, you will have a number of example
configurations available that you can play with as well.
</p><p>
Nightfall is not only useful in determining what a given binary star
system would look like, but you also can feed in your own observational
data and calculate a best-fit model to those observations. You can load
your observational data by clicking the menu item File&rarr;Open data
file. Again, if you compiled and installed Nightfall following
the instructions above, you will have several sample data files that
you can load. 
You probably should click on the menu item
File&rarr;Clear memory first. Once the data is loaded, select the Data
Fitting tab in the main window. You then need to select the Mass and/or
Separation buttons as parameters for the fitting. Then, select
the FIT with tolerance button, using the tolerance you enter within the
text box. You also can choose whether to use simulated annealing
or Monte Carlo methods. You may want to do some research
to see how active astronomers use these parameters
to find best-fit models.
</p><p>
The last thing to notice is that almost everything you can do with the
GUI is also doable with command-line options. This means you can
generate many different models with different sets of parameters and
generate the relevant plots and output data automatically. This
way, you can farm out the work to some cluster of machines (but that's moving into
the realm of &ldquo;professional&rdquo; astronomy and beyond the scope of this
article).

<h2 class="title">When Birdcam Goes Mainstream</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #266, June 2016</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
If you read my articles on when I originally set up BirdCam a few years ago, you'll
remember I did it with compatibility in mind. At the time of this writing, BirdCam
(<a href="http://birds.brainofshawn.com" target="_self">birds.brainofshawn.com</a>) is simply an HTML page with
the JavaScript
language to refresh the images constantly, in order to create a low-fps
video stream of sorts. One of the frustrations is that if I want to
rearrange camera images or add a new camera (check out my Open-Source
Classroom column in this issue), it means a lot of complex HTML coding. It
also means the &ldquo;stream&rdquo; is less and less reliable, because it depends on
multiple images refreshing several times a second. I want to do something
more powerful.
</p><p>
Enter: YouTube.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12018openf1.large.jpg"><img src="12018openf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
My goal is to get BirdCam to stream a live video to YouTube Live,
so it can be embedded on Web sites, viewed on mobile devices and even
&ldquo;tuned in&rdquo; via Roku or Fire TV. I tried in vain to get ffmpeg and/or
VLC to stream video to YouTube from the command line, but I couldn't
ever get it working reliably. I haven't given up hope, but until then,
I'm planning to play with Open Broadcaster Studio.
</p><p>
It's an open-source, cross-platform studio package that allows you
to put multiple video streams, text boxes and still images into a
single window that is encoded and streamed to YouTube. I couldn't get
the OpenGL version required to work on my Ubuntu laptop, but the OS X
version worked flawlessly in my test. With a little bit of tweaking,
BirdCam 3.0 might be a legitimate 24/7 YouTube stream. If you want to
play around with streaming live to YouTube, check out the awesome
open-source studio software at <a href="http://obsproject.com" target="_self">obsproject.com</a>.
