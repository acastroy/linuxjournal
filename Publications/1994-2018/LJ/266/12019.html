The year 2014 frequently was termed the &ldquo;year of wearable
devices&rdquo;, but besides being able to access e-mail, play games or listen to music,
we have yet to see real productivity (including IDEs like RStudio,
editors like Emacs or tools like LaTeX and Sweave) on
wearable devices like smartphones or even tablets. Although we could
not agree more with Bjarne Stroustrup (see the first minute of
his YouTube video listed in the Resources for this article), early attempts to bring
more productivity to wearables, such as the Ubuntu Edge campaign, so far have failed. We 
have no doubt that the development of productivity tools for wearable devices
will come, but the hype hasn't provided 
a working solution so far. With that in mind, this article addresses the
following question:
&ldquo;How can one run R on Android devices in a productive way?&rdquo;
</p><p>
For our tests we used the Google Nexus 5 smartphone (released November 2013)
with these specs:
quad-core 2.3GHz CPU (Snapdragon 800, 32-bit, ARM-based); 32GB memory;
2GB RAM; and Android 5.1.1 (Lollipop). During our testing phase,
we also considered Android 4.4 (Kitkat) and Android 5.0 (Lollipop). Note
that in practice, people usually would rather work with R on a tablet (or at least
a phablet) than on a smartphone. Our choice
of such a small device (with a 5" display) is purely to demonstrate
the concept and its potential (and because we already owned this device).
</p><p>
The choice of Android as an operating system is natural for these three reasons:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
A majority of smartphones and tablets run Android.
</p></li><li><p>
Android is a mobile operating system based on the (free and open-source)
Linux kernel.
</p></li><li><p>
As it turns out, it is feasible to use R on Android (whereas we are not sure
how this could be done on iOS, for example).
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Other approaches for running R on Android (not discussed in this article) are
used by the R Console Free and GNURoot apps (available at the
Google Play Store). The former allows
only limited R functionality under Android; the latter follows a similar
paradigm as presented here, but provides only console access to R
(one of the more obvious limitations). In particular, both methods do not
provide GUI access to R (so no graphics).
</p><p>
Our understanding of
productivity goes beyond the functionality of these apps. We aim not only at
running a full version of R on Android (including graphics or multicore
computing), but also at tools that are naturally required to be productive with
R&mdash;for example, a full version of an editor like Emacs (including ESS), 
LaTeX and Sweave (for writing articles
or working on presentations during flights). 
For RStudio users, see the Tips and Tricks section at the end of this article.
</p><p>
We also want to consider some selected auxiliary tools from the Linux world. 
Note that for some of
these tools (like Emacs), specific Android apps are available (such as the
Emacs app), but they often are in early stages of development and have frequent
crashes (not offering the functionality we need), or they are not well
maintained, which leads to bugs we don't want to cope with (we've pointed out several 
to the respective app developers
with minor success in solving them). 
</p><p>
Also, none of these apps
work or communicate with each other (as they are mainly black boxes),
and for a fully functioning &ldquo;R app&rdquo;, Android is missing compilers, a
shell and an X Window System (among other tools). 
</p><p>
Our approach may
be a bit more daunting to install, rather than using a simple thin client and connecting
to an R server to address the above questions, but this is what we consider to 
be part of productivity (one advantage is not being limited to Internet
access).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2118580.0x2210b98"></a>
The Main Idea</h2></div></div><p>
The goal is to install a Linux operating system on Android and then
install the required productivity tools (including R) under this Linux OS. We
then can run an SSH or VNC server on it and connect to it via a
terminal or graphically, respectively. 
Here are the steps:
</p><p>
1) Prepare the Android device. This 
might be the technically most difficult step, and it is partly
device-dependent. In particular, it involves unlocking the device's bootloader 
(required for rooting the device&mdash;that is, gaining root/superuser access
to the device) and rooting the device (which is required by the Linux
Deploy app to install a Linux OS under Android).
</p><p>
2) Installing and accessing the Linux OS. The main idea here is that the
Linux OS will be installed in a so-called change-root (chroot)
environment on Android 5.1.1&mdash;that is, in a directory tree in which a running
program cannot name or access files outside the tree. The Linux OS installed
this way allows for root access (and therefore to install the required
productivity tools), but sees only this local environment and does not
interfere with the Android OS.
</p><p>
3) Installing and using R and related productivity tools. Here we show how
you can install R and
tools like
Emacs (version 24) with Emacs Speaks Statistics (ESS) and the
LaTeX system TeX Live (2015) with AUCTeX. We also
show how you even can do multicore computations, and we provide some tips and
tricks addressing productivity when working with Android.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2118580.0x2210da8"></a>
Preparing the Android Device</h2></div></div><p>
For this article, we assume you have a laptop computer running an
Android Software Development Kit (SDK). We used a MacBook Pro (2015) running OS X
Yosemite 10.10.5 and Android Studio as the SDK. During our testing
phase with Android 4.4 and 5.0, we used a Lenovo X1 Carbon (2013), which ran Ubuntu
14.10 (the corresponding Android SDK was installed via <tt  >sudo
apt-get install android-tools-adb android-tools-fastboot</tt>). 
Installing these tools is straightforward. We also wanted to
use the <tt  >adb</tt> and <tt  >fastboot</tt> tools from the OS X terminal. An easy
way to accomplish this is via <tt  >bash &lt;(curl
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/corbindavenport/nexus-tools/master/install.sh)</tt>.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2118580.0x2211010"></a>
Unlocking the Bootloader and Rooting (Android 5.1.1)</h2></div></div><p>
In short, rooting describes the process of gaining root or superuser access
to an Android device, and it's required in order to interact with
Android more deeply. Specifically, it's necessary for installing a Linux OS on the device
using an app like Linux Deploy (described below). Because rooting typically completely
wipes the device, do a complete backup first (rooting
also may brick the device, rendering it useless, although this risk nowadays is considered comparably small for newer
devices). As a last resort if the rooting procedure fails, you typically can try
to flash a factory image (see Resources). A factory image for the Google Nexus 5 is available 
at <a href="https://developers.google.com/android/nexus/images#hammerhead" target="_self">https://developers.google.com/android/nexus/images#hammerhead</a>.
</p><p>
The rooting procedure depends on the Android device under
consideration (there are many good on-line resources for this). It also may depend on the version
number of Android. For example, for a Google Nexus 5 running Android 4.4 and
5.0, we followed the instructions given in the Unlocking the Bootloader and
Rooting sidebar. However, Android
5.1.1 requires a different approach (see Resources). 
</p><p>
1) Make sure that your device's battery status is at least 80% and that
developer mode is enabled (go to Settings&rarr;About
phone and then tap the build number until developer mode is enabled).
</p><p>
2) Connect the Android device to the laptop via a (micro) USB cable.
</p><p>
3) Download UPDATE-SuperSU-v2.46.zip from <a href="http://www.devfiles.co/download/dr7ZBy0w/UPDATE-SuperSU-v2.46.zip" target="_self">www.devfiles.co/download/dr7ZBy0w/UPDATE-SuperSU-v2.46.zip</a>.
</p><p>
4) Use the Android File Transfer app to copy the .zip file to the
phone's root directory (the folder shown by default when Android File
Transfer is opened; in the Android filesystem, this corresponds to
/sdcard or /storage/emulated/0).
</p><p>
5) Download <a href="http://www.devfiles.co/download/iLJJIo60/recovery-clockwork-touch-6.0.4.5-hammerhead.img" target="_self">www.devfiles.co/download/iLJJIo60/recovery-clockwork-touch-6.0.4.5-hammerhead.img</a>
and put this file in the ~/Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools folder on the laptop.
</p><p>
6) Boot into fastboot mode&mdash;typically by shutting down the
phone, then pressing and holding both volume keys and the power key.
</p><p>
7) Execute in a shell on the laptop:


<pre     class="programlisting">
cd ~/Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools
fastboot flash recovery recovery-clockwork-touch-6.0.4.5-hammerhead.img
</pre>
</p><p>
8) Use the volume keys to select &ldquo;Recovery Mode&rdquo; on the Google Nexus
5, then press
the Power key to enter this mode.
</p><p>
9) From the menu that appears, select &ldquo;install zip&rdquo; (via the volume
keys), and press the
Power key to do so. Select &ldquo;choose zip from /sdcard&rdquo;.
</p><p>
10) Use the volume keys to select the .zip file. Choose
&ldquo;yes&rdquo; to install it, then wait until you see &ldquo;Install from
sdcard complete&rdquo;.
</p><p>
11) Choose &ldquo;Go back&rdquo; from the menu and &ldquo;reboot system
now&rdquo;, then
&ldquo;Yes - Fix root (/system/xbin/su)&rdquo;. After this process finishes, you can
unplug the phone.
</p><p>
12) Install the Super Su app and reboot the device. Then, install the Root
Checker app, open it and grant superuser access. The app then indicates whether
rooting the device was successful.
</p><p>
Once the device has been rooted successfully, you can continue
installing auxiliary apps and setting up the device.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2118580.0x2211ab8"></a>
Auxiliary Apps</h2></div></div><p>
At this point, you can set up the Android device as desired. For the purposes of
this article,
we recommend installing the following apps from the Google Play Store:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Hacker's Keyboard: a full-size keyboard for Android, including meta keys like
Tab/Ctrl/Esc.
You can select the Hacker's Keyboard as the default keyboard via Settings&rarr;Language
input&rarr;Current Keyboard.
</p></li><li><p>
Linux Deploy: an app for installing a Linux OS on a rooted Android device
(note that this app requires the device to be rooted). An alternative may be
the Complete Linux Installer app, but it had various rather
strange bugs (for example, &ldquo;Error: Unable to attach image to loop
device!&rdquo;, so every
launch required rebooting the device) and did not provide
support for Android 5.1.1 at the time of this writing.
</p></li><li><p>
JuiceSSH: an easy-to-use SSH client for Android. (You'll use this later
to connect to the SSH server running on the Linux OS you install under
Android and provide access to R via the terminal.)
</p></li><li><p>
VNC Viewer: a VNC client for Android you'll use later to
connect to the VNC server running on the Linux OS and provide access
to graphics (the R GUI).
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2118580.0x260a180"></a>
Installing and Accessing Ubuntu in a Change-Root Environment</h2></div></div><p>
The goal now is to install a Linux OS (in this case Ubuntu 15.04; during our
testing phase, we also considered Debian Testing) in a chroot environment on
Android 5.1.1, together with various productivity tools, such as Emacs
(version 24) with ESS and TeX Live with AUCTeX. The Linux Deploy app
provides a relatively straightforward approach for installing Linux on Android
(described below), and updates to Android 5.0 and 5.1.1 also were provided in a
reasonable amount of time (and the developer replied to questions).
</p><p>
1) Start Linux Deploy and press the arrow button pointing downward to specify
the properties the Linux OS should have.
</p><p>
2) Choose the following:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Distribution: Ubuntu (uses the lightweight X11 desktop environment LXDE by
default).
</p></li><li><p>
Distribution suite: &ldquo;vivid&rdquo; (this is Ubuntu version 15.04).
</p></li><li><p>
Installation path: the path where you want the Linux image to reside (for
example, /sdcard/linux.img).
</p></li><li><p>
Image size (MB): the size of the Linux image. Due to the many pieces
of software you will install for this example, choose 16000MB here.
</p></li><li><p>
Filesystem: ext4.
</p></li><li><p>
User name: an appropriate user name for the Linux OS (in our case,
&ldquo;mhofert&rdquo;).
</p></li><li><p>
Select components: in addition to the components already checked, also check
&ldquo;X server&rdquo;.
</p></li><li><p>
Custom mounts: check it. On startup of the Linux OS, this allows you to
access files located in /storage/emulated/0 on the Android device via
/mnt/0 on the Linux OS (which is handy when working on the
same files from Android and within the Linux OS); see the beginning of
the following section for more on this.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Now choose &ldquo;Install&rdquo; to install the Linux OS (hereby grant
root/superuser rights to Linux Deploy via the Super Su app when prompted).
</p><p>
3) Choose &ldquo;START&rdquo; from the main menu of Linux Deploy to start the
Linux OS (Figure 1). There is also an &ldquo;Autostart&rdquo; option
available from the settings so that the Linux OS starts once Android is
booted.

Figure 2. Installing Productivity and Auxiliary Tools via
<tt >apt-get</tt> over SSH with JuiceSSH
</p></div></div><p>
Starting the Linux OS starts an SSH server (port 22) and a VNC server (port
5900), which allow you to access the Linux OS from Android via the terminal and a
GUI, respectively. The following steps detail how to set up an SSH
connection via JuiceSSH and then how to set up a VNC connection via VNC Viewer:
</p><p>
1) Open JuiceSSH, navigate to Settings, and set &ldquo;Popup keyboard
position&rdquo; to &ldquo;Disabled&rdquo;.
</p><p>
2) Go back to the main menu, then to &ldquo;Connections&rdquo;, and add a new connection. Choose:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Nickname: Ubuntu.
</p></li><li><p>
Address: this is the IP address of the SSH server. You can find it on the
top bar in Linux Deploy when the Linux OS starts (Figure 1).
This may depend on your device's network (in our case, home
or work) and whether the IP addresses are allocated dynamically in this network.
</p></li><li><p>
Identity: Choose &ldquo;New...&rdquo; and the user name as selected for the Linux
OS.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
3) Go to the &ldquo;Connections&rdquo; main menu and choose
&ldquo;Ubuntu&rdquo; to start the SSH
connection to the running Linux OS. When asked for a
password, use &ldquo;changeme&rdquo;, which is the default for Linux Deploy. You should
now be connected to the Linux OS via SSH. Use the Linux 
<tt  >passwd</tt> command to
change the login password.
</p><p>
As mentioned earlier, to get GUI access, including graphics for R, you need
to establish a VNC
connection. Using VNC Viewer, follow these steps:
</p><p>
1) Open VNC Viewer, press the + and enter:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Address: &lt;IP address as displayed by Linux Deploy&gt;
</p></li><li><p>
Name: Ubuntu
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Then press the check mark to save the connection details.
</p><p>
2) In the main menu, press &ldquo;Ubuntu&rdquo; and put in the password
&ldquo;changeme&rdquo;.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2118580.0x260b9e8"></a>
Installing and Using R and Related Productivity Tools</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Installing Emacs, ESS, LaTeX and R:</b></span>
</p><p>
Now you can interact with the Linux OS installed under Android and install
software on it. First copy the setup files and folders (for example,
.emacs, .emacs.d, .gitconfig, .Renviron,
.Rprofile and .ssh) from the laptop to the Linux OS as follows. (See also the Tips
and Tricks section. Additionally, you can append personal settings from .bashrc 
to the .bashrc already available in ~ in the Linux OS.)
</p><p>
1) Open &ldquo;Android File Transfer&rdquo; and copy the files to the phone's root directory 
(the folder shown by default when Android File Transfer is
opened). They then appear in /storage/emulated/0 on the Android device
and under /mnt/0 from within the Linux OS.
</p><p>
2) From the latter folder, copy (via <tt  >sudo cp -r</tt>) all the files to the home directory ~.
</p><p>
Next, install some basic Linux tools in the terminal via JuiceSSH 
(note: this may take several hours; see
Figure 2 for a screenshot during the installation):

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install a2ps auctex chromium-browser cmake curl 
 &#8618;emacs24 git htop
sudo apt-get install make okular pdftk preview-latex subversion 
 &#8618;texinfo unzip wget
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, you can install ESS, LaTeX and base R via <tt  >sudo
apt-get install ess latex r-base</tt> if available on ARM architecture. The
drawback is that software like LaTeX typically comes in older
versions, so we recommend installing the latest versions from source (see the detailed
instructions in the sidebar).
</p><p>
After this installation, restart Linux Deploy (otherwise R is not found from
within JuiceSSH or VNC Viewer). Figure 3 shows a
screenshot taken during the R installation process (during
<tt  >make</tt>),
and Figure 4 shows R running over SSH via JuiceSSH.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12019f3.large.jpg"><img src="12019f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

Figure 4. R Running over SSH via JuiceSSH
</p></div></div><p>
For installing R packages in a version-independent library, put
<tt  >R_LIBS_SITE=/usr/local/R/library</tt> in .Renviron, and make sure the
/usr/local/R/library folder exists. You then simply can install most packages via
<tt  >install.packages()</tt> or other common methods. We installed a large
number of packages (170) on the Linux OS, without
problems; see Figures 5 and 6.

Running R on Multiple Cores on a Smartphone</h2></div></div><p>
As a proof of concept and for roughly comparing runtimes with the laptop, we
briefly ran two R example scripts on the Google Nexus 5 smartphone. The first is a
shorter and slightly adapted version from the vignette of the R package
&ldquo;parallel&rdquo;:


<pre     class="programlisting">
require(parallel)
require(boot)
require(microbenchmark)

## Setup
dat &lt;- cd4
B &lt;- 1000 # bootstrap replications
mle &lt;- list(mean=colMeans(dat), var=var(dat))
dat.rng &lt;- function(data, mle) MASS::mvrnorm(nrow(data), mle$m, mle$v)
bstr &lt;- function(...) boot(dat, statistic=corr, R=B, sim="parametric",
                           ran.gen=dat.rng, mle=mle)

## Non-parallel version
N &lt;- 100 # number of repetitions
set.seed(271)
mc &lt;- 2 # number of cores
(mbm.nonpara &lt;- microbenchmark(res.nonpara &lt;- do.call(c, 
 &#8618;lapply(seq_len(mc), bstr)), times=N))

## Multicore version
set.seed(271)
(mbm.mc &lt;- microbenchmark(res.mc &lt;- do.call(c, mclapply(seq_len(mc), 
 &#8618;bstr)), times=N)) # ms
</pre>
</p><p>
As a second example, we ran a slightly adapted version of
&ldquo;demo(VaRsuperadd)&rdquo; from the R package &ldquo;simsalapar&rdquo;:


<pre     class="programlisting">
require(simsalapar)
require(copula)

## Setup

        family = list(type="grid", expr = quote(C), # copula families 
 &#8618;(t=t_4)
                      value = c("normal", "t", "Clayton", "Gumbel")),
        tau = list(type="grid", value = c(0.2, 0.5, 0.8)), 
 &#8618;# Kendall's tau
        qmargin = list(type="inner", expr = quote(F[j]), # margins
                      value = c(norm = qnorm,
                                t4   = function(p) qt(p, df=4),

The latter example concerns a standard problem in Quantitative Risk Management
and involves simulating high-dimensional multivariate random vectors from
various distributions, approximating the distribution function of the sum of
their components and deciding, for a range of quantiles, whether the risk
measure Value-at-Risk is subadditive (see the article by M. Hofert and M.
M&auml;chler,
&ldquo;Parallel and other simulations in R made easy: An end-to-end
study&rdquo;, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Journal of
Statistical Software</em></span>, 69(4), 2016 for more
details).

Figure 7 shows the example while being run on two of the four cores of the
smartphone (see the <tt  >htop</tt> output) and the graphical output of
the result (Figure 8). This example was run exactly as on the laptop, by opening
Emacs and executing the code line by line as one would do with most R scripts;
in particular, we did not have to change our workflow to run this code on
Android as we essentially run it on a Linux OS.

</p><p>
Clearly, this provides only a limited insight as to R's performance on a
mobile device, but there are a few things to note:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
One major aspect of R is that it provides graphics. With the approach
described above, we obtain access to graphics on R without the need to print
them to files to be able to access them (as is often done when working without
GUI access). Even on the Google Nexus 5 (full HD&mdash;that is, 1920 x 1280
pixels), graphs looked sharp; see also Figure 4. With more
and more Quad HD devices (2560 x 1440 pixels) on the market, the ability
to run R (via GUI) on Android devices might become even more
interesting.
</p></li><li><p>
To our surprise, even after lengthy installation processes and repetitions
of testing and running code on the smartphone, it did not overheat in any way
(a 30-minute Skype call or Google Hangout via the smartphone produced much more
heat). This might be due to the fact that there is a large gaming market on
Android that overall has pushed the hardware development for smartphones quite a
bit in recent years; installing and running R and related tools might still
be considered rather &ldquo;light&rdquo; in contrast to what modern games demand from
smartphones.
</p></li><li><p>
The runtimes on the smartphone are, of course, larger than on the new
MacBook Pro. However, if necessary, one still would be able to do some
serious work on a smartphone (for example, to fix bugs, rerun code, prepare
plots and slides for talks and so on), including multicore
computations. Furthermore, note that the Lenovo X1 Carbon (2013; Ubuntu
14.10) we originally used during our testing phase led to (user, system, elapsed) runtimes of (161s, 7.6s, 94s), which is much closer to the runtimes on the smartphone.
</p></li><li><p>
After all, we are using a smartphone from 2013
here. In the fast-developing Android world, this is
rather old hardware and a more up-to-date Android flagship (with a faster
processor) might be expected to score much better.

Tips and Tricks</h2></div></div><p>
The approach described above to run R on Android seems easier than it is. In
fact, we had to do the installation procedure described here a couple times
to overcome various challenges. 
Considering some of these issues, here are some tips and tricks:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
External SD card: our Google Nexus 5 did not allow for an external SD card. If an
Android device allows for that, you can put an ext4 partition
directly on the SD card and &ldquo;more directly&rdquo; install Linux (see,
for example,
<a href="http://whiteboard.ping.se/Android/Debian" target="_self">whiteboard.ping.se/Android/Debian</a>). More and more flagship devices do
not provide expandable storage anymore though (such as the Galaxy Note
line of Samsung).
</p></li><li><p>
Interacting with Linux via VNC: we successfully used the bVNC app for
quite a while, but it did not work properly under Android 5.1.1 and
was essentially not usable anymore. Also, we originally worked with &ldquo;Complete
Linux Installer&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;Linux Deploy&rdquo;, however, there were other
app-related challenges to overcome. As mentioned, you might need to 
adapt some of the tools discussed here to get the job done. Fortunately, the Android
app ecosystem typically provides several apps for the same task, which
gives you other options to try.
</p></li><li><p>
Upgrade to Android 5.1.1: if your device can be upgraded, upgrade it to
Android 5.1.1, as there have been major improvements in energy
consumption over Android 4.4. When we conducted the
installation process under Android 4.4, although connected via USB to the
laptop the whole time (and thus being charged while in use), the battery still was
(slowly) draining. Under Android 5.1.1, battery status remained constantly
high.
</p></li><li><p>
How files can be copied (or moved) to or from the device: for 
productivity, you need to be able to copy files to and from the device. As
mentioned, you conveniently can use &ldquo;Android File
Transfer&rdquo; to transfer
files to the phone's root directory (the folder shown by default when
Android File Transfer is opened). They then appear in
/storage/emulated/0 on the Android device and under /mnt/0 from
within the Linux OS. The latter is a great feature of &ldquo;Linux
Deploy&rdquo; (and much
more complicated with the &ldquo;Complete Linux Installer&rdquo; app, for
example). A terminal-based method to copy files to the Android device is to
use <tt  >adb push</tt>&mdash;for example, doing <tt  >adb push foo.R
/sdcard/Download</tt> copies foo.R to the respective folder on Android.
One limitation of <tt  >adb push</tt> is that
unlike <tt  >cp</tt> or <tt  >mv</tt>, it does not
allow you to push several files or
folders to the device at once. Finally, if you need to access files on a USB
stick, many modern Android phones provide USB on-the-go (OTG) adapter
cables for this task.
</p></li><li><p>
The size of the Linux OS image: during one iteration of the installation
procedure described above we ran out of space, although the disk image seemed
to be large enough (even when we selected 18GB).
It turned out that the image contained too many files (in the
folder ~/.emacs.d due to backup files from Emacs being copied to the
Linux OS). We then tried to enlarge the Linux OS image, but ran into several
problems (including no longer being able to start the VNC server).
Overall, we recommend proceeding carefully with the
installation, checking disk space (for example, via <tt  >df
-h</tt> to keep track of /dev/loop0) and making sure the Linux OS image is large enough. Messing around with the image size after the installation
(adjustable from within Linux Deploy) is not recommended.
</p></li><li><p>
Screen size: although a smartphone's screen size is nothing you'd want 
to work on exclusively, the trend seems to be moving toward bigger screen sizes and
phablets. Even on the 5" Google Nexus 5, it was possible to work for
several hours. Besides tablets, a future alternative might be to use virtual
reality goggles, which might be interesting when working on an airplane
where space is very limited.
</p></li><li><p>
Installing RStudio: RStudio needs to be compiled from source as
no ARM binaries are available. During our testing, we tried to
install RStudio by downloading
<a href="https://github.com/rstudio/rstudio/archive/master.zip" target="_self">https://github.com/rstudio/rstudio/archive/master.zip</a>, copying it to
the Linux OS, unzipping it, installing the required dependencies (see
the install-dependencies-debian subfolder; this took several hours) and
then doing <tt  >cmake . -DRSTUDIO_TARGET=Desktop
-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release</tt>. The
latter command failed though with the message <tt  >CMake Error at
src/cpp/desktop/CMakeLists.txt:69 (get_filename_component):
get_filename_component called with incorrect number of arguments</tt>.
An alternative would be to follow along the lines of <a href="https://github.com/dashaub/ARM-RStudio" target="_self">https://github.com/dashaub/ARM-RStudio</a> (see <a href="https://github.com/dashaub/ARM-RStudio/blob/master/ARM-RStudio.sh" target="_self">https://github.com/dashaub/ARM-RStudio/blob/master/ARM-RStudio.sh</a> for
the required steps), but we didn't have the required disk space left on the
Google Nexus 5 to try this installation process (and it might take several
hours to install).
</p></li><li><p>
The input device: although technically possible with the Hacker's Keyboard,
it's not practical to interact with the smartphone only over the software
keyboard (a large tablet might be a different story). We connected a Bluetooth
keyboard to the Google Nexus 5, but had problems allowing features like a more
productive remap of the Ctrl key to Caps Lock. The app &ldquo;External Keyboard
Helper Settings&rdquo; might be a solution here, but we could not get this (and
other features) to work. We did not go as far as utilizing
<tt  >xmodmap</tt> for
that purpose, as ideally, this should be solved on Android. For our proof of
concept here, using the Bluetooth keyboard worked well, but the input device
used to interact with Android or the Linux OS (and thus R) is still one of
the major productivity bottlenecks. Also note, that the behavior was somewhat
different when connected via SSH or via VNC. For example, the Emacs key
combination C-space for the command M-x set-mark-command did not
work when connected via SSH with JuiceSSH, but it worked when connected via
VNC with VNC Viewer. Keyboards more specifically designed for Android
devices and with more focus on productivity might be interesting here, such as
the recently introduced LG's Rolly keyboard (which also would be easy to
carry around).
</p></li><li><p>
The input device (once again): one more convenient way to interact with
the device during the installation process was the following. Install and run
TeamViewer on the laptop (see <a href="http://www.teamviewer.com/en/index.aspx" target="_self">www.teamviewer.com/en/index.aspx</a>) and
the &ldquo;TeamViewer QuickSupport&rdquo; app on the smartphone. This way
you can mirror
the smartphone display on the laptop and use the laptop's keyboard as an input
device. Two hiccups we encountered here were 1) some Emacs key combinations
still were not sent to the device properly (this may be related to the problem
mentioned previously), and 2) the laptop shows the smartphone's display with a
small but annoying time lag. Nevertheless, using the laptop's keyboard while
looking at the smartphone's display worked well and did not require a
Bluetooth keyboard.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
This article presents an approach for running a full version of R and related
productivity software on Android devices within a Linux OS in a chroot
environment. SSH or GUI access (via VNC) allow you to connect to the Linux OS and
run R and related productivity tools (even on multiple cores).
</p><p>
Some advantages of this approach:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
You don't have to make sacrifices on the software side; you can run full-blown
versions of Linux, R, LaTeX, Emacs and so on.
</p></li><li><p>
You don't have to use the Android device as a thin client, so you don't need
to have Internet access.
</p></li><li><p>
All software tools used here are freely available at no cost.
</p></li><li><p>
Once the installation process is finished, you can access R simply by
starting Linux via Linux Deploy&rarr;Start and then connecting to the
running Linux OS via SSH (with JuiceSSH) or VNC (with VNC Viewer).
</p></li><li><p>
With a VNC connection, you have full support of R graphics.
</p></li><li><p>
You easily can access and transfer files from a laptop to Android,
the Linux OS and back.
</p></li><li><p>
The performance for everyday tasks is good. Also, more and more Android
devices come with 64-bit (and much faster) processors (such as the Snapdragon
810), which may lead to significant improvement over the performance
we experienced.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Although no real show-stoppers, there are some drawbacks we should mention as well:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
The installation process is (much) more time-consuming than simply installing
more apps, simply because you 
basically are installing full desktop versions of Linux, R, LaTeX and so on.
</p></li><li><p>
Updating the Linux OS via <tt  >apt-get</tt> is straightforward, but updating
Android requires a complete re-installation, including rooting. Note that this
problem might be circumvented when the Linux OS is installed on an external
SD card (if supported by the device).
</p></li><li><p>
As mentioned earlier, the device's location affects the IP address of the
SSH server. As this is not propagated to JuiceSSH automatically, this is a
bit inconvenient (and a typical source of error when the connection to the
Linux OS fails).
</p></li><li><p>
As pointed out previously, the main bottleneck is not the weaker
processing power of the Android device, but rather the interaction with device
itself. On the one hand, you could try harder to make a full keyboard work
more easily with Android (including, for example, a faster key repeat rate or more
key combinations for productive work). On the other hand, you might raise the
question as to why you wouldn't just work with a laptop if a full keyboard
is required. More portable input solutions can be expected in the future,
but the classical keyboard hasn't changed very much since its
introduction. Two interesting mobile approaches for the future seem to be: 1)
a keyboard developed by Tactus Technology (<a href="http://tactustechnology.com" target="_self">tactustechnology.com</a>), which can appear/disappear
dynamically and, thus, enhance software keyboards (this might be especially interesting on
tablets where you can type with ten fingers); and 2) a glove keyboard
(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vij420qVqCY" target="_self">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vij420qVqCY</a>), although it's far from
the production stage. With more and more mobile computing devices being used, we hope to
see more development on mobile input devices in the future, especially for
productivity purposes. For example, software keyboards, such as SwiftKey,
Swype, Google Keyboard or Fleksy (offering different enhancements for
speed-typing text), are widely used on wearable devices, but are
practically of no use for productivity purposes, as certain keys
or key combinations (for coding, for example) are simply not available.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Overall, we were pleasantly surprised by how &ldquo;far&rdquo; mobile productivity
(including R) already is, and we hope that the quirks will be solved in the near
future. Projects like Remix Mini (<a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1123481999/remix-mini-the-worlds-first-true-android-pc" target="_self">https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1123481999/remix-mini-the-worlds-first-true-android-pc</a>)
even aim at bringing this experience (and the related &ldquo;less is
more&rdquo; paradigm)
to the desktop (still in a portable way). For future research, a glance toward
Mac OS/iOS certainly would be interesting. Besides available thin clients, the
current state of the art on mobile iDevices is unclear to us. A rather old
post (<a href="http://www.r-bloggers.com/running-r-on-an-iphoneipad-with-rstudio" target="_self">www.r-bloggers.com/running-r-on-an-iphoneipad-with-rstudio</a>)
briefly addresses some issues (such as jailbreaking and performance), but that might not
apply to newer Apple devices anymore.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2118580.0x279e8c0"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Back Up the Device</b></p><p>
Here's how to back up an Android device (before rooting it). For a full backup, certain backup apps require root access
on the wearable device, but here we assume you don't have root yet (which is
why you
want to do a backup in the first place). So for this, you'll simply use the Android SDK for
backup purposes (<a href="http://www.redmondpie.com/how-to-completely-backup-your-android-device-on-pc-without-root-access" target="_self">www.redmondpie.com/how-to-completely-backup-your-android-device-on-pc-without-root-access</a>).
For a full backup, do the following:
</p><p>
1) Connect the device to the laptop via USB cable.
</p><p>
2) Enable developer mode and USB debugging on the Android device by going to 
Settings&rarr;About phone and tap the build
number until developer mode is enabled.
Then go to Settings&rarr;About phone&rarr;Developer options, and check
&ldquo;USB debugging&rdquo;.
</p><p>
3) Open a shell on the laptop and execute the following (make sure the phone
is on and unlocked):


<pre     class="programlisting">
adb start-server
adb backup -apk -shared -all # then confirm on the Android device
</pre>
</p><p>
After confirmation on the Android device, the backup file backup.ab is
created in the current working directory; this may take several hours
depending on the storage usage of the device. Note that you can restore a backup 
via <tt  >adb restore backup.ab</tt>.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2118580.0x279ede8"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Unlocking the Bootloader and Rooting (Android 4.4 or 5.0)</b></p><p>
You can root the Google Nexus 5 running Android 4.4 or 5.0, and possibly other
versions as well, by following these steps
(see
<a href="http://www.androidauthority.com/chainfire-successfully-roots-android-lollipop-6-nexus-devices-567409" target="_self">www.androidauthority.com/chainfire-successfully-roots-android-lollipop-6-nexus-devices-567409</a>).
Note: you can download the
CF Auto Root files from <a href="http://autoroot.chainfire.eu" target="_self">autoroot.chainfire.eu</a>.
</p><p>
1) Make sure that your device's battery status is at least 80% and that
developer mode is enabled.
</p><p>
2) Boot the device into fastboot mode.
</p><p>
3) To unlock the device's bootloader, execute in a shell on the laptop:

<pre     class="programlisting">
fastboot oem unlock
</pre>
</p><p>
4) Rooting (for this device and the above versions of Android) can be done via
&ldquo;Chainfire's Auto Root&rdquo; as follows.
Download the appropriate version of Chainfire's Auto Root for the device
at hand (in our case, this is <a href="http://download.chainfire.eu/363/CF-Root/CF-Auto-Root/CF-Auto-Root-hammerhead-hammerhead-nexus5.zip" target="_self">download.chainfire.eu/363/CF-Root/CF-Auto-Root/CF-Auto-Root-hammerhead-hammerhead-nexus5.zip</a>)
from <a href="http://autoroot.chainfire.eu" target="_self">autoroot.chainfire.eu</a>, and unzip it.
Then, navigate to the unzipped folder and execute:

<pre     class="programlisting">
chmod +x root-linux.sh # make the unzipped script 
 &#8618;root-linux.sh executable ./root-linux.sh # if unlocked 
 &#8618;already, this fails, but just hit enter/continue
</pre>
</p><p>
After rooting is done, reboot the device. You can disconnect it without
harm.
</p><p>
Next, install the Super Su app and reboot the device. Then install the Root
Checker app, open it and grant superuser access. The app then indicates whether
rooting the device was successful.

Installing the Latest Versions of Productivity Tools</b></p><p>
To install the latest version of TeX Live (LaTeX) on the Linux OS, do the
following (adjust the version numbers accordingly):

<pre     class="programlisting">
mkdir ~/Downloads
cd ~/Downloads
curl -OL http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/
&#8618;install-tl-unx.tar.gz
tar -xzf install-tl-unx.tar.gz
cd install-tl-20150906 # use the correct version number
sudo ./install-tl # enter the password, then hit "I"
</pre>
</p><p>
After the installation, a path is displayed. Make TeX Live available by adding
this path to /etc/bash.bashrc. In our case, we used:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo vi /etc/bash.bashrc # Then add the following
PATH=/usr/local/texlive/2015/bin/armhf-linux:$PATH
</pre>
</p><p>
After closing and restarting the Linux OS, LaTeX is available; this
installation procedure of LaTeX took roughly 45 minutes.
</p><p>
For Emacs users, you can install the latest version of ESS as follows:

<pre     class="programlisting">
cd /usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/
sudo svn co https://svn.r-project.org/ESS/trunk ess
cd ess
sudo make
</pre>
</p><p>
For this to work, put the following in ~/.emacs:

<pre     class="programlisting">
(add-to-list 'load-path "/usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/ess/lisp")
(require 'ess-site)
</pre>
</p><p>
To update ESS at any point, simply navigate to
/usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/ess and execute <tt  >sudo svn up; sudo
make</tt>.
</p><p>
Now you can install the latest version of R (from source). Start by installing
some Linux preliminaries as follows:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo apt-get install gsl-bin libgsl0-dbg libgsl0-dev 
 &#8618;libgsl0ldbl # for GNU GSL
sudo apt-get install openmpi-bin openmpi-doc libopenmpi-dev 
 &#8618;# for open MPI
sudo apt-get install libmpfr4 libmpfr4-dbg libmpfr-dev # for 
 &#8618;GNU MPFR
sudo apt-get install libgmp10 libgmp3-dev # for GMP
sudo apt-get install libxml2-dev # for package 'XML'
</pre>
</p><p>
Next, install R (for updating an existing version, simply redo
steps 3&ndash;7) as follows:
</p><p>
1) Build dependencies:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo apt-get build-dep r-base # ~ 10min
</pre>
</p><p>
2) Create installation directory:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo mkdir /usr/local/R
sudo chown &lt;username&gt;:&lt;username&gt; /usr/local/R # put in your 
 &#8618;username
</pre>
</p><p>
3) Get and unpack R:

<pre     class="programlisting">
cd /usr/local/R
wget http://cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-3/R-3.2.2.tar.gz
