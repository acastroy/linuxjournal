We won the battle for Linux, but we're losing the battle for freedom.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd68580.0xe60300"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Linux turns 25 in August 2016. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> turned 21
in April 2016. (Issue #1 was
April 1994, the month Linux hit version 1.0.) We're a generation into the
history of our cause, but the fight isn't there anymore, because we won. Our
cause has achieved its effects.
</p><p>
It helps to remember that Linux was a fight, and so were free software and open
source. If they weren't fights, they wouldn't have won what they did. They also
wouldn't have been interesting, meaning there wouldn't have been any Linux
stories, or a <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>.
</p><p>
Stories are what make a subject interesting. To program a story, you need three
elements:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
A protagonist, which could be a person, a group or an easily personified cause
that people can identify with.
</p></li><li><p>
A problem, or a set of problems, against which the protagonist struggles.
</p></li><li><p>
Movement toward resolution.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
If you lack one those, you don't have a story.
</p><p>
With Linux, we had a cause and a person who personified it, whether he liked it
or not. Our problem was mentalities embodied in opponents such as Microsoft and
the herd of dull enterprise suppliers of &ldquo;solutions&rdquo; based on proprietary
variants of UNIX. As Linux and its opposition grew, we had movement toward what
Linus called &ldquo;world domination&rdquo;.
</p><p>
Which is where we are now. In terms of actual use, Linux's
<span   class="emphasis"><em>quo</em></span> has more <span   class="emphasis"><em>status</em></span>
than any of its early opponents ever had. Damn near everything runs on Linux,
or on something so similar that you can open a shell on it and get stuff
done.
(Example: Apple's OS X, which wouldn't be what it is if Linux hadn't already
been the leading *nix OS.) Even Microsoft runs lots of its own stuff (such as
Bing) on Linux. Bill Gates no longer cares. He's a philanthropist now. Steve
Jobs is dead. Linux's old UNIX enemies are zombies or gone. And, most of the
world's smart mobile devices run on Android, a derivative of Linux. 
</p><p>
So what's our next fight?
</p><p>
Here are some candidates. Rather than argue with any of the cases I make for
them (which will all be too brief), tell me the cases we <span   class="emphasis"><em>should
be</em></span> making.
Think: <span   class="emphasis"><em>What will grow our community of readers and writers here at Linux
Journal?</em></span> and <span   class="emphasis"><em>What effects do we want to have in the
world?</em></span>
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
General-Purpose Computing and Networking</b></span>
</p><p>
Linux was born on a generic 386 computer and grew on a boundless population of
others that were called &ldquo;compatibles&rdquo; or
&ldquo;clones&rdquo; in the early days.
</p><p>
They were an accident of history. When Intel introduced the 8086 in 1978, the
idea wasn't to make its descendants the most ubiquitous CPUs ever. Intel wanted
to sell chips to makers of closed and proprietary devices at a time when there
were no other kinds. &ldquo;Open&rdquo; back then meant &ldquo;we'd like this thing to get along
with some other things as long as it doesn't threaten our market
position&rdquo;.
</p><p>
When IBM came out with the 8088-based IBM PC in 1981, the idea was to sell
desktop IBM boxes into the business marketplace. The PC succeeded mostly
because it had a lot of backplane, a strategy modeled by the Apple II in prior
years (and abandoned by Steve Jobs with the first round of Macintosh
computers). This opened markets for expansion cards, peripherals, publications,
training, events and software to run on MS-DOS&mdash;the OS that IBM, in a move
deeply out of character, licensed from somebody else. It helped that the PC
could run other OSes as well, such as CP/M. But not many bothered with that
until Linus broke through nine years later, thanks to another accident of
history called the Internet. That too was a general-purpose thing that no
company ever would have invented on its own. Even as late as 1994, Microsoft
fought the Internet with an &ldquo;on-line service&rdquo; of its own called Marvel
(<a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/1994/10/18/billgatesvstheinternet.html" target="_self">scripting.com/davenet/1994/10/18/billgatesvstheinternet.html</a>).
Fortunately for Microsoft, Marvel failed instantly. Bill Gates then got wise,
and issued his &ldquo;Internet Tidal Wave&rdquo; memo in early 1995.
</p><p>
IBM saw the PC as an exclusive hardware play. The only reason it failed to
remain exclusive was that Phoenix Technologies came out with a compatible BIOS
(<a href="http://www.computerworld.com/article/2585652/app-development/reverse-engineering.html" target="_self">www.computerworld.com/article/2585652/app-development/reverse-engineering.html</a>),
which it reverse-engineered to keep it legal. The clone market was born when
Phoenix then began selling its knock-off BIOS, and it grew as chip makers did the
same with knock-offs of the x86 CPU. As a result, the PC became a generic
commodity, and the general-purpose computer was born, and it's still with us.
</p><p>
For now.
</p><p>
In <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Future of the Internet&mdash;and How to Stop It</em></span>
(<a href="https://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/4455262" target="_self">https://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/4455262</a>), Jonathan Zittrain calls
general-purpose computers and networks <span   class="emphasis"><em>generative</em></span>, meaning by nature they
generate and support countless other inventions and services, and the markets
that grow around them.
</p><p>
The term &ldquo;platform&rdquo; suggests a bottom level that supports stuff above. But
generative computers and networks support whole markets both above and below
their own level in the stack. To illustrate this, Zittrain uses an hourglass,
with the generative thing at the waist in the middle (Figure 1).

</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12022f1a.large.jpg"><img src="12022f1a.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1a. PC Hourglass
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12022f1b.large.jpg"><img src="12022f1b.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1b. IP Hourglass
</p></div></div><p>
He also notes how Apple, for example, limits hardware generativity below the
waist of the hourglass by preventing other companies from making devices that
run its OS.
</p><p>
More important, he warns that generativity itself is under threat by a new
model exemplified by giant controlling vendors such as Google, Apple, Facebook
and Amazon (together called &ldquo;GAFA&rdquo; in Europe). Each,
he says, has a &ldquo;model for
lockdown&rdquo; that:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
...exploits near-ubiquitous network connectivity to let vendors change and control
their technologies long after they've left the factory&mdash;or to let them bring
us, the users, to them, as more and more of our activities shift away from our
own devices and into the Internet's &ldquo;cloud&rdquo;.
</p><p>
These technologies can let geeky outsiders build on them just as they could
with PCs, but in a highly controlled and contingent way....
</p><p>
This model is likely the future of computing and networking, and it is no minor
tweak. It is a wholesale revision to the Internet and PC environment we've
experienced for the past thirty years....We are at risk of embracing this model,
thinking it is the best of both worlds&mdash;security and whimsy&mdash;when it may
be the worst. Even fully grasping how untenable our old models have become,
consolidation and lockdown need not be the only alternative. We can stop the
future.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
That book came out in 2008. It's much worse now. The general-purpose PC
business is itself a zombie. IBM is long gone, having sold its PC business to
Lenovo, which makes nice boxes but also likes to install adware on its new
laptops. Other clone-makers have left the business or the planet entirely.
Microsoft now makes its own closed and proprietary hardware on the Apple model.
And, Google has at least as much control over the Android mobile device market
as Microsoft had over its PC OEMs, back in the decade.
</p><p>
CyanogenMod (<a href="http://www.cyanogenmod.org" target="_self">www.cyanogenmod.org</a>) is a worthy Android alternative, but Google appears to be
controlling the mobile market at least as well as Microsoft controlled its PC
one. Mobile hardware also gets old fast, making it a swarm of moving targets,
all changing constantly. So it's hard for a generative OS to support whole
stacks of hardware below and software above.
</p><p>
All four GAFA companies also are better at taking advantage of our next enemy:
centralization.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>
Decentralization and Distributed Everything</b></span>
</p><p>
The original model for the Internet was drawn by Paul Baran
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Baran" target="_self">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Baran</a>) in 1962
(<a href="http://www.rand.org/about/history/baran.html" target="_self">www.rand.org/about/history/baran.html</a>). It's the
one on the right in Figure 2.

</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12022f2.large.jpg"><img src="12022f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Centralized, Decentralized and Distributed Networks
</p></div></div><p>
He called it &ldquo;distributed&rdquo;, to contrast it with
&ldquo;centralized&rdquo; and
&ldquo;decentralized&rdquo;, which were the prevailing network architectures of the time,
and for the foreseeable future. As Baran saw it, a distributed network would be
composed of independent peers, each of which could connect to any other peer
or combination of peers. TCP/IP
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite" target="_self">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite</a>), the Internet's base protocol pair, assumed a
distributed network to begin with, and that's why it became so generative in
1995, when commercial activity was no longer kept off of it.
</p><p>
Yet nearly all the sites and services using the Web are built on the client-server
computing model (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client-server_model" target="_self">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client-server_model</a>). While client-server is ideal for distributed applications, it
still presumes a server as a center, and can be used to overlay many
centralized assets and services onto the distributed Internet. This is how
dominant companies create worldwide webs of deep dependencies, controlling
whole markets for hardware, software, providers, customers and up to a billion
and more users.
</p><p>
One of the great inventions on the Web was blogging. Thanks to RSS, anybody
could syndicate what he or she wrote to the whole world, meaning anybody's
publication easily could get subscribers. I started blogging myself in late
1999. By 2003, I was one of the top 20 bloggers in the world, according to
Technorati, the blog search engine that Dave Sifry
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Sifry" target="_self">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Sifry</a>) invented while helping me
write a story about blogging for <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>
(<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/6497" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/6497</a>). My blog (<a href="http://doc.weblogs.com" target="_self">doc.weblogs.com</a>) had
between a few and many thousands of visitors per day, most from people who
subscribed to my RSS feed.
</p><p>
Blogs were part of what my son Allen around the same time called &ldquo;the live
Web&rdquo; (<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/8549" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/8549</a>),
which he saw branching off the &ldquo;static&rdquo; Web of
&ldquo;sites&rdquo; at &ldquo;addresses&rdquo;
with &ldquo;domains&rdquo; and &ldquo;locations&rdquo; that were
&ldquo;built&rdquo; and &ldquo;visited&rdquo; or &ldquo;browsed&rdquo;.
</p><p>
Back in the early 2000s, it would take search engines like Google up to a month
to re-visit and index a static Web site. But over the coming years, three things
caused the live Web to eat the static one: search engine time-to-index
approached zero, &ldquo;social media&rdquo; (starting with Twitter and Facebook) took off,
and smartphones (with their apps) became a required accessory.
</p><p>
During that transition, Hossein Derakhshan
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hossein_Derakhshan" target="_self">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hossein_Derakhshan</a>), a Canadian journalist from Iran who
blogged by the handle Hoder (at hoder.ir, now gone), served six years in an
Iranian prison (yes, for his blogging) getting out in 2014. Appalled by what
happened to the Web, and especially to blogging, he wrote &ldquo;The Web We Have to
Save&rdquo; (<a href="https://medium.com/matter/the-web-we-have-to-save-2eb1fe15a426#.6ktnkemaw" target="_self">https://medium.com/matter/the-web-we-have-to-save-2eb1fe15a426#.6ktnkemaw</a>) on
the centralized blogging platform Medium (<a href="https://medium.com" target="_self">https://medium.com</a>), a recent creation of Ev
Williams (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evan_Williams_(Internet_entrepreneur)" target="_self">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evan_Williams_(Internet_entrepreneur)</a>),
who co-created Blogger
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evan_Williams_%28Internet_entrepreneur%29#Pyra_Labs_and_Blogger" target="_self">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evan_Williams_%28Internet_entrepreneur%29#Pyra_Labs_and_Blogger</a>),
which was acquired by Google in 2003 and
somehow survives. In that piece, Hossein wrote, &ldquo;The rich, diverse, free web
that I loved&mdash;and spent years in an Iranian jail
for&mdash;is dying. Why is nobody stopping it?&rdquo;
</p><p>
He especially mourned the loss of hyperlinks that make the Web a web:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Since I got out of jail, though, I've realized how much the hyperlink has been
devalued, almost made obsolete.
</p><p>
Nearly every social network now treats a link as just the same as it treats any
other object&mdash;the same as a photo, or a piece of
text&mdash;instead of seeing it as a way to make that text richer.
You're encouraged to post one single hyperlink and expose it to a
quasi-democratic process of liking and plussing and hearting: adding several
links to a piece of text is usually not allowed. Hyperlinks are objectivized,
isolated, stripped of their powers.
</p><p>
At the same time, these social networks tend to treat native text and
pictures&mdash;things that are directly posted to
them&mdash;with a lot more respect than those that reside on outside
web pages. One photographer friend explained to me how the images he uploads
directly to Facebook receive a large number of likes, which in turn means they
appear more on other people's news feeds. On the other hand, when he posts a
link to the same picture somewhere outside Facebook&mdash;his now-dusty
blog, for instance&mdash;the images are much less visible to Facebook
itself, and therefore get far fewer likes. The cycle reinforces itself.
</p><p>
Some networks, like Twitter, treat hyperlinks a little better. Others, insecure
social services, are far more paranoid. Instagram&mdash;owned by
Facebook&mdash;doesn't allow its audiences to leave whatsoever. You can
put up a web address alongside your photos, but it won't go anywhere. Lots of
people start their daily online routine in these cul de sacs of social media,
and their journeys end there. Many don't even realize that they're using the
Internet's infrastructure when they like an Instagram photograph or leave a
comment on a friend's Facebook video
(<a href="http://qz.com/333313/milliions-of-facebook-users-have-no-idea-theyre-using-the-internet" target="_self">qz.com/333313/milliions-of-facebook-users-have-no-idea-theyre-using-the-internet</a>). It's just an app.
</p><p>
But hyperlinks aren't just the skeleton of the web: they are its eyes, a path
to its soul. And a blind webpage, one without hyperlinks, can't look or gaze at
another webpage&mdash;and this has serious consequences for the
dynamics of power on the web.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
What made this happen is centralization. The GAFA giants and their like
dominate by plying the arts and sciences of centralization to a near-absolute
degree. As a result we are forgetting and failing to protect the distributed
nature of the Net itself.
</p><p>
I despair of fighting this, and said so in &ldquo;Giving Silos Their
Due&rdquo; (<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/giving-silos-their-due" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/content/giving-silos-their-due</a>), an EOF a few
months back. Phil Windley responded with &ldquo;Decentralization Is Hard, Maybe
Too Hard&rdquo;
(<a href="http://www.windley.com/archives/2016/02/decentralization_is_hard_maybe_too_hard.shtml" target="_self">www.windley.com/archives/2016/02/decentralization_is_hard_maybe_too_hard.shtml</a>),
which was even more despairing. Writes Phil:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
I remember telling Doc a while back that I'm often afraid that the Internet is
an aberration. That it's a gigantic accident brought on by special circumstances.
That accident showed us that large-scale, decentralized systems can be built,
but those circumstances are not normal. 
</p></blockquote></div><p>
We have now lived so long as serfs in GAFA's feudal castles
(<a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2012/12/feudal_sec.html" target="_self">https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2012/12/feudal_sec.html</a>) that it is hard to
imagine the networked world lacking dependence on overlords to provide much of
what we need and take for granted&mdash;all on their terms rather than ours.
Which brings us to our next cause.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Privacy:</b></span>
</p><p>
At Black Hat 2015, Jennifer Stisa Granick
(<a href="http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/about/people/jennifer-granick" target="_self">cyberlaw.stanford.edu/about/people/jennifer-granick</a>), Director of Civil Liberties at the
Stanford Center for Internet and Society (<a href="http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu" target="_self">cyberlaw.stanford.edu</a>) gave a keynote talk titled &ldquo;The End of
the Internet Dream&rdquo;
(<a href="https://backchannel.com/the-end-of-the-internet-dream-ba060b17da61#.spambd160" target="_self">https://backchannel.com/the-end-of-the-internet-dream-ba060b17da61#.spambd160</a>). Among many other scary things, she said this:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
The first casualty of centralization has been privacy. And since privacy is
essential to liberty, the future will be less free.
</p><p>
This is the Golden Age of Surveillance. Today, technology is generating more
information about us than ever before, and will increasingly do so, making a
map of everything we do, changing the balance of power between us, businesses,
and governments. The government has built the technological infrastructure and
the legal support for mass surveillance, almost entirely in secret.
</p><p>
Here's a quiz. What do emails, buddy lists, drive back-ups, social networking
posts, web browsing history, your medical data, your bank records, your face
print, your voice print, your driving patterns and your DNA have in common?
</p><p>
Answer: The US Department of Justice (DOJ) doesn't think any of these things
are private. Because the data is technically accessible to service providers or
visible in public, it should be freely accessible to investigators and
spies....
</p><p>
The physical design and the business models that fund the communications
networks we use have changed in ways that facilitate rather than defeat
censorship and control.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Privacy is something we define and control with technology and norms. In the
physical world, we've had thousands of years to create those, starting with the
original privacy tech: clothing and shelter. In the networked world, we've 
had only a couple decades. That's not enough. So we have a lot of work to do,
starting with the equivalents of clothing and shelter. What are those? The
answers need to be ones any muggle can use&mdash;not just wizards like us.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
The True Internet of Things:</b></span>
</p><p>
The &ldquo;Internet of Things&rdquo; today is a
mess traveling as a fantasy. Most
Internet-connected &ldquo;things&rdquo; sold by Amazon, Google, GE and others live in
silo'd systems meant to trap customers and fail&mdash;on purpose&mdash;to
interoperate with things in other companies' silos. Together these comprise
what Phil Windley calls The CompuServe of Things
(<a href="http://www.windley.com/archives/2014/04/the_compuserve_of_things.shtml" target="_self">www.windley.com/archives/2014/04/the_compuserve_of_things.shtml</a>).
</p><p>
Worse, many of them are designed to spy on you. As Jennifer Granick puts
it:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Now we have networked devices, the so-called Internet of Things, that will keep
track of our home heating, and how much food we take out of our refrigerator,
and our exercise, sleep, heartbeat, and more. These things are taking our
off-line physical lives and making them digital and networked, in other words,
surveillable.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Shoshana Zuboff says this is inevitable
(<a href="http://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/the-surveillance-paradigm-be-the-friction-our-response-to-the-new-lords-of-the-ring-12241996.html?printPagedArticle=true#pageIndex_2" target="_self">www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/the-surveillance-paradigm-be-the-friction-our-response-to-the-new-lords-of-the-ring-12241996.html?printPagedArticle=true#pageIndex_2</a>), because it follows three laws:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
First, that everything that can be automated will be automated. Second, that
everything that can be informated will be informated. And most important to us
now, the third law: in the absence of countervailing restrictions and
sanctions, every digital application that can be used for surveillance and
control will be used for surveillance and control, irrespective of its
originating intention.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
So, in obedience to an original intention of giving you better advertising, new
Samsung TVs watch you while you watch them. Exactly what nobody will ever ask
for.
</p><p>
Phil Windley sums up the challenge this way:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
On the Net today we face a choice between freedom and captivity, independence
and dependence. How we build the Internet of Things has far-reaching
consequences for the humans who will use&mdash;or be used by&mdash;it. Will we push
forward, connecting things using forests of silos that are reminiscent of the
on-line services of the 1980s, or will we learn the lessons of the Internet and
build a true Internet of Things?
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Good question.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Freedom:</b></span>
</p><p>
I have a long list of other topics, but every one I can think of goes back to
where we were in the first place&mdash;or before the first place. To freedom.
</p><p>
Linux is called Gnu Linux by many in the Free Software movement. Their ethos
and their code helped make Linux possible, and Linux still embodies both.
</p><p>
The problem with &ldquo;free software&rdquo;, besides the fact that it needed explanation
(&ldquo;free as in freedom, not as in beer&rdquo;), was that it had no box
office. &ldquo;Open
source&rdquo; did have box office, and we (myself included) did a pretty good job of
getting it known, if not well understood, by the whole technical world.
</p><p>
I don't think that making a big thing about open source hurt the cause of
freedom. But I also don't think it helped much, if at all. Regardless of the
causalities involved, we took our eye off the freedom ball. Here's how Eben
Moglen put it in a talk at Freedom to Connect in 2012 called 
&ldquo;Innovation under
Austerity&rdquo;
(<a href="https://www.softwarefreedom.org/events/2012/freedom-to-connect_moglen-keynote-2012.html" target="_self">https://www.softwarefreedom.org/events/2012/freedom-to-connect_moglen-keynote-2012.html</a>):
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
...if we'd had a little bit more disintermediated innovation, if we had made
running your own Web server very easy, if we had explained to people from the
very beginning how important the logs are, and why you shouldn't let other
people keep them for you, we would be in a rather different state right now.
</p><p>
The next Facebook should never happen. It's intermediated innovation serving
the needs of financiers, not serving the needs of people. Which is not to say that
social networking shouldn't happen, it shouldn't happen with a man-in-the-middle attack built in to it. Everybody in this room knows that. The question is
how do we teach everybody else....
</p><p>
The nature of the innovation established by Creative Commons, by the Free
Software Movement, by Free Culture, which is reflected in the Web, in 
Wikipedia, in all the Free Software operating systems now running everything,
even the insides of all those locked-down vampiric Apple things I see around
the room. All of that innovation comes from the simple process of letting the
kids play and getting out of the way. Which, you are aware, we are working as
hard as we can to prevent now completely.
</p><p>
Increasingly, all around the world the actual computing artifacts of daily life
for human individual beings are being made so you can't hack them. The computer
science laboratory in every twelve-year-old's pocket is being locked-down.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
How did we let that happen? And who are &ldquo;we&rdquo; anyway? In
&ldquo;A Tale of Three
Cultures&rdquo; (<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/5912" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/5912</a>),
which ran in <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> in 2002, I tried to pull apart the separate cultures
in our community:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
One is purely technical. It's pre-Net, pre-UNIX and maybe even pre-cultural. It
shows up where raw technology meets the real world, and its concerns are
utterly practical. &ldquo;Here's the problem&rdquo;, it says. &ldquo;Let's
solve it.&rdquo; This is a
heads-down culture and civilization depends on it. Embedded systems are what
run our cash registers and brake systems, our airplane guidance systems, our
factory robotics, our flow meters, our stoplights and our heating systems. The
Net and Linux are both handy ways to solve countless embedded systems
problems&mdash;extremely handy, it turns out. One morning at SXSW I read that
embedded Linux soon will run in something like 60,000 cash registers at Home
Depot. It's a big story, but mostly a technical one. Does Home Depot give a
damn about Linux as a cause? Or about the lawmaking that threatens to turn the
Net into nothing more than a backbone for industrial-grade commerce, plus a
bunch of culverts for moving &ldquo;content&rdquo; stamped and sanitized by ubiquitous
digital content management? I kind of doubt it.
</p><p>
The other two cultures are the geeks and the entertainment industry, what Larry
Lessig and others like to characterize geographically as Silicon Valley and
Hollywood.
</p><p>
The geeks built the Net and want to keep it free. Hollywood wants to control
it. That's the basic conflict. Since the beginning, the geeks have had resolute
faith in the Net's ability to resist control by government and commercial
interests. Geeks interpret attempts at control as mere problems the Net will
naturally route around. The same goes for Linux, which has proven handy for
extending the Net upward into the operating system and outward into the world.
That geek philosophy was manifest in John Perry Barlow's &ldquo;A Declaration of the
Independence of Cyberspace&rdquo;, even six years after it was written in February
1996. The provocations have changed, but the sides remain the same. And, like I
said, those sides dwell in our own heads.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Turns out it wasn't just Hollywood. Geeks who succeeded went both Hollywood and
Wall Street&mdash;also away from themselves as ordinary folks like you and me.
Google, for example, does lots of good in the world. I know lots of people
there, and they're all very nice&mdash;including the founders, who I've met and
like. Yet Google, for all the good it does in the world, is a colossus that
plays a huge role in countless lives, yet has almost zero accountability to
individual human beings. By design.
</p><p>
A good example comes from a recent post at BoingBoing titled &ldquo;A Plea for Help
From Someone Being Casually Crushed Under Google's Heel&rdquo;
(<a href="https://bbs.boingboing.net/t/a-plea-for-help-from-someone-being-casually-crushed-under-googles-heel/76666" target="_self">https://bbs.boingboing.net/t/a-plea-for-help-from-someone-being-casually-crushed-under-googles-heel/76666</a>). It's by a couple who
says say they are paying customers of Google, for storage of Google Apps data;
yet Google has yanked their accounts for some machine reason no humans can be
found to fix. My wife and I are in the same boat with Gmail. Something went
wrong a few months back, and Gmail barely works any more for either of us.
Fortunately, Gmail was a secondary system for us, but we feel the pain. 
</p><p>
An irony here is that Google prides itself on knowing people extremely well.
Yet even that has a Matrix-like inhumanity to it.
</p><p>
We see the same thing with Facebook. Mark Zuckerberg is another super-smart
geek who now runs a giant company involved in more than a billion human lives,
with almost no accountability to the individuals who depend on the company's
services.
</p><p>
Like Google, Facebook is a B2B business that sells data about its consumers to
its actual customers, which are corporations. So, while Facebook talks one
game&mdash;about doing good things for individuals&mdash;it plays another. For
example, at the latest F8 conference, in April, Mark Zuckerberg said this
(<a href="http://money.cnn.com/2016/04/12/technology/facebook-messenger-bots/index.html" target="_self">money.cnn.com/2016/04/12/technology/facebook-messenger-bots/index.html</a>):
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Now that Messenger has scaled, we're starting to develop ecosystems around it.
And the first thing we're doing is exploring how you can all communicate with
businesses.
</p><p>
You probably interact with dozens of businesses every day. And some of them are
probably really meaningful to you. But I've never met anyone who likes calling
a business. And no one wants to have to install a new app for every service or
business they want to interact with. So we think there's gotta be a better way
to do this.
</p><p>
We think you should be able to message a business the same way you message a
friend. You should get a quick response, and it shouldn't take your full
attention, like a phone call would. And you shouldn't have to install a new
app.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Let's pause here. It looks like he's going to give us a better way to talk to
businesses, right? Maybe a new way to issue a call for help, or to send out a
request for a plumber or a licensed electrician&mdash;something that helps us
deal with the typical pains of being a customer of many products and services
in the real world. Now, let's hit Play again:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
So today we're launching Messenger Platform. So you can build bots for
Messenger.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Who is the &ldquo;you&rdquo; he's talking about here? It's not the
&ldquo;you&rdquo; who wants a better
way to talk to businesses. It's developers working for businesses that doesn't
want human beings to talk to customers, a decision they already made by
replacing customer service people with apps customers install. Zuck again:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
And it's a simple platform, powered by artificial intelligence, so you can
build natural language services to communicate directly with people. So let's
take a look.
</p><p>
CNN, for example, is going to be able to send you a daily digest of stories,
right into messenger. And the more you use it, the more personalized it will
get. And if you want to learn more about a specific topic, say a Supreme Court
nomination or the zika virus, you just send a message and it will send you that
information.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
And thus he obeys all three of Zuboff's Laws.
</p><p>
And he's not the only one misdirecting attention away from surveillance. Nearly
every story about Facebook's new bot thing focuses on lost jobs or the
threatened app marketplace. Not on the loss of freedom.
</p><p>
In &ldquo;'Bot' is the wrong name...and why people who think it's silly are
wrong&rdquo;
(<a href="https://medium.com/lightspeed-venture-partners/bot-is-the-wrong-name-and-why-people-who-think-they-are-silly-are-wrong-dc0c0b76ae18#.mkl3r99xo" target="_self">https://medium.com/lightspeed-venture-partners/bot-is-the-wrong-name-and-why-people-who-think-they-are-silly-are-wrong-dc0c0b76ae18#.mkl3r99xo</a>),
Aaron Batalion says all kinds of functionality now found only in apps will move
to Messenger. &ldquo;In a micro app world, you build one experience on the Facebook
platform and reach 1B people.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Nobody suggests building one method for connecting a billion people to every
business they deal with&mdash;which, in case you don't know by now, is what I've
been evangelizing with ProjectVRM (<a href="http://blogs.harvard.edu/vrm" target="_self">blogs.harvard.edu/vrm</a>) for the last ten years. Because it's easier
to think big than think right. And by &ldquo;right&rdquo; I mean free.
</p><p>
So where are we headed here?

</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Twenty years from now:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
You won't necessarily know anything about the decisions that affect your
rights, like whether you get a loan, a job, or if a car runs over you. Things
will get decided by data-crunching computer algorithms and no human will really
be able to understand why.
</p></li><li><p>
The Internet will become a lot more like TV and a lot less like the global
conversation we envisioned 20 years ago.
</p></li><li><p>
Rather than being overturned, existing power structures will be reinforced and
replicated, and this will be particularly true for security.
</p></li><li><p>
Internet technology design increasingly facilitates rather than defeats
censorship and control.
</p></li></ul></div></blockquote></div><p>
And it will all be done on Linux.
</p><p>
Remember how Zuboff's Third Law said &ldquo;In the absence of countervailing
restrictions and sanctions&rdquo;?
</p><p>
It's our job to correct that absence.
