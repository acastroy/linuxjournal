Bruce Byfield's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Designing with LibreOffice</em></span></h2></div></div><p>
Tech author and <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> writer Bruce Byfield's
new book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Designing with LibreOffice</em></span> is not
the usual death march through the menu and standard tasks. Rather,
Byfield's book takes two fresh approaches to the world's most
popular free office suite. First, Byfield outlines the importance of using
styles and templates in order to utilize LibreOffice with the most
convenience and least effort. This approach lets users concentrate
on self-expression, rather than formatting. Second, Byfield explains the
basics of modern design and how to apply them in LibreOffice, illuminating
the open secret that LibreOffice is as much a desktop publishing tool as an
office suite. Byfield explains and illustrates the range of design choices
as well as the pros, cons and considerations behind each choice. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Designing
with LibreOffice</em></span> was released under a Creative Commons

Contrast Security's Contrast Enterprise</h2></div></div><p>
With more and more businesses running on the Node.js server-side JavaScript
runtime environment, application vulnerabilities are a growing threat to
entire organizations. The antidote to this problem, says Contrast Security,
is the new Contrast Enterprise, which is marketed as the only application
security product that enables the discovery and remediation of Node.js
security vulnerabilities in real time. Contrast Enterprise achieves this
without disrupting software development processes or involving application
security experts. Product features include high levels of accuracy so that
developers don't burn cycles chasing false alarms; continuous operation
throughout the Agile development process&mdash;that is, no security scans or waiting
for results; and deep security instrumentation for identifying
vulnerabilities across Node.js deployments, such as APIs, microservices,
containers and libraries.

Dynamsoft's Barcode Reader SDK</h2></div></div><p>
What's slick about Dynamsoft's Barcode Reader SDK is that just a few
lines of code from scratch are required instead of potentially hundreds of
them, which could save months of development time. The updated Barcode
Reader SDK 4.2, which adds Linux PHP support, allows application developers
to embed functionality for decoding linear and 2D barcodes
into Web or desktop applications almost instantly, significantly reducing
development costs and costs of long-term application support. Barcode recognition is
enabled from image files, scanned images and from images captured on
Webcams or smartphones. The new PHP barcode reader toolkit for Linux
supports PHP x64 versions 5.3&ndash;5.6. Both Thread Safe and Non Thread Safe
options are provided. The Dynamsoft toolkit works with Debian,
Ubuntu and CentOS. Support for Web applications in ASP.NET, in C# or
VB.NET, and PHP on Windows also is included, just in case.

Apricorn's Aegis Secure Key 3.0 USB Drives</h2></div></div><p>
Packing a mighty punch in a tiny package is the Apricorn's Aegis Secure
Key 3.0 line of software-free, hardware-encrypted USB drives, which
recently added a 480GB version. Apricorn claims that the new Flash key is
&ldquo;roughly four times the competition's max size of 120GB&rdquo; and
&ldquo;the ideal tool for corporate data security deployment&rdquo;. Apricorn
boasts that Aegis Secure Keys are completely software-free, cross-platform-compatible with any OS and have embedded authentication, meaning that no
security parameters ever are shared with the host. They further carry the
highest portable device security validation that the NIST grants: FIPS
140-2 level 3, and feature separate admin and user modes, two read-only
modes, forced enrollment, programmable brute-force defense, a lock-override
mode and the ability to adhere to most security policies. Apricorn's
Aegis Secure Key 3.0 is available in 8GB, 16GB, 30GB, 60GB, 120GB, 240GB
and 480GB capacities.

Microstar Laboratories, Inc.'s Accel64 for Linux</h2></div></div><p>
Microstar Laboratories, Inc., develops Data Acquisition Processor (DAP)
systems for PC-based high-performance multichannel measurement
applications. Microstar observes that GNU/Linux distributions generally
presume that if you have 64-bit hardware and a 64-bit operating system, the
applications will use compatible 64-bit development tools and drivers,
leaving support for 32-bit applications incomplete. This can present
problems for vetted 32-bit applications, particularly those dependent on
kernel extensions. To deal with the problem, Microstar's latest
innovation in the DAP space is Accel64 for Linux software, version 1.00.
Accel64 allows advanced DAP applications to be supported as 32-bit
applications on 32-bit or 64-bit hardware platforms, or as 64-bit
applications on 64-bit hardware platforms. Delegation of complex real-time
details to the DAP/DAPL systems means that data acquisition applications
can use generic kernels and graphical desktop environments, even on
lightweight platforms without 64-bit support. This new software is
available for free download.

Susan Lauber's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Command Line Complete Video
Course</em></span> (Prentice
Hall)</h2></div></div><p>
Users, developers and administrators can all find much to love in
Linux's powerful command line. Those seeking to go deeper into the
Linux command-line interface&mdash;from new users of the Linux command line to
system administrators with limited command-line experience or developers
more comfortable with an IDE&mdash;will find just what they need in technical
instructor and trainer Susan Lauber's new Prentice Hall LiveLessons
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Command Line Complete Video Course</em></span>. The 6+ hours of video training
introduce common utilities used at the Linux command line. While learning
commands for specific tasks, users will obtain greater confidence
navigating the Linux filesystem, understand how to locate and edit files,
use Bash shell features for efficiency and automation and access built-in
help for further exploration.

Mark Geddes' <span   class="emphasis"><em>Arduino Project Handbook</em></span> (No Starch Press)</h2></div></div><p>
Lifelong tinkerer and gadget enthusiast Mark Geddes was so frustrated with
the lack of practical, visual Arduino guides for teaching his ten-year-old
that he wrote his own book on the topic. Titled <span   class="emphasis"><em>Arduino Project Handbook:
25 Practical Projects to Get You Started</em></span>, Geddes' book is a
beginner-friendly collection of 25 fun and interactive projects to build
with the low-cost Arduino microcontroller. Projects range from disco strobe
lights and joystick lasers to rocket launchers and laser tripwires. This
is a step-by-step project book, suitable for total beginners just starting
out as well as for more experienced makers looking for inspiration. Readers
will get set up with introductions on the hardware and software along with advice
on tools, components and workspaces. Then it's time to choose a
project to build from scratch, using straight-forward instructions, color
illustrations, simple circuit diagrams and the complete code to program
the build. <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Arduino Project Handbook</em></span>
is a
fast and fun way to get started.

SoftMaker FreeOffice</h2></div></div><p>
The bottom line on SoftMaker FreeOffice 2016&mdash;the updated, free,
full-featured Office alternative to the expensive Microsoft Office
suite&mdash;is this: no other free office suite offers as high a level of file
compatibility with Word, Excel and PowerPoint. This maxim applies to both
Windows and Linux operating systems, says the suite's maker, SoftMaker
Software GmbH. SoftMaker asserts that the myriad competing free
alternatives often harbor problems opening the Excel, Word and PowerPoint
file formats loss-free. Sometimes the layout and formatting get lost, and
on other occasions, files cannot even be opened. SoftMaker sees itself as
the positive exception to this rule, especially with the newly overhauled
FreeOffice 2016. Benefiting greatly from SoftMaker's commercial
offering, SoftMaker Office 2016, FreeOffice 2016 adds features such as
improved graphics rendering, compatibility with all current Linux
distributions and Windows flavors (XP to Windows 10), new EPUB export and
improved PDF export and many other MS-Office interoperability enhancements.
