Get started editing code like a pro, with Sublime Text, a programmer's editor.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2653580.0x274b1f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Sublime Text is a proprietary, cross-platform text editor designed
for people who spend huge amounts of time shuffling code around. A
programmer's editor, Sublime Text is a third option to the long-standing
&ldquo;Vi or Emacs&rdquo; conundrum. Going beyond the basics of syntax highlighting
and code folding, Sublime offers a litany of innovative and unique
features. With version 3.0 just around the corner, I'm taking you on a
tour of Sublime's most compelling features and add-on packages.
</p><p>
At the time of this writing, Sublime Text version 2 is $70 US, and the upgrade
to version 3 (which is currently in beta) will be paid. Version 2 is
downloadable as a trial, allowing you to get a feel for the editor for
as long as you need before committing to buy. Because the application
is available for Linux, Windows and Mac OS X, you do not need to buy a
separate license for each platform. $70 US may
seem like a lot for a text editor,
but if you spend hundreds of hours a month in front of your editor,
it's a worthy investment.
</p><p>
Most of the content in this article should apply to either Sublime Text 2
or 3. Sublime Text 3 is not available for pre-purchase evaluation,
so if you're new to Sublime Text, you'll be stuck with version 2 for now.
You can download Sublime Text from <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com" target="_self">www.sublimetext.com</a>.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2653580.0x274b568"></a>
Getting Around in Sublime Text</h2></div></div><p>
Start Sublime Text, and the first thing you're greeted with is a
charcoal editor window. A traditional project sidebar is on the left, and
on the right, is what Sublime calls the Minimap. The Minimap is a zoomed-out view
of the currently open file, which works a bit like a WYSIWYG
scroll bar. Open some source code, and the Minimap provides a useful way
of navigating large files visually.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11516f1.large.jpg"><img src="11516f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Sublime Text Editor Window
</p></div></div><p>
If you have a directory holding a project to work on, choose File&rarr;Open Folder to select the project folder, then save the project by
using Project&rarr;Save Project As. Consistent with the spirit of Sublime
Text, you can tweak the properties of the project simply by opening the
.sublime-project file directly and editing its contents.
</p><p>
Open files in Sublime Text are shown in tabs reminiscent of Chrome. You 
can reorder and drag them between open Sublime Text windows, again like
in Chrome or Firefox. This feature is particularly nice if you have 
multiple monitors, as it lets you quickly organize a vast workspace. If
you want to focus (on writing a <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> article, perhaps), use
View&rarr;Enter Distraction Free Mode (Shift-F11) to view your file in
full screen with all navigation widgets hidden.
</p><p>
Part of Sublime Text's appeal is speed, both in terms of application
performance and UI design. A wide array of highly customizable keyboard
shortcuts make using the mouse optional. My most frequently used hotkey
is called Goto Anything and is available from the Goto&rarr;Goto Anything
menu item (Ctrl-p). Provided you have the relevant language support
installed (more on that later), Goto Anything lets you quickly access
files, classes, functions and even regular old variables as you type. For
example, I'll open up my project's icongrabber.py file by pressing Ctrl-p,
and as I type my desired filename, Sublime Text narrows down possible
completions. When using Goto Anything, you can prefix your query with
@ to find a symbol, # to search within a file or : to jump to
a line number. Unfortunately, Sublime Text does not search symbols in
unopened files.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11516f2.large.jpg"><img src="11516f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. As you type the name of your file, Sublime Text narrows down
possible completions.
</p></div></div><p>
A close second in useful keyboard shortcuts is the Command
Palette. Similar to the Escape/Command prompt in Emacs, Sublime's Command
Palette lets you quickly execute commands internal to Sublime Text or
provided by an add-on package you've installed. For example, to toggle word
wrap, use Tools&rarr;Command Palette (Shift-Ctrl-p) and type &ldquo;wrap&rdquo;. Sublime
is smart enough to suggest &ldquo;Toggle Word Wrap&rdquo; as a completion. Notice that
Sublime Text also shows keyboard shortcuts for commands that have them.
</p><p>
To view a full list of default key bindings, click on the Preferences Menu
and choose &ldquo;Key Bindings - Default&rdquo;. This will open up the system-wide
key-binding file. To create your own key-binding preferences, choose
&ldquo;Key Binding - User&rdquo;, and use the same syntax as the default file.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2653580.0x274bda8"></a>
Editing Kung Fu</h2></div></div><p>
Now to the heart of what makes Sublime Text such a powerful editor:
its unique alchemy of text editing features. Sublime Text's most praised
editing feature is multi-selection, which is a little tricky to wrap your
head around at first. Most editors let you select only one contiguous span
of text; some let you select text as a block. Sublime Text lets you select
multiple noncontiguous spans of text and act on them collectively. After
you've begun using this feature, its power will become apparent to you,
especially in editing code or any file with a formal syntax.
</p><p>
Say, for example, that I'm converting the following source code from
Python 2 to 3. The first thing I want to do is rename &ldquo;raw_input&rdquo; to just
&ldquo;input&rdquo;:


<pre     class="programlisting">
your_name = raw_input('Enter your name: ')
print 'Hello,', your_name

printer_model = raw_input("What kind of printer do you have?: ")
print your_name, 'has a', printer_model
</pre>
</p><p>
Using Sublime Text, such a task is easy. I'll select the first occurrence
of &ldquo;raw_input&rdquo; and press Ctrl-d. Pay close attention, and you'll notice
that both occurrences of raw_input are now selected, each with its own
blinking cursor. As I begin to type the word &ldquo;input&rdquo;, both occurrences
are replaced. It is true that such a change could have been 
accomplished easily with search and replace, but I've only scratched the
surface with multiple selection.
</p><p>
Next, I'll want to replace the two &ldquo;print&rdquo; statements with Python
3's &ldquo;print&rdquo; function, which means making the commands look like
<tt  >print(...)</tt>. Because the text &ldquo;print&rdquo; occurs four times in this
document, the last technique won't work, so I'll show you another way
to make multiple selections. I'll begin by positioning my cursor on the
first print statement. Then, I'll hold Ctrl while clicking on the other
print statement.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11516f3.large.jpg"><img src="11516f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. The editor cursor is blue, and the mouse pointer is red. By holding
down Ctrl and clicking, you can create multiple editor cursors.
</p></div></div><p>
Although I haven't selected any text, I have two blinking
cursors. Whatever I type will effect both lines. I'll type (, press
end, and type ). Both lines received those keys, and now my file is
Python 3-compliant.
</p><p>
There are several other ways of selecting multiple spans of text in
Sublime Text, and as you experiment with them, you'll get a feel for
how to use them. Ultimately, when used productively, Sublime's multiple
selection feature replaces most editor macro, find/replace operations
and refactoring operations all at once. Imagine, for example, how you
could transform a plain-text list into an HTML &lt;ul&gt; list using multiple
selection. If you can picture how this is done, you're starting to grok
multiple selection. If not, don't fret: this is a new editor feature. A
few trips to YouTube and some video demos will help you get the idea.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2653580.0x274c5e8"></a>
Search and Replace</h2></div></div><p>
Forget grepping through your codebase when the time comes for aggressive
refactoring. Sublime Text offers a powerful recursive search and replace
feature. Recursive search and replace eliminates the need for the GNU
grep and find commands for many users. Many editors provide recursive
search and replace, although I find Sublime Text really gets it right in
a way that few other projects do.
</p><p>
Click on Find&rarr;Find in Files, and a large search bar will appear at
the bottom of your editor. Using the toggle buttons on the left, you
can toggle regular expression matching, case sensitivity and whole
words. Hover over individual icons to see what they do. You also
can select a directory to search and optionally specify replacement text.
</p><p>
If you expect many results or plan to refer to your search results over time,
toggle the &ldquo;Use Buffer&rdquo; icon in the search area. When enabled, Sublime
Text will open a summary of search results in its own editor buffer. When
using a multihead workstation, I find it useful to put search results
in one monitor and code in another. Toggling &ldquo;Show Context&rdquo; will include
a few lines before and after each hit in the results.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11516f4.large.jpg"><img src="11516f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Sublime Text can open up your search results in its own
buffer. Click on any result to jump to its source.
</p></div></div><p>
Sublime Text uses Perl-style regular expressions implemented using
the Boost C++ library. Sublime Text also supports regular expression
replacements.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2653580.0x274ca60"></a>
Snippets</h2></div></div><p>
Despite their best efforts to not repeat themselves, programmers often find
themselves typing common blocks of text throughout their projects. Examples
include standard class file layouts, unit tests and license warnings
programmers put at the top of each file.
</p><p>
To support this work flow, Sublime Text features &ldquo;snippets&rdquo;. Suppose I
have a standard unit test layout for my Python projects:


<pre     class="programlisting">

"""
Unit tests for &lt;MODULE&gt; in &lt;PROJECT&gt;.
"""
import unittest

class UnitTest(unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        """
        Called before each test to set up the environment.
        """
        pass

    def tearDown(self):
        """
        Called after each test to clean up.
        """
        pass

    def test&lt;METHOD&gt;(self):
        pass

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        unittest.main()

</pre>
</p><p>
I can use Tools&rarr;New Snippet. Sublime Text will give me an example
snippet file. I'll modify it to read like this:


<pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;snippet&gt;
    &lt;content&gt;&lt;![CDATA[
"""
Unit tests for ${1:module} in ${1:project}.
"""
import unittest

class UnitTest(unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        """
        Called before each test to set up the environment.
        """
        pass

    def tearDown(self):
        """
        Called after each test to clean up.
        """
        pass

    def test${1:method}(self):
        pass

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()


]]&gt;&lt;/content&gt;
    &lt;tabTrigger&gt;unittest&lt;/tabTrigger&gt;
    &lt;scope&gt;source.python&lt;/scope&gt;
&lt;/snippet&gt;
</pre>
</p><p>
Notice that I've made a &ldquo;tabTrigger&rdquo; tag and a &ldquo;scope&rdquo; tag in my snippet
file. Using the settings I've given, any time I'm in a Python file and
type the word &ldquo;unittest&rdquo;, I can press Tab, and the snippet will be
inserted where the cursor is. To try it out, I'll save the snippet as
&ldquo;unittest.sublime-snippet&rdquo; in the default directory. Now I can use the
snippet to create unit tests quickly.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2653580.0x2b451d8"></a>
Packages Galore</h2></div></div><p>
Sublime Text can be scripted using plugins written in Python. These
plugins are stored in packages that can be installed locally using a
file manager or your favorite shell. Should you feel the urge to scratch
an itch no one else has found, you can write packages in Python (more
on that later).
</p><p>
I like to think that Sublime walks the fine line between an IDE and
a text editor. Its speed and initial simplicity make it suitable for
editing /etc files as easily as source code. Sublime's true power, however, is
found in add-on packages users can write and install to do everything
from synchronizing files over SSH to refactoring code. Basic syntax
highlighting is included for major languages, but to make use of Python
as a programming tool, I find it's best to install some handy packages.
</p><p>
Before anything else, you'll most likely want to install something
called Package Control, which is a little bit like apt-get for Sublime
Text. Package Control is itself a package that manages downloading,
installing, updating and removing other packages. Download Package
Control from <a href="http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control" target="_self">wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control</a>. To
install a package, just use the Tools&rarr;Command Palette (Shift-Ctrl-P),
and type &ldquo;Package Control&rdquo;. Along with other actions, &ldquo;Install
Package&rdquo;
will be available as a completion.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2653580.0x2b454f0"></a>
Finding Coding Errors</h2></div></div><p>
One of the most compelling features an IDE offers over a text editor is
real-time error detection. For example, if you type a Java syntax error
into Eclipse, the editor realizes your mistake and warns you about it
in real time.
</p><p>
SublimeLinter provides similar functionality for a variety of languages
inside Sublime Text. Install SublimeLinter using the Package Control
&ldquo;Install Package&rdquo; command described above or by downloading it from
<a href="https://github.com/SublimeLinter/SublimeLinter" target="_self">https://github.com/SublimeLinter/SublimeLinter</a>.
</p><p>
SublimeLinter wraps native language tools, such as cppcheck for C and
xmllint for XML, so you'll need the relevant tool installed for your
language. Let's try an XML error.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11516f5.large.jpg"><img src="11516f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. Notice that Sublime Text highlights lines with errors,
and in the status bar, it describes the error itself.
</p></div></div><p>
Can you spot the error in Figure 5? Notice in the gutter of the editor, there's a
warning icon. You'll see in the status bar, SublimeLint is explaining the
problem: I forgot to close the &lt;head&gt; tag. After fixing the problem,
pressing Ctrl-Shift-L will force SublimeLint immediately to rescan the file, and
the error will go away.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2653580.0x2b45968"></a>
For Python Programmers</h2></div></div><p>
If you're a Python programmer, your first download for Python Develop
undoubtedly will be SublimeRope. SublimeRope combines Python's Rope
source code analysis and refactoring library with Sublime Text, offering
context-specific completion, refactoring, jumping to symbols using
Sublime Text's &ldquo;Goto Anything&rdquo; feature and more.
</p><p>
Install SublimeRope by using the Package Control &ldquo;Install Package&rdquo;
command. To test out just one of Sublime Rope's features, try this code:

<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/usr/bin/env python2.7


def hello(name):
    print 'Hello, %s' % name

hello(raw_input('Enter your name: '))
</pre>
</p><p>
Move the cursor over the definition of the hello function. To use a
SublimeRope command to rename &ldquo;hello&rdquo; to &ldquo;greet&rdquo;, use the Command Palette
(Shift-Ctrl-P) and type &ldquo;rename&rdquo;. You should notice a &ldquo;Rope Refactoring:
Rename&rdquo; command. After choosing the Rename command, enter
&ldquo;greeting&rdquo; as
the new name of your function, and notice that the name has been replaced
in both places.
</p><p>
To explore other features of SublimeRope, including organizing imports
and showing documentation of Python methods, just use the Command Palette
and type &ldquo;rope&rdquo; to see the handful of commands SublimeRope provides. In
general, this is a quick way to explore commands provided by packages
you add to Sublime Text.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2653580.0x2b45e90"></a>
Synchronizing Code to a Server</h2></div></div><p>
As a Web developer, I find myself testing and developing code on
servers. Although one way to do this would be to make changes locally and rsync
them up to the server after each edit, with a large codebase, this
is a painfully slow solution. Another option is to use sshfs to mount
a remote filesystem locally, but this too has its problems, especially
in terms of latency over a typical broadband connection.
</p><p>
Enter Sublime SFTP. Although Sublime SFTP is a $16 &ldquo;shareware&rdquo; package,
like Sublime Text itself, SFTP support is a justified expense for anyone
who uses Sublime Text for a living. At the time of this writing, Sublime SFTP
is available only for Sublime Text 2. Install Sublime FTP using the
same method as other packages. Use Package Control's &ldquo;Install
Package&rdquo;
command and find the package called just &ldquo;SFTP&rdquo; in the list.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11516f6.large.jpg"><img src="11516f6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. Sublime SFTP uses your ~/.ssh configuration for authentication.
</p></div></div><p>
To get started, choose File&rarr;SFTP/FTP&rarr;Setup Server. Sublime
Text will open up a file letting you specify a hostname,
user name and so on. Sublime SFTP will use your default SSH keys, so
if you've already configured logging in to your remote host, this
will be easy. Settings for remote servers are stored as files in
~/.config/sublime-text-2/Packages/User/sftp_servers. Each file in
this directory represents a remote server, and files can be directly
manipulated to update settings.
</p><p>
After configuring a server, you can open files remotely by
going to File&rarr;SFTP/FTP&rarr;Browse Server or mapping a local directory to be synchronized
remotely by right-clicking on a directory in your project and choosing
SFTP/FTP&rarr;Map to Remote.
</p><p>
In my experience as a developer, Sublime SFTP is a surprisingly reliable
and well-made package, well worth its unusually high price.

Where to Go from Here</h2></div></div><p>
Of course, I've just scratched the surface of Sublime Text's capabilities
in this article. I've glossed over or left out many great
features, and as you use Sublime Text, you'll find a great deal more. If I've
whet
your appetite to learn more, try reading the Sublime Text Unofficial
Documentation at <a href="http://docs.sublimetext.info/en/latest" target="_self">docs.sublimetext.info/en/latest</a>. Forums 
also are active on <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com" target="_self">www.sublimetext.com</a>, and many
programmers&mdash;especially in
the Python community&mdash;use the editor actively, making its community
robust. Enjoy and happy coding.
