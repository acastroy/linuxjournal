LynuxWorks' LynxOS</h2></div></div><p>
The term &ldquo;Internet of Things&rdquo; is increasingly used to describe our
present-day network of tens of billions of connected devices. In response to
the increasing embedded nature of this network and the growing number and
sophistication of threats to it, embedded software developer LynuxWorks
presents LynxOS 7.0, the next generation of its popular RTOS. The core
focus of version 7.0 of LynxOS is to give developers the tools to guard
against threats at the operating system level, embedding military-grade
security directly into its devices via features like access control
lists, audit, quotas, local trusted path, account management, trusted menu
manager and OpenPAM. This release also features networking support for common
protocols utilized in both long- and short-haul networks. In order to satisfy
demanding real-time QoS requirements of certain market segments, LynuxWorks
has partnered with key middleware providers, such as Real-Time Innovations,
Inc. (RTI), to port their offerings to the LynxOS platform.

Real Time Logic's Mako Server</h2></div></div><p>
Real Time Logic boasts that its Mako Server Web application back end for
Linux, Mac and Windows platforms can respond with 45,000 dynamic page
requests in the same time that Apache outputs 25,000 less-compute-intensive
static pages. Utilizing the easy-to-learn Lua scripting language, Mako Server
offers fast, efficient development of Web applications, ranging from
database-driven business applications to customized applications managing
microcontroller-based devices, says Real Time Logic. In contrast to the
typical approach requiring integration and configuration of components, such
as Apache, PHP and SQL database, Mako Server brings all of these components
together, bundling them into one unit so that the developer can
immediately focus on application development for the desired platform or
device. With the server, developers can bundle their applications into a
single zip file, so users can download and run the application just as
they would a Windows-based application.

WHIPTAIL's WT-1100</h2></div></div><p>
Small businesses with big challenges, especially those with branch offices and
a need to scale out their application-intensive environments, are the target
market for the WHIPTAIL WT-1100 solid-state storage array. This low-profile,
high-performance 1U solid-state storage array features an installation wizard
that speeds deployments, making it ideal for turnkey implementations focused
on virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI), e-mail and databases. The WT-1100,
which can support up to 4TB of SanDisk SSD capacity, performs at 100,000
IOPS, with less than 0.1ms latency and runs WHIPTAIL's RACERUNNER
operating system, which optimizes the write performance of NAND Flash.

BeyondTrust's PowerBroker Servers for Linux and UNIX</h2></div></div><p>
The meat of the matter with the upgraded BeyondTrust's PowerBroker Server 7.5
for Linux and UNIX is that organizations can make better-informed decisions
around root delegation on their most critical servers. This ability is
possible due to added tight integration with the BeyondTrust's vulnerability
management platform, Retina CS, providing clear perspective on how root
delegation affects overall risk to an organization. System administrators
enjoy the ability to delegate privileges and authorization without
disclosing the root password on UNIX, Linux and Mac OS X platforms.
Furthermore, a highly flexible policy language enables creation of unifying
security across multiple platforms and allows users to perform tasks across
multiple targets simultaneously. Deployment requires no changes to the kernel
nor system reboots, thus eliminating their impact on resource availability.
The net impact of the PowerBroker Server solution, says BeyondTrust, is
transparent provision of the boundaries essential to a secure and compliant
environment with a concurrent breaking down of familiar walls that hinder
productivity.

Eewei Chen's <span   class="emphasis"><em>101 Design Ingredients to Solve Big Tech
Problems</em></span> (Pragmatic
Bookshelf)</h2></div></div><p>
You might be a white-belt geek who is venturing into your first big
technology project. Or, you could be a black-belt master geek who's been
tackling big problems for years and needs a fresh approach to problem
solving. Whatever your mastery level, the wisdom found on the pages of Eewei
Chen's new book <span   class="emphasis"><em>101 Design Ingredients to Solve Big Tech
Problems</em></span> may help
you solve the daunting problems that vex you. Humorously illustrated,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>101
Design Ingredients</em></span> is designed to help a technology team identify problems,
share responsibilities and work better together. Part I features case
studies that demonstrate how companies like Facebook and Dropbox blended
ingredients from this book to solve specific business requirements for
investment, innovation, leadership and more. Part II consists of the 101
problem-solving ingredients, grouped into project stages, to help one apply
the right ingredient at the right time. The ingredients cover the spectrum a
business needs to be successful.

Alex Blewitt's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Eclipse Plugin Development by Example</em></span> (Packt
Publishing)</h2></div></div><p>
A nice feature about Alex Blewitt's new book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Eclipse Plugin Development by
Example: Beginner's Guide</em></span> is that one need not have prior experience in
Eclipse plugin development or OSGi. With this book as a guide, Java
developers who already are familiar with Eclipse as an IDE will embark on a
full journey through plugin development, starting with an introduction to
Eclipse plugins, continuing through packaging and culminating in automated
testing and deployment. The included example code provides simple snippets
that can be developed and extended to get users up and running quickly. A
specific chapter on the differences between Eclipse 3.x and Eclipse 4.x
presents a detailed view of the changes needed by applications and plugins
when upgrading to the new model.

Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization 3.2</h2></div></div><p>
Sources at Red Hat call the new Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization 3.2 &ldquo;a
significant step forward for open-source virtualization&rdquo;. A core element
of Red Hat's open hybrid cloud offerings, Red Hat Enterprise
Virtualization is a mission-critical end-to-end, open-source virtualization
infrastructure designed for enterprise users and global organizations. The
platform is designed to meet an increasing industry need for open
virtualization solutions without compromising performance, scalability,
security or features. Version 3.2 adds support for Storage Live Migration;
support for the latest industry-standard processors from Intel and AMD,
including the Intel Haswell series and AMD Opteron G5 processors; and
enhancements in storage management, networking management, fencing and power
management, Spice console, logging and monitoring, and more. A new
third-party plugin framework enables third parties to integrate new features
and actions directly into the user interface; solutions from NetApp, Symantec
and HP already are in development.

Epiq Solutions' Matchstiq Z1</h2></div></div><p>
The most spot-on mantra for our current era is &ldquo;do more with
less&rdquo;,
and such is the accomplishment of Epiq Solutions' Matchstiq Z1, a small
form-factor software-defined radio (SDR) solution. Measuring only 2.2" x 4.6" x
0.9", the Matchstiq Z1 combines a Xilinx Zynq Z-7020 SOC running Linux
with a flexible RF transceiver capable of tuning between 300MHz and 3.8GHz
in a complete SDR solution. Epiq Solutions says that the Matchstiq Z1
provides a more capable signal processing system while maintaining the same
footprint as the existing Matchstiq platform. The company further notes that
users can combine a library of signal processing applications from Epiq
Solutions or other signal processing frameworks, such as GNU Radio or
REDHAWK,
to enable countless capabilities to the Matchstiq Z1, including using it as
an agile point-to-point data modem, LTE survey tool or portable spectrum
analyzer. Development kits also are available for end users who want to
create their own custom applications.
