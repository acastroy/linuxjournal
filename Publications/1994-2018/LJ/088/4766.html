Solaris Running</h2></div></div><p>Financial Risk Management Systems
</p><p>Selling Linux solutions to the financial industry is a tough
job. This traditionally conservative industry has been a slow
adopter of the Open Source movement. Even as this is gradually
changing, better, cheaper, faster Linux solutions aimed at the
financial industry begin to appear. Last year Reuters developed
Value at Risk, a statistical approach predicting how much your
financial investments can lose given a financial horizon. The
targeted development platform for the engine was Solaris 2.7. Once
it was completed, we decided to give Linux a try. Most of the
third-party libraries being available&mdash;a sure sign Linux is gaining
weight in the financial industry&mdash;I ported the core of the engine
itself (about 100 KLOC) to Linux 2.2.14 SMP (Red Hat flavor,
multiprocessor).</p><p>We tested the financial engine with Solaris on a Sun 450, a
four-processor machine running at 300MHz, and with Linux on a
two-processor Pentium III running at 733MHz. Table 1 shows the
results on a typical individual portfolio (30+ stocks).</p><p><a href="4766t1.html" target="_self">Table 1. Performance
Comparison</a></p><p>On Linux the optimized engine was built using GCC 2.95.2.1
with -O3 and on Solaris using SPARCworks 5.0 with -xO3. A financial
engine like ours is not I/O-bound but CPU-bound (the financial
properties are cached). Most of the time is spent calculating
hypothetical future prices of a financial instrument and
manipulating these prices (additions/multiplications, and sorting
operations are involved in the financial algorithms). These tests
would suggest the combination Linux/Intel is at least twice as fast
than the Solaris equivalent. They are designed not to put one
platform over another but as the typical request an on-line broker
might send to our engine. They are real life examples, taken from
common portfolio configurations.</p><p>To be fair we did not anticipate such performance gain by
switching to Linux. We had in mind the deployment costs for our
customers, and we were even ready to lose a bit of speed. Surprised
by these tests, we ran the following test case simulating a common
financial algorithm, which led to similar results (see Table
2):</p><pre     class="programlisting">
for(int j=0; j&lt;10000; j++)
  {
    // Build a time series
    std::vector&lt;double&gt; ts;
    ts.reserve(2000);
    for(int i=0; i&lt;2000; ++i)
      ts.push_back(random());
    // Simulate the perturbation
    for(int i=0; i&lt;2000; ++i)
      ts[i]+=5.0;
    // Sort the time series
    std::sort(ts.begin(), ts.end());
  }
</pre><p><a href="4766t2.html" target="_self">Table 2. Performance Comparison
II</a>
</p><p>We proved here that Linux is a viable alternative to Solaris
for our product offering. Customers can choose their own deployment
platform, Linux, Solaris or a combination of the two, in which case
our engines will communicate with one another, some running on
Solaris, some on Linux. We knew a Linux box was as reliable as
Solaris. We knew it was cheaper. We know today, at least for our
type of application, that it is faster. It is definitely our
platform of choice, and that will contribute to the adoption of
Linux in the financial community, which is a very good
thing.</p><p>&mdash;Sebastien Marc</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e0e580.0x1f06608"></a>Hacker Insurance</h2></div></div><p>On May 28th, ZDNet reported that J. S. Wurzler Underwriting
Managers&mdash;a company that offers &ldquo;hacker insurance&rdquo;--now charges
between 5 and 15% more to companies who employ Windows NT for
internet operations
(<a href="http://www.zdnet.com/intweek/stories/news/0,4164,2766045,00.html" target="_self">www.zdnet.com/intweek/stories/news/0,4164,2766045,00.html</a>).
Of course the numerous security holes for which Microsoft is famous
were cited as one of the reasons for the increase, but more
surprising was the effect of higher employee turnover in companies
that use Microsoft NT. The article relates:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Wurzler found that system administrators working
on open source systems tend to be better trained and stay with
their employers longer than those at firms using Windows software,
where turnover can exceed 33 percent per year. That turnover
contributes to another problem: System administrators are not
implementing all the patches that have been issued for Windows NT,
Wurzler said.</p></blockquote></div><p>The turnover results in reduced implementation of security
patches, compounding the difficulties of weak MS security.

California. As their web site says: &ldquo;The O'Reilly Perl Conference

technologies, but storytellers (folks like us) usually treat the
characters separately&mdash;even given major exceptions like Wintel and
PowerPC. Now, as we look toward next-generation 64-bit chips from
Intel and AMD, the stories tend to be about what those companies
are doing vs. each other, rather than with the communities of
developers surrounding the operating systems that put CPUs to
work.</p><p>As we go to press, Intel's Itanium (aka IA-64) is rolling
into production, almost exactly seven years after Intel and
Hewlett-Packard announced the partnership that would work on the
new chip design, which reportedly began its life in HP's labs as
&ldquo;PA-RISC Wide-Word&rdquo;. The new joint design was code-named Merced
and later given its elementine brand name. Sun Microsystems came to
market with its UltraSPARC III 64-bit processor last fall, but
that's bound to be less interesting to the Linux community than
both Itanium and AMD's Sledgehammer, currently slated for release
about a year from now.</p><p>But Itanium is here. As Linley Gwennap says, &ldquo;Changes in
servers never happen fast. But with Itanium now a reality, Intel's
dominance is only a matter of time.&rdquo;</p><p>And what operating system will most help achieve this
dominance? The top press release linked from Intel's Itanium index
page is titled &ldquo;Intel Itanium-Based Systems Poised For
Production&rdquo;, and says this about operating systems:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Four operating systems will support Itanium-based
systems, including the Microsoft Windows* platform (64-bit Edition*
for workstations and 64-bit Windows Advanced Server Limited Edition
2002* for servers); Hewlett-Packard's HP-UX 11i v1.5*, IBM's
AIX-5L* and Linux. Caldera International, Red Hat, SuSE Linux and
Turbolinux plan to provide 64-bit versions of the Linux operating
system. [The asterisks disclaim ownership of various name
brands.]</p></blockquote></div><p>Note the future tense employed by the operative verb phrase
here: <span   class="emphasis"><em>will support</em></span>.
</p><p>On May 29, SuSE announced SuSE Linux 7.2 for IA-64 and Red
Hat announced Red Hat Linux 7.1 for the Itanium Processor. The next
day Turbolinux announced Turbolinux Operating System 7 for the
Itanium. All three expressed availability in the present tense. At
this writing, three of the four headlines among Intel's Itanium
&ldquo;news and events&rdquo; involve Linux. The fourth is &ldquo;Microsoft
Unveils Plans for 64-Bit Windows Platform&rdquo;.</p><p>As for hardware, SGI announced (also on May 29) Silicon
Graphics 750 system for Linux, which it called &ldquo;The First Itanium
Processor-Based System Using Linux&rdquo;. IBM also said it was building
the second of the world's fastest Linux supercomputers at NCSA by
clustering Itanium-based boxes with Turbolinux. It's due to be
installed this summer.</p><p>Credit should be spread in many directions, but perhaps that
can be done at once by pointing to the Trillian Project (now called
LinuxIA64.org at
<a href="http://linuxia64.org" target="_self">http://linuxia64.org/</a>),
which began in May 1999 and brought together Caldera, CERN, Cygnus
(now Red Hat), HP, Intel, Linuxcare, NEC, SGI, Turbolinux and VA
Linux. Most of those organizations now have something to show for
the effort.</p><p>So, it's already hard to imagine that Itanium's success won't
be due largely to its adoption as a penguin element.</p><p>&mdash;Doc Searls</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e0e580.0x23004e0"></a>They Said It</h2></div></div><p>Only the insane take themselves quite seriously.</p><p>&mdash;Sir Max Beerbohm</p><p>Before a mad scientist goes mad, there's probably a time when
