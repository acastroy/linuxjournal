version of a proprietary program. Can I do this without getting
sued by the owner of the proprietary program?
</p><p>&mdash;Andre Durand, founder of Jabber.Com</p><p>For the sake of illustration only, I'm going to assume that
you want to create an open-source version of a program such as
Windows. Unfortunately, the owners of most proprietary programs
(like the owner of Windows) do not allow you to reverse engineer
their programs or to copy their code. That doesn't mean you can't
exercise your own creativity to create your own winning version of
a proprietary program, including your own improvements and new
features. The simple answer to your question is yes, you can create
an open-source version of a proprietary program, as long as you
create your own version of the program without infringing the
copyrights or patents of the proprietary program. The courts
uniformly hold that a copyright is infringed when one
intentionally, or even subconsciously, makes copies of a
copyrighted work. However, if a person, without making any use of a
prior copyrighted work, by his or her own independent labor
produces something similar, there is no infringement. As Judge
Learned Hand put it, to sustain an infringement suit, &ldquo;more must
appear than the mere similarity or even identity of the supposed
infringement with the part in question&rdquo; (Fred Fisher Inc. vs.
Dillingham D.C.N.Y. 1924 298 F.145, 147). He continues:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Two or more authors may write on the same
subject, treat it similarly, and use the same common materials in
like manner or for one purpose. Their productions may contain the
same thoughts, sentiments, ideas; they may be identical. Such
resemblance or identity is material only as showing whether there
has been unlawful copying.</p></blockquote></div><p>Copying is a matter to be proven by evidence. The
law requires proof of either outright copying or, if the evidence
of copying is unclear, proof that you had access to the original
and that there are &ldquo;substantial similarities&rdquo; between your work
and the original. Because of the risk that evidence can be
interpreted in many ways, when you set out to implement your own
independent version of a copyrighted proprietary program, you
should make a clear record of precisely what you have done. Here
are some simple, common-sense practices you should follow. When you
examine the program you intend to re-implement, restrict yourself
to an external review of the functions and processes that the other
program performs. Remember that if your program turns out to be too
similar to the proprietary program, the court may not believe that
you didn't see and copy copyrighted code. The less you look at, the
less likely it is that your code will be &ldquo;substantially similar&rdquo;.
Don't copy the user documentation for the proprietary program, even
if your new program is intended to operate identically. Such copies
of documentation are infringing even if the software itself doesn't
infringe. If you have had access to the source code or
implementation details of the proprietary program, you may have to
separate yourself from the implementation of the open-source
version. One way big companies do this is to create a specification
that describes what the program is to do, and give that
specification to a separate group of engineers who have never seen
the original proprietary program. Those engineers can implement
according to the specification without copying the original work.
To protect yourself, document this procedure thoroughly. One final
caution: the copyright in the original proprietary program does not
extend to the &ldquo;ideas&rdquo; implemented by the program but only to
their &ldquo;expression&rdquo;. You have the right to re-implement the ideas
of the program without fear of copyright infringement. However, the
ideas may be protected by patents. Merely making, using or selling
the patented software can subject you to claims of patent
infringement. You can infringe a patent even without copying it,
and even if you independently and innocently arrive at the exact
same idea. So if some aspects of the proprietary program are
protected by patent, you will have to find a way to implement those
portions of the program without using any of the patented
technology.
</p><p>Is there any advantage to registering my copyright in a
program?</p><p>&mdash;Mark Jordon, 1707WebWay.Com</p><p>Registering a copyright is a simple and inexpensive process.
The procedure is well documented in Circular 61, Copyright
Registration for Computer Programs, available from the Library of
Congress. For further information, go to
<a href="http://www.loc.gov/copyright/circs/circ61.pdf" target="_self">www.loc.gov/copyright/circs/circ61.pdf</a>.
Registration is not a condition of copyright protection. However,
there are several advantages to registering your work:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Registration establishes a public record
of the copyright claim.</p></li><li><p>Before an infringement suit may be filed
in court, registration is necessary for works of US
origin.</p></li><li><p>If made before or within five years of
publication, registration will establish prima facie evidence in
court of the validity of the copyright and of the facts stated in
the certificate.</p></li><li><p>If registration is made within three
months after publication of the work or prior to an infringement of
the work, statutory damages and attorney's fees will be available
to the copyright owner in court actions. Otherwise, only an award
of actual damages and profits is available to the copyright
owner.</p></li><li><p>Registration allows the owner of the
copyright to record the registration with the US Customs Service
for protection against the importation of infringing
copies.</p></li><li><p>You may register your copyright any time
within the life of the copyright.</p></li></ul></div><p>Legal advice must be provided in the course of an
attorney-client relationship specifically with reference to all the
facts of a particular situation. Even though an attorney wrote the
answers presented here, the information must not be relied upon as
a substitute for obtaining specific legal advice from a licensed
attorney.
