much are they willing to pay for it? Today, there is little privacy
on the Internet, but new chips are emerging that will allow users
to protect their information for little or no extra cost.
</p><p>Two security standards are predominant on the Internet: SSL
and IPSec. The former is built into most browsers, providing secure
web transactions. IPSec creates virtual private networks (VPNs)
that enable users to access remote databases securely.</p><p>Both standards use encryption to protect sensitive data from
sniffers, snoopers and intruders. Until last year, the US
government blocked the export of strong encryption technology, but
the government has since relented. Today, the biggest barrier to
the widespread use of encryption is the massive computation
required to encode and decode messages. If encryption were not
computationally difficult, codes could be easily broken.
Fortunately, most modern PC processors have enough horsepower to
encrypt messages on a broadband internet connection, or even a slow
Ethernet connection. The problem is the server, which must handle
messages from a large number of clients at once. These servers are
typically operating at Fast Ethernet (100Mbps) speeds or
higher.</p><p>To break this bottleneck, companies have turned to dedicated
encryption hardware, such as VPN boxes or SSL cards. These units
typically use specialized security chips that perform encryption
calculations much more quickly than standard CPUs.</p><p>Today's security chips, however, are not very fast, so a
high-end VPN or SSL system may combine several of these expensive
devices, along with their support hardware, to achieve top speed.
As a result, a high-end VPN box sells for hundreds of thousands of
dollars.</p><p>But help is on the way. Greater interest in security has
spurred new companies to enter the market for security chips; we
now count ten companies in this market, with more on the way. Most
of the chips last year came from Hifn, a spin-off of the
software-compression vendor Stac. But chip giants Intel, Motorola
and Philips are jumping into this market as well. Competition
encourages innovation. Not surprisingly, much of this innovation is
coming from small companies such as Chrysalis-ITS, SafeNet and
Securealink as well as startups such as Corrent, NetOctave and
BlueSteel, now the security division of Broadcom. As a result of
this competition, by the middle of next year we will see security
chips operating at 10Gbps, able to serve the fattest pipes in the
network infrastructure.</p><p>This speed is more than 100 times faster than that of the
best security chip available at the beginning of last year, a
phenomenal increase. Compared with the standard pace of Moore's
Law, we have compressed ten years of progress into just over two
years. It will take some time for the new, faster chips to become
common in systems, but by next year, we should see systems with the
performance of today's high-end VPN boxes selling for just a few
thousand dollars.</p><p>In fact, once encryption gets this cheap, it won't even be in
separate boxes; these superfast chips can be included on every line
card in every networking system. ISPs will offer a security service
to their users at a minimal cost, perhaps as little as $1 per
month. At this price, most people will be able to secure their
daily e-mail, web surfing and other on-line activities. Some
analysts predict that, by 2004, as much as half of the traffic on
the Internet will be encrypted.</p><p>In many cases, this will occur with little or no impact on
applications. As part of the IP standard, IPSec works at Layer 3 in
the network stack, below the application layer and below even TCP.
Once the operating system establishes a secure link between two
sites (for example, your PC and a corporate server), all traffic
between these two sites is encrypted and decrypted without any
impact on the application.</p><p>SSL is a higher-layer protocol that must be directly managed
by the application. But since it is already built into the browser,
any services accessed through the browser can take advantage of it.
The onus is on webmasters to implement more of their site on secure
servers. As the cost of security falls, entire sites can be
secured.</p><p>The trick to using IPSec is to make sure it is included in
the operating system. Linux users can take advantage of FreeS/WAN,
a well-regarded open-source implementation of IPSec. Most Linux
distributions, however, do not include FreeS/WAN, although this may
change as encryption becomes more popular. In contrast, IPSec is a
standard feature in Windows 2000. As the cost of security chips
falls, the Linux community needs to be ready. Developers,
distributors and end users should make sure their systems can take
advantage of inexpensive encryption hardware.</p></div></div>
