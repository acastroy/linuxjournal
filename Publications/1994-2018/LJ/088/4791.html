database developed on the Internet by a group of developers spread
across the globe. It is an open-source alternative to commercial
databases like Oracle and Informix.
</p><p>PostgreSQL was originally developed at the University of
California, Berkeley. In 1996, a group began development of the
database on the Internet. They used e-mail to share ideas and file
servers to share code. PostgreSQL is now comparable to proprietary
databases in terms of features, performance and reliability. It has
transactions, views, stored procedures and referential integrity
constraints. It supports a large number of programming interfaces,
including ODBC, Java (JDBC), Tcl/Tk, PHP, Perl and Python.
PostgreSQL continues to improve at a tremendous pace thanks to a
talented pool of internet developers.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2807580.0x28ff710"></a>Performance Concepts</h2></div></div><p>There are two aspects of database-performance tuning. One is
improving the database's use of the CPU, memory and disk drives in
the computer. The second is optimizing the queries sent to the
database. This article talks about the hardware aspects of
performance tuning. The optimization of queries is done using SQL
commands like CREATE INDEX, VACUUM, VACUUM ANALYZE, CLUSTER and
EXPLAIN. These are discussed in my book, <span   class="emphasis"><em>PostgreSQL:
Introduction and Concepts</em></span> at
<a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/awbook.html" target="_self">www.postgresql.org/docs/awbook.html</a>
[see also Stephanie Black's review on page 76].</p><p>To understand hardware performance issues, it is important to
understand what is happening inside the computer. For simplicity, a
computer can be thought of as a central processing unit (CPU)
surrounded by storage. On the same chip with the CPU are several
CPU registers, which store intermediate results and various
pointers and counters. Surrounding this is the CPU cache, which
holds the most recently accessed information. Beyond the CPU cache
is a large amount of random-access main memory (RAM), which holds
executing programs and data. Beyond this main memory are disk
drives, which store even larger amounts of information. Disk drives
are the only permanent storage area, so anything to be kept when
the computer is turned off must be placed there (see Table 1).
Figure 1 shows the storage areas surrounding the CPU.</p><p><a href="4791t1.html" target="_self">Table 1. Types of Computer
Storage</a></p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4791f1.large.jpg"><img src="4791f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Storage Areas
</p></div></div><p>You can see that storage areas increase in size as they get
farther from the CPU. Ideally, a huge amount of permanent memory
could be placed right next to the CPU, but this would be too slow
and expensive. In practice, the most frequently used information is
stored next to the CPU, and less frequently accessed information is
stored farther away and brought to the CPU as needed.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2807580.0x28ffbe0"></a>Keeping Information Near the CPU</h2></div></div><p>Moving information between various storage areas happens
automatically. Compilers determine which information should be
stored in registers. CPU chip logic keeps recently used information
in the CPU cache. The operating system controls which information
is stored in RAM and shuttles it back and forth from the disk
drive.</p><p>CPU registers and the CPU cache cannot be tuned effectively
by the database administrator. Effective database tuning involves
increasing the amount of useful information in RAM, thus preventing
disk access where possible.</p><p>You might think this is easy to do, but it is not. A
computer's RAM contains many things, including executing programs,
program data and stack, PostgreSQL shared buffer cache and kernel
disk buffer cache. Proper tuning involves keeping as much database
information in RAM as possible while not adversely affecting other
areas of the operating system.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2807580.0x28ffd98"></a>PostgreSQL Shared Buffer Cache</h2></div></div><p>PostgreSQL does not directly change information on disk.
Instead, it requests data be read into the PostgreSQL shared buffer
cache. PostgreSQL backends then read/write blocks, and finally
flush them back to disk. Backends that need to access tables first
look for needed blocks in this cache. If they are already there,
they can continue processing right away. If not, an operating
system request is made to load the blocks. The blocks are loaded
either from the kernel disk buffer cache or from disk. These can be
expensive operations.</p><p>The default PostgreSQL configuration allocates 64 shared
buffers. Each buffer is eight kilobytes. Increasing the number of
buffers makes it more likely that backends will find the
information they need in the cache, thus avoiding an expensive
operating system request.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2807580.0x28ffef8"></a>How Big Is Too Big?</h2></div></div><p>You may think, &ldquo;I will just give all my RAM to the
PostgreSQL shared buffer cache.&rdquo; However, if you do that, there
will be no room for the kernel, or for any programs, to run. The
proper size for the PostgreSQL shared buffer cache is the largest
useful size that does not adversely affect other activity.</p><p>To understand adverse activity, you need to understand how
UNIX operating systems manage memory. If there is enough memory to
hold all programs and data, little memory management is required.
However, if everything doesn't fit in RAM, the kernel starts
forcing memory pages to a disk area called swap. It moves pages
that have not been used recently. This operation is called a swap
pageout. Pageouts are not a problem because they happen during
periods of inactivity. What is bad is when these pages have to be
brought back in from swap, meaning an old page that was moved out
to swap has to be moved back into RAM. This is called a swap
pagein. This is bad because while the page is moved from swap, the
program is suspended until the pagein is complete.</p><p>Pagein activity is shown by system analysis tools like
<span   class="bold"><b>vmstat</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>sar</b></span> and indicates there is not
enough memory available to function efficiently. Do not confuse
swap pageins with ordinary pageins, which may include pages read
from the filesystem as part of normal system operation. If you
can't find swap pageins, many pageouts is a good indicator you are
also doing swap pageins.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2807580.0x2900160"></a>Effects of Cache Size</h2></div></div><p>You may wonder why cache size is so important. First, imagine
the PostgreSQL shared buffer cache is large enough to hold an
entire table. Repeated sequential scans of the table will require
no disk access because all the data is already in the cache. Now
imagine the cache is one block smaller than the table. A sequential
scan of the table will load all table blocks into the cache until
the last one. When that block is needed, the oldest block is
removed, which in this case is the first block of the table. When
another sequential scan happens, the first block is no longer in
the cache, and to load it in, the oldest block is removed, which in
this case is now the second block in the table. This pushing out of
the next needed block continues to the end of the table. This is an
extreme example, but you can see that a decrease of one block can
change the efficiency of the cache from 100% to 0%. It shows that
finding the right cache size can dramatically affect
performance.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2807580.0x2900268"></a>Proper Sizing of Shared Buffer Cache</h2></div></div><p>Ideally, the PostgreSQL shared buffer cache will be large
enough to hold most commonly accessed tables and small enough to
avoid swap pagein activity. Keep in mind that the postmaster
allocates all shared memory when it starts. This area stays the
same size even if no one is accessing the database. Some operating
systems pageout unreferenced shared memory, while others lock
shared memory into RAM. The <span   class="emphasis"><em>PostgreSQL 7.2
Administrator's Guide</em></span> has information about kernel
configuration for various operating systems
(<a href="http://www.postgresql.org/devel-corner/docs/admin/kernel-resources.html" target="_self">www.postgresql.org/devel-corner/docs/admin/kernel-resources.html</a>).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2807580.0x2900420"></a>Sort Memory Batch Size</h2></div></div><p>Another tuning parameter is the amount of memory used for
sort batches. When sorting large tables or results, PostgreSQL will
sort them in parts, placing intermediate results in temporary
files. These files are then merged and resorted until all rows are
sorted. Increasing the batch size creates fewer temporary files and
often allows faster sorting. However, if the sort batches are too
large, they cause pageins because parts of the sort batch get paged
out to swap during sorting. In these cases, it is much faster to
use smaller sort batches and more temporary files, so again, swap
pageins determine when too much memory has been allocated. Keep in
mind that this parameter is used for every backend performing a
sort, either for ORDER BY, CREATE INDEX or for a merge join.
Several simultaneous sorts will use several times this amount of
memory.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2807580.0x2900528"></a>Cache Size and Sort Size</h2></div></div><p>Both cache size and sort size affect memory usage, so you
cannot maximize one without affecting the other. Keep in mind that
cache size is allocated on postmaster startup, while sort size
varies depending on the number of sorts being performed. Generally,
cache size is more significant than sort size. However, certain
queries that use ORDER BY, CREATE INDEX or merge joins may see
increases in speed with larger sort batch sizes.</p><p>Also, many operating systems limit how much shared memory can
be allocated. Increasing this limit requires operating
system-specific knowledge to either recompile or reconfigure the
kernel. More information can be found in the <span   class="emphasis"><em>PostgreSQL
7.1 Administrator's Guide</em></span>
(<a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/admin/kernel-resources.html" target="_self">www.postgresql.org/docs/admin/kernel-resources.html</a>).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2807580.0x2900738"></a>Disk Locality</h2></div></div><p>The physical nature of disk drives makes their performance
characteristics different from the other storage areas mentioned in
this article. The other storage areas can access any byte with
equal speed. Disk drives, with their spinning platters and moving
heads, access data near the head's current position much faster
than data farther away.</p><p>Moving the disk head to another cylinder on the platter takes
quite a bit of time. UNIX kernel developers know this. When storing
a large file on disk, they try to place the pieces of the file near
each other. For example, suppose a file requires ten blocks on
disk. The operating system may place blocks 1-5 on one cylinder and
blocks 6-10 on another cylinder. If the file is read from beginning
to end, only two head movements are required&mdash;one to get to the
cylinder holding blocks 1-5, and another to get to blocks 6-10.
However, if the file is read non-sequentially, e.g., blocks
1,6,2,7,3,8,4,9,5,10; ten head movements are required. As you can
see, with disks, sequential access is much faster than random
access. This is why PostgreSQL prefers sequential scans to index
scans if a significant portion of the table needs to be read. This
also highlights the value of the cache.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2807580.0x2900898"></a>Multiple Disk Spindles</h2></div></div><p>The disk head moves around quite a bit during database
activity. If too many read/write requests are made, the drive can
become saturated, causing poor performance (Vmstat and sar can
provide information on the amount of activity on each disk
drive).</p><p>One solution to disk saturation is to move some of the
PostgreSQL data files to other disks. Remember, moving the files to
other filesystems on the same disk drive does not help. All
filesystems on a drive use the same disk heads. Database access can
be spread across disk drives in several ways:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Moving
Databases&mdash;<span   class="bold"><b>initlocation</b></span> allows you
to create databases on different drives.</p></li><li><p>Moving Tables&mdash;symbolic links allow you to move
tables and indexes to different drives. Movement should only be
done while PostgreSQL is shut down. Also, PostgreSQL doesn't know
about the symbolic links, so if you delete the table and recreate
it, it will be created in the default location for that database.
In 7.1, pg_database.oid and pg_class.relfilenode map database,
table and index names to their numeric filenames.</p></li><li><p>Moving Indexes&mdash;symbolic links allow moving indexes
to different drives from their heap tables. This allows an index
scan to be performed on one disk while a second disk performs heap
lookups.</p></li><li><p>Moving Joins&mdash;symbolic links allow the movement of
joined tables to separate disks. If tables A and B are joined,
lookups of table A can be performed on one drive while lookups of
table B can be done on a second drive.</p></li><li><p>Moving Log&mdash;symbolic links can be used to move the
pg_xlog directory to a different disk drive. (Pg_xlog exists in
PostgreSQL releases 7.1 and later.) Unlike other writes, PostgreSQL
log writes must be flushed to disk before completing a transaction.
The cache cannot be used to delay these writes. Having a separate
disk for log writes allows the disk head to stay on the current log
cylinder so writes can be performed without head movement delay.
You can use the postgres -F parameter to prevent log writes from
being flushed to disk, but an operating system crash may require a
restore from backup.</p></li></ul></div><p>Other options include the use of RAID features to spread a
single filesystem across several drives.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2807580.0x2cf90c0"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>Fortunately, PostgreSQL doesn't require much tuning. Most
parameters are automatically adjusted to maintain optimum
performance. Cache size and sort size are two parameters
administrators can control to make better use of available memory.
Disk access can also be spread across drives. Other parameters may
be set in share/postgresql.conf.sample. You can copy this file to
data/postgresql.conf to experiment with some of PostgreSQL's even
more exotic parameters.</p></div></div>
