    Reuven introduces XMLC, part of the Enhydra application server.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1004580.0x10fc710"></a></h2></div></div><p>Over the last few months, we have looked
at a variety of methods for creating web applications using
server-side Java. We started with simple servlets and then moved
onto JavaServer Pages (JSPs). In order to remove Java code from our
JSPs, we began to use JavaBeans, objects whose methods are
automatically available to our pages.
</p><p>But you can only go so far with JavaBeans, which is where
custom actions come in. These actions, which look like XML tags and
attributes in our JSPs, are tied to the methods of a Java class. In
other words, placing a tag in our JSP can effectively invoke one or
more methods. Combining custom tags with beans allows us to remove
quite a bit of the Java code from our JSPs.</p><p>But in the end, what have we accomplished? As we saw last
month, intelligent use of custom actions means creating our own
mini-language, with its own loops, conditionals and variables.
Writing our own tags saves graphic designers from having to use
Java and allows us a greater separation between form and content.
But it does not go nearly far enough in solving problems.</p><p>One clever solution is part of the Enhydra application
server, about which I will be writing over the next few months.
XMLC, or the XML compiler, turns XML files (including HTML and
XHTML files) into Java objects. By invoking methods on these
objects, we can modify the HTML that is eventually produced.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1004580.0x10fc920"></a>XML and XHTML</h2></div></div><p>XML, as you have probably heard by now, is the extensible
markup language. What began as a simple and small standard several
years ago has ballooned into a veritable alphabet soup of standards
and proposed standards.</p><p>But the core of XML has remained the same, allowing people to
create their own markup languages using a uniform syntax. XML is
not meant to be used directly; rather, it is meant to let you
create your own markup languages. Because those markup languages
are based on XML, they have a well-understood syntax that can be
verified by any XML parser. Moreover, if you define a data type
definition (DTD) for your markup language, a verifying parser can
ensure that the elements and attributes are within accepted
norms.</p><p>HTML and XML are both standards of the World Wide Web
Consortium (W3C), have a similar syntax and are often discussed in
the same breath. But in fact, HTML is just one markup language,
while XML allows you to create your own languages. More
significantly, HTML has a much looser syntax than XML, thanks in no
small part to historical factors. The following is thus legal HTML:
<b  >&lt;img src="foo.png"&gt;</b>.</p><p>But because every tag must be explicitly closed in
XML-derived languages, this would be illegal in an XML document.
Instead, we would have to say: <b  >&lt;img
src="foo.png"/&gt;</b>.</p><p>In order to bridge the gap between HTML and XML, the W3C has
issued a recommendation known as XHTML, the XML implementation of
HTML. While there are indeed various benefits to the use of XHTML,
the biggest one is that XML tools will now work on our HTML
documents.</p><p>Of course, this means that our XHTML documents will look a
bit more formal than the HTML documents we might be used to
writing. While HTML allows us to be sloppy, using &lt;P&gt; to
separate paragraphs, XHTML is much stricter, forcing us to begin
paragraphs with &lt;P&gt; and end them with &lt;/P&gt;. Attributes
must also appear in double quotes, which many people fail to do
when working with straight HTML.</p><p>While XHTML might be a pain for humans, it actually reduces
the load on programs by making the syntax more regular, and thus
easier to read and write. But the biggest benefit is the fact that
XHTML documents can now be treated as XML documents.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1004580.0x10fcce8"></a>The DOM</h2></div></div><p>XML documents are trees, which should ring a bell for those
of you who studied computer science in college. Trees are
remarkably easy to work with in theory, but the practice can be a
bit tricky sometimes, depending on the way in which the interface
is implemented.</p><p>There are two popular and cross-platform APIs for working
with XML: SAX (the Simple API for XML) is designed to work with
incoming streams of XML data, allowing it to be small and
efficient. The DOM (document object model), by contrast, gives us
access to the entire document tree at once. This allows us to
traverse and modify nodes, including adding new nodes and removing
old ones. However, it also means that the entire document must be
loaded into memory before we can begin to work with documents using
the DOM. This makes it more powerful than SAX, but also slower and
more resource-intensive.</p><p>XMLC works by converting an XML file, normally written in
HTML or XHTML, into a Java class that creates and manipulates a DOM
tree. You can use standard DOM methods to add, modify and remove
nodes on the tree, thus changing the document that will eventually
be output.</p><p>But the truly clever idea in XMLC is the use of HTML &ldquo;id&rdquo;
attributes. When the XMLC complier sees an id attribute, it creates
methods that allow us to retrieve and modify the text contained
within that attribute. The site designers thus work with HTML,
identifying areas of dynamic text by giving them unique
identifiers. When the designers have finished with their mockup of
the original HTML page, they compile it (using XMLC) into a Java
class. Developers then create servlets that instantiate that class,
use methods to replace the mockup text with dynamically generated
content and send the document to the user's browser.</p><p>The basic idea is that the designers do not work on hybrids
of text and HTML, but rather on mockups of the final output. So
long as the id attributes do not change, the HTML file and servlet
can evolve in parallel, with neither designers nor developers
waiting for their counterparts.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1004580.0x10fcf50"></a>Installing Enhydra</h2></div></div><p>As I mentioned above, XMLC is one element of the Enhydra
application server. The 3.x version of Enhydra is considered to be
production-ready and includes a copy of XMLC that most users will
find more than adequate. Because I am particularly interested in
Enhydra for working with Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB), I have been
working with the beta version of 4.x, otherwise known as Enhydra
Enterprise. By the time you read this, the final release of Enhydra
Enterprise should be available, giving web developers an
open-source, production-quality J2EE-compliant application
server.</p><p>To work with XMLC, I downloaded the Enhydra Enterprise beta,
a 15.7MB file named enhydra4.0.tar.gz. Open this file, and you will
find a wealth of libraries, applications and documentation for the
Enhydra application server. We will ignore much of this for now,
concentrating on XMLC for the time being.</p><p>Almost all of Enhydra is written as Java classes invoked from
shell scripts. In order for the shell scripts to find the Java
classes, they must be configured for your particular installation.
You can do this by entering the Enhydra directory (enhydra4.0 on my
system) and running the <span   class="bold"><b>configure</b></span>
script:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
./configure /usr/java/jdk1.3
</pre><p><span   class="bold"><b>configure</b></span> normally takes a
single argument&mdash;the root directory of your JDK 1.3 installation.
While earlier versions of Enhydra (and particularly earlier
versions of Enhydra Enterprise) wouldn't work with JDK 1.3, current
versions will only work with 1.3. Since JDK 1.3 has a number of
other benefits, and a Linux version is supported by Sun, it is
probably a good idea to install it.
</p><p>If you have installed Enhydra somewhere other than
/usr/local/enhydra, you should probably set the ENHYDRA environment
variable to your installation directory.</p><p>Full use of XMLC depends on placing three different .jar
files in your CLASSPATH. Since we will be concentrating on XMLC for
the rest of this article, we should probably add them now, using
bash syntax:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
export CLASSPATH=$ENHYDRA/lib/xmlc.jar:\
$ENHYDRA/lib/enhydra.jar:\
$ENHYDRA/lib/xmlc-support.jar
</pre><p>If you're like me, you will want to have a number of items in
your CLASSPATH in addition to Enhydra-related items. Here is how I
set my CLASSPATH, for instance:
<pre     class="programlisting">
export CLASSPATH=$ENHYDRA/lib/xmlc.jar:\
$ENHYDRA/lib/enhydra.jar:\
$ENHYDRA/lib/xmlc-support.jar:\
$TOMCAT_HOME/classes:\
$TOMCAT_HOME/lib/servlet.jar:\
/usr/share/pgsql/jdbc7.1-1.2.jar:\
.
</pre>


Notice how I placed the Enhydra .jar files before the others on my
system in order to avoid potential problems with conflicts. Since
Enhydra has the newest versions of some classes, such as those
having to do with the DOM, they should take precedence.
</p><p>Note that not all three Enhydra-provided .jar files are
necessary for each stage of working with XMLC. However, I found it
convenient to include all of them at all stages in order to avoid
unpleasant surprises later on.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1004580.0x10fd478"></a>A Simple HTML File</h2></div></div><p>Now that we have installed everything we need to work with
XMLC, let's try it with a simple HTML file:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;This is a title&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;This is a headline.&lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;p id="firstpara"&gt;This is a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;img src="foo.gif"/&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This is a second paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre><p>While XMLC works just fine with straight HTML files, XHTML is
a better idea because it stops us from generating files that the
DOM cannot represent. For example, XML forbids overlapping tags:
<pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;i&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wow&lt;/i&gt;, he thought.&lt;/p&gt;
</pre>


The above is tolerable HTML but is illegal XML and XHTML. So while
your web browser can somehow handle this HTML and make sense of it,
XMLC will generate a warning indicating that it is discarding what
it considers to be a useless closing tag. XMLC will often warn you
when your HTML is not well formed, helping you to identify
potential problems. While you might not have to consider your
document's structure when you are writing simple HTML documents,
the manipulations that you can perform with XMLC require that you
have a clear understanding of how your document will be rendered.
</p><p>The first paragraph in the previous sample statement is
identified with the id attribute &ldquo;firstpara&rdquo;. We will soon see
how we can manipulate that text from within a Java program, using
the id as a lever into the document.</p><p>To turn our document into a Java class, we invoke the
<span   class="bold"><b>xmlc</b></span> program. Assuming that our
above HTML file was called foo.html, we can say:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ENHYDRA/bin/xmlc -parseinfo -verbose -keep foo.html
</pre><p>This turns foo.html into a Java source file called foo.java,
which is in turn compiled into foo.class. The -keep argument
retains foo.java, rather than deleting it once it has been compiled
into foo.class. And while they are unnecessary, I like to use
-parseinfo and -verbose when working with xmlc, if only to get some
visual feedback on the compilation process.
</p><p>The Java source code created by XMLC is fairly long and
boring, if well-commented. For those of us who want to modify
foo.html, the most important parts of foo.java are the
getElementFirstpara() and setTextFirstpara() methods. The former
returns the text associated with the id &ldquo;firstpara&rdquo;, while the
latter allows us to swap that text with an arbitrary string.</p><p>Listing 1 contains the source code to a small command-line
Java class (PrintFoo.java) that prints the contents of the
Java-ized version of foo.html. Before printing it, it uses
setTextFirstpara() to modify the output:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
myfoo.setTextFirstpara("This has been changed");
</pre><p>Once we have made that change, we can display the document:
<pre     class="programlisting">
System.out.print(myfoo.toDocument());
</pre>


We could traverse the DOM tree ourselves, looking for nodes with a
certain id and then modify it manually. However, XMLC's convenience
methods make it extremely easy and straightforward to modify such
text.
</p><p><a href="4783l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1.
PrintFoo.java</a></p><p>If you have just run PrintFoo, you will notice that the
output HTML is displayed without any of the original white space.
The resulting document is harder for humans to read but is rendered
identically by browsers. That said, I have always tried to keep my
HTML documents formatted correctly for easier debugging, and it
would be nice for XMLC to include a -preserve-whitespace
option.</p><p>From what we have seen so far, it would seem that XMLC makes
it easy to modify entire paragraphs but difficult to change a
single word. However, XMLC takes advantage of the HTML &ldquo;span&rdquo;
tag, which takes an id attribute and allows us to identify
individual words, characters and images that we might want to
modify. For example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;P id="para"&gt;This is a paragraph,
    &lt;span id="phrase"&gt;and this is a phrase&lt;/span&gt;.
&lt;/P&gt;
</pre><p>When we compile this HTML using XMLC, we will be able to
modify the contents of the entire paragraph using the SetTextPara()
method and the individual phrase using the SetTextPhrase() method.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1004580.0x10fdc08"></a>Servlets</h2></div></div><p>Now that we have seen how to work with XMLC from the command
line, let's look at a servlet that accomplishes the same task. For
starters, our simple PrintFooServlet servlet will receive an HTTP
request and will return a copy of the document.</p><p>Listing 2 contains a copy of the servlet that displays a
foo.html. Like its command-line counterpart, it creates an instance
of our &ldquo;foo&rdquo; class, modifies some of its text and then writes a
textual representation of the XML tree to an output stream. In this
particular case, however, the output stream is connected to the
user's browser. The user thus sees the modified template without
knowing that two Java classes (and an original HTML document) were
involved.</p><p><a href="4783l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2.
PrintFooServlet.java</a></p><p>For our servlet to work, I needed to put a copy of foo.class
in a directory located under the Jakarta-Tomcat servlet engine's
CLASSPATH environment variable. I chose to put it in
$TOMCAT/classes, at the top level. If this were a production class,
I would undoubtedly want to put it in a more intelligent place,
taking advantage of Java's hierarchical namespace. However, I
executed xmlc without specifying a package, meaning that foo.class
must be put in the top-level namespace. In order to place foo.class
in the il.co.lerner namespace, I would have had to use the -class
option:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ENHYDRA/bin/xmlc -class il.co.lerner.foo\
-parseinfo -verbose -keep foo.html
</pre><p>With foo.class in $TOMCAT/classes, I was able to compile
PrintFooServlet.java successfully. Now the only remaining challenge
was to execute this servlet and display my modified HTML page. Once
again, I needed to modify the CLASSPATH, but this time the
CLASSPATH in need of change was that of the Tomcat servlet engine,
which executes servlets on our behalf. I modified
$TOMCAT/bin/tomcat.sh such that just before it exports its
CLASSPATH, we add the three Enhydra-supplied .jar files and
restarted Tomcat. Moments after pointing my browser at the servlet,
I was delighted to see a modified version of my original HTML file
on my screen.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1004580.0x14f6170"></a>Databases and XMLC</h2></div></div><p>It is easy to see how we could populate a page with
information taken from a relational database. For example, here is
a small PostgreSQL table that we can use to store a different
saying for each calendar day:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
CREATE TABLE DailySayings (
    date   TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    saying TEXT NOT NULL,
    UNIQUE(date)
)
</pre><p>Now let's insert a number of sayings into our system:
<pre     class="programlisting">
INSERT INTO DailySayings(date, saying)
VALUES (CURRENT_DATE,
     'A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.');
INSERT INTO DailySayings(date, saying)
VALUES (CURRENT_DATE+1,
     'A penny saved is a penny earned.');
INSERT INTO DailySayings(date, saying)
VALUES (CURRENT_DATE+2,
     'The rain in Spain falls mainly in the plain.');
</pre>


To retrieve today's saying, we merely need the following query:
<pre     class="programlisting">
SELECT saying
FROM DailySayings
WHERE date = CURRENT_DATE
</pre>


In order to write a servlet that displays today's saying, we will
need two classes: a template that we will create with XMLC
(saying.html, which will be compiled into saying.class) and another
that will load and manipulate the template (DailySaying.java). We
will agree in advance of writing our XMLC document and our
manipulation class that the id &ldquo;saying&rdquo; will link the two
together.
</p><p>Our XMLC document is fairly straightforward:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;html&gt;
   &lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Today's saying&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
   &lt;body&gt;
      &lt;h1&gt;Today's saying&lt;/h1&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;And now, as you requested, today's saying:
        &lt;span id="saying"&gt;Saying Goes Here&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre><p>I compiled this HTML document into the Java class
il.co.lerner.saying, keeping around the .java file just for fun:
<pre     class="programlisting">
$ENHYDRA/bin/xmlc -class il.co.lerner.saying\
-parseinfo -verbose -keep saying.html
</pre>


I then copied the resulting saying.class file into
$TOMCAT_HOME/classes/il/co/lerner, where I keep my servlet-related
classes.
</p><p>Once I installed my document, I had to write a manipulation
class. This class executes the SQL query that we saw above,
retrieving the results and sticking them into our compiled XMLC
document. Listing 3 [see Listing 3 at
<a href="../listings/088/" target="_self">ftp://ftp.linuxjournal.com/pub/lj/listings/issue88/</a>]
contains the source code for our servlet, which I compiled and put
into an active servlet context on my Tomcat server. After
restarting Tomcat and Apache, I was able to retrieve today's saying
via my web browser, with the SQL results instantiated into the HTML
document.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1004580.0x14f65e8"></a>Is XMLC a Good Solution?</h2></div></div><p>When I first began to look into XMLC, I had my serious doubts
about its viability. After years of working with hybrid templates,
it just seemed too weird to turn an HTML file into a Java class,
only to manipulate that class using the DOM. And indeed, it takes
significantly greater resources to fire up a DOM parser than to
simply display a file.</p><p>As I have begun to work with XMLC, however, I am increasingly
aware of its advantages over such templates. In essence, XMLC
forces designers and developers to create a contract, or API
specification, between their documents and programs. Once this API
is in place, it cannot easily be changed, which is not necessarily
a bad thing. Most importantly, the stability of the API between
designers and developers allows them to work in parallel, barely
interfering with each other's work.</p><p>Because a Java manipulation class can modify the HTML of a
compiled document in any way it chooses, we can easily imagine a
situation in which we bring in three classes at a time: a header
file, the main body of the document and a footer file. Our class
could then use DOM methods to attach the header to the beginning of
the document and the footer to the end. In such a way, we could add
global formatting to our site without having to copy boilerplate
text to the top of each file.</p><p>There are, of course, a number of irksome details when
working with XMLC. One is that it quickly gets boring and
frustrating to write one servlet per HTML file. True, we could
write a single servlet that takes the name of a file in its query
string, acting almost as a document template for a variety of
classes created by XMLC. Perhaps I have not yet explored Enhydra
enough to have discovered the answer to this question, and perhaps
Enhydra developers quickly get used to creating two Java classes
for each page they wish to display. Regardless, this can quickly
create an overwhelming number of classes, even on a small- to
medium-sized site.</p><p>The biggest problem that I see with XMLC is the lack of a
high-level API to manipulate HTML (and XML, for that matter). One
of the FAQs for XMLC is &ldquo;How do I add a row to an HTML table?&rdquo;
Such a task, which is trivial to accomplish with standard HTML,
quickly becomes a burden with XMLC. You must first find the bottom
of the table to which you want to add rows and then add individual
nodes (and attributes) to that node. It has a very non-HTML feel to
it and forces the developer to think of nodes when he or she would
prefer to think in terms of HTML. Given that Enhydra includes an
API to create SQL queries using Java methods, I would imagine that
a similar API for HTML manipulation wouldn't be too
difficult.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1004580.0x14f6850"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>XMLC is an intriguing technology that sits at the heart of
the Enhydra application server. XMLC forces developers (and
designers) to consider how they will interact before they begin
working and then allows them to work independently. While this mode
of operation might throw experienced template users off balance, it
quickly becomes second nature and feels more natural than I ever
expected.</p><p>Indeed, the fact that Zope's ZPT uses a similar method for
separating form from content probably points to a trend within the
web development community. We can expect to see more XMLC-like
systems in the near future. If we're lucky, perhaps there will even
be some standardization of these templates, so that designers can
move across systems without having to learn the subtle differences
between them.</p><p>While XMLC is important, Enhydra has many other features that
make it worth investigating. Next month we will continue to look
into Enhydra, looking at ways in which it speeds up the writing of
server-side database applications.</p><p><a href="4783s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
