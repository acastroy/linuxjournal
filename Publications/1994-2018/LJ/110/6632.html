    Put your knowledge to good use by helping develop
    innovative, fun and educational exhibits for a whole new
    audience.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19af580.0x1aa7608"></a></h2></div></div><p>Over the past several years, my son and I
have spent a significant amount of volunteer time creating exhibit
software for the Sciencenter in Ithaca, New York. This article
discusses how this project is similar to other software development
projects, how it is different and how using Linux has been
beneficial. It's not only about Linux or software; it's also about
the processes involved, and what you may encounter if you have the
opportunity to work in this type of environment.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19af580.0x1aa7710"></a>The Target Audience</h2></div></div><p>Science museum exhibit software must be designed with a
different audience from the typical computer program, as the
software generally is used in a different manner. My earlier
Microsoft Windows-based exhibits&mdash;<span   class="emphasis"><em>Measurement
Factory</em></span> and <span   class="emphasis"><em>Fabulous Features</em></span>&mdash;were
designed for children up to approximately sixth grade, while the
Linux-based exhibits&mdash;<span   class="emphasis"><em>Sound Studio</em></span> and
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Traffic Jam</em></span>&mdash;were designed for fifth to eighth
graders. The software must be simple enough that the target
audience understands a significant amount of what they see on the
screen and how it relates to the exhibit. A computer in an exhibit
is not necessarily the exhibit; it may act as a guide or simply be
another &ldquo;manipulative&rdquo; along with real-world objects.</p><p>A second &ldquo;audience&rdquo; also must be considered, the museum
staff. Floor personnel (many of whom are volunteers) shouldn't have
to be trained in the vagaries of each computer. Exhibit software
and hardware also should come up and run automatically when the
systems are powered on first thing in the morning, as museums tend
to turn off at least some circuit breakers when they close in the
evening. Trust me, you want the museum staff to like your
exhibit&mdash;if it makes their life difficult, the exhibit may sit
there with a sign saying &ldquo;broken&rdquo;.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19af580.0x1aa79d0"></a>The Competition</h2></div></div><p>Possibly the most important thing to keep in mind when you're
developing your dream exhibit is this: when you build a non-hidden
computer into a museum exhibit aimed at younger visitors, you're
competing with every video game they've played and every television
show or movie they've watched. Your exhibit, therefore, must be
extremely cool.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Measurement Factory</em></span> is cool because
visitors can weigh themselves, measure their height, test their
grip strength, compare themselves to others of their age and get a
certificate when they're done.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Traffic Jam</em></span> (Figures 1-3) is cool
because visitors can play with traffic lights and prevent traffic
jams&mdash;or not, if they prefer.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6632f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1. </p></div></div>

</p></div></div>
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Sound Studio</em></span> (Figures 4-6) lets visitors
record themselves and their friends on a multitrack recorder and
play with simple special effects, such as echoes.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6632f4.large.jpg"><img src="6632f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 4. </p></div></div>

</p><p>Cool has a definite limit, however. For instance, it's not a
good idea to make the &ldquo;you made a mistake&rdquo; annunciator&mdash;sound,
animation, whatever&mdash;too cool; otherwise visitors will consider
that the goal. Don't defeat the purpose of the exhibit.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19af580.0x1aa89a0"></a>The Development Process</h2></div></div><p>An orderly development process is important here because of
the educational goals and target audience. Some of the following
actually may be quite informal, but it is important nonetheless.
Your development cycle may not be exactly like this, of
course.</p><p>The kickoff meeting: if you're building a standalone exhibit
that is not part of a coordinated exhibition, this may not happen.
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Tech City</em></span>, however, was to consist of around a
dozen coordinated exhibits, with a central theme of engineering.
Therefore, an all-day kick-off meeting was held to discuss project
goals and to arrive at an initial focus. I've attended several
meetings of this type, and all were well worth the time. In
addition to getting a feel for the project, you'll pick up a few
good ideas and meet people who may be helpful later on in the
process.</p><p>Brainstorming: put your feet up and don't even worry about
Linux until you come up with a few good ideas. On the other hand,
if you know of a good existing application that could be modified
and made useful, mention it and make note. While kicking around
your cool ideas, keep handy a list of the project requirements.
These can range from something quite simple, such as &ldquo;demonstrate
a type of engineering&rdquo;, to something more difficult, like
&ldquo;demonstrate Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle for elementary
schoolchildren in a nonstructured, graphical manner using virtual
manipulatives.&rdquo; Always keep the requirements in mind, but I can
guarantee that they'll change right up to the day you ship.</p><p>Prototype construction: this phase is the same as building
prototypes anywhere else, but it can be even more fun because of
the people you're working with. The museum people we've worked with
over the years have been intelligent, creative and enthusiastic
about their jobs. Don't be too shocked by the appearance of the
kiosk prototype if your exhibit requires one. There's probably
going to be a lot of duct tape and cardboard involved.</p><p>First review: this is where you show off your prototype for
the first time, for critiquing. Don't worry if the adults involved
in the process don't think your exhibit is as cool as you know it
is. Remember, most adults don't think like kids. Show your
prototype to a few kids in the target age range, informally.</p><p>Target test: this might be the most fun part of building your
exhibit. It's the first, and possibly second and third, time that
it's set up for museum visitors to try, so you and possibly other
people can observe the results. Expect to go through this process
several times. Important questions to consider include: Is the
exhibit inviting to visitors? How long do visitors stay at the
exhibit? Do several visitors use it together? Do visitors learn
what you're trying to teach? Do visitors use the exhibit the way
you intended? Can visitors figure out how to use the exhibit
successfully? Does it appeal to the correct age bracket?</p><p>You may be able to interview visitors after they've tried
your exhibit, or museum personnel may do so and report their
results to you. This is probably the most valuable information
you'll receive; kids can be brutally honest.</p><p>Professional evaluation: there are firms with expertise in
evaluating educational programs such as museum exhibits. If your
exhibit is being built as part of a National Science Foundation
(NSF) grant, it likely will be evaluated by one of them. We've only
had the opportunity to deal with one of these firms, Inverness
Research Associates, but found their comments to be extremely
helpful. If you have the chance, observe them at work&mdash;you'll learn
a lot.</p><p>Revision, including code cleanup: like the prototype
construction step, this is similar to what it would be like
anywhere else. It's well worth taking the time to add extra
comments and clean up any kludged code. Museum software tends to
accumulate extra bits and pieces. If you need to modify your
software sometime in the future, the extra time spent now may more
than pay for itself later. At this stage, the nice versions of the
non-computer parts of your exhibit are probably being built as
well.</p><p>Deployment: again, this isn't much different from anywhere
else, though you'll want to keep the turnkey and no-maintenance
requirements of this sort of project in mind. If your software is
shipping as part of a larger exhibition, remember that museum
personnel will be extremely busy at this point, so make things as
easy as possible for them. System deployment for <span   class="emphasis"><em>Tech
City</em></span> ultimately consisted of setting up the
systems&mdash;four targets, plus a spare&mdash;installing Linux on each and
testing with the CD-ROMs we'd already prepared (see the Tips and
Tricks section below).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19af580.0x1a9f700"></a>Hardware Selection</h2></div></div><p>Your software may have to run on an old PC that has been
sitting around unused or on a latest-generation machine that has
been donated specifically for the project. Or, if you're
lucky&mdash;from the Linux driver perspective at least&mdash;you'll get a
machine that is one generation old.</p><p>If you're able to specify the deliverable hardware, be
conservative; try to look at this from the turnkey system
viewpoint, as opposed to office desktop. Well-debugged hardware and
drivers are probably going to be worth more to you than the
latest-and-greatest devices, and saving a few degrees of cabinet
temperature by using a somewhat slower processor and video board
might prevent a failure six months from now in a faraway museum on
a warm summer day. Don't be stingy with system cooling. If you can,
specify good-quality fans, and make sure that whoever builds the
exhibit kiosk, if there is one, provides for adequate airflow to
and from the computer.</p><p>The <span   class="emphasis"><em>Tech City</em></span> software was deployed on
donated Hewlett-Packard Vectra 400s, each with a 1GHz PIII
processor, an i810 chipset with onboard video and a 20GB HD. We
also added an Sound Blaster 16 PCI card to each machine, as
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Sound Studio</em></span> requires either a full-duplex
sound card or two cards without that capability. Each system was
supplied with a 19" monitor, also donated by
Hewlett-Packard.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19af580.0x1a9f968"></a>Tool and Library Selection</h2></div></div><p>Not knowing anything about your project, I can't recommend
specific tools and libraries. I won't even try to recommend
implementation languages to you. I can, however, suggest a few
guidelines that worked for us.</p><p>Experienced developers probably have heard this already, but
if an existing package is close to what you need to accomplish a
particular task, think about modifying and using it. The
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Traffic Jam</em></span> user interface is split across
four windows&mdash;traffic display, density setting, control and other
information. We used GTK+ because of its extensive theme
capabilities and the icewm window manager for the same reason. We
did, however, need to modify the latter slightly.</p><p>Carefully read the licenses for the code you want to borrow,
of course. Respect the author's wishes, and don't create any
liabilities for the museum. As with hardware selection, being
conservative is good. If you really don't need the features
available in the latest version of a tool or library, don't rush to
install it&mdash;known bugs are easier to work around than unknown ones.
Don't forget about maintenance and project lifetime; either you or
someone else may have to modify this project in the future. A
nonrelease version of a language or library might seem wonderful
and stable now, but two years from now it might be quite different
and somewhat incompatible. Even g++ changed in the four years from
when I wrote the prototype Linux version of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Traffic
Jam</em></span> until the final software was delivered.</p><p>Lastly, I'll go out on a limb by suggesting that you also be
conservative with regard to selecting a Linux distribution. Latest
and greatest may be ideal for your desktop, but again, reliability
is far more important in the field. We chose Debian 3.0r0 for our
final system deployment soon after it was released, but because
Debian has a reputation as a conservative distribution, we felt
comfortable with that decision.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19af580.0x1a9fc28"></a>Tips and Tricks</h2></div></div><p>Here are several of the problems we encountered and how we
solved them. The solutions may not be optimal, but they worked well
for us.</p><p>Problem: How did we set the systems up as turnkey? They must
power into the exhibit software automatically; no user intervention
required. Museum staff also must be able to update software easily,
as required.</p><p>Solution: We solved this by mounting the CD-ROM application
directory over (on top of) the exhibit home directory,
/home/techcity for example, and automatically logging on as that
user at startup. If the appropriate CD-ROM isn't present&mdash;each
deployment CD contains the software for only one exhibit&mdash;the
console displays a message asking the user to put it in and then
reboot. (Although not accessible to visitors, a keyboard is in the
cabinet with each computer.) The reboot monitor watches a FIFO for
either an R to reboot the system or a Q to quit, though we also
considered using it in other ways. See Listing 1 for pseudo-code
describing this process, Listing 2 for our autostart file and
Listing 3 for a sample .xinitrc.</p><p><a href="6632l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1. Pseudo-Code for Turnkey
Application Startup</a></p><p><a href="6632l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2. File 599xx-mytechcity,
Inserted into /etc/rc2.d to Sequence Exhibit Software
Startup</a></p><p>Problem: This type of application generally needs
fine-tuning. How did we accomplish this?</p><p><a href="6632l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Sound
Studio</em></span> Application .xinitrc File</a></p><p>Solution: Our first idea was to use a configuration file
format based on the Windows .ini file. This would have worked for
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Sound Studio</em></span> but not for <span   class="emphasis"><em>Traffic
Jam</em></span>. The latter required, among other things, the
defining of multiple vehicle types, which made XML's ability to
represent easily multiple instances of the same class useful. My
son coded a C library designed to run on top of xmllib2, which
allows our software to access the various elements as a tree&mdash;based
on the path to that element within the document, in other
words.</p><p>Listing 4 shows a section of the DTD for the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Traffic Jam</em></span> configuration file, and Listing 5
contains the associated section of the file. Listing 6 is a section
of the code used to load vehicle physics&mdash;notice how Cfg points to
a C++ object wrapped around the library functions mentioned
previously.</p><p><a href="6632l4.html" target="_self">Listing 4. The Vehicle-Definition
Section of the DTD for the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Traffic Jam</em></span>
Configuration File</a></p><p><a href="6632l5.html" target="_self">Listing 5. The Vehicle-Definition
Section of the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Traffic Jam</em></span> Configuration
File</a></p><p><a href="6632l6.html" target="_self">Listing 6. Loading Vehicle Physics
Constants from the XML Configuration File</a></p><p>Problem: How to deal with window manager security? Visitors
shouldn't be able to exit the software, bring up other
applications, move windows around and so on.</p><p>Solution: We found that when visitors had access to the
keyboard during early testing, they were quite good at finding
their way out of the applications. We fixed this with a combination
of configuration file and code changes to icewm to disable pop-up
menus, window moves and window resizes. Also, neither exhibit
requires the use of a keyboard, so that's kept inside the kiosk
during normal operation.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19af580.0x1aa05c8"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>Educational software may not be your cup of tea, but if it
is, try to find a science museum to help. They like seeing new
faces, they can always use the help, and I can promise that you'll
get back more than you give.</p><p>I'd like to thank the staff and volunteers at the
