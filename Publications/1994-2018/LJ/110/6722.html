Research Center at Moffett Field, in the heart of Silicon Valley,
California, I was a part of a team that used Linux for some
interesting and advanced research. I worked in the Neuro
Engineering Lab at Ames in support of the construction of a
brain-computer interface, a system by which EEG
(electroencephalogram&mdash;brain wave) signals can be used to control
electronic systems and robotic devices. My job was to take ideas
and prototype code from primary lab researchers and develop and
evaluate efficient implementations of them for use in real-time
data processing with human subjects. Often, I would be handed only
a rough sketch of an algorithm or a fragment of code to see if it
could be used on the brain wave data we had been collecting.
</p><p>Matlab and the free software GNU Octave were great tools for
doing this work; they allowed me to develop effective methods for
data processing and data visualization that would have been a real
pain to construct in C or, heaven forbid, Fortran. Ease of
implementation is a great concern when dealing with large amounts
of experimental code that may or may not end up as a finished
product.</p><p>When a process did indeed fit the bill, and it was time to
start thinking about using it in our real-time data processing
system, it would become immediately apparent that the advantages of
Matlab in programming ease did not come without cost. The cost was
speed. The time to process data representing a single second, for
instance, could take minutes or even hours. Obviously, this would
not do in a real-time system. Also, any code deemed worthy would
have to end up in C or C++ to fit into our existing code base. To
address both of these issues, we rewrote much of our Matlab code in
C.</p><p>Now, if you have some experience with Matlab, you might
think, &ldquo;but Matlab already exports to C on its own&rdquo; or, &ldquo;what
about the new Matlab JIT compiler?&rdquo; Although the new JIT compiler
may speed up code in places (looking at the documentation, there
are many exceptions to what it will try to optimize), it cannot
equal the efficiency of well-written, compiled C code. As for the C
export feature of Matlab, the code exported by Matlab is as slow as
the interpreted code running inside the Matlab environment and is
fairly difficult to merge into existing projects without a bit of
interface work. And, none of this helps users of GNU Octave or
those that can't keep up with expensive Matlab upgrades. In
general, it seems the best way to work something originally
developed in Matlab into fast, production-level code, is to do it
by hand.</p><p>This article first offers a few tips on how to write somewhat
more efficient Matlab code. Then it illustrates the process of
integrating C code into a Matlab program using MEX functions, in
order to speed up program execution while still tweaking and
evaluating it in the Matlab environment. From there, it is a
relatively short step to bring the entire project into C or C++.
Most of the information here is available in different places
on-line; this article is presented as a sort of a HOWTO or a
personal account of bringing a piece of Matlab experimental code
into the real world.</p><p>For this article, I use as an example a piece of code
developed to isolate rapid changes of voltage measured on the
surface of the head. The code uses an algorithm called
multicomponent event-related potential estimation, or simply mcERP.
I first looked into porting Matlab code to C when working on this
algorithm. When testing the algorithm with different configuration
parameters and input data sets, I usually would have to let it run
overnight. No amount of optimization inside Matlab was able to
drastically cut down its execution time.</p><p>After full conversion to C, it usually would take on the
order of tens of seconds to execute with a large input data set. I
view this as an extreme time savings, due to the highly nested,
looping nature of the algorithm (see Listing 1). I would not expect
most algorithms to speed up this much. Even so, this performance
still is not quite good enough for real-time operation, but it is
close enough that we could start to look at data reduction
techniques, parallelizing the code and other tricks to pare it down
to something closer to the speed we need.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf26580.0x101e8c8"></a>Optimizing Code in Matlab</h2></div></div><p>The main area in which the performance of Matlab suffers
greatly is looping. Matlab abhors the loop; it was written to be
more efficient to do many loop-type operations by vectorizing the
code, applying functions over a range of data in a matrix, than it
is to iterate through the data. Unfortunately, this only works with
certain kinds of operations. When dealing with high-dimensional
matrices, this often produces code that is hard to read and
understand. Looping happens to be an area in which C
excels&mdash;iterating through a matrix using pointer arithmetic is an
extremely efficient and sometimes more understandable way to do
operations over large chunks of data. Most of the effort of C
optimization of Matlab code is spent trying to optimize nested loop
structures.</p><p>Other ways to code in Matlab more efficiently include:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Make sure to allocate all, even moderately sized,
arrays using the zeros() function before assigning values to the
array, instead of having Matlab append data to existing arrays as
values are assigned.</p></li><li><p>As mentioned in the Matlab documentation, store all
of your code in functions instead of scripts. This offers about a
two- to threefold speed increase.</p></li><li><p>Organize data such that operations over a range of
a matrix operate in a column-major fashion. Matlab stores arrays
like Fortran does, in that data in a particular matrix column is
contiguous in memory. This is unlike C, where data in a matrix row
are contiguous in memory. If you are going to apply functions over
a range of data, store that data in a column rather than along a
row in the matrix. This is completely anecdotal and may be false,
but it seems to make sense.</p></li><li><p>Try to avoid internal-type conversions that happen
over and over. This is another one where I don't have hard proof,
but as Matlab usually does not make you explicitly label the data
types of variables, it is sometimes easy to have a loop of repeated
implicit type conversions. It is better to convert to a common data
type first, then do your repeated operations. This is like
programming in C or C++ but harder to detect right away, because
variables are almost never explicitly typed in Matlab.</p></li></ol></div><p>That being out of the way, let's take a look at a code
snippet from the mcERP algorithm (Listing 1). This represents one
of the many nested loop structures within the code. The mcERP
algorithm relies on a complicated process of iterative Bayesian
waveform estimation. A number of the following loopy bits are in
the code, all of which are run repeatedly to hone in on waveform
shapes present at the data.
</p><p><a href="6722l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1. Nested Loops in the mcERP
Algorithm</a></p><p>One can see how this sort of structure would not run so
quickly with an interpreter that does not perform well with loops.
However, because of the inner if statement, the code cannot be
vectorized without adding an inner function call&mdash;which can't be
any better. This code, then, is a prime candidate for translation
to C/C++. However, it is nice to have a foot in Matlab when
developing the algorithm, because it is easy to produce pretty
pictures like those in Figure 1. So, we write something called a
MEX function. That way, we can have the core fast bits run quickly
while retaining interface points around those parts in Matlab that
tune and inspect the overall algorithm.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6722f1.large.jpg"><img src="6722f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1.</p></div></div><p>Figure 1 is an example output from the
mcERP algorithm, showing estimates of the fundamental waveforms
driving real-time potential readouts at scalp electrodes during
simulated experimental trials. Each of these waveshapes is the
result of many iterations of progressively accurate Bayesian
waveshape estimation, requiring many calculations per iteration.
These results can take many hours to achieve with Matlab but take
seconds or minutes if portions of the algorithm are rewritten in
C.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6722f2.large.jpg"><img src="6722f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

web site (see Resources), and you should take a look at it after
reading this article if you are serious about developing MEX
functions. This article emphasizes optimization and some of the
sticking points of getting things working.</p><p>To develop MEX functions in Linux, go to the source of all
that is good, the command line, and type <b  >mex
-start</b>. When that doesn't work, search for the MEX script
within the Matlab install directory. Your system administrator may
have made a link in your path only to the Matlab binary. Running
MEX, you are presented with a choice of compiler. To take advantage
of some compiler optimizations that I will detail later, it is a
good idea to use GCC rather than the Matlab built-in LCC. MEX will
create the file ~/.matlab/R12/mexopts.sh, which is sourced when you
compile external code for Matlab using the MEX utility. It is
useful and instructive to take a look at the mexopts.sh file, under
the appropriate section for your platform/compiler. In the case of
x86 Linux/GCC, look at the glnx86 section of the main switch
statement. Any changes made outside this section do not have any
effect when compiling code. Place any compiler switches there with
which you wish to compile your C functions. For the purpose of
optimization, you might want to try:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
COPTIMFLAGS='-O3 -funroll-loops
-finline-functions'
</pre><p>(this is aggressive&mdash;be careful) or whatever flags you
desire. To use these flags in compilation, you later must run MEX
with the -O option. As with some makefiles, include here any header
directories you wish to include by appending:
<pre     class="programlisting">
-I/path/to/header/directory
</pre>


to the end of CFLAGS. Indicate libraries you wish to link with by
adding:
<pre     class="programlisting">
-l[libname]

</pre>


and:
<pre     class="programlisting">
-L/path/to/library/directory
</pre>


to the end of LDFLAGS.
</p><p>Once this is done, set up a directory to hold your C files to
be compiled with MEX. I suggest not working on C-based and
Matlab-based code within the same directory. Now, add that
directory, or a third build directory that you have created, to the
path within the Matlab environment. Now you are ready to think
about writing code.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf26580.0x101f688"></a>How to Code in C for Matlab</h2></div></div><p>First and foremost, think about what your goals are for
optimization and what parts of your program will benefit the most
by being rewritten in C. Since the prime area in which C is much
faster than Matlab is the evaluation of loops, it makes sense to
look for loops over a lot of data in your code. It is not worth it
to code for something that loops three times, but if you are
iterating over each voxel in a 500 &times; 500 &times; 500 volume,
coding in C can shave off tons of time. Especially look for simple
operations in nested loops, like the code fragment in Listing 1.
Anything that performs a complex operation in a nested
loop&mdash;anything that looks hard to implement yourself or that you
cannot find a third-party library for&mdash;is probably not a good
starting point for optimization. It is possible to call Matlab
functions from within your C code, but this won't help your
execution time, for obvious reasons.</p><p>Now, the general method of creating C MEX files is to
functionize a block of code in your algorithm or to choose a
function you have already written to optimize. Now, it is time to
create the C version of the function. The general procedure is to
create a generic Matlab interface function and then a meat function
representing the actual procedure for which you are coding. See
Listing 2 for an example of a MEX function. The meat function it
calls corresponds to the Matlab file in Listing 1, and parts are
available on the <i  >Linux Journal</i> FTP site
[<a href="../listings/110/6722.tgz" target="_self">ftp.linuxjournal.com/pub/lj/listings/issue110/6722.tgz</a>].</p><p>mexFunction() is a sort of main() of the MEX-file programming
world. It is the actual function called when you call your function
in Matlab. The actual name of the function is defined by the name
of your compiled .c files, usually the name of the first .c file
that you pass to MEX for compilation. On the Linux x86 platform,
MEX files have the extension .mexglx. When Matlab is run on the
Linux x86 platform, Matlab looks for .mexglx files in the same path
and in the same way as it looks for normal .m files, so .mexglx and
.m files are interchangeable. A good way to switch between Matlab
and optimized code is to change Matlab's search path. I compile
c_mLAT.c to c_mLAT.mexglx, and then I can run the compiled code
simply by calling c_mLAT() within the Matlab environment. It's a
fairly slick system.</p><p><a href="6722l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2. A MEX
Function</a></p><p>Things get a little complicated when trying to pass data back
and forth between Matlab and C. You will notice two double pointers
in the argument list of the mexFunction. *plhs[] refers to the
return values of the function (Matlab functions can have multiple
return values), and *prhs[] refers to the input arguments. The
number of input and return arguments also are passed to the
function as nlhs and nrhs. The return matrices of the function must
be allocated within the mexFuntion() using routines such as
mxCreateDoubleMatrix() in order to be passed back correctly to the
Matlab environment. The mx functions create memory in the Matlab
environment and are handled by the Matlab memory manager, so there
is no need to worry about freeing memory created by the mx
functions.</p><p>Functions beginning with mex are called within the Matlab
environment, and with mexCallMATLAB() it is possible to call
arbitrary Matlab functions from within your code. From the
mexFunction(), you then call your meat function after allocating
the output, formatting the input and doing things like argument
checking.</p><p>Something quite frustrating for C programmers is not dealt
with well in the Matlab documentation, however, and that is the
fact that Matlab stores its data in column-major format. This can
be extremely annoying because you want to be able to use
easy-to-understand pointer arithmetic to iterate over the
multidimensional input matrices. But it is frustrating and
bug-causing to figure out how far to step per iteration and so on.
There are three solutions to this, as I see it.</p><p>1) Figure out the amount you need to step per iteration
manually and think it out. This seems doable and is probably the
best solution, but it leads to huge headaches with arrays of
dimension equal to or greater than three.</p><p>2) Reformat the code before entering the MEX function so it
is organized correctly for iterating through the way you want in C.
This can be fairly expensive in Matlab, and many times you want to
have a drop-in replacement for your original version.</p><p>3) Do what I do, and create macros or macro-type items to
access memory in Matlab arrays. This is slower than stepping
through the arrays and might seem to be an inelegant solution. In
my experience, though, it ends up being easy to read and plenty
fast. For instance, I created a file named pops.h that contains
functions like:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
extern inline double num3d(double *start, int rows,
                           int cols, int x, int y,
                           int z)
{
    return(*(start + rows * cols * z
                   + rows * y + x));
}
</pre><p>which returns the value in a 3-D Matlab array given the
array, the number of rows and columns of the array and the xyz
location of the data you want to retrieve. It's a little unwieldy,
but not too bad. When the code is optimized, it is inserted into
the code the same as a preprocessor macro. One could use macros
just as well, but I find this method much easier to create and
debug. In the end, the speed improvement for doing the loops in C
far outweighs the relatively small loss from doing array access
this way.
</p><p>Other than that, the creation of MEX files is not difficult.
When it comes time to compile, run the MEX program with the names
of the C files you wish to compile. A list of MEX options also is
available at the MathWorks web site. After running <b  >mex X.c
Y.c Z.c</b>, you will have a file called X.mexglx that, if it
is in your path, you can call as X() on the Matlab command
line.</p><p>From here, you can rewrite larger and larger portions of your
code in C. When it is time to do the full C implementation, it
often is beneficial to use the C export feature of Matlab to export
the outer Matlab code, because the important parts also have been
optimized by you. If things are still not fast enough, it might be
a good idea to redo the outer function to deal with memory in a
C-friendly fashion. Then you can speed up the loops in the inner-C
code, using optimized pointer iteration to access the array
values.</p><p>In general, the use of Matlab to prototype and develop code
can speed things up greatly. However, when you find yourself
waiting overnight for Matlab to produce results, only to find that
you messed up a small input value, the process of hand-optimizing
pieces of the code can be extremely beneficial to making your
algorithms practical for use.</p><p><a href="6722s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
