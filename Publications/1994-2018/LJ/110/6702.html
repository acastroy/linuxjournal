    Getting Linux into stores is a dog fight every step of the
    way.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1026580.0x111e500"></a></h2></div></div><p>We're in the midst of a stunted PC
revolution. I'm sure some would challenge this characterization
given the enormous impact the PC has had on how we communicate,
transact and entertain. But as I look around, I wonder why I don't
see more computers in more places. Why doesn't every student have a
computer? Why don't five-year-olds get their own computers the same
as they get bicycles? Why doesn't every hotel room, conference
room, school room and bedroom have a computer? Why do only 70% of
Americans have access to PCs? The big answer, of course, is cost.
PCs are too expensive.
</p><p>For many consumers, the most expensive component of desktop
computing is not the cost of the machine, but the price of the
software. The average PC sells for $700 US and is dropping by more
than a hundred dollars each year&mdash;and that's the average. Many
people pay much less. But software has not shown the radical price
decreases that hardware has, in spite of the near-zero reproduction
costs of software. The lack of meaningful competition has allowed
one company to operate with 85% gross margins, which is great for
their shareholders but raises the cost of computing by billions of
dollars and prevents the full benefit of the PC from reaching all
corners of our society. Antitrust litigation and government
programs have attempted to throttle the costs and close the digital
divide with little results.</p><p>Desktop Linux is going to be the force that makes software
affordable and energizes the PC business into the next wave, which
will make the last wave&mdash;the proliferation of the graphical user
interface&mdash;seem tame. Software prices will decline radically.
Instead of eating up the majority of a computing budget, software
should consume a much smaller portion, about what you'd pay for a
hard disk and RAM.</p><p>Several challenges remain to be met before desktop Linux can
have a significant impact on software costs, and most of these
challenges are not technical. When I have a chance to put users on
well-configured LindowsOS machines with Netscape, StarOffice and
KDE, their typical reaction is one of shock. They're shocked that
Linux can perform ably on the desktop. There's still some work to
be done to bring together an easy-to-use OS and wide-ranging
applications that together make a capable end-user experience. But
the LindowsOS Click-N-Run system, I believe, is filling that
void.</p><p>The nontechnical areas are where Linux needs to see growth
before we'll witness widespread consumer adoption. And the
challenge here is that the entrenched monopolist's war chest
ensures a dog fight as every step of the essential retail ecosystem
is built. It's challenging to recruit OEMs to build Linux computers
when their number-one profit determiner is their existing economic
relationship with the aforementioned monopolist. More than one of
the top ten OEM and chip companies have said they cannot do desktop
Linux until they &ldquo;clear&rdquo; it first, and they don't mean clear it
with their internal management. Once you've got the hardware
vendors on board, securing a retailer to carry the product is the
next critical step. Many have questions about demand, sales
training and customer support, but those questions are answered
favorably once the cash register starts ringing.</p><p>If on-line sales of desktop Linux at outlets like Walmart.com
and Tigerdirect are any indication, there's strong pent-up demand,
which means the early retail adopters especially will see strong
customer sales. The Brick, Canada's largest electronics retailer,
has begun stocking computers with Linux pre-installed in more than
50 of their outlets. This is a dramatic development because it's
the first time we've seen choice on computer store shelves in 15
years.</p><p>With the retail ecosystem required to bring desktop Linux to
the masses showing promising developments, the final hurdle is
education. Most PC consumers have known only Microsoft. They speak
only Microsoft's language of computing. Microsoft even has
attempted to rewrite history by positioning themselves as the
innovator and owner of even basic terms like &ldquo;windows&rdquo;. What's
undeniable is that Microsoft file formats and protocols are the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>de facto</em></span> standards, and all desktop products
must interact with them seamlessly. Desktop Linux products today do
a surprisingly great job of this, but consumers don't know about
it. It's here where much work remains to be done.</p><p>Conferences, evangelists, training classes, stocked Linux
aisles in stores, &ldquo;Lin&rdquo; labeling alongside &ldquo;Mac&rdquo; and &ldquo;Win&rdquo; on
peripherals and much more are all needed to accelerate the
education process. Ultimately, the cost advantage of Linux-based
desktops will drive adoption in business, homes and schools, but
education will dictate the growth rate. I look forward to the day
when we see consumers benefiting from affordable Linux software,
because we will see computers positively affecting our lives far
beyond where we're at today. It's coming, but if you encourage a
friend to try desktop Linux, we'll get there much sooner.</p></div></div>
