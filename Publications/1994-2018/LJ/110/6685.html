from the main train station in Taipei, Taiwan. It is a very large
Linux penguin, dressed up for Chinese New Year. I just finished up
with Apricot (the Asian networking conference), and Linux had a
large presence in the IPv6 appliances on display, as well as the
research being presented. The research lab I work in has many Linux
systems. The software engineers do most of their work on Linux and
FreeBSD.</p><p>&mdash;Van Emery</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6685f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Debit on the Left, Credit on the Right
</p></div></div><p>I just read the article &ldquo;Linux for a Small Business&rdquo; by
Gary Maxwell [<i  >LJ</i>, April 2003]. He states that
when you pay for a book, you debit your cash account and credit
your expense account. I believe it should be the other way around.
In accounting, debit refers to the left side of a T-account and
credit refers to the right side of a T-account. The words are of
Latin derivation meaning left and right. They don't mean decrease
or increase. Depending on the type of account, a debit can either
increase it or decrease it. The same applies to credits. I think
this is probably the source of most non-accountants' confusion
about double-entry accounting.</p><p>&mdash;Kathy</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1fd7580.0x20cf5b0"></a>Network Desktop Advice</h2></div></div><p>Thanks for the great article listing rdesktop, Marcel
[Cooking with Linux, <i  >LJ</i>, April 2003]. In a
heterogeneous environment, rdesktop works nicely for getting to
Windows machines. I have also found tsclient
(<a href="http://www.gnomepro.com/tsclient" target="_self">www.gnomepro.com/tsclient</a>),
a GNOME 2 front end to rdesktop that looks and acts exactly like
the Windows Terminal Services client. For those of us who must work
in this environment, it helps things a little bit.</p><p>&mdash;Jeremy</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1fd7580.0x20cf7c0"></a>MST Helps Brazil's Poor</h2></div></div><p>To Jon &ldquo;maddog&rdquo; Hall: I am Brazilian and would like to let
you know that I agree with your response to Bruno Trevisan's letter
about the &ldquo;Landless Workers' Movement&rdquo;, Movimento dos
Trabalhadores Rurais Sem Terra (MST) [<i  >LJ</i>,
February 2003]. I sincerely thank you for bringing out the facts.
MST is addressing the very basic needs of landless people in Brazil
in a conscious, organized and effective way. MST has shown
results&mdash;tons of results. The land issue in Brazil is a serious
one, and Trevisan's statements show a total lack of respect toward
people in need of basic things, people in poverty, people that die
from hunger. Former President Cardoso never had his farm destroyed.
The Brazilian army was always securing his properties because of
the lack of response of local police. A few years ago, in the
Brazilian state of Para, in the Amazon region, the state police
cowardly murdered dozens of rural workers. It took a very long time
to bring the police officers to trial. A few years ago, in the
state of S. Paulo, the state police invaded a prison and murdered
111 prisoners. Again, it took a very long time to put the
responsible ones on trial.</p><p>&mdash;Nuno Vasconcellos</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1fd7580.0x20cf978"></a>&ldquo;Wardialing&rdquo; in 1979</h2></div></div><p>The term wardialing was in use in 1979-80. It was used to
describe either linear or random dialing of phone numbers and
keeping tabs on the modem carrier detects (CDs) received.
Wardialing also was used interchangeably to signify using those
numbers, getting the codes from the long-distance carriers, or if
you were lucky, a PBX connect to trunk calls and make party lines.
Nothing too intelligent, just brute force. Not that I ever did any
of that. I think the term war was that you were at &ldquo;war&rdquo; with the
phone company doing this. Think of it as carpet bombing the telco
switch. Eventually, you'll hit something. There were a lot of turf
wars like they have now, and essentially, the biggest &ldquo;list&rdquo;
wins. The movie <span   class="emphasis"><em>Wargames</em></span> (1983) had nothing to
do with it whatsoever.</p><p>&mdash;Craig</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1fd7580.0x20cfb30"></a>GNOME 2 Drops Features of Version 1</h2></div></div><p>I disagree strongly with your description of GNOME 2 as &ldquo;an
excellent choice for first-time and nontechnical users&rdquo; [&ldquo;The
GNOME 2 Desktop Environment&rdquo;, <i  >LJ</i>, April
2003]. I used GNOME 1 and persuaded my wife to use it too, but when
I installed Red Hat 8 with GNOME 2 we found things had gone
backward.</p><p>Under GNOME 1, with the Sawfish window manager, I set up all
sorts of keyboard shortcuts. This was reasonably easy. There was a
decent keyboard shortcuts tool, which allowed you to set the
context (global, window, title) and then set shortcuts like
Alt-MOUSE3, etc., with a long list of commands to assign them to.
Now under GNOME 2, I find a very primitive &ldquo;keyboard shortcuts
editor&rdquo; that offers a much smaller number of predefined commands
and does not allow you to specify the context. Why adopt a worse
new window manager without offering the choice of keeping the old
one?</p><p>We wanted to have some programs run on GNOME startup. I
looked in the menus for something like &ldquo;startup&rdquo;. It took ages: I
finally found the required functionality in a program that runs
when you click on Extras--&gt;Preferences--&gt;Sessions. Well
hidden!</p><p>My wife found GNOME 2 unusable and unfriendly. I found it
shockingly weak on everyday functionality, compared with GNOME 1.
Overall, the point of a desktop is to make the computer more
usable, but I see no sign of any user-sensitivity in the GNOME
desktop. It feels like a half-baked programming project, not a
user-oriented functional tool.</p><p>&mdash;Dr Mark Alford</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1fd7580.0x20cfdf0"></a>HTTP User-Agent in Mozilla</h2></div></div><p>Gary Maxwell's article &ldquo;Linux for a Small Business&rdquo;
[<i  >LJ</i>, April 2003] is very useful for an average
desktop user like me. I'd like to add a small correction to his
statement that &ldquo;Mozilla lacks a feature that Konqueror has:
changeable user agents.&rdquo; In Mozilla 1.3 and later, the user can
change User-Agent by changing profiles.</p><p>&mdash;Hiroshi Iwatani</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1fd7580.0x20cffa8"></a>Ready to Make Movies</h2></div></div><p>I would like to say thanks for some really inspiring and
interesting stuff about movies in <i  >Linux Journal</i>. The January 2003 issue about <span   class="emphasis"><em>Star
Trek</em></span> was excellent. I would also like to give a special
thanks to Robin Rowe, because he's actually the reason I'm
switching to Linux. The biggest problem as a 3-D animator is that
there are not enough 3-D applications for Linux. Currently, I'm
using the free Blender 3-D application, and I'm very
impressed.</p><p>&mdash;Jesper Christensen</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Robin Rowe replies:</b></span> Thank
you, and you may want to try Wings. That's free, too. See

<i  >LJ</i>, April 2003] that accuses
<i  >LJ</i> of containing &ldquo;apologies for terrorists
and other assorted anti-American, third-world riffraff&rdquo;, I don't
believe the editorial team should worry about losing another loser,
but should rejoice that <i  >LJ</i> does not encourage
such xenophobia. Linux provides an opportunity to rise above this
type of nationalism. Open-source software can help create a more
equitable sharing of knowledge and access to wealth, and this is a
great thing. Linux is most definitely a multinational effort in the
best traditions of freedom and democracy (a European invention).
And yes, that operating system you use every day includes
contributions from the third world too.</p><p>&mdash;Ian, a citizen of the world</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1fd7580.0x20d0688"></a>Life without <i  >LJ</i> Is

ago, then what do I find when I look at <i  >Linux Journal</i> at my local Borders bookshop? I find
interesting, technically unrepentant articles. I find excellent
design and a good balance between news, discussion and facts. The
cheek of it! I was shocked by the current issue [April 2003], which
I was forced to buy&mdash;a GNUstep programming introduction, a
brilliant inspiring GIMP tutorial, USB drivers, a kernel
cryptography overview, CMS chitchat, teasing screenshots of GNOME
2, gossip on kernel patches for the SGI VISWS&mdash;and all on lovely
glossy paper! You do realise the pain you're putting me through
knowing that I'm not subscribing anymore! People I have spoken to
were really inspired by your GIMP tutorial. They couldn't wait to
get back to their mice and keyboards to try it out. I think that's
the key really: to show people how powerful the tools they already
have are. &ldquo;I didn't know you could do X with this Y I have here&rdquo;
is a nice feeling!</p><p>&mdash;Tariq</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1fd7580.0x20d0898"></a>Don't Try to Mimic Another OS</h2></div></div><p>I don't get why everyone wants Linux GUIs to look like
Microsoft Windows. I've supported Mac users and Windows users for
years. It never fails to thoroughly confuse Mac users on Windows
systems when something <span   class="emphasis"><em>almost</em></span> works like on
their Mac, but not quite. Most users I've worked with had an easier
transition from one platform to another when the two had very

middle of a small press startup, and I'm hoping to be able to
standardize on Linux. I've looked at software packages like TeX,
LaTeX, LyX and Scribus. None of them seem to be quite ready for my

in a prime position to write articles on this subject, being
already in the publishing industry.</p><p>&mdash;Charles</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1fd7580.0x20d0bb0"></a>Put maddog's Letter on the Web</h2></div></div><p>I regularly pick up the <i  >Linux Journal</i>,

[<i  >LJ</i>, February 2003]. I wondered what would
happen to small- to medium-sized software companies that currently
produce competing library systems. No doubt these companies have
invested real money into developing these products and need some
return on their investment in order to survive. This led me to
wonder about the long-term effect of free software. Any software
product that has to compete with the equivalent open-source product
must surely struggle to survive. This means one open-source product
will eventually dominate each market niche leaving consumers with
no choice. Presumably a lot of open-source products are developed
by charitable professional software developers during their free
time. Will the pool of professional developers shrink as there is
little work available other than charity work? Why should large
organisations increase their profit margins by significantly
reducing the cost of software essential to their organisation?
Charity is fine for those who cannot afford to pay but shouldn't be
exploited by those who can.</p><p>&mdash;John</p><p>Richard Stallman covered many of the issues you raise in the
