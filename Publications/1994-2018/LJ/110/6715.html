    Configure bastion host and firewall iptables policies so you
    can see exactly what the security policy is.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c33580.0x1d2b500"></a></h2></div></div><p>Last month we used Firewall Builder to
create a set of reusable objects for iptables policies. In this
month's column, I show you how to use Firewall Builder to create
two such rule sets: one for a bastion host that needs to defend
itself and another for a firewall that needs to defend entire
networks.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c33580.0x1d2b608"></a>Local Rules on a Bastion Host</h2></div></div><p>Let's consider the bastion host scenario first. A common
misconception about Netfilter/iptables, and about packet filtering
in general, is that packet inspection is strictly a function of
firewalls. In-depth defense, however, dictates that it's foolish to
put all your security eggs in one basket. Although you must use a
carefully configured and monitored firewall to protect all your
internet-connected hosts, those hosts also should be able to defend
themselves, especially the bastion hosts on which you host publicly
accessible services, such as FTP and WWW.</p><p>If, for example, your public web server runs Linux 2.4, it
follows that you should configure its local Netfilter rules to
provide an extra level of defense in case a clever attacker
subverts or otherwise gets around your enterprise firewall. If your
server runs a pre-2.4 kernel, you need to use ipchains rather than
Netfilter/iptables. You also need to find a contributed ipchains
compiler plugin for Firewall Builder to build your scripts.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c33580.0x1d2b768"></a>Loopback Rules</h2></div></div><p>Step one for creating any firewall rule base, even for a
bastion host, is to give free rein to the local loopback interface.
Loopback is used for certain transactions between local processes
and d&aelig;mons. Without loopback-allowing rules, things like
name-service caching and SSH port forwarding break when you run the
iptables script.</p><p>Suppose you've got a web server to harden, named Trillian.
You've installed Firewall Builder on your administrative
workstation; remember, we avoid running the X Window System and
therefore X-based applications on bastion hosts. You've
subsequently created some objects that describe hosts, networks and
groups in your environment, plus a firewall object for Trillian,
complete with a loopback-interface definition. In other words,
you've done the things I described in last month's column.</p><p>You need two rules for Trillian's loopback interface: one
that allows all traffic leaving the loopback interface and one that
allows everything coming in to it. Follow these steps to create two
such rules (Figure 1):</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Beneath and to the right of your firewall's
loopback interface sub-object, on the left-hand side of the
Firewall Builder screen (in Figure 1, this is named loopback),
select the loopback interface's policy, which should be
empty.</p></li><li><p>In the Rules menu, select Append rule at the
bottom. A blank rule appears in the right-hand half of the
window.</p></li><li><p>Drag the firewall icon next to the name Trillian
into the blank rule's Source field. Be sure to wait until the
cursor changes into a plus (+) before releasing the mouse
button.</p></li><li><p>Right-click in the new rule's Action field and
select Accept from the menu.</p></li><li><p>Right-click in the rule's Direction field and
select Outbound.</p></li><li><p>Right-click on the paper and pencil icon in the
rule's Options field and select Turn logging OFF.</p></li><li><p>Right-click again in the rule's Options field and
select Modify options. In the resulting window, check the box near
the bottom of the window, which disables stateful inspection. We
don't need to waste CPU overhead on state tracking for loopback
traffic.</p></li><li><p>Optionally, right-click in the new rule's Comment
field and select Edit Comment if you wish to write a brief reminder
of the rule's purpose, perhaps &ldquo;allow loopback outbound&rdquo;.</p></li></ol></div><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6715f1.large.jpg"><img src="6715f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1. Loopback Interface Rules</p></div></div>
</p><p>To create the second rule in Figure 1, repeat steps 2 through
8. In step 3, however, drag Trillian's icon into the new rule's
Destination field rather than its source. In step 5, set the
direction to Inbound.</p><p>How, you may ask, do these rules work? First, you should
understand that they apply only to the loopback interface. It's
possible to create rules specific to any interface, rules that are
parsed before your firewall's global policy. Although we used
Trillian as the source and destination, respectively, of our two
loopback rules, this doesn't mean that the rules match packets with
particular IP addresses, that is, Trillian's. They'll match any
packets leaving or entering the loopback interface.</p><p>This leads me to my last point about loopback rules. It may
seem counterintuitive to use two rules referencing the firewall
object rather than one rule that says any source to any destination
should be accepted. But in my own tests, the single-rule approach
caused Firewall Builder to write its loopback rules for the FORWARD
chain rather than for INPUT and OUTPUT, which counterproductively
killed loopback on my test system. Changing to separate loopback in
and loopback out rules fixed the problem. Don't worry; this is the
only time I've seen Firewall Builder choose the wrong chain for its
rules. At that, it did so only for single-homed hosts, not
multi-interfaced firewalls.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c33580.0x1d2c210"></a>Bastion Host Policy</h2></div></div><p>Once your bastion host's loopback needs have been attended
to, turn your attention to its global policy. This requires a
little thought. You want Netfilter to provide a meaningful amount
of protection but not at the expense of desired
functionality.</p><p>Our example host, Trillian, is a web server, so we want to
allow other hosts to access it with HTTP and HTTPS. We also want to
allow Trillian to perform DNS lookups for coherent logging. In
addition, some sort of administrative connectivity should be
allowed. The tool of choice for this purpose is SSH, so we'll also
allow inbound SSH connections but only from our internal network.
Figure 2 shows such a policy as defined for Trillian.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6715f2.large.jpg"><img src="6715f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 2. Policy for a Bastion Host</p></div></div>
</p><p>I'll spare you a blow-by-blow description of how I created
every single rule, but several things are worth noting. First, in
the object hierarchy on the left-hand side of the window, you can
see that I had selected the global Policy object in the
hierarchical level directly below Trillian, rather than either of
the interface-specific policy objects.</p><p>I also referenced not only the Trillian object, but also a
network object named Net_Internal, which is the example network
object from last month's column. This object refers to an entire
network's worth of IP addresses, 192.168.111.0 to be exact. Whereas
rule 02 uses a single IP address (Trillian's) as its source IP
address, rule 03 matches packets whose source IP address is any of
the entire range, 192.168.111.1-192.168.111.254.</p><p>Another important tip for rule building is to get at Firewall
Builder's handy prebuilt service objects, click the Standard tab on
the left-hand side of the window. Be careful, though; if you do
anything <span   class="emphasis"><em>besides</em></span> drag a service object (for
example, dns_tcp) into your rules, the rules display on the
right-hand part of the window is replaced with information about
whatever you've selected.</p><p>In other words, if you're working on a policy, you can click
on the Standard tab, click on the + (expand) and - (collapse) icons
in the hierarchy window and click and drag service objects from it,
all without changing the mode of the right-hand part of the window.
But if you simply select a service object or category in the
Standard hierarchy (by clicking on it once without dragging), that
object's properties are displayed on the right. You have to go back
to the User tab and reselect your firewall's global policy to
display your rules again. You do not lose any data, but this can be
inconvenient and unsettling if you aren't expecting it.</p><p>A more substantial observation is that in all of these rules,
I left stateful inspection turned on. I skipped step 7 from our
loopback-rules procedure. Normally, we want the kernel to keep
state information on network transactions; this is why we can
describe most transactions with a single bidirectional rule rather
than with two unidirectional rules. For example, thanks to stateful
inspection, whenever a transaction matches rule 02 from Figure 2,
which allows inbound SSH traffic from hosts on the internal
network, Trillian's kernel matches not only those inbound SSH
packets, but also the SSH packets that Trillian sends back out in
reply. Had I turned off stateful inspection for rule 02, I'd need
another rule allowing all packets originating from TCP port 22 on
Trillian to accommodate those replies.</p><p>Finally, all rules but the last one have logging turned off,
as described in step 6 of our loopback-rules procedure. Most people
don't find it a useful or justifiable use of disk space or I/O
overhead to log every packet their firewall rules process.
Personally, I tend to focus on dropped packets and forego logging
on allow rules. Thus, the sample rules in Figure 2 end with a
cleanup rule at the bottom that explicitly drops any packet not
matching the other rules or the rules in any interface-specific
policies such as the loopback policy.</p><p>This rule's sole purpose in life is for logging. Firewall
Builder automatically sets the default policy for all my iptables
chains to DROP, but these dropped-by-default packets aren't logged
unless you tell Netfilter to do so.</p><p>An experimental dropped-table patch is available for
Netfilter that allows automatic logging of all dropped packets, but
I recommend you wait for this code to stabilize before going out of
your way to compile it into your kernel. If you can't wait for some
reason, you can access this feature from Firewall Builder by
selecting your firewall object, clicking its Firewall Properties
tab and checking the box next to Log all dropped packets. For more
information on the dropped-table patch, see
<a href="http://www.netfilter.org/documentation/pomlist/pom-summary.html" target="_self">www.netfilter.org/documentation/pomlist/pom-summary.html</a>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c33580.0x1d2c8f0"></a>Compiling and Installing the Policy</h2></div></div><p>After you've finished your firewall policy, you need to
convert it to an actual iptables script. To do so, first make sure
that on the screen's left-hand hierarchy view your firewall's
object, its global policy or one of its interface policies is
selected&mdash;it doesn't matter which. Then, pull down the Rules menu
and select Compile. Figure 3 shows the result.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6715f3.large.jpg"><img src="6715f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 3. Compiling the Policy</p></div></div>
</p><p>Upon successful policy compiling, Firewall Builder writes a
file whose name consists of the name of the firewall object whose
policy you compiled and the suffix .fw. The example script we
produced, trillian.fw, is shown in Listing 1. Listing 1 has been
modified slightly due to space requirements, and some housekeeping
material has been removed. All of the actual rules mentioned in the
article are present.</p><p><a href="6715l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1.
trillian.fw</a></p><p>This script now can be copied over manually to Trillian and
run as is, or it can be converted manually into a startup script
appropriate to Trillian's Linux distribution, for example, a
standard Red Hat 7.3 startup script. Easier still, you can copy it
over automatically and activate it with a Firewall Builder
installer script such as fwb_install, available under contrib at
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=5314" target="_self">sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=5314</a>.</p><p>The latter in particular is an elegant and simple way to copy
and activate your firewall scripts securely; fwb_install uses
<b  >scp</b> to copy the script to /etc/firewall on the
remote host and then <b  >ssh</b> to execute the script
remotely. If you've downloaded fwb_install somewhere on your
Firewall Builder system, you can configure Firewall Builder to use
it from within each firewall object's Compile/Install
properties.</p><p>Be sure to tweak fwb_install manually to match your system
settings and to set up SSH keys for fwb_install to use. Once you've
set this up, all you need to do to install your policies after
compiling them is pull down the Rules menu and select
Install.</p><p>As handy as fwb_install is, you'll want a startup script in
place on your target system that also executes the firewall script
on startup and after any reboot. Otherwise, the system is
vulnerable between each startup or reboot and the next time you
execute Install from within Firewall Builder. It's easy to copy and
adapt existing scripts in your system's /etc/init.d
directory.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c33580.0x1d23808"></a>Policy for a Real Firewall</h2></div></div><p>I've devoted most of this column to the bastion host example,
but building a policy for a multihomed (multi-interfaced) network
firewall is quite similar. Create loopback policies, create
anti-spoofing policies for the other interfaces, create a global
policy, compile the policy and install it.</p><p>The big differences have to do with the fact that a firewall,
unlike a server, has multiple network interfaces. Because a
single-interfaced system receives all packets except loopback at
one physical point, it can't distinguish spoofed packets from
legitimate packets; it must take each packet's source-IP address at
face value. But a multihomed system can distinguish easily between
packets that truly originate from local networks and packets that
arrive from the Internet but have forged source-IP addresses
matching a local or trusted network.</p><p>For instance, our example internal network is numbered
192.168.111.0 (subnet mask 255.255.255.0). If we have a firewall
named Slartibartfast between this network and the rest of the
world, we can use anti-spoofing rules to tell Slartibartfast to
drop any packet immediately from any interface other than the one
facing our internal network, if that packet has a source IP
beginning with 192.168.111. Such a packet is obviously spoofed.
Figure 4 shows Slartibartfast's anti-spoofing rule.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6715f4.large.jpg"><img src="6715f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 4. Anti-Spoofing Firewall
Rules</p></div></div>
</p><p>Before I made this rule, I created several network objects
that refer to the reserved IP address spaces defined in RFC 1918,
&ldquo;Address Allocation for Private Internets&rdquo;. RFC 1918 address
spaces are for use only within an organization and can't be routed
over the Internet, so any internet firewall should consider inbound
packets bearing such addresses to be spoofed, which is precisely
what the rule in Figure 4 does. Because my RFC 1918 Class C object
expands to 192.168.0.0, subnet mask 255.255.0.0 and my internal
network address is 192.168.111.0 (part of RFC 1918 address space),
it wasn't necessary to include my Net_Internal object in this
rule.</p><p>By the way, if you're not familiar with RFC 1918, my RFC 1918
Class A object refers to 10.0.0.0, subnet mask 255.0.0.0, and RFC
1918 Class B is 172.16.0.0, subnet mask 255.240.0.0.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c33580.0x1d23c80"></a>Global Rules</h2></div></div><p>Figure 5 shows Slartibartfast's global policy; because this
article is already too long I won't explain it in-depth. But the
whole point of Firewall Builder is to display firewall rules in an
easy-to-read format, so Figure 5 should be self-explanatory.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6715f5.large.jpg"><img src="6715f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 5. Global Policy for a Network
Firewall</p></div></div>
</p><p>Speaking of self-explanatory, did I mention that all rules,
whether loopback, anti-spoofing or global, can be generated quickly
and automatically using Firewall Builder's policy druid? You can
run it by selecting a firewall object, pulling down the Rules menu
and selecting Help me build a firewall policy.</p><p>Don't get too irked at me for not mentioning this until after
making you slog through all my instructions on building policies
the hard way. Firewall rules are too important to trust entirely to
druids. Hopefully, you now can understand and tweak or even correct
the rules Firewall Builder generates for you. Regardless of how you
build your policies, I hope you find Firewall Builder as useful as
I have.</p></div></div>
