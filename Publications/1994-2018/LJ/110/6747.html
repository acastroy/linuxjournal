    Maybe you should too.

posted to <a href="http://advogato.org" target="_self">advogato.org</a>
with the question, &ldquo;Why don't C++ and free software mix?&rdquo; He
pointed out that freedom-loving software developers tend to stay
away from C++.
</p><p>But, he added, although C++ is a big complicated language
with &ldquo;terrible pitfalls and simple misfeatures&rdquo;, it is
standardized and offers good flexibility and performance. And, he
wrote, &ldquo;its standard library includes the STL, which knocks the
socks off anything available in the C world for power, flexibility
and efficiency.&rdquo;</p><p>Or, does C++, as many have argued, represent the worst of
both worlds, an infertile middle ground between the simplicity and
control of C and the almost-automatic everything of Perl and
Python?</p><p>Today, though, it might be time for a second look at this
much-maligned language. For two big reasons books on standard C++,
templates and all, are on my to-read stack above the more tempting
ones on the next great scripting languages. First, the tools are
good. The C++ support in the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) is being
actively cleaned up, with binaries getting smaller and version 3.2
offering a stable application binary interface (ABI) that will help
with deploying software written in C++.</p><p>Besides GCC, a lot of other good tools are available to help
with C++, as Cal Erickson points out on page 34. Cal does embedded
development and that article is in the Embedded section, but his
development strategy&mdash;get as much as possible working on your
workstation first&mdash;means that the article will be useful to any C++
programmer.</p><p>Second, new or newly freed C++ projects, such as the Xerces
XML parser contributed by IBM, mean that your new C++ code can draw
on a lot of already tested, supported functionality. See John
Dubchak's article on page 50 for an example. As more corporations
start sharing in-house code, corporate technical preferences such
as C++ start to be more important on the outside.</p><p>If you're looking for a place to apply your software
development skills, Len Kaplan has a great one&mdash;your local museum.
On page 89 he covers the unique challenges and rewards of creating
applications for museum exhibits. And, you might pick up some C++
and XML hints from that article, too.</p><p>Another school of thought favors doing object-oriented
programming in C. For an example of how that is happening in the
kernel, see Greg Kroah-Hartman's Driving Me Nuts column on page 28.
Your brain is inside your head, so people won't see the stretch
marks on it from reading his code.</p><p>But speaking of brains, don't worry. We couldn't let the
development issue slip by without at least one regular C article,
and you'll be happy to know that the performance-critical parts of
interpreting the brain waves of the test subject on the cover are
in C. Enjoy Sam Clanton's Matlab-to-C porting advice on page
56.</p></div></div>
