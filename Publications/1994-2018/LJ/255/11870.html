<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #255, July 2015</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
There's a slow effort underway to allow virtually any part of the kernel to be
extracted into its own shared library, thus enabling users to use any
alternative subsystem they please. There's a long history of this, going back to
the debate between <span   class="bold"><b>micro-kernels</b></span> and <span   class="bold"><b>monolithic kernels</b></span>. Even <span   class="bold"><b>Linus Torvalds</b></span>,
the proponent of the monolithic kernel, believes it's better to abstract
features out of the kernel, so long as it can be done without sacrificing speed,
stability and other core requirements.
</p><p>
Most recently, <span   class="bold"><b>Hajime Tazaki</b></span> extracted the entire networking stack from the
kernel and converted it into a shared library. This wasn't in itself part of a
more generalized attempt to do such things, but while no one objected to the
idea, there was considerable debate over the right way to architect the
extraction, and this led to the thought that Hajime's idea could be extended to
other subsystems beyond the networking stack.
</p><p>
Ultimately, <span   class="bold"><b>Richard Weinberger</b></span> suggested that the portion of Hajime's code that
stubbed out the networking stack so it could be linked with a shared library
could be added to the kernel's testing code and used to stub out any arbitrary
portion of the kernel.
</p><p>
As it turned out, <span   class="bold"><b>Antti Kantee</b></span> had been working on a similar type of thing for
<span   class="bold"><b>NetBSD</b></span> for the past eight years, but he cautioned that the maintainability issues
could rapidly get out of hand if the design didn't aggressively address
maintainability from the start. And this, he felt, would require organizing the
deeper kernel infrastructure around the need to stub out portions of the kernel
to be turned into dynamic libraries. But at that point, he said, the code would
have only a very low maintenance cost.
</p><p>
Antti's recommendations were met with some suspicion. Richard felt that the
maintainability issues might go deeper even than Antti cautioned, due to the
tremendous speed of Linux development relative to that of NetBSD. In the end,
Richard suggested&mdash;and Hajime agreed&mdash;that the best approach would be for
Hajime to maintain the code, now dubbed <span   class="bold"><b>libOS</b></span>, as a separate git tree himself,
to get an exact measurement of how well it could keep pace with the rest of
kernel development.
</p><p>
It's not clear whether Hajime's code ever will get into the kernel. It seems a
lot of people like the ability it offers, but there are unanswered questions
about how well those abilities could be sustained over time. It may take a year
or more to get a better sense of these things, and until the kernel folks know
more, they'll be unlikely to accept this code into the kernel.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Beata Michalska</b></span> has been working on generic
filesystem event notification&mdash;a
kernel interface that any filesystem could use to alert the system to various
events, such as being remounted read-only. Beata described four basic categories
of events: warnings, errors, information and thresholds. Thresholds would
include things like the amount of free space dropping below a set minimum. The
kernel could respond to filesystem events by triggering any desired response.
</p><p>
In response to Beata's patch, <span   class="bold"><b>Heinrich
Schuchardt</b></span> suggested that her code
should be expanded to cover a range of filesystem scenarios that it didn't
yet&mdash;for example, distributed filesystems like <span   class="bold"><b>Lustre</b></span>, remote filesystems like <span   class="bold"><b>Samba</b></span>,
and any <span   class="bold"><b>FUSE</b></span>-based filesystems also should be supported, he said. He also
suggested that thumb drives and any other automounted filesystem also
should trigger an event in Beata's code, and the same for filesystems mounted under
virtual machines.
</p><p>
Various other folks also offered technical suggestions on how Beata could
improve her initial patch, and Beata invited more implementation suggestions for
some of the features Heinrich had requested. 
</p><p>
One benefit everyone seemed to agree on is that a generic notification system
would be highly preferable to each filesystem implementing its own
notifications independently. So there was a lot of enthusiasm for Beata's work,
although the exact technical details probably will continue to be hammered out for
some time.

<h2 class="title">Android Candy: Google Photos</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #255, July 2015</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Google has become the company that we love and can't live without,
but at the same time, I think we all worry a little about just how much
Google knows about us. With that caveat, it's hard to ignore Google's
newest offering: Google Photos.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11870androidf1.large.jpg"><img src="11870androidf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
Using unlimited storage, automatic sorting and face/place/event
recognition, Google is taking all the manual work of tagging and hiring
googlebots to do the work for us. Is that creepy? Maybe a little. Honestly
though, it's hard to scoff at unlimited storage of full-quality photos
and videos. Plus, if you're like me, actually finding the time to sort
and tag tens of thousands of photos is something you're going to get to
&ldquo;any day now&rdquo;.
</p><p>
If you're not completely freaked out by Google having access to all
your personal photos, give it a try today. It's free and seems to be
legit. There's an Android app you can download from the Google Play
Store, plus an iOS app and a Web application for using on
computers. Head over to <a href="http://photos.google.com" target="_self">photos.google.com</a>, and check it out!

<h2 class="title">Non-Linux FOSS: Portable Apps, in the Cloud!</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #255, July 2015</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
The concept of PortableApps has been around for a long time. It's
a great way to take your Windows apps from computer to computer
using a USB drive and never worry about being without your favorite
program. Honestly, remembering to carry around a USB drive can be a
bit of a pain though. Also, USB drives are generally fairly slow, and
working directly from the drive can be cumbersome.
</p><p>
Even with those limitations, the PortableApps.com system is an incredible
way to keep the apps you want, with your preferences, exactly how you
want them. The recent cloud changes are what sparked this mention. Although
PortableApps still work great on USB drives, it's also added support
for cloud-based services like Dropbox and Google Drive. If you want your
programs to follow you around from computer to computer without needing
to grab a Flash drive, the new syncing functionality means having all your
apps and all your preferences on any computer running Dropbox!
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11870fossf1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
I'm not sure if that makes them cloud apps, or TeleportingApps, or
if it's just a really great idea&mdash;regardless of what you call the concept,
it means fast and efficient computing on the various Windows machines
you use on a daily basis. Download the completely free (beer and speech)

<h2 class="title">General Relativity in Python</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Joey Bernard</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #255, July 2015</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
I have covered several different software packages for 
doing scientific computation in <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>, but I
haven't spent as much time describing
available libraries and the kind of work that can be done
with those libraries. So in this article, I take a look at SymPy, the Python module
that allows you to do symbolic mathematics, and specifically at a utility
named GraviPy that is built upon SymPy. With this utility, you can do all
sorts of computations that you'll want to do if you're researching
general relativity. 
</p><p>
You can install both modules using pip
with the following command:
   
<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo pip install sympy
sudo pip install gravipy
</pre>
</p><p>
Then, you can import everything from both modules with the Python
statements:

<pre     class="programlisting">
from sympy import *
from gravipy import *
</pre>
</p><p>
This way, you will have access to all of the functionality from these
modules within the namespace of your own Python code. 
</p><p>
When you do work in
general relativity, you often need to look at very complicated
equations. The GraviPy module includes a function, called
<tt  >init_printing()</tt>,
that sets up everything you need for pretty-printed equations. You 
probably will want to call this near the top of your code so that your worksheet
is more human-readable.
</p><p>
Let's start with the SymPy Python module. SymPy is
designed to give you the ability to do symbolic mathematical computations.
With it, you can do things like solve algebraic expressions, rearrange and
simplify equations, and even perform symbolic derivatives and integrals.
I've
looked at SymPy in a previous issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>, so here, I just focus on
some of the core parts as a reminder. 
</p><p>
The first necessary step is to
define the symbolic variables that you are going to use in your
calculations. Using the <tt  >symbols</tt> command, you can define them with:
   
<pre     class="programlisting">
x,y,z = symbols('x y z')
</pre>
</p><p>
This way, you define the variables that define the three space dimensions
in Cartesian coordinates. 
</p><p>
If you want to have all four space-time
coordinates defined in spherical coordinates, you can use this:
   
<pre     class="programlisting">
t, r, theta, phi = symbols('t, r, \\theta, \phi')
</pre>
</p><p>
Remember that you are feeding a string into the symbols function. This
means you need to escape any special characters to get the
results you are expecting. 
</p><p>
These commands will give you the symbolic
variables that you can use in expressions. But, general relativity has a
special class of variables, called coordinates, that are used to define the
space-time itself. There is a class, called
<tt  >Coordinates</tt>, that helps define
this. Using the spherical coordinates above, you can create the coordinates
with the statement:
   
<pre     class="programlisting">
x = Coordinates('\chi', [t, r, theta, phi])
</pre>
</p><p>
The four space-time coordinates are stored in the object
<tt  >x</tt>. You can
access the individual coordinates by using an index. In general relativity,
there are two different ways of indexing variables: covariant and
contravariant indexes. To look at the element values for the covariant
version, you need to use positive index values. Negative index values will
give you the contravariant versions. As an example, if you wanted to
get the time variable, you would use the following:
   
<pre     class="programlisting">
x(-1)
</pre>
</p><p>
Right away, you should notice that this implies that GraviPy uses 1-based
indexing rather than 0-based indexing.
</p><p>
Now that you have a set of variables to define the space-time coordinates to
be used, let's move on to actual general relativity. 
</p><p>
The core
part of general relativity is the metric. The metric defines how space-time
is shaped. This space-time shape is what defines the gravitational force.
The usual phrase that explains what is happening is that &ldquo;matter tells
space-time how to bend, and space-time tells matter how to move&rdquo;. To define
the metric within GraviPy, you need to start by creating a metric tensor
object. You can do so with this statement:

   
<pre     class="programlisting">
Metric = diag(-(1-2*M/r), 1/(1-2*M/r), r**2, r**2*sin(theta)**2)
</pre>
</p><p>
In this example, you'll notice a new variable, named <tt  >M</tt>, which
represents the mass of the matter that is creating this space-time
distortion. If it is an item that will remain static, you don't need
to do anything extra. But, there is no reason that it should remain static.
If it is something that can change, you need to use the
<tt  >symbols</tt>
command to define it. In its most general form, the metric tensor is a
4-by-4 matrix of elements. The above example is of a
diagonal metric where only the non-zero elements are along the diagonal.
Once you have this tensor object, you can define the metric based on it
with the statement:
   
<pre     class="programlisting">
g = MetricTensor('g', x, Metric)
</pre>
</p><p>
This example gives the function the metric definition and the coordinate
system to be used. 
</p><p>
To access the various elements, you can use indices that
follow the same format as above. For example, you could use the following:
   
<pre     class="programlisting">
g(1, 1)  -&gt;  2M/r-1
</pre>
</p><p>
For both vectors and tensors, you can use a special index called
<tt  >All</tt>
that will give you every possible value for the index in question. For
example, you can get the entire list of coordinates with this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
x(-All)  -&gt;  [t r theta phi]
</pre>
</p><p>
You can get all of the elements of the metric tensor with the statement:
   
<pre     class="programlisting">
g(All, All)
</pre>
</p><p>
Now that you have a set of coordinates and a metric tensor, there are
a number of standard tensors that need to be calculated to help work out
what the geometry of space-time actually looks like and how things like
light beams travel through this geometry. The GraviPy module includes
the tensor classes <tt  >Christoffel</tt>,
<tt  >Riemann</tt>, <tt  >Ricci</tt>,
<tt  >Einstein</tt> and
<tt  >Geodesic</tt>. The <tt  >Christoffel</tt>,
<tt  >Riemann</tt> and <tt  >Ricci</tt> tensors
depend only on
the metric. Therefore, they all have very similar forms to create new
instances and get results out of them. For example, you can define the
<tt  >Christoffel</tt>
tensor values with this statement:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Ga = Christoffel('Ga', g)
</pre>
</p><p>
You can get individual elements with indices, just like with the metric
tensor. But, some of these tensors can have a number of uninteresting
zero entries. So, you can get the non-zero values with the statement:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Ga.components
</pre>
</p><p>
This returns a dictionary where the keys are the coordinate sets for
where this particular value is located, as well as the actual non-zero
value at the point. 
</p><p>
The <tt  >Einstein</tt> tensor is the one used in the actual
Einstein equations for space-time, and they are a little different. In
order to calculate them, you first need to calculate the
<tt  >Ricci</tt> tensor
with this statement:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Ri = Ricci('Ri', g)
</pre>
</p><p>
Once you have this tensor, you can calculate the
<tt  >Einstein</tt> tensor with this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
G = Einstein('G', Ri)
</pre>
</p><p>
Before I leave off, I should look at two techniques that are absolutely
necessary to doing general relativity. The first is index contraction. This
is where you end up summing values over two of the indices in a tensor. In
Python, you can do this by explicitly summing with:
   
<pre     class="programlisting">
Rm = Riemann('Rm', g)
ricci = sum([Rm(i, All, k, All)*g(-i, -k) for i, k in 
 &#8618;list(variations(range(1, 5), 2, True))], zeros(4))
</pre>
</p><p>
These two lines are equivalent to the above single creation of the
<tt  >Ricci</tt>
tensor. In many cases, complicated calculations are not simplified
automatically.
This means that you need to do this simplification explicitly 
with the command:
   
<pre     class="programlisting">
ricci.simplify()
</pre>
</p><p>
The other important technique is to calculate geodesics, which are
equations that define how light beams travel in this space-time. You need
to create a new variable to handle the world line parameter for these
equations:
   
<pre     class="programlisting">
tau = symbols('\\tau')
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, you can calculate the geodesics with this:
   
<pre     class="programlisting">
w = Geodesic('w', g, tau)
</pre>
</p><p>
Again, you can use 1-based indices to access the various non-trivial
equations for your space-time of interest.
</p><p>
With SymPy, you can do all sorts of symbolic calculations normally reserved
for programs like Maple, Maxima or Mathematica. Building on these
capabilities, GraviPy lets you play with space-time and do calculations to
determine curvature and gravitational effects. There is not a great deal of
information available on-line explaining what GraviPy can do. Your best
option is to download the source files, which include a tutorial iPython
notebook, even if you install GraviPy through pip. Now you can do your
gravitational research all from the comfort of Python. 
If
you are a Python fan, this module will let you do interesting research work
in your favourite language.

Streaming video to multiple people always has been a challenge. Back
when Kyle Rankin and I did &ldquo;Linux Journal Live&rdquo;, we'd use services
like ustream or justin.tv in order to accommodate the bandwidth
requirements. The problem with those services is that unless you pay
significant money, the features are extremely limited. Fairly recently,
Google has changed that with its &ldquo;Hangouts on Air&rdquo;.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11870hangf1.large.jpg"><img src="11870hangf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
(Image from Google)
</p></div></div><p>
The process works like any other Google Hangout video chat, except
that while you're chatting, a YouTube live stream is taking place. It's
possible to embed the live stream like any other YouTube video, and because
it uses the Google networks, there's no need to worry about using too
much bandwidth.
</p><p>
The process for starting, stopping and embedding Hangouts on Air 
still can be a bit cumbersome. Thankfully, as the product matures, its
integration into YouTube gets better and better. I personally used
Hangouts on Air to broadcast my kid's drama presentation to family
members who couldn't make it. You even can keep the live stream as an
archive video for folks who can't watch the stream live. Check it

I was chatting with Fred Richards on IRC the other day (flrichar on
freenode) about sneaking around hotel firewalls. Occasionally, hotels will
block things like the SSH port, hoping people don't abuse their network.
Although I can respect their rationale, blocking an SSH port for a Linux user
is like taking a mouse away from a Windows user! I mentioned that I used to
have a remote server running SSH on port 443 so I still could get to my
servers. (Port 443 is the HTTPS port, which is rarely blocked.)
</p><p>
I also mentioned that it was inconvenient to use port 443 for SSH, because it
meant I couldn't host secure Web sites on that server. Fred graciously
pointed me to sslh, which is an awesome little program that multiplexes
(or maybe de-multiplexes?) network traffic based on the type of traffic it
sees. In simple terms, it means that sslh will listen for incoming
connections on a port like 443, and if it's a request for a Web page, it
will send the request to Apache. If it's an SSH request, it sends it to the
SSH d&aelig;mon. It also has support for OpenVPN traffic, XMPP traffic and
tinc.
</p><p>
Conceptually the program is simple, but I never considered it would be
something a simple open-source application could manage! I assumed it would
require a hardware appliance and lots of horsepower. I'm happy to say I was
very, very wrong. In fact, it's such an impressive piece of software, it
gets this month's Editors' Choice award! If you'd like to reach your SSH
server over port 443 while still hosting secure Web pages, check out sslh at
