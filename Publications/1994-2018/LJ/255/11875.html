Canonical Ltd.'s Ubuntu for Cloud &amp; Servers</h2></div></div><p>
The feature-rich 22nd release of the Ubuntu Debian Linux-based operating system,
version 15.04, recently became available for download from Canonical Ltd., the
OS's commercial sponsor. In the Cloud &amp; Server versions of this &ldquo;Vivid
Vervet&rdquo; release, three new features stand out: the LXD hypervisor, Snappy
Ubuntu Core and the OpenStack Kilo release. First, the next-generation LXD
hypervisor for containers, asserts Canonical, eliminates the virtualization
penalty of traditional hypervisors, making Linux-on-Linux workloads much faster
and much more dense. Meanwhile, Snappy Ubuntu Core, the smallest Ubuntu
available, is designed for lightweight cloud container hosts running Docker and
for smart devices. Snappy Ubuntu Core already is running on the next generation
of network switches, home routers, smart drones and robots, adds Canonical.
Finally, the company notes that this Ubuntu release is &ldquo;the world's first
OpenStack distribution to make the newest 'Kilo' release available to
users, a significant step forward in scalability for virtual networks on
OpenStack&rdquo;.

SoftMaker Office HD Basic</h2></div></div><p>
Although it lacks the advanced functionality of its sibling version, the newer,
free and slightly more spartan SoftMaker Office HD Basic &ldquo;still considerably
overtrumps all the other free Android Office packages&rdquo;, claims its
developer. SoftMaker adds that the original SoftMaker Office HD was the first
office suite for Android tablets to offer the full functional scope of a Windows
Office package; the &ldquo;Basic&rdquo; variant meanwhile forgoes some advanced
functionality. Basic consists of three apps, namely TextMaker HD Basic (word
processing), PlanMaker HD Basic (spreadsheets) and Presentations HD Basic
(presentation software), each optimized for touch operation and seamlessly
compatible with their MS Office counterparts. The programs offer functionality
beyond simple correspondence to include advanced formatting and graphical
design. Connectivity with Dropbox, Google Drive, Evernote and OneDrive is
built in.

Rich Cameron and Joan Horvath's <span   class="emphasis"><em>The New Shop Class</em></span> (Apress)</h2></div></div><p>
Publisher Apress proposes an ideal use for its new book <span   class="emphasis"><em>The New Shop
Class</em></span> as a hands-on guide for mentoring budding makers and hackers to a
potential science career. Subtitled <span   class="emphasis"><em>Getting Started with 3D Printing, Arduino,
and Wearable Tech</em></span> and authored by real &ldquo;rocket scientist&rdquo; Joan Horvath
and 3D printing expert Rich Cameron, the work demonstrates what open-source
&ldquo;maker&rdquo; technologies and wearable tech really can do in the right hands.
Not only will this book keep readers a step ahead of the young makers in their
lives, but it also will provide essential background on mentoring future scientists
and engineers. Insights into how engineers and scientists got their start, what
these professionals do and how their mindsets mirror that of the maker also
are included.

AdaCore's CodePeer</h2></div></div><p>
AdaCore's CodePeer 3.0 is the recently upgraded version of the company's
advanced static analysis tool for the automated review and validation of Ada
source code. Version 3.0 sports a variety of enhancements that help developers
detect potential runtime and logic errors early in the software life cycle, and
its deep analysis can directly support formal certification against
industry-specific safety standards. These standards include DO-178B for avionics
and EN50128, the highest standard for safety integrity concerning software for
railway control and protection. AdaCore claims a proven track record in the
most demanding systems and can help customers in any application domain. The
tool, AdaCore says, simplifies the verification effort by detecting subtle bugs in
both new code that is being developed and in existing code bases that need to be
analyzed for vulnerabilities.

In their new book <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Art of Scalability</em></span>, 2nd ed., leading scalability
consultants and authors Martin L. Abbott and Michael T. Fisher comprehensively
explain how to scale products and services smoothly for any requirement. The
contents of this extensively revised edition include new technologies,
strategies and lessons, as well as new case studies from the authors'
consulting work for companies like eBay, Visa, Salesforce.com and Apple. Written
for both the technical and nontechnical decision-makers, Abbott and Fisher
explore the core elements affecting scalability, including architecture,
process, people, organization and technology.

VMware's Project Lightwave and Project Photon</h2></div></div><p>
As part of its push to enable enterprise adoption of cloud-native applications,
VMware recently announced two new open source-projects: Project Lightwave and
Project Photon. Project Lightwave is an identity- and access-management project
that VMware says will extend enterprise scale and security to cloud-native
applications. Meanwhile, Project Photon is a lightweight Linux operating system
optimized for cloud-native applications. These projects are designed to help
enterprise developers securely build, deploy and manage cloud-native
applications. By integrating into VMware's unified platform for the hybrid
cloud, these projects will create a consistent environment across the private
and public cloud to support cloud-native and traditional applications. The
company hopes that the open-sourcing of these initiatives will foment a dynamic
ecosystem of partners and developer community, leading to common standards,
security and interoperability within the cloud-native application market. The
desired outcome is improved technology and greater customer choice.

Imagination Technologies' Creator CI20 Microcomputer</h2></div></div><p>
Looking for a high-performance, fully featured Linux and Android development
platform? &ldquo;Step right up&rdquo; says Imagination Technologies, developer of
the new MIPS-based Creator CI20 microcomputer. The company recently upgraded the
Creator CI20, which now features an improved board layout that optimizes Wi-Fi
performance and is easier to mount in cases. Imagination Technologies also
has designed a new 3D-printable enclosing, and makers can use source files from the
company's Web site to build their own versions. On the software side, the
new version adds out-of-the-box support for FlowCloud, an IoT API designed to
connect devices to the cloud.

Sentrix's Cloud-DMZ</h2></div></div><p>
The traditional response to the growing threat of attack on Web applications has
been to deploy Web Application Firewalls (WAFs). WAFs, says Sentrix, are no
longer suitable as they are extremely complex to deploy, configure and manage
within today's dynamic Web development models. The Sentrix alternative is
Cloud-DMZ version 3.0, &ldquo;a disruptive approach&rdquo; that increases security
effectiveness by replicating the customer's original Web site, thus locking
out attackers by removing more than 99% of the attack surface. Unlike WAFs, Cloud-DMZ
does not inspect all incoming traffic but rather continuously analyzes the
protected Web property's functionality and virtualizes the customer user
interface within a cloud-based grid. As a result, Cloud-DMZ prevents data
breaches, defacement and DDoS attacks while not generating false
positives and forcing the blocking of legitimate traffic. Among other features,
version 3.0 unveils a new, real-time Application Layer Visualizer,
&ldquo;the first tool that empowers both security and Web development teams to
visually identify the critical business logic components of their Web
application, identify security gaps, fix them using a visual policy editor, and
test them before publishing&rdquo;, notes Sentrix.
