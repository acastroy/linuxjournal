Dave takes a look at how to work with functions in shell scripts, offering
both an iterative and recursive solution to the classic Towers of Hanoi
problem.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1677580.0x176f358"></a></h2></div></div><p>
For this article, I thought it would be beneficial to go back to some basics of
shell scripting and look at how functions work. Most script writers
probably eschew using functions because it's a bit antithetical to how
scripts tend to evolve, as a sequence of commands on the command line that
are captured in a file.
</p><p>
As with general programming, however, if you have a block of even a few
lines that are invoked multiple times, in multiple locations in a script,
turning that into a function makes a lot more sense.
</p><p>
The general syntax is thus:

<pre     class="programlisting">
MyFunction() {
  commands to execute
}
</pre>
</p><p>
Within the main script&mdash;or any other functions, or the function
itself&mdash;a function is invoked by simply referencing its name:

<pre     class="programlisting">
echo "before call to MyFunction"
MyFunction
echo "after call to MyFunction"
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1677580.0x176f6c8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Easy enough. Positional parameters are given to the function in a manner
exactly analogous to how command flags are handed to the script overall, as
$1, $2, $3 and so on.
</p><p>
This means that within a function, I could write:

<pre     class="programlisting">
if [ -n "$1" ] ; then
  echo "I was given $1 as my first parameter"
fi
</pre>
</p><p>
Well, that's a bit lazy of me, testing <tt  >$#</tt> would be a better way to
ascertain if positional parameters were handed to the function, so
let's rewrite that as:

<pre     class="programlisting">
if [ $# -gt 0 ] ; then
  echo "I was given $# parameters"
fi
</pre>
</p><p>
The biggest limitation with shell functions is that they can return an
integer value only of 0&ndash;127, where a typical script actually utilizes the 0 =
false or failure, 1 = true or success. Or, a lot of scripters just ignore
return values entirely and use a global variable to pass back values,
particularly if they're string values, which otherwise are impossible to
deal with in a function.
</p><p>
Functions manipulating global variables is a bit sloppy compared to best
practices in Ruby, Java or C++, but you've got to work with what you've got,
right?

Towers of Hanoi</h2></div></div><p>
To make this column more interesting, I'm going to brush off a classic
recursion program and see how to make it work as a shell script. The
program is called Towers of Hanoi, and you've probably seen a kid's toy
for this. It's a set of different sized disks and three pegs, with the
goal being to move all the disks from one peg to another while never
violating the rule that bigger disks should never be atop smaller ones.
If the pegs are labeled 0, 1 and 2, the simplest case of one disk is to
simply move it from peg 0 to peg 2. For two, the first (smaller) disk moves
from 0 to 1; the second disk moves from 0 to 2, and the first then moves
atop it from 1 to 2.
</p><p>
There's an iterative solution that's succinct:

<pre     class="programlisting">

#!/bin/sh
/bin/echo -n "Towers of Hanoi. How many disks? "
read disk
for (( x=1; x &lt; (1 &lt;&lt; $disk ); x++ )) ; do
  i=$((($x &amp; $x - 1 ) % 3))
  j=$(((($x | $x - 1 ) + 1 ) % 3))
  echo "Move from tower $i to tower $j"
done

</pre>
</p><p>
When run, this delightfully short script produces the result I desire, a
step-by-step solution to the Towers of Hanoi problem:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Towers of Hanoi. How many disks? 4
Move from tower 0 to tower 2
Move from tower 0 to tower 1
Move from tower 2 to tower 1
Move from tower 0 to tower 2
Move from tower 1 to tower 0
Move from tower 1 to tower 2
Move from tower 0 to tower 2
Move from tower 0 to tower 1
Move from tower 2 to tower 1
Move from tower 2 to tower 0
Move from tower 1 to tower 0
Move from tower 2 to tower 1
Move from tower 0 to tower 2
Move from tower 0 to tower 1
Move from tower 2 to tower 1
</pre>
</p><p>
It turns out that the solution to <span   class="emphasis"><em>n</em></span> disks is 2**n + 1 steps
mathematically. Put succinctly, 20 disks would take a staggering 1,048,577
moves. That's a lot more patience than I would have with a puzzle
game; I don't know about you.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1677580.0x176fe00"></a>
Recursion in Shell Script Functions</h2></div></div><p>
The point of introducing the Towers of Hanoi puzzle, however, was to
demonstrate a neat recursion trick within a shell script, so let's have
a look at how that might work too.
</p><p>
The basic algorithm has three steps:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Move the topmost disks from Source to Temp.
</p></li><li><p>
Move the next largest disk from Source to Destination.
</p></li><li><p>
Move the topmost disks from Temp to Destination.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
There are various Web sites with illustrations of how this works, but it
just might be easier to present my script so you can see what I'm
talking about:


<pre     class="programlisting">
moves=0     # start with no moves
hanoi()
{
    if [ $1 -gt 0 ] ; then
      hanoi "$(($1-1))" $2 $4 $3
      echo move $2 "--&gt;" $3
      moves=$(( $moves + 1 ))
      hanoi "$(($1-1))" $4 $3 $2
    fi
}
/bin/echo -n "Towers of Hanoi. How many disks? "
read disks
hanoi $disks 1 2 3
echo "It took $moves moves to solve Towers for $disks disks."
</pre>
</p><p>
Notice that there are four parameters that you must give to the recursive
Towers of Hanoi function and that you have to &ldquo;prime the pump&rdquo; with
the initial invocation of:

<pre     class="programlisting">
hanoi $disks 1 3 2
</pre>
</p><p>
The parameters, in order, are the number of disks and the identity of each
of the three pegs you'll be using. For four disks and three pegs, the
solution:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Towers of Hanoi. How many disks? 4
move 1 --&gt; 3
move 1 --&gt; 2
move 3 --&gt; 2
move 1 --&gt; 3
move 2 --&gt; 1
move 2 --&gt; 3
move 1 --&gt; 3
move 1 --&gt; 2
move 3 --&gt; 2
move 3 --&gt; 1
move 2 --&gt; 1
move 3 --&gt; 2
move 1 --&gt; 3
move 1 --&gt; 2
move 3 --&gt; 2
</pre>
</p><p>
It took 15 moves to solve Towers of Hanoi for four disks.
Look closely at the code, and you'll realize you actually can use
mnemonic names for the pegs by changing the initial invocation near the
bottom of the script, which makes the output considerably more
understandable as a solution, this time for just three disks:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Towers of Hanoi. How many disks? 3
move source --&gt; temp
move source --&gt; destination
move temp --&gt; destination
move source --&gt; temp
move destination --&gt; source
move destination --&gt; temp
move source --&gt; temp
It took 7 moves to solve Towers of Hanoi for 3 disks.
</pre>
</p><p>
Although you might not encounter situations where you need to create recursive
functions in a shell script, the more general function creation and usage
definitely can make your scripts more efficient and easier to
understand.
And, as for Towers of Hanoi? Well, do you have a better algorithm? It's a
staple
of computer science education, so I bet a lot of you have tackled this one
in the past.
