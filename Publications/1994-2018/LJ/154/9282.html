PHP and Perl are both so powerful, they can even run each other.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1783580.0x187b298"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Perl is a language often associated with text processing and CGI.  PHP is
a language often associated with dynamic Web pages.  Both are very popular
with Web developers.  Often, each of these languages is used at the expense of
the other.  Hard-core Perl developers would love to develop everything in
Perl, and PHP developers tend to stick with PHP.
</p><p>
As usual in the Open Source
world, there is a lot of zealotry between users of each language.  If you
think that one of these languages is perfect and the other is lame,
this article is not for you! This article is for those who take a more
pragmatic approach and use what works best for them.  Each language has
its strengths and limitations.  Personally, I use both languages at work
and at home.  With time, I have discovered which language is best for which
tasks and
try to integrate the strengths of each language as much as possible to
complete my work quickly.
</p><p>
Perl is extremely good at
system administration and extensive data processing, among other
things.  This means, if you want to do some extensive processing on a text
report, Perl would be preferable, as it provides handy
regular-expression-enabled text comparisons, which make it so much easier to
search through a report.  Perl also has extensive string manipulation
features.  Perl, by virtue of being older than PHP and having an extensive
community, has thousands of extensions archived in CPAN, which allow
one to do virtually anything with the language, conveniently.  From XML
processing to writing to parallel port devices, CPAN includes
everything.  CPAN is the reason Perl continues to be useful to a
large number of developers to date.  Although it is not impossible to do
everything described here with PHP and a mixture of other languages, it's
simply more convenient with
Perl.
</p><p>
PHP is extremely good at integration with Web pages and databases.  PHP
integrates nicely with static HTML Web pages.  That's why it's so
popular and has had more visibility than Perl in recent years.  It has
mature support for numerous popular free or non-free databases and
supports MS SQL (MSSQL) server better than any other open-source
language.  From personal experience, I have tried at least two CPAN
extensions for Perl to get it to work with an MSSQL installation, but
with limited success.  However, PHP has seamless support for MSSQL and
uses it as natively as MySQL.
</p><p>
I was recently involved in a project in which nearly the entire project
was in Perl.
However, a tiny bit of code needed access to an MSSQL server.  I
knew how simple it was in PHP to work with MSSQL, and I did not want to
go through the pain of setting up my Perl installation for MSSQL.  That's
why I searched the Internet for a way to integrate both languages in
a manner that would allow me to use the best parts of each language and
produce a coherent solution.  And, I found the PHP::Interpreter CPAN module.
PHP::Interpreter was perfect.  It enables the complete integration of
the two languages to an extent that one starts to believe that both are
mere extensions of each other.  PHP::Interpreter, as this
article shows, allows you to use PHP's mature support for databases and other
features natively in Perl, and also to use Perl's vast number of CPAN modules to
extend your PHP programs.
</p><p>
According to AnnoCPAN, the module's main function is to encapsulate an
embedded PHP5 interpreter.  It provides proxy methods (via AUTOLOAD) to
all the functions declared in the PHP interpreter, transparent
conversion of Perl data types to PHP (and vice versa), and the ability
for PHP to call Perl subroutines similarly and access the Perl symbol
table.  The goal of this package is to construct a transparent bridge for
running PHP code and Perl code side by side.
</p><p>
To demonstrate the power of this module, we code two examples to
show each side of the PHP::Interpreter, integrating Perl with PHP and
integrating PHP with Perl.  Each example shows areas in which
both languages complement each other nicely to produce powerful code.

Example 1: Integrating PHP with Perl</h2></div></div><p>
In the first example, we create an application to monitor failed
logins through SSH to our system.  SSH often is targeted by script
kiddies and malicious users to compromise a system and gain access to
it.  The script identifies the IPs of the offenders, blocks all
incoming packets from using iptables and, finally, logs them in to an
MS SQL server database.  We use Perl to do what it's best
at&mdash;processing log files.  It will continuously monitor the /var/log/messages
file, which the SSH d&aelig;mon uses to log failed login attempts.  To
monitor a log file continuously, we use the CPAN extension
File::Tail.  To support writing to MS SQL Server transparently, we
implement this portion in PHP and show how the two languages can be
integrated seamlessly and used in scenarios where both complement each
other.

Setting Up PHP::Interpreter</h2></div></div><p>
Setting up PHP::Interpreter is basically a standard Perl module installation
procedure.  You can get it from <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/PHP-Interpreter" target="_self">search.cpan.org/dist/PHP-Interpreter</a>.
Unpack it, and create the Makefile:
</p><pre     class="programlisting">perl Makefile.PL</pre><p>
Compile it:</p><pre     class="programlisting">make</pre><p>
And, install it:</p><pre     class="programlisting">make install</pre><p>
You can do an additional:</p><pre     class="programlisting">pod2html interpreter.pm &gt; interpreter.html</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1783580.0x187ba80"></a></h2></div></div><p>
and keep the documentation file for future reference.
</p><p>
We also use the CPAN module File::Tail, which allows us to
monitor a log file continuously.
You can get this module from <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/File-Tail" target="_self">search.cpan.org/dist/File-Tail</a>.
</p><p>
Unpack it, and create the Makefile:
</p><pre     class="programlisting">perl MakeFile.PL
make
make install</pre><p>
Now, fire up a text editor, and start coding:
</p><pre     class="programlisting">1. use PHP::Interpreter;
2. use File::Tail;
3. use threads ('yield', 'stack_size' =&gt;64 * 4096, 'exit'
   =&gt;'threads_only');
4. use Thread;
5. my $php = PHP::Interpreter-&gt;new;
6. my $ref=tie *FH,"File::Tail",(name=&gt;'/var/log/messages');
7. while (&lt;FH&gt;)
8. {
9. if($_=~/sshd/) #checks for message from sshd
10. {
11. if($_=!/Failed password for/) #check for a failed password attempt
12. {
13. $ind = rindex($str,'from');
14. $rind = rindex($str,'port');
15. $ip = substr($str,$ind+4,$rind-$ind-4);
16. $thr = new Thread \&amp;writems, $ip;
17. $thr-&gt;join();
18. }
19. }
20. }
21. sub writems
22. {
23. `iptables -I INPUT -s $ip -j DROP`
24. $php-&gt;include(*"*writems.php*"*);
25. $php-&gt;writeIP('ssqlserver','sshwatch','sshusr','sshpass',$_[0]);
26. print $php-&gt;eval("echo Succeeded!");
27. }</pre><p>
In a separate file, write the following script (the file should be named
writems.php):</p><pre     class="programlisting">1. &lt;?php
2. function writeIP($dbhost,$dbname,$dbuser,$dbpass,$ip)
3. {
4. $conn = mssql_connect($dbhost,$dbuser,$dbpass)
5. or die("Couldn't connect to SQL Server on $dbhost");
6. $db = mssql_select_db($dbname, $s)
7. or die("Couldn't open database $myDB");
8. set_time_limit(0);
9. $squery="insert into sshwatch(currentdate,ip)
10. values('".date('Y/m/d')."','".$ip."')"; mssql_query($squery);
11. }
12. ?&gt;</pre><p>
To run the application, simply run the Perl script:
</p><pre     class="programlisting">Perl scriptname</pre><p>
In Line 25, you need to fill in the correct settings for your MSSQL
server installation.  You also need to have a PHP installation with
support for MSSQL.  This is usually done by passing the switch
-with-mssql during the compilation of PHP.  Some distributions also
require you to install FreeTDS, which is used by PHP to access MSSQL.
</p><p>
Now, let's review some specific portions of the code.
To use the PHP::Interpreter in your code, declare its use, as
in line 1.
To create a new instance of PHP interpreter, do as is shown in line 5:</p><pre     class="programlisting">my $php = PHP::Interpreter-&gt;new;</pre><p>
As with object-oriented programming, you now can invoke methods on the $php
object to achieve interoperability with PHP.  The above code shows two
functions provided by the PHP::Interpreter for interoperability.  In line
24,
we are calling the include() function, which includes a PHP script
file to the environment, and you can call functions defined in the file
natively from the object.  We do the same with writeIP in line 25, which is a PHP
function declared in writems.php on line 2 of the writems.php listing.
The Eval
function of the $php object allows you to execute a specific PHP
instruction, as with a live interpreter.  The instruction is interpreted,
and the return may be stored into a variable or used directly, as in
line 26.  As you can see in the above program, PHP::Interpreter provides
an object-oriented mechanism for completely integrating the two
languages.  This integration is achieved with only two lines of code: the
initial use statement and the instantiation of the object.
PHP::Interpreter is not only about calling functions and procedural
programming, it also works with object-oriented PHP.  This is how you
can instantiate an object of class defined in a PHP:</p><pre     class="programlisting">my $instance = $PHP-&gt;instantiate('PHPclass', @args);</pre><p>
The instance is stored in $instance, and any arguments are passed to
the class' constructor.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1783580.0x187c108"></a>
Example 2: Integrating Perl with PHP</h2></div></div><p>
The biggest advantage of Perl/PHP integration is PHP's ability to access
Perl CPAN modules.  There are CPAN modules for almost
everything that can be done via software; you can use PHP::Interpreter
in PHP to call CPAN modules to extend a PHP application to do anything,
which is not native to PHP&mdash;for example, it enables you to write to IO ports.
Writing to IO ports has been the exclusive domain of C/C++ programs, but
with PHP::Interpreter, even a mere scripting language can have the
capability to write to IO ports.  The example that follows shows
how to use Perl code with PHP, but first, we discuss the features
of PHP::Interpreter that allow PHP/Perl integration.
</p><p>
The PHP interpreter, invoked via PHP::Interpreter, has a special class
that allows PHP to Perl communication.
Create an instance of the class via this call in PHP:</p><pre     class="programlisting">1. &lt;?php
2. $perl = Perl::getInstance();
3. ?&gt;</pre><p>
The new $perl object allows you to evaluate specific Perl instructions
in PHP, such as:</p><pre     class="programlisting">1. &lt;?php
2. $perl = Perl::getInstance();
3. $perl-&gt;eval(q^
4. print "Executing Perl code in PHP\n";
5. ^);
6. ?&gt;</pre><p>
Similar to Example 1, where we called a PHP function in Perl, you can
call Perl subroutines in PHP.  All subroutines defined in the Perl
program, which instantiated the PHP::Interpreter instance, can be invoked
like this (I will provide a more detailed example shortly):</p><pre     class="programlisting">1. &lt;?php
2. $perl = Perl::getInstance();
3. $return = $perl-&gt;call('sub', @args);
4. ?&gt;</pre><p>
And, of course, you can get and set variables from the Perl file that
instantiated the PHP::Interpreter; however, only package variables, not
lexical variables, are supported.
</p><p>
Let's look at a practical application of PHP/Perl integration&mdash;for
example,
a snippet of Perl code that uses the Babel Fish CPAN
module.  (Babel Fish is a piece of software that allows you to translate
text between different languages.  To learn more about Babel Fish,
go to <a href="http://babel.altavista.com" target="_self">babel.altavista.com</a>.) The PHP program calls the
translate function, which will be implemented in Perl, to translate a
string in English to German and retrieve the output.
</p><p>
To install the Babel Fish CPAN, go to
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/CPAN/authors/id/D/DM/DMUEY/AltaVista-BabelFish-v42.0.1.tar.gz" target="_self">search.cpan.org/CPAN/authors/id/D/DM/DMUEY/AltaVista-BabelFish-v42.0.1.tar.gz</a>,
and install it with the standard installation procedure, as shown
previously
in this article.
</p><p>
AltaVista::BabelFish also has some prerequisites, such as Class::Std and
Class::Std::Util.  These need to be downloaded and installed
for Babel Fish to work:</p><pre     class="programlisting">1. use AltaVista::BabelFish;
2. use PHP::Interpreter;
3. my $p = PHP::Interpreter-&gt;new();
4. $p-&gt;include("phpscript.php");
5. my $val = $p-&gt;invoke();

6. sub translate
7. {
8. my $phish = AltaVista::BabelFish-&gt;new({ source =&gt; $_[0], target =&gt;
   $_[1] });
9. return $phish-&gt;translate($_[2]) or die $phish-&gt;get_errstr();
10. }</pre><p>
The phpscript.php file contains the following:</p><pre     class="programlisting">1. &lt;?php
2. function invoke()
3. {
4. $perl = Perl::getInstance();
5. $string = $perl-&gt;call('translate', 'en','de','Translate this for me');
6. print "Translated string: $string\n";|
7. }
8. ?&gt;</pre><p>
Let's look at this piece of code in more detail.  In line 4 of the PHP
program, we are creating an instance of the Perl class
using Perl::getInstance().  This is the special class inserted by
the PHP::Interpreter dynamically into the environment to achieve PHP to Perl
integration.
</p><p>
In line 5, we then use the class object, $perl, to invoke a function
called translate, which is defined in line 6 of the Perl program, and we
pass the arguments accordingly.  The subroutine translate is invoked from
the Perl script, and the translation is done via the Babel Fish module.
The translated string is returned to PHP and printed via the print
statement.  Although this is a rudimentary example, the entire script can
be extended to provide runtime translation for viewers of a dynamic
Web page generated from PHP.  With CPAN and the PHP::Interpreter, the
possibilities of what can be achieved in PHP are bounded only by the
developer's imagination.
</p><p>
You can use the PHP Perl class for object-oriented Perl as well.
Invoke a Perl object via the new() function, as follows:</p><pre     class="programlisting">1. &lt;?php
2. $perl = Perl::getInstance();
3. $instance = $perl-&gt;new('perlclass', @args);
4. ?&gt;</pre><p>
The first argument to the new() method, in line 3, is the name of the
class, and additional arguments are passed to the constructor of the class.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
This article shows both sides of the PHP::Interpreter: using PHP in Perl and
Perl in PHP.  The module essentially allows a PHP programmer to extend
the capabilities of PHP to enable it to do anything that CPAN allows
Perl to do.  It also allows a Perl programmer to use those features in
PHP that are not yet mature or not implemented in Perl.  By no means have I
covered all of the PHP::Interpreter, and readers are encouraged to
explore the official CPAN documentation of PHP::Interpreter.
