Don't forget the modular command-line power of Linux.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dd3580.0x1ecb3a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
I was walking along the beach with one of the Pollywogs when I saw a
small tidal pool.  I stopped to wade through it and look at some
of the life under the rocks.
</p><p>
Most people never look under the rocks in a tidal pool or in a freshwater
stream, but there is a lot of very interesting and necessary life to
be found&mdash;life forms that are necessary because they fill a very important part of
the world.  Most people see only the glossy surface of the ocean or the
stream, simply because they never look any deeper.
</p><p>
The same is true with Linux.  I have noticed that recently there has been a
lot of work on graphical user interfaces, with translucent windows and
different ways of displaying multiple desktops&mdash;all of this is good.
</p><p>
In my opinion, however, the real power of Linux comes from the command-line
interface that resides below this glossy surface and allows people to
write very powerful programs to manipulate huge amounts of data.
</p><p>
I do not expect that everyone will want to learn every type of
command-line interface or small language, but if you do not learn at
least one or two, you will never know how powerful your system can be.
</p><p>
Many years ago, the company where I was working needed to get a new
piece of software out to its customers.  However, the customers who
were supposed to receive the software were represented by two different
printouts from two different systems, and my company was planning on
having a clerk evaluate the two reports to accomplish this task.
Estimated time for the clerk to do this was nine
months, which meant that the software would be almost a year old before
the customers received it.
</p><p>
I asked if this process could somehow be automated, because the customers
were waiting for the software.  &ldquo;No&rdquo;, I was told, &ldquo;it
can't be done&rdquo;,
because the databases were incompatible and on different machines.
There was no program that could reach across the systems to coordinate
the data.
</p><p>
I had the managers put the printout into two files, and put both files
on my (at that time) UNIX system.  In less than a quarter of a day,
using the stream editor sed(1), the pattern matching program grep(1)
and the pattern matching, scanning and processing language awk(1), I was
able not only to correlate the data but also to print out mailing labels for
the shipping boxes along with an indication of the proper software to
go in each one.  The managers could not believe it.
</p><p>
Some people think that it takes a lot of study in order to
&ldquo;know&rdquo; command-line programming.  However, if you approach the task systematically,
you can learn it over time, taking advantage of each learning cycle.
</p><p>
The first thing you probably should do is get a book
on Linux commands.  <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux In A Nutshell: A Desktop Quick
Reference</em></span> by Figgins, Weber and Siever (O'Reilly) is a good
start.  Another good one is
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Pocket Guide</em></span> by Barrett, also from O'Reilly.
Finally, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
For Dummies Quick Reference</em></span> by Hughes and Navratilova (Wiley) also
is a good reference.
</p><p>
Read the book you choose, but do not obsess with memorizing the capabilities of
each command.  After you have read the book, think about some task
you have to do repeatedly and what it would take to automate
that task.  You probably will find some Linux command-line programs that
would help make things easier.
</p><p>
When you log in to your Linux system, execute a terminal emulator
program,
such as xterm or one of the others.  Stay away from superuser
(root) mode for the present, as you are trying to learn and sometimes
things go astray.
</p><p>
Practice with some commands, such as grep, sed, ls, cd
and others, simply by typing them into the command line and feeding them
data according to what the command requires.  Or, create a file of ASCII
characters that you would like to use the commands to search,
sort, filter or otherwise change.
</p><p>
Then, start putting the commands together using the pipe symbol (|).  Note
that this is not either the lowercase l
or uppercase i.  It is typically found along with some of the other
special characters on ASCII keyboards, usually above the Enter key.
</p><p>
For example, start by putting together the
ls and grep commands:</p><pre     class="programlisting">ls | grep 'e'</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dd3580.0x1ecbbe0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
This will show you every visible file in your directory with the letter e
in its name.
</p><p>
Another area of study should be the concept of regular
expressions&mdash;ways of describing strings of data that typically are used for searching
or matching with other strings of characters.  The aforementioned
books also cover issues of regular expression creation, which can be
quite tricky, but also quite powerful.
</p><p>
Although different programs may use different methods of regular expressions,
they tend to follow the same principles, and generally you can use
the same type of special characters with each command.
</p><p>
I was working for Bell Laboratories in 1977, trying to be a system
administrator for this interesting system called &ldquo;UNIX&rdquo;.  For
several months I had been frustrated by trying to learn this operating
system that had seemingly millions of tiny little commands, multiple
directories holding them and &ldquo;cryptic&rdquo; names for them.  One night I was
trying to modify a text file with the interactive text editor, ed(1),
and I could see that it would take me <span   class="emphasis"><em>hours</em></span> to modify the file using
ed, if not all night.
</p><p>
I remember suddenly thinking, &ldquo;I do not <span   class="emphasis"><em>know</em></span>
that there is a command in UNIX
for doing this easily, but I am willing to <span   class="emphasis"><em>bet</em></span> there is
one.&rdquo;  So, I started going through the manual looking only at the
description of each command given in the &ldquo;Name&rdquo; line for the command.
Fairly soon, I came across cut and its partner program paste,
which allowed me to do exactly what I needed to do in two commands.
From that time on, I followed the philosophy of first looking for the
right command, and although that philosophy was sometimes wrong, more times
than not, the philosophy was right, and a suitable command did exist.
</p><p>
To start learning the command line with only on-line resources, make
sure that you have loaded the on-line manual and info pages from your
distribution.  You can then type in <tt  >man intro</tt> to read the introduction
section of the man(1) command, then type <tt  >man
&lt;command-name&gt;</tt>&mdash;for example,
<tt  >man ls</tt>&mdash;to learn more about the ls(1) command.  The
(1) after
the command name ls means that it is a user-level command, rather than
a programming interface, system administrator command or other
specialized function.
</p><p>
If you like a graphical, mouse-based reader, rather than a command-line
reader, there is xman.  Once you have invoked xman by typing
<tt  >xman</tt>,
click Help in the little window and read the first section of the
help page.  You then can click manual page in the little control
window, and when the text window pops up, select show both screens
from the Options menu at the top.  This lets you see both
the index of all the manual commands in the top section and the
actual manual page itself in the bottom section.  Click on the program
of interest in the top section, and the command will be formatted in the
bottom section.  An example of an interesting command is less(1).
</p><p>
I can't touch on all the issues and needs
for learning the power of the command line in one column, but perhaps I've piqued your
interest in discovering why a lot of Linux users do not use a graphical
windowing system at all, preferring to use only the command line,
while others (myself included) heavily use both the windowing system
and the command line.
</p><p>
And, perhaps you will look beneath the surface to see the power of the
underlying currents.
