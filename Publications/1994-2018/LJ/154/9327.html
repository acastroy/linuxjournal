Some of the best Windows utilities available might be in your Linux
partition.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1324580.0x141c298"></a></h2></div></div><p>
A Linux environment can gain access to dozens of filesystems, whether
on the local hard drive or somewhere on the network.  More specifically,
Linux can run many tools to manipulate Windows
filesystems or repair Windows problems.
</p><p>
One suite of tools comes from the Linux-NTFS Project.  These utilities
work many miracles.  One resizes NTFS partitions.  Several manipulate
individual files.  One clones an entire NTFS image.  It is possible to back
up Windows installations, clone new workstations from a centrally stored
image and update images across a network.  And, because these tools
run inside Linux, they benefit from the power of the Linux environment.
These tools help when you're dealing with a single dual-boot computer.
They quickly become indispensable if you work with a large network.
Aided by redirection, pipes and scripting, it is easy to automate many
tedious but important Windows maintenance tasks from within
Linux.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1324580.0x141c3f8"></a>
Installation</h2></div></div><p>
The utilities are widely available and well supported.  Packages are
available for virtually all Linux distributions that have package
managers, and the software itself is even included on the Knoppix live CD.
Many distributions install the tools to be run only by the root user.
To see if these tools are on your installation of Linux, consulting the
man pages will at least show whether the documentation is installed:
<tt  >man ntfsprogs</tt>.
</p><p>
Even if the software and/or documentation are absent, you can install
these tools yourself.  For SUSE, Debian, Ubuntu and Gentoo, ntfsprogs
is the package name to search for and install.  The packages for some
distributions include all of the NTFS tools, some do not.  For example,
the package in the Etch version of Debian includes the ntfsmount
tool, and the package in the Sarge version does not.  Red Hat/Fedora
distributions do not support NTFS, based on perceived licensing issues,
but specifically designed packages for Red Hat/Fedora are available
directly from the Linux-NTFS Project.  Of course, consulting the actual
home page of the project (<a href="http://www.linux-ntfs.org" target="_self">www.linux-ntfs.org</a>) gives the
most up-to-date documentation and information, as well as the latest
source code and instructions for building the complete set of tools.
</p><p>
No matter what flavor of Linux you run, it is possible to download the
source code and install from that.  This is a good choice if you want the
newest features and the latest NTFS drivers, although you could suffer
from the disadvantage of having bypassed your package manager.
</p><p>
Note: before you build ntfsprogs from scratch, you probably
should install the FUSE library (<a href="http://fuse.sourceforge.net" target="_self">fuse.sourceforge.net</a>).  Linux has a built-in NTFS driver,
but the NTFS utilities include a second driver for NT filesystems.
The non-native driver is the FUSE-based ntfsmount, which boasts many
extra features.  However, it is a bit slower than the driver that
comes with the latest kernel.  Furthermore, it requires that your kernel
has the FUSE module.
</p><p>
If you want to install the FUSE library, download the latest source and
store it in a handy directory, maybe the same place you plan to store
your ntfsprogs download.  The installation follows the &ldquo;configure, make,
make-install&rdquo; process that has become the standard (note that the version
number may have changed by the time you read this).
Do this as root:</p><pre     class="programlisting">tar -xzvf fuse-2.5.3.tar.gz
cd fuse-2.5.3.tar.gz
./configure
make
make install</pre><p>
Installing the FUSE library and module is not completely necessary
if all you want is read access (and somewhat temperamental read/write
access) to an NT filesystem.  That's because for all distributions, except
Red Hat/Fedora, there is a native Linux kernel driver that runs through
the normal mount command.  It is faster, but it lacks the extensive
features and feedback of ntfsmount.
</p><p>
Now, download the ntfsprogs source, and then save it in a handy
directory.  Operating as root, build it much the way you built the FUSE
package (again, the actual version number may have changed by the time
you read this):</p><pre     class="programlisting">tar -xzvf ntfsprogs-1.13.1.tar.gz
cd ntfsprogs-1.13.1
./configure
make
make install</pre><p>
When building ntfsprogs without the FUSE library (even if you do have
the FUSE module), you will get a complaint while running the configure
command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">checking for FUSE_MODULE... configure: WARNING: \
ntfsmount requires FUSE version &gt;= 2.3.0</pre><p>
This shouldn't be fatal to building the other NTFS tools, but you will
not be able to compile ntfsmount.
</p><p>
If you are running Red Hat/Fedora, you might not even have the kernel
driver.  In that case, it is strongly recommended that you either install
a custom kernel containing the kernel-based NTFS driver or install the
FUSE libraries before building.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1324580.0x141ca80"></a>
The Software</h2></div></div><p>
At this point, it is assumed that you have either installed ntfsprogs
or have discovered it already installed on your system.
</p><p>
If you have already looked at the ntfsprogs man page, you have seen the
complete list of the utilities.  Here is that part of the output from
the man page:</p><pre     class="programlisting">mkntfs(8) - Format a partition using NTFS.
ntfscat(8) - Dump a file's contents to the standard
output.
ntfsclone(8) - Efficiently clone, create, restore or
rescue an image of an NTFS partition.
ntfscluster(8) - Locate the owner of any given sector
or cluster on an NTFS partition.
ntfscp(8) - Overwrite file on an NTFS partition.
ntfsfix(8) - Check and fix some common errors, clear
the LogFile and make Windows perform a thorough check
next time it boots.
ntfsinfo(8) - Show some information about an NTFS
partition or one of the files or directories
within it.
ntfslabel(8) - Show, or set, an NTFS partition's
volume label.
ntfsls(8) - List information about files in a
directory residing on an NTFS partition.
ntfsmount(8) - NTFS module for FUSE.
ntfsresize(8) - Resize an NTFS partition without
losing data.
ntfsundelete(8) - Recover deleted files from an
NTFS partition.</pre><p>
Many of the utilities listed are more useful to developers than to people
doing maintenance on a network or dual-boot computer.  However, some of
these are real life-savers, and ntfsclone is the biggest life-saver of all.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1324580.0x141cc90"></a>
Using the NTFS Tools</h2></div></div><p>
In order to try out ntfsclone, you need a computer with the NT filesystem
to clone, and it needs to have access to another filesystem large enough
to store the image.  Recommended filesystems are ext2, ext3, xfs or
ReiserFS.  The documentation for ntfsclone warns that the ReiserFS is slow
when handling sparse files, but I have found the performance to be okay
with more recent versions.  It is possible to to use an external drive,
as long as it has the ability to store huge files&mdash;for some operations
you will need space as large as your entire Windows partition.  If you
have an external drive formatted as a FAT32 filesystem, it will have
a size limit for individual files that is too small for what you need.
Of course, if your computer does not have Linux installed, you will need
to boot from a live Linux CD, such as Knoppix.
</p><p>
Notice that the description of the ntfsclone utility above claims that
it does its job &ldquo;efficiently&rdquo;.  This is not merely a boast.  On newer
hardware, it can clone a substantial Windows XP workstation in just a
couple of minutes.  If you had an NT filesystem on the first partition of
the first IDE drive and were operating from Linux on the same computer,
the following command would back up the NTFS as a single file:</p><pre     class="programlisting">ntfsclone /dev/hda1 -O /usr/local/backup/ntfs.img</pre><p>
The uppercase O in this command tells the software to overwrite
the image, but it will create the file if it is absent.  This will not
compress the filesystem.  In fact, it will leave it in a state to allow
you to mount ntfs.img using loopback.  First, make a mountpoint:</p><pre     class="programlisting">mkdir /usr/local/backup/mtpt</pre><p>
Then, use ntfsmount and the same syntax you would use for an ordinary
mount:</p><pre     class="programlisting">ntfsmount -o loop /usr/local/backup/ntfs.img \
 /usr/local/backup/mtpt/</pre><p>
The ntfsmount command mounts the filesystem read/write by default.  Files
can be copied, moved and deleted easily.  Of course, there are the
usual cross-platform perils to contend with.  For example, situations
involving configuration files can require caution when alien line endings
and character sets are involved.
</p><p>
Using the the native mount command with the native driver involves the
same familiar syntax:</p><pre     class="programlisting">mount -o rw,loop,nls=utf8 -t ntfs \
 /usr/local/backup/ntfs.img \
 /usr/local/backup/mtpt/</pre><p>
Note that this mount also makes a provision for a Windows-compatible
character set.  You still need to use caution, finesse and
expertise, however, if you were to choose to edit, say, boot.ini with Emacs.
It would be better to edit such a file in a Windows environment or
perhaps with Notepad running through Wine.
</p><p>
If you want read/write access, your success with this last mounting method
might vary according to the version of your kernel.  Again, the native
driver is a bit finicky.  It may complain, and if it does, its usual
behavior is to fall back to a mount that is read-only.  Older versions
of the native driver are outright dangerous in read/write mode.
</p><p>
Unmount the filesystem the same way for both methods.  From the directory
containing the mountpoint do the following:</p><pre     class="programlisting">umount mtpt/</pre><p>
The ntfs.img file can be moved and copied just like any other (admittedly
huge) file.  It can be compressed and stored in a safe place.  It can be
uploaded to remote locations.  A copy can be edited and then restored over
the original.  The command for restoring this backup onto the original
partition (while in the directory containing the backup) is as follows:</p><pre     class="programlisting">ntfsclone  ntfs.img -O /dev/hda1</pre><p>
Sometimes, smaller is better.  The ntfsclone command will take flags
that allow your image to be compressed efficiently.  These flags also
make the process of cloning much faster, both from the local hard drive
and over the network.  Here is one example, where the image is saved
much the way it was in the first example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">ntfsclone --save-image /dev/hda1 -O \
 /usr/local/backup/ntfs.img</pre><p>
This image, alas, cannot be mounted unless it is restored, either to its
original partition or to a different file.  Restoring to its original
partition would happen as follows:</p><pre     class="programlisting">ntfsclone --restore-image --overwrite /dev/hda1 \
/usr/local/backup/ntfs.img</pre><p>
Note that in the above, the -O has been replaced by the more
script-friendly --overwrite flag.  They do the same job.  All flags
can be expressed as script-friendly words (for readers of English),
and most can be expressed as single letters.
</p><p>
Now comes the good part.  The ntfsclone utility will send its data
to standard output.  This means you have your choice of various
compression utilities, different modes of transfer over the network and
so forth.
Any useful tool that accepts standard input could process the image.
Here are some examples.
</p><p>
To back up a compressed image, do:</p><pre     class="programlisting">ntfsclone --save-image --output - /dev/hda1 | gzip \
 -c &gt;ntfs.img.gz</pre><p>
The image is sent to standard output by the -output flag with the
argument of a single dash.  The gzip utility compresses it, then redirects
the stream to overwrite or create the file ntfs.img.gz.
</p><p>
To back up the image to a remote computer, do:</p><pre     class="programlisting">ntfsclone --save-image -o - /dev/hda1 | ssh \
backups@storage.mydomain.org \
"dd of/home/backups/windows/images/ntfs.img"</pre><p>
Here, the flag for --output is shortened to its single-letter
abbreviation.  It is sent to standard output.  This, in turn, is piped into
the ssh program.  The stream is sent over the network to a computer named
storage under the care of a user named backups and stored in its
proper place through the dd command.
</p><p>
Here is another example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">wget ftp://storage.mydomain.org/home/backups/
&#8618;windows/images/ntfs.img.gz \
-O - |  gunzip | tee /usr/local/backup/ntfs.img | \
ntfsclone --restore-image --overwrite /dev/hda1 -</pre><p>
This could be a line taken directly from a cloning script, because it needs
no password or other user input.  It uses wget to download the compressed
image, uses gunzip to unzip it, and then splits the data stream with the
tee command, so that a backup copy of the image is stored in the Linux
partition at the same time that it is redirected to the NT partition on
/dev/hda1.  This assumes that storage.mydomain.org has a functioning
anonymous FTP d&aelig;mon.  Other possible ways of downloading without user
input would be to use wget with Apache or to set up encryption keys to
use with SSH.  Again the possibilities are limited only by the incredible
number of tools available.
</p><p>
Another useful tool in the ntfsprogs package is
ntfsresize.  This does
exactly what it advertises.  It shrinks or expands an NT filesystem.  It
operates on filesystems occupying partitions, but it also resizes filesystems that have been stored as single files by ntfsclone.
</p><p>
Note that ntfsresize doesn't change partition tables,
it changes only the NT filesystem inside the partition.  Changing the
partition table is a job for fdisk or sfdisk.
</p><p>
This article does not cover how to partition a disk.  A detailed and
cautious description of how to free space on a drive occupied entirely
by a single NT filesystem could take an article at least as long
as this one.  The operation itself doesn't take long, but it is a bit
dangerous.  Carelessness, or even bad luck, could result in a computer
that refuses to boot.  Given this, and given that the workaround of an
extra hard drive costs almost the same as a tank of gas, this article
continues to assume that partitioning already has been done.
</p><p>
Suppose, however, that the NT partition is just a little too small for
the NT filesystem.  This can happen, for example, if you don't account
for the need of most partitioning tools to round down to a nearby sector,
or if you replaced a defective drive with one having the same advertised
size but with a different geometry.
</p><p>
The ntfsclone utility will work just fine on a partition that is too
big, but it refuses to fit into a space that is even the slightest bit
too small.
</p><p>
In that case, the ntfsresize tool can come to the rescue.  To figure
out how much space you could shrink out of your NT filesystem, type
the command that follows (from the directory containing ntfs.img):</p><pre     class="programlisting">ntfsresize --info ntfs.img</pre><p>
The software will report something like the following:</p><pre     class="programlisting">ntfsresize v1.11.2
Device name        : ntfs.img
NTFS volume version: 3.1
Cluster size       : 4096 bytes
Current volume size: 90009203200 bytes (90010 MB)
Current device size: 90009203200 bytes (90010 MB)
Checking filesystem consistency ...
100.00 percent completed
Accounting clusters ...
Space in use       : 6508 MB (7.2%)
Collecting resizing constraints ...
You might resize at 6507421696 bytes or 6508 MB
(freeing 83502 MB). Please make a test run using both
the -n and -s options before real resizing!</pre><p>
This reports that you could shrink your filesystem down to as little as
6,508MB.  Windows probably wouldn't run if you reduced it to the minimum
size; it would be smart to leave a little room for future growth anyway.
Note that the software advises that you could make a &ldquo;test run using
both the -n and -s options&rdquo;.  Instead, you simply could keep a backup
copy in a safe place in case something goes wrong.  Or, you could do both.
Shrinking the filesystem to 10,000MB requires the following command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">ntfsresize --size=10000M ntfs.img</pre><p>
This produces a great deal of feedback, including the following:</p><pre     class="programlisting">100.00 percent completed
Updating $BadClust file ...
Updating $Bitmap file ...
Updating Boot record ...
Syncing device ...
Successfully resized NTFS on device 'ntfs.img'.</pre><p>
This should create an NT filesystem small enough to fit into its
designated partition.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
The NTFS tools may not be a requirement for everyone wanting a secure
Windows workstation, but they do make life a lot easier.
</p><p>
In the context of a single dual-boot computer, complete backups can be
performed to a safe, non-NTFS partition, either on the same hard drive,
or even onto a removable hard drive of sufficient capacity.  This may not
make the effort worthwhile for everyone.  However, for the user already
equipped with a dual-boot system, the tools for greatly enhanced security
may already be installed.
</p><p>
For a network administrator in charge of many Windows workstations, the
potential is even greater.  Dual-boot computers can be equipped with a
shared disk partition (see Kevin Farnham's article &ldquo;The Ultimate Linux/Windows
System&rdquo; in the June 2006 issue of <i  >Linux Journal</i>).  If GRUB is installed in this shared partition,
along with alternate menu files, scripts can be written that reboot the
computer into runlevels that automatically restore the Windows image,
update it and so on.
</p><p>
Windows and Linux may be competitors in many areas.  However, one of
the great strengths of Linux is its open nature and the versatility of
its command-line tools.  The Linux-NTFS tools open up a conversation
with the NT filesystem that, because of its one-way nature, makes for
ideal security.
