Screen the unwanted results out of your access log searches.

Last month, we started exploring how you can use a shell script to
extract and analyze the HTTP_REFERER values out of your Web server log
and identify the most common terms and phrases that people used to find
your pages.  Sounds useful, doesn't it?
</p><p>
The problem is, the script is more nuanced than
it initially seems.  Last
month, we wrapped up with the following shell script:</p><pre     class="programlisting">#!/bin/sh

ACCESSLOG="/var/logs/httpd.logs/access_log"

grep 'google.com/search' $ACCESSLOG | \
  awk '{print $11}' | \
  cut -d\? -f2 | cut -d\&amp; -f1 | \
  sed 's/+/ /g;s/%22/"/g;s/q=//' | \
  sort | \
  uniq -c | \
  sort -rn | \
  head -5</pre><p>
When I run this, here's what I see:</p><pre     class="programlisting">$ sh google-searches.sh
  94 hl=en
  18 client=safari
   6 client=firefox-a
   4 sourceid=navclient
   4 client=opera</pre><p>
That's weird, because it's not search terms, it's other variables that are
included with search strings sent from sites like Google
(<tt  >hl=en</tt> says that
you've constrained searches to English-language sites only,
<tt  >client=safari</tt> identifies the user's Web browser as Apple's Safari and so on).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10b3580.0x11ab710"></a>
Screening Out False Matches</h2></div></div><p>
The problem is revealed when we look at the first ten matches rather
than only the first five:</p><pre     class="programlisting">$ sh google-searches.sh | head -10
  94 hl=en
  18 client=safari
   6 client=firefox-a
   4 sourceid=navclient
   4 client=opera
   3 wicked cool scripts
   3 hl=zh-CN
   2 num=100
   2 hs=wNy
   2 barbara nelson%2Bpurses</pre><p>
Ah, so we can see that there are two valid searches here, one for &ldquo;wicked
cool scripts&rdquo; and one for &ldquo;Barbara nelson%2Bpurses&rdquo;.  Not sure what the
latter one's about, but it's useful and important to see.  Fortunately,
screening out the bogus matches is as simple as using grep to remove
fields that include an equal sign: <tt  >grep -v '='</tt>.
</p><p>
Rather than have that at the very end of the long pipe in the script,
however, I'll place it immediately after the sed invocation to strip
out false results as soon as possible in the pipeline to speed up the
entire script.  Now it looks like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">grep 'google.com/search' $ACCESSLOG | \
  awk '{print $11}' | \
  cut -d\? -f2 | cut -d\&amp; -f1 | \
  sed 's/+/ /g;s/%22/"/g;s/q=//' | \
  grep -v '=' | \
  sort | \
  uniq -c | \
  sort -rn</pre><p>
Notice that the sed statement itself strips out the name= part of the
search (<tt  >q=</tt>), so that it's not incorrectly matched in the new
grep statement.
</p><p>
Now we have the results we want:</p><pre     class="programlisting">$ sh google-searches.sh | head -10
   3 wicked cool scripts
   2 barbara nelson%2Bpurses
   1 wsj%20password
   1 why did animal kingdom introduce expedition everest
   1 what makes a great speaker%3F
   1 university of phoenix center of writing excellence
   1 ubuntu x problem
   1 triboot osx ubuntu ydl
   1 the best dvd players
   1 symbol html heart</pre><p>
This site doesn't get a huge amount of traffic, so let's run the very
same script against my far-busier AskDaveTaylor.com site.  The results
are more interesting:</p><pre     class="programlisting">$ sh google-searches.sh | head -10
   5 standalone player
   4 psp help
   4 create a myspace
   4 Documents and Settings"
   4 %24NtUninstall
   3 view myspace accounts that are set to private
   3 i cant hear music on runescape
   2 transfer files to psp
   2 sync v3 motorola mac
   2 running unix in windows xp</pre><p>
Much more interesting.  Oh, and if you want to know how many searches
you're exploring, it's another simple tweak to the script, an invocation
of wc:</p><pre     class="programlisting">$ sh google-searches.sh | wc -l
     501</pre><p>
So out of 501 searches, the single-most common search is &ldquo;standalone
player&rdquo;, which represents only five out of 500, or 1% of my search traffic.

Stripping Out Unwanted Characters</h2></div></div><p>
One more step before we walk away from this script for the month: let's
get rid of the strange characters that have been carried over from the
original URL encoding of the user's Web browser.  What am I talking about?
The %24, the closing double quote in Documents and Settings and the
%2B in the earlier search for purses.
</p><p>
You can figure out all the mappings and convert everything as appropriate,
but I'm lazy at the end of the day and will instead simply find all
%xx sequences and replace them with a single space.
</p><p>
This sounds hard, but it's a perfect job for sed because it allows
you to do pattern matching and then replace the matched material with
whatever else you desire.  Here's how I'd do that:</p><pre     class="programlisting">sed 's/%[0-9a-fA-F][0-9a-fA-F]/ /g'</pre><p>
Let's look at this closely before you panic.  A set separated by square
brackets is a set in regular expression terminology, so [0-9] will match
any of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 0.  It turns out that URL encoding
uses hexadecimal, so not only can the values be 0-9, but they can also
be A, B, C, D, E and F, in upper- or lowercase letters&mdash;hence 0-9 and
a-f and A-F in the pattern.  The overall pattern form is % followed by
any of these possible values, followed by any of these possible values
again.  Now you can see the full pattern.
</p><p>
Finally, before we beat this completely into the ground, note that the bigger
structure here in the sed statement is s/old/new/g, which replaces old
with new throughout the line, whether it occurs once or 15 times.
</p><p>
We're not quite done yet, however, because we also need to strip the
stray double quotes.  Again, this is easily added to the sed statement:</p><pre     class="programlisting">sed 's/%[0-9a-fA-F][0-9a-fA-F]/ /g;s/"//g'</pre><p>
Here's the final script:</p><pre     class="programlisting">grep 'google.com/search' $ACCESSLOG | \
  awk '{print $11}' | \
  cut -d\? -f2 | cut -d\&amp; -f1 | \
  sed 's/+/ /g;s/%22/"/g;s/q=//' | \
  sed 's/%[0-9a-fA-F][0-9a-fA-F]/ /g;s/"//g' | \
  grep -v '=' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn</pre><p>
And, the final results:</p><pre     class="programlisting">$ sh google-searches.sh | head -15
   6  NtUninstall
   5 standalone player
   4 psp music
   4 psp help
   4 creat a myspace
   4 Documents and Settings
   3 view myspace accounts that are set to private
   3 i cant hear music on runescape
   2 transfer files to psp
   2 sync v3 motorola mac
   2 running unix in windows xp
   2 rss feed reader shell
   2 reinstall windows xp hp
   2 psp transfer music
   2 psp internet</pre><p>
Note that once we remove the stray material, things organize slightly
differently (for example, here you can see that psp music is one of
the top searches, but earlier we had different variations of psp music,
and it didn't make it to a top search value).
</p><p>
Okay, enough torturing of the Apache log file.  Let's wrap this up and
we'll switch to something completely different in the next column!
