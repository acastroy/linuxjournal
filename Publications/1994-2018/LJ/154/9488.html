Hey there sweeties, I'm Laverta Voyd, and my husband Chester picked some
tips for y'all.  Like I says last time, Chester ain't no talker, so I'm
here to do the writin'.  Now, I knows you ain't had much time to send
in tips since last month, but we can't be doing this service for all
you sweethearts out there without your help.  So send in a tip, honey,
so we can keep this steamboat rolling.  Chester and me, we want this to
keep afloat.  We can use the money for hosting this here column, and
you won't make out so bad yourself.  This mag will send you $100 for
every tip you give us.  So get the lead out of them undies of yours and
send in some tech stuff Chester can use.  He'll pick 'em and I'll sort
it all out for him.  In the meantime, we got that dear editor to stick
in another tip, and we got a goodie from ol' Paddy.  So here's y'are.

Recover a MySQL Table with Zmanda Recovery Manager</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>
Somebody dropped a MySQL table.  Duh.  Fire your DBA.  If you can't fire the
DBA, then this tip helps.
&mdash;Chester</em></span>
</p><p>
You are a MySQL database administrator.  You take regular backups of your MySQL
database.  Somebody drops a table critical to the MySQL application (for
example, the &ldquo;accounts&rdquo; table in a SugarCRM application).  The MySQL application
no longer works.  How can you recover from the situation?
</p><p>
The answer is MySQL binary logs.  Binary logs track all updates to the
database with minimal impact on database performance.  MySQL binary logs
have to be enabled on the server.  You can use the mysqlbinlog MySQL command
to recover from the binary logs.
</p><p>
A better and more comprehensive solution is to use the Zmanda Recovery Manager
(ZRM) for MySQL (MySQL backup and recovery manager).  The mysql-zrm tool
allows users to browse the binary logs and selectively
restore the database from incremental backups:</p><pre     class="programlisting"># mysql-zrm --action parse-binlogs   --source-directory=/var/lib
/mysql/sugarcrm/20060915101613
Log filename                 | Log Position | Timestamp          | Event Type | Event

/var/lib/mysql/my-bin.000015 | 11013          | 06-09-12 06:20:03 | Xid = 4413 | COMMIT;
/var/lib/mysql/my-bin.000015 | 11159          | 06-09-12 06:20:03 | Query      | DROP TABLE IF EXISTS `accounts`;</pre><p>
Here we're doing selective recovery for incremental backups without the DROP
customer table from the SugarCRM database.  Do two selective restore
commands to restore from the incremental backup done on Sept 15, 2006,
without executing the database event DROP TABLE at log position 11159:</p><pre     class="programlisting"># mysql-zrm --action restore  --backup-set sugarcrm \
   --source-directory=/var/lib/mysql/ sugarcrm/20060915101613/ \
   --stop-position 11014

# mysql-zrm --action restore   --backup-set sugarcrm \
   --source-directory=/var/lib/mysql/ sugarcrm/20060915101613/ \
   --start-position 11160</pre><p>

Hedge Your Upgrade Bets by Using Partimage, Even on AMD64</h2></div></div><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
Sometimes it don't make sense to assume upgrades are a good thing.  Run
partimage to save an image of your old version first.  If the new distro
version don't work, you can run partimage to put the old one
back.
&mdash;Chester</em></span>
</p><p>
I run multiple distros for various reasons.  For example, I run 32-bit
Kubuntu and 64-bit Kubuntu.  I spend most of my time using 64-bit Kubuntu,
but some packages are easier to set up and use on 32-bit
Kubuntu, like Skype, for instance.
</p><p>
I recently decided to upgrade my 32-bit Kubuntu from Dapper to Edgy.
Whenever you upgrade, you run the risk of
breaking some existing programs.
So I usually boot to another distribution and use partimage to save
an image of the partition with the distribution I'm about to upgrade.
If the upgrade doesn't go well, I always can use partimage to restore
the partition to its previous state.  There are many other reasons why
you might want to save partition images, so you'll find this procedure
useful even if you don't share my motivation.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Running Partimage on 64-bit Kubuntu
AMD64</b></span>
</p><p>
Partimage is finicky and refuses to run on a 64-bit system.  For reasons
beyond my knowledge, there is a partimage package you can install for
Kubuntu AMD64, but it won't run.  In my case, I want to boot to Kubuntu
AMD64 and use partimage to save my 32-bit installation of Kubuntu, so
the fact that partimage for Kubuntu AMD64 doesn't work is a major problem.
</p><p>
Or is it? It's actually quite easy to get partimage working on
Kubuntu AMD64.  Simply download the static binary form of partimage
from <a href="http://www.partimage.org" target="_self">www.partimage.org</a>.  Untar the binaries partimage and partimaged
into /usr/sbin.  These binaries should work fine even under AMD64.
You should be able to type the command <tt  >partimage</tt> at a root prompt to
get it running.  One would think it would be necessary to precede the
command with <tt  >linux32</tt>, but it works without it.
</p><p>
You should check to see if you have a /dev/dm inode before you use
partimage.  If you don't, you will be greeted with a screen like the one
shown
in Figure 1.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9488f1.large.jpg"><img src="9488f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Partimage wants the /dev/dm inode created.
</p></div></div><p>
If nothing seems to happen when you press OK, partimage may not be able
to create /dev/dm for you.  Sometimes you can get past this screen by
pressing OK several times, and partimage will work even if it doesn't
create /dev/dm.  Why take chances, though? Don't even start partimage
until you create /dev/dm yourself with this command (assuming it's not
already there):</p><pre     class="programlisting"># mknod -m 644 /dev/dm b 240 0</pre><p>
Now start partimage.  Select the partition you want to save.  In my
case, this is partition /dev/sdb8.  Then, enter a full path to the file
where you want to store the image.  I like to include the distro type,
filesystem type and partition in the filename so I can remember
why I created the partition image.  The filename I used in this case
is dapper32-ext3-sdb8.img.  See Figure 2 for the example.  The path
/storage/disk/images points to a partition where I have lots of extra
disk space for saving partition images.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9488f2.large.jpg"><img src="9488f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Save the image with a descriptive filename.
</p></div></div><p>
Press function key F5 to continue.  I use the default compression method,
gzip, as it is much faster.  If you are tight on disk space and don't
mind waiting, you can choose bzip2 for the compression method.  Partimage
will check the partition and let you enter a description by default.  I
usually uncheck the description feature because the description is in
the filename, but you may want to use the feature.  Uncheck the feature
by using the arrow keys to highlight it, and then press the spacebar to
toggle to unchecked.  You can see the screen with my choices in Figure 3.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9488f3.large.jpg"><img src="9488f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. You can uncheck the description if you use a descriptive
filename.
</p></div></div><p>
Press F5 to continue.  Partimage should get busy checking the
filesystem.  Partimage can be flaky and sometimes reports errors that do
not exist.  If you have this problem, check the partition manually (with
fsck.ext3, for example), and then uncheck the option to have partimage do
it for you.  If everything went well, you should see a screen something
like the one shown in Figure 4.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9488f4.large.jpg"><img src="9488f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Partimage is ready to create an image for you.
</p></div></div><p>
Press Enter, and partimage will create one or more compressed image
files of the partition.  The rest of the process is self-explanatory.
</p><p>
Note that partimage adds numbers to your filename, because it prepares
to split up the image into multiple files if necessary.  Even if
it needs only a single file, it will change the above filename to
dapper32-ext3-sdb8.img.000.
</p><p>
It's now safe to boot into 32-bit Dapper and upgrade 32-bit Dapper to
32-bit Edgy.  If everything works, you're in business.
</p><p>
If you run into problems and feel like you need to downgrade back to
Dapper, all you have to do is boot back into 64-bit Kubuntu (or whatever
other distro you were using) and run partimage again.  This time,
highlight the partition, type the same image filename (remember to add
.000 to the name), but use the arrow keys to select Restore partition
from an image file, and press the spacebar to select it.  See Figure
5 for an example.  Press F5 and the rest of the process should be
self-explanatory.  If partimage created multiple files ending in .000,
.001 and so on, you don't have to worry about specifying them all.  It
will find the extra image files and restore them automatically.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9488f5.large.jpg"><img src="9488f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. Restore the image to the partition.
</p></div></div><p>
Partimage works with many filesystems, but some of them have only beta
support.  Use partimage with filesystems like JFS with caution.  It has
worked for me, but that doesn't mean it will work for you.  If you want
to save and restore XFS filesystems, you should bypass partimage and
use the XFS utilities xfsdump and xfsrestore, designed for saving and
restoring partitions.
