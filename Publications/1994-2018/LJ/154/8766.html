SELinux does not have to be as hard to manage as many people may think.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1867580.0x195f240"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Modern Linux distributions ship with a plethora of security features and
tools, and one of the most important features added to
the kernel has been the inclusion of SELinux.
</p><p>
SELinux solves one the most challenging problems in security.  How to
control trusted users or processes.  Trusted users, such as root in the *nix
domain, have unlimited and unrestricted access to a system.  They
should have, as this account is supposed to be used only by the
system administrator; however, this leads to a problem.  What happens if
the root account itself gets hacked, leaving the hacker with complete
control of the system.  Malicious users are not the only problem;
misconfiguration of a security tool, such as iptables, can have
a profound effect as well.  Besides this, imagine a security vulnerability
is discovered for a service you deployed on your server, and no patch is
made available in a timely manner.  In this case, your system is
vulnerable.  SELinux secures Linux systems from these sorts of security
issues by implementing mandatory access controls (MACs) in the Linux
kernel.  SELinux is based on the Flask security architecture.
Discussion of the Flask architecture is avoided in this article, as
excellent documentation about it is easily available on the Internet.
</p><p>
To understand mandatory access control, we must go through the currently
deployed security model called discretionary access control (DAC).  In a
DAC system, access to objects is restricted based on their
classifications.  This type of control is discretionary in the sense that
a subject with a certain set of access permissions is capable of passing
those permissions on to another subject.  For example, any program you
run while logged on as a certain user has the same access rights that you
have.  Rights are set by another user (for example, root).
</p><p>
Any particular permission (read, write, execute and so on) can be thought of
as a two-dimensional graph with users on one axis and objects on
another.  In essence, DAC systems check the validity of credentials
presented to them against stored information.
</p><p>
As mentioned, the SELinux security model is mandatory access control, or
MAC.  This controls access in a different manner.  Whereas DAC security
models are authentication-based, MAC systems rely on authorization, not
only of users but also of each object loaded by the system.
</p><p>
A MAC system controls objects individually and makes decisions on the
rights and/or permissions of objects based on a security policy, which
can define what rights the object should be accorded, based on different
variables.
</p><p>
An example of how discretionary versus mandatory access control styles
could affect the operation of a computer is a Python script.  If
the script allows an external entity to insert and execute malicious
code on a computer system under a DAC system, the malicious code now has
the same access rights as the code that executed it&mdash;the Python script.
</p><p>
A MAC system can restrict the rights of a certain process to only the
resources needed for normal operation.  A Python script may create a
process (or it may be forbidden), but that process might not have the
same set of permissions as the process that created it.
Thus, the MAC approach is seen as secure.

A Brief Look at SELinux Internals</h2></div></div><p>
In SELinux, the security policy configuration is defined in a text file
written in the m4 language.  It is compiled when the security policy is
finalized and, at boot time, loaded into the memory.  Only the security
server can make policy decisions on the permissions of an object.
</p><p>
Security policy enforcement is done by components called object
managers, which receive requests from client objects, submit queries
to the security server and enforce the resulting decisions.
</p><p>
The SELinux implementation of the security server uses a combination of
two security paradigms, called Type Enforcement (TE) and Role-Based
Access Control (RBAC).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1867580.0x195f768"></a>
Type Enforcement</h2></div></div><p>
Type Enforcement makes security decisions based on what kind of object
requests the permissions.  For example, object types could include a
regular file, a directory, a process or a socket.  Type enforcement is an
object labeling system that, combined with access mapping (from the
domain of the object requesting permission and to the type of the
object requested), returns a decision that defines the permissible
actions of the object.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1867580.0x195f870"></a>
Role-Based Access Control</h2></div></div><p>
Role-based access control assigns permissions to objects in a
computer system based on the role they play within that system.  In
practice, this means a process would have its permissions based on
its parent process, the user logged on at the time and any number of
other variables.
</p><p>
How processes, filesystem objects and sockets communicate with each
other is defined by the security policy.  In particular, the security
policy governs how different types and roles may interact, along with
any specific rules.
</p><p>
At present, SELinux provides binary compatibility with existing
applications and source compatibility with kernel modules.  The current
implementation of SELinux is x86-specific.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1867580.0x195fa28"></a>
Getting and Installing SELinux</h2></div></div><p>
SELinux is included in many distributions nowadays, and even if it does not
come with the main distribution, distribution-specific packages usually are
available for popular distributions.
The sources for SELinux are available from
<a href="http://www.nsa.gov/selinux/code/download0.cfm" target="_self">www.nsa.gov/selinux/code/download0.cfm</a>.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1867580.0x195fb88"></a>
Installation of seedit</h2></div></div><p>
seedit is a user-friendly Webmin-based tool that enables an
administrator to administer SELinux policies from a Web browser.  The seedit
Webmin interface allows users to perform every action they can
normally perform by writing manual scripts in m4 in a point-and-click
environment.
</p><p>
seedit is available from <a href="http://seedit.sourceforge.net" target="_self">seedit.sourceforge.net</a>.
</p><p>
Once installed, the SELinux policy is located in
$SELINUX/(seedit-something)/policy/policy.conf (where $SELINUX is the
root directory of your SELinux installation&mdash;usually it is /etc/selinux/).
</p><p>
Let's familiarize ourselves with the seedit interface.
Fire up a browser, point it to http://localhost:10000 and go to
the System&rarr;SELinux Configuration section.
</p><p>
You will see six icons labeled configure ACLs, define domain transitions,
define relationship between users and roles, create new domain/roles,
delete domains/roles and update configuration.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1867580.0x195fe48"></a>
Configure ACLs</h2></div></div><p>
Here you can define virtually all access control to
nearly every object in the system.  This includes allowing/disallowing
read, write or executable files to entire directories or individual
files and allowing/disallowing access to networking capabilities.  In
this section, you also can define ports in which the specific application
can work.  Let's say we assign port 80 to Apache; if it is started to
work on port 81, SELinux terminates this process.
</p><p>
IPC access control can be defined in this section also.  You can define what
kind of IPC mechanism this particular application can use and
with which applications the particular application can communicate.
</p><p>
Other access controls that can be defined in this section include
various administrative access controls, such as kernel communication
privileges, SELinux operations, process information retrieval and so forth.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1867580.0x1960000"></a>
Defining Domain Transitions</h2></div></div><p>
In the domain transaction section, you can define which processes can spawn the
current application&mdash;for example, by default, the seedit policy defines
this domain transition for MySQL: kernel&rarr;init&rarr;mysqld.  This means the
kernel can start init, and init in turn can launch the MySQL d&aelig;mon.  If
the application has a d&aelig;mon associated with it, domain transitions should
be defined or the d&aelig;mon will never be able to start.
</p><p>
So in this section, the user can define domain transition, alter
existing ones or remove them altogether.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1867580.0x1960160"></a>
Define Relationship between Roles and Users</h2></div></div><p>
Roles are privileges that an object (like users) can have on a system.  For
example,
there may be a role that allows access to all files in the system.
Thus, in this section, users can associate roles with specific users on
the system.
</p><p>
The next two sections are self-explanatory.  They allow you to define a
new domain/role and remove a domain/role.  Defining a domain/role is
the first step when adding access control rules for a new application or
user.
</p><p>
The last section is the update configuration section; it allows the user
to update the policy and recompile it and load it.
</p><p>
seedit comes with a plethora of predefined policies, which cover every
popular server/d&aelig;mon in a Linux system&mdash;from the kernel to the
MySQL d&aelig;mon.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1867580.0x1960370"></a>
Defining a New Policy for a D&aelig;mon Application</h2></div></div><p>
Defining an SELinux policy for a d&aelig;mon is an iterative process.
The first step is to &ldquo;register&rdquo; the d&aelig;mon with SELinux, by declaring a
domain/role in the seedit Webmin interface.  This is done in the
Add Domain/role section discussed previously.  The convention is
that domains should end with a _t, and role definitions should end
with an _r.  So, there could be a role, such as admin_r, and a domain, such
as
mysqld_t.
</p><p>
Defining domain transitions is another important step.  Here you have to
allow the parent processes of the d&aelig;mon to spawn the concerned
d&aelig;mon.
Usually if the d&aelig;mon activates at startup, you need to define a
domain transition from init to the concerned d&aelig;mon.
</p><p>
Define the initial access control list for the d&aelig;mon.  Now, it is not
possible for the user to define an exhaustive ACL for the d&aelig;mon when it
is initially installed, rather what is usually done is that an initial
ACL list is defined, which is very restrictive.  Every time the
application tries to access an object and is not allowed to do so, an
access violation message occurs; such messages can be accessed from
/var/log/messages.  As you use the d&aelig;mon, SELinux will report some
violations.  Considering that the d&aelig;mon for which we are trying to write
rules is called foobar, the violation messages will look like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">|avc: denied { write } for pid=7279 exe=/usr/bin/foobar comm=ifup
name=dhclient-eth0.conf dev=hda12 ino=57400
scontext=system_u:system_r:foobar_t tcontext=system_u:object_r:etc_t
tclass=file</pre><p>
This violation states that a write attempt was made to the file
dhclient-eth0.conf by our application.  This violation can be removed by
giving the application write access to the dhclient-eth0.conf file.
This violation can be addressed by going to the Configure ACL section
of the seedit Webmin interface, under the File ACL section, and then
browsing to the place where this file exists, and giving the application
foobar write access to it.
</p><p>
Another violation might look like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">|avc: denied { create } for pid=7279 exe=/usr/bin/foobar
scontext=root:system_r:foobar_t tcontext=root:system_r:foobar_t\
tclass=udp_socket</pre><p>
This violation reports that the application tried to create a UDP
socket and was denied.  To remove this violation, we
can simply add networking features to the access control of the foobar_t
domain.  This can be addressed by going to the Configure ACL section
and in the Network ACL section, selecting Allow Network for the domain
foobar_t.
</p><p>
All access violations can be addressed in the Configure ACL section of
the seedit Webmin interface.
</p><p>
After every policy update, reload it via the Update Policy
option in the seedit Webmin interface and restart the d&aelig;mon.  As
other violations occur, update it again and so on, until you get nearly
no violation messages.
</p><p>
There are other ways to generate access rules for an application with
the help of audit2allow tool.  But using it can lead to general rules,
which can lead to security problems.  You always can refine the rules
the tool generates, however.
</p><p>
When creating or updating policies, make sure you have set your SELinux installation to permissive mode.  SELinux has three modes:
enforcing, disabled and permissive.  In enforcing mode, all access
controls are enforced according to the defined policy.  In permissive
mode, the policy is not enforced; however, violation messages are shown
when any violation to the policy occurs.  Disabled mode completely disables
SELinux.
