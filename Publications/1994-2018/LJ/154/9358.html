Smooth Migration to Linux by delivering Windows to Linux clients via
Win4Lin VDS.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26f1580.0x27e9298"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Win4Lin Virtual Desktop Server (<a href="http://www.win4lin.com" target="_self">www.win4lin.com</a>) is a client/server virtualization solution
that can be used to migrate an organization from an expensive and
high-maintenance Windows infrastructure to a more robust and sleeker Linux
base gently.  How? A single copy of Windows can be delivered directly to multiple
users' desktops with the click of a mouse.  You don't want your users to
have a full Windows desktop? No problem.  Virtual Desktop Server (VDS)
can be configured to deliver a single application to the Linux desktop
instead.  Given its flexibility, it's not surprising that the reasons
for using VDS to move to a Linux infrastructure are equally as varied.
</p><p>
Linux server requirements are generally lower than those of Windows
servers.  Therefore, Win4Lin VDS can be used to break the hardware upgrade
cycle.  With Vista on the horizon, many organizations are faced with
potentially costly hardware upgrades in the next few years.
</p><p>
Although arguments can be made on either side of the Total Cost of Ownership
(TCO) issue, organizations that have come to the conclusion
that Linux offers a lower TCO are then faced with the technical and
logistical burdens of migrating their infrastructure.  VDS allows the
baseline software swap to occur while still allowing employees to continue
using their familiar Windows environment and applications.
</p><p>
VDS offers organizations indefinite breathing
room.  Once the OS
baseline has been swapped out, organizations can choose to remain in the
Linux/Windows VM posture, or they can carry on with the business
of sourcing or porting Linux solutions to their functional applications.
</p><p>
VDS offers &ldquo;single application&rdquo; deployment to the desktop, meaning that
single mission-critical apps need not ever be ported.  Single Windows
applications can be launched right into the client Linux desktop.
</p><p>
Aside from the infrastructure questions, running a VDS server allows for
a centralized point of management, upgrades and maintenance.  Because all
clients are being served the same Windows image, single changes on the
server end mean rapid organization-wide change.
</p><p>
Existing Windows licenses can continue to be used under their respective
terms.
</p><p>
VDS is different from a lot of client/server virtual
machine (VM) solutions on the market.  Most VM server products simply
provide a remote display to the client, whereas VDS provides a proper
client/server X Window System display to the client.  If the client cannot
support X Protocol messages, the alternative &ldquo;display&rdquo; methods can
be used via traditional Virtual Network Connection or Tarantella, which
really opens up the door for pretty much any client with a recent Web
browser installed on it.
</p><p>
One of the main tasks for many Windows administrators is keeping Windows
patched and updated in order to protect clients from the many spyware and
malware attacks perpetrated against hapless Windows machines on a daily
basis.  As mentioned, VDS offers a single instance of
Windows to patch and upgrade, which not only takes less time, but also offers
more simplicity than staging patches throughout the organization.  Further,
because the end users' environment is a product of a combination of the
master Windows image and their own locally stored settings, simply logging
off and logging back in refreshes their session with the master image
and thus eliminates any running malware or spyware in their session.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26f1580.0x27e9768"></a>
Clients</h2></div></div><p>
Win4Lin recommends using the native Win4Lin Terminal Services Client in
order to make use of all the advanced functionality a native Win4Lin
client/server connection offers.  However, there are a plethora of ways
to connect to a VDS server, and unless you're desperately in need of
seamless printing, almost any client will get the job done.
</p><p>
Connection to a VDS server is possible with Telnet, rlogin or SSH (with
X11 forwarding enabled).  For Telnet and rlogin, the {$DISPLAY} environment
variable must be set correctly.  In general, the remote login options
are suitable only for high-speed environments, such as local LANs.  WAN and
consumer-grade high-speed Internet connections do not generally provide
enough bandwidth to use these methods.  Connections also are possible
using the RealVNC client, the NoMachine client and Tarantella.
</p><p>
In short, if you can't find a way to connect to the VDS, you're
simply not trying.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26f1580.0x27e9920"></a>
Licensing</h2></div></div><p>
A base license starts at $2,500 US for 25 seats.  Bump licenses can
be obtained in various increments to enable VDS to handle up to 1,000
users.  Whether your server can handle 1,000 users is up to you to
decide.  It's important to note that these are licenses for VDS and
not for Windows.  Organizations will have to provide their own Windows
licenses under Microsoft's conditions.  In most cases, however, existing
licenses can be used.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26f1580.0x27e9a28"></a>
Download and Installation</h2></div></div><p>
The current version of Win4Lin VDS is 3.0, but 3.5
is in tail-end beta and probably will be released before this article
goes to print.  Because it doesn't make a whole lot of sense to write an
article about a potentially moving target, we use the 3.0
stable version.
</p><p>
Win4Lin Pro and VDS are the same binary, but different
licenses unlock different functionality.  There are DEB and RPM packages
for 32- and 64-bit Linux.  The installation prompts for a license code,
and that's when the product turns into either Pro or VDS.
</p><p>
There is no upgrade path from Win4Lin Pro to Win4Lin VDS, so if you have
Pro installed, you'll have to relicense it with
a VDS license by using the ask_license.sh script.
</p><p>
VDS clients are available for Linux, Solaris and Windows, but the source
also is available for download, which allows moderately skilled Linux
users to compile a client for almost any platform.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26f1580.0x27e9c38"></a>
Install the Server</h2></div></div><p>
We downloaded our packages from the Win4Lin FTP site
(<a href="ftp://ftp.win4lin.com/pub/releases/linux/pro/3.0/index.html" target="_self">ftp.win4lin.com/pub/releases/linux/pro/3.0/index.html</a>).  There
are server packages available as 32- and 64-bit RPM, 32- and 64-bit DEB
and tarball.
</p><p>
We downloaded the 32-bit RPM package for our test platform, a Centrino Duo
Core running at 1.83GHz with 1GB of RAM running a beta of Edgy Eft.  We
ended up moving to SUSE 10.1 after the initial install, because Edgy's
&ldquo;edgy&rdquo; kernel had issues with the Win4Lin client.  Serves us right for
trying to use a beta release on our testing platform, and we've been
properly chastened.  I mention it only because some sharp-eyed readers
may be able to detect differing platforms in some of the screenshots.
</p><p>
The win4linpro_6.3.0-07_i386.deb package was only 3.7MB and installed
without a hitch.  The VDS installation manual advises that the toolchain
for supported distros must be installed prior to installing VDS.  The
reasoning behind this is that all Win4Lin products provide a specialized
KQEMU module in order to deliver satisfactory speed performance.  As long
as you've dutifully installed the toolchain, the building and insertion
of said module will be largely transparent to you (Figure 1).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9358f1.large.jpg"><img src="9358f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Building and Installing the Modules
</p></div></div><p>
Now it's time to install my single Windows instance.  We used Windows XP
Home, installed it and allowed it to upgrade itself to service pack 2
before provisioning accounts.  To do so, we put our Windows XP CD into
the drive and ran the command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">sudo loadwinproCD</pre><p>
If you haven't installed your VDS license yet, you
will be prompted to do so at this time.  You can choose not to enter a
license at this time and use the product for 14 days, but none of the
server functionality will be enabled, effectively leaving you with a
single-user workstation.
</p><p>
In Figure 1, you will see that we had to use the -r switch
to load the guest media.  This is because our testing bench already had
Win4Lin Pro installed on it previously, and the loadwinproCD command
detected this.  The -r switch simply tells VDS to reload the guest media.
</p><p>
There are two steps to installing VDS.  First, the superuser must copy
the guest media to the hard disk, which is what loadwinproCD does.  The
next step is actually to install Windows, which is done under a normally
privileged user account.  The process of installing Windows and creating
the master profile, from which all other user accounts will derive their
Windows environment, are tightly coupled&mdash;so much so, in fact,
the entire next section is devoted to understanding the process.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26f1580.0x27ea210"></a>
Profile-Based Provisioning</h2></div></div><p>
Win4Lin VDS uses profile-based provisioning.  In a
nutshell, this means that a single master profile must be configured.  This
is the profile all other users will inherit from, and this is also
the only profile where patches, upgrades and applications need be installed
and other maintenances need be performed.  Once a master profile has been
configured as desired, individual user profiles are created for each
system user.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26f1580.0x27ea318"></a>
Create a Master Profile</h2></div></div><p>
VDS must be installed under a user account.  As with all infrastructure
decisions, a few moments spent now can save countless headaches
later.  I've decided to install my master profile under my main user
account jdw.  I've further decided that I'm going to provision two other
user accounts on my system named jwatson and dwatson.  My first step,
then, is to create the two jwatson and dwatson accounts.  Organizations
already running a Linux system quite likely have all of their
user accounts set up and may be required to create only an account for
the master VDS profile.
</p><p>
To create the master profile, first I log in to my system and run:</p><pre     class="programlisting">sudo adduser jwatson
sudo adduser dwatson</pre><p>
After assigning these new user account passwords, they are ready to
go.  Now it's time to create the master profile.  This involves installing Windows,
designating that installation as the master and then configuring it
as required.
</p><p>
So, I log out and back in as my master profile user jdw, and then run the
<tt  >installwinpro</tt> command.
</p><p>
Various options to this command dictate the characteristics
of the virtual machine into which Windows will be installed.  I
accept the defaults, which include a 4GB disk image size.  Depending
on the amount of applications you intend to install, 4GB may not
be enough.  There is no need to take user space into account, however,
because individual user's documents and settings are stored in the Linux
filesystem on a user's respective workstation and not within the image
(Figure 2).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9358f2.large.jpg"><img src="9358f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. User documents and folders are stored on the Linux filesystem.
</p></div></div><p>
The default profile name will be winpro unless you change it with the
-d switch.  Keep in mind that if you switch the configuration name, you
will need that information to export the master profile in the next step.
</p><p>
Take my word for this&mdash;back up your image now.  Living through one Windows
install is painful enough, you don't want to have to do it twice.
</p><p>
Backing up your image is as simple as copying the GUEST.IMG file to
another location.  If you took the default installation options, you'll
find the GUEST.IMG file in /home/jdw/winpro/ (obviously, you'll need
to substitute your own user name).  If you modified your installation,
you'll know where to find it.
</p><p>
Once installation is complete, designate this installation as the master
by running the command <tt  >/opt/win4linpro/bin/export-profile &lt;configuration
name&gt;</tt>.
</p><p>
If you changed the configuration name while installing the guest session
in the previous step, you need to provide that name in place
of &lt;configuration name&gt;.  If you didn't specify a configuration name,
the default winpro was used, and you need not supply it to export
the master profile.
</p><p>
Launch the image and customize it.
It is critical that you launch and shut down the image at least once
in order to create the master profile properly.  To launch the master
Windows profile, either double-click the Win4Lin icon on your desktop,
or run the command <tt  >winpro</tt> from the command line.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26f1580.0x27eaaa8"></a>
Customizing the Image</h2></div></div><p>
Because provisioned users will receive a fresh copy of the master image each
time they log in to the VDS, it's not critical that you fully customize
your image right away.  In theory, you can skip to creating your user
profiles right now and then come back and customize your master image
later.  In practice, however, there are a few reasons why you probably
should do it now:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Familiarity: it's quite likely that one of the reasons your organization
is using VDS to swap out the infrastructure is to minimize the impact
on users.  Therefore, common sense seems to say that every effort should
be made to provide users with the most familiar desktop and set of
applications possible.
</p></li><li><p>
Security: because users' sessions are refreshed with a copy of the
master image every time they log in to the VDS, it's easy to think that
security can take a back seat.  If the OS is refreshed back to the master
image at least daily, how much damage can spyware, malware or a virus
do? That's a good question, but consider what can happen if your master image
contains malware or a virus.  Lock it down, now (Figure 3).
</p></li><li><p>
Technical: the master profile cannot be running when any user profiles
are running.  Because you have to fire up the master profile in order to make
changes to it, failing to customize it now might mean a lot of off-hours
work in the near future&mdash;or significant work disruptions as all users
are forced to log off and stay off while the master image is worked on.
</p></li></ul></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9358f3.large.jpg"><img src="9358f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Update your Windows master image, but lock down a known good
state.
</p></div></div><p>
Now is probably a good time to take another backup of your image.  Every
time you make a change to the master profile, it's wise to create another
backup of the image.  Remember that if your image becomes corrupted, a whole lot of users won't be able to get their work done until
you've restored it.  It takes only a few minutes to copy a 4GB image back
to the master directory, but it takes a lot longer to re-install Windows
or bring an old image up to date.
</p><p>
The Win4Lin VDS service should start itself.  If it doesn't, or if you
need to restart it from some reason, you can do so with:
</p><pre     class="programlisting">/opt/win4linpro/etc/mergepro_rc start</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26f1580.0x2be3328"></a></h2></div></div><p>
or:</p><pre     class="programlisting">/opt/win4linpro/etc/mergepro_rc restart</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26f1580.0x2be3488"></a>
Create User Profiles</h2></div></div><p>
Only provisioned users will be able to use the master profile.  System
users that are not intended to use VDS need not be provisioned, but the
provisioning process must be done under each user's account.  If you
have only a few users, if might be quicker to <tt  >su</tt> to each user account and
run the import command manually.  If you have many users, however, some
clever bash scripting or log-on scripts might be in order to facilitate
the process.  In my example, this means I have to log in as both jwatson
and dwatson and run the following command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">/opt/win4linpro/bin/import-profile /home/jdw/winpro</pre><p>
The master profile has been created, and users have been provisioned.  The
bulk of the server work is done now, and any changes made to the master
profile from this point on (such as new applications being installed or
patches being applied) will propagate on down to provisioned users
each time they log on.
</p><p>
But, how will these users log on? It's time to install a client.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26f1580.0x2be36f0"></a>
Install the Client</h2></div></div><p>
As mentioned before, there are several ways to connect to a VDS.  I
look only at the Win4Lin client as it is free and easily attainable.
</p><p>
Using the native Win4Lin client against the VDS server provides
the best speed and feature set.  The Win4Lin client can be downloaded from
the Win4Lin site
(<a href="http://www.win4lin.com/component/option,com_repository/Itemid,76/func,fileinfo/id,2" target="_self">www.win4lin.com/component/option,com_repository/Itemid,76/func,fileinfo/id,2</a>) and comes in flavours for Linux, Solaris, Windows
and source.
</p><p>
Strangely, although the VDS itself is available in both DEB, RPM and a
tarball, the Linux client isn't available in DEB format.  Because installing
from source usually makes me lose my lunch, we're going to grab the RPM,
use alien to convert it to a DEB and then use dpkg to install it on a
Debian-based system.  Here are the steps:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Download the RPM from Win4Lin.
</p></li><li><p>
Run <tt  >sudo alien wtsclient_1.0.0-4_i386.rpm</tt>.
</p></li><li><p>
Run <tt  >sudo dpkg -i wtsclient_1.0.0-4_i386.deb</tt>.
</p></li><li><p>
Run the <tt  >wtsclient</tt> command to connect to the
server.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
The Win4Lin VDS can be configured to deliver a single application or
an entire Windows desktop.  We connected both configurations to the
Win4Lin demo server and provided two screenshots.  The first screenshot
shows an entire Windows desktop configuration, and the second shows only
Internet Explorer being delivered to our Linux desktop (Figures 4 and 5).

Delivering Single Applications to the Linux Desktop</h2></div></div><p>
So far, all we've covered is how to get a full Windows XP desktop
delivered to a Linux desktop.  Although that might be suitable for many
situations, there are others when users may require only a single Windows
application.  How can VDS be rigged to open up an application instead
of a full desktop? By tweaking the Windows registry, of course.  The
Win4Lin VDS manual is the best place to look for current
instructions on how to achieve this, but in the interests of sitting
down and getting it done with just this copy of <i  >Linux Journal</i>, now we provide
steps required to deliver a single application.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26f1580.0x2be4248"></a>
Ensure Correct Win4Lin Registry Key Value (All Versions of Windows)</h2></div></div><p>
Regardless of the application or the version of Windows being used,
a Win4Lin registry key must be set or verified first:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Open the regedit application.
</p></li><li><p>
Navigate to the HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows
NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon.
</p></li><li><p>
Ensure the Userinit variable reads exactly
<tt  >B:\mrgpro32.exe</tt>.  If the
value isn't exact, change it.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
It doesn't make a whole lot of sense to have users log in to Windows just
to run a single application.  Therefore, step one&mdash;although
optional&mdash;is to
set the master Windows profile to log in a user automatically.  Different
flavours of Windows have different provisions for allowing automatic
log in.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26f1580.0x2be4668"></a>
Set Autologin (Windows 2000)</h2></div></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Launch the Control Panel.
</p></li><li><p>
Launch the Users and Passwords applet.
</p></li><li><p>

</p></li></ol></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26f1580.0x2be4a30"></a>
Set Autologin (Windows XP)</h2></div></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Launch the Control Panel.
</p></li><li><p>
Launch the User Accounts category.
</p></li><li><p>

</p></li><li><p>
Uncheck the Use the Welcome screen check box.
</p></li><li><p>
Click Apply Options.
</p></li><li><p>
Launch the alternate user account editor by clicking Start&rarr;Run and
entering <tt  >control userpasswords2</tt>.  Click OK.
</p></li><li><p>
Uncheck the box that reads Users must enter a user name and password

</p></li><li><p>

</p></li></ol></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26f1580.0x2be5110"></a>
Designate the Single Application to Deliver (All Versions of
Windows)</h2></div></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Launch the registry editor by clicking Start&rarr;Run.  Type in
<tt  >regedit</tt> and
click OK.
</p></li><li><p>
Navigate to HKLM\Software\Win4Lin.
</p></li><li><p>
Right-click in the empty right-hand pane to create a new variable.
</p></li><li><p>
Select String Value.
</p></li><li><p>
Type <tt  >SingleAppStart</tt> (case-sensitive).
</p></li><li><p>
Double-click on the newly created SingleAppStart variable.
</p></li><li><p>
In the Value data: field, enter the full path to the executable
to be launched.  For example, to run Microsoft Word, WORD.EXE is not
sufficient.  The full path of C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\word.exe
(or wherever your Word executable is located and named) is required.
</p></li><li><p>
Exit the registry editor, and you're done!
</p></li></ol></div><p>
Now when users launch their clients and log in, Microsoft Word will
launch onto their desktop right beside their Linux applications.  This
may not seem like a big deal, because the Microsoft Office suite is
nicely supported by Wine and CrossOver Office, but swap out Word for
absolutely any other application on your Windows desktop, and the power
becomes obvious.  Because a full copy of Windows is being brought to bear
to deliver the application, there is an almost unlimited number of Windows
applications that can be delivered in this manner with zero modification.

Parting Thoughts</h2></div></div><p>
Virtualization technology isn't new.  IBM has been playing with it since
the 1960s.  What's making virtualization exciting again is the widespread
availability to fast networks and powerful servers.  Using Linux to
deliver Windows is cost effective in terms of hardware, management
and training, and products such as Win4Lin Virtual Desktop Server make the
technology easy to install and use.  In fact, virtualization technology
has come so far that the tricky points are no longer technical in nature;
they are logistical.  It's more difficult to plan a virtualization strategy than
it is to implement one.
