You don't have to wait for Microsoft to support Linux filesystems to get
at your Linux files from Windows.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x113f580.0x1237240"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Lack of access to your data in a new operating system may be one of the
most severe impediments for doing an OS migration.  There is
little personal incentive for users to switch to a system that can't
interoperate with their data, as the system would be practically
useless to them.
</p><p>
Linux has done a great job in allowing Microsoft Windows users to access
their Windows partitions from Linux.  Support for a majority of Windows
filesystems is available, such as seamless support for FAT16/32 and partial
but increasingly complete support for NTFS.  There also are some tools,
such as Captive-NTFS, which enable complete support for NTFS drives from
Linux.  Data access is not restricted to the local host.  Samba allows
Linux users to access their shared data on Windows computers over a
network.  Hence, we can say that, for MS Windows users, access to their
data is no longer an impediment to Linux migration.
</p><p>
However, as Linux advances into the desktop, many people use Linux
for some tasks and then turn to Windows for software that is not
yet available on Linux, such as high-end games, Adobe
Photoshop and various domain-specific applications for which no
open-source equivalent exists.  When people are using such applications, they
generally require access to their Linux partitions.  Support for Linux
filesystems is non-existent in Windows.  Thus, Linux dual-booters must
use some tools to access their Linux filesystems.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x113f580.0x12373f8"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>A Short Primer on Filesystems</b></p><p>
Some readers might be wondering what a filesystem really is.  A
filesystem basically defines a method for storing and retrieving files
from
a disk.  This begs the questions: &ldquo;Why are there so many filesystems? Why
can't everyone decide on the best way to store and retrieve data from a
disk and make that filesystem standard across all platforms?&rdquo; Different
operating systems come with different filesystems, because they target
different users.  Windows NT, which was targeted at enterprise users, came with
a filesystem called NTFS, which was a filesystem that had enhanced
security; whereas Windows 9x, which was targeted at ordinary users,
came with FAT16/32, which was a filesystem with less security but
with more performance.  Windows XP offers both, as it is marketed to
both segments.  Similarly, on Linux, ext2/3 are the de facto filesystems,
but there are some others for more special-purpose uses, for example,
filesystems for high-performance computing, such as XFS, or filesystems with
a great deal of fault tolerance, such as ext3 and ReiserFS.
</p><p>
Adding &ldquo;support&rdquo; to an OS for a particular filesystem basically entails
that we define the data structures involved to the operating system
upon which the data is stored on the disk.  It is more difficult to add
support for proprietary filesystems, such as NTFS, because the structure
of the data on the disk, the encryption algorithms and so forth, are not known
to the public.  That is why it is proving to be a challenge to
support NTFS completely in Linux.

Tools for Accessing Linux Partitions in Windows</h2></div></div><p>
As mentioned previously, Windows does not have native support for Linux
filesystems.  All is not lost, however.  The Open Source community has risen to the
challenge and created some excellent software to solve this problem.  This
article focuses mainly on LTOOLS, which is advanced software with
multiple interfaces that allows users to access a range of Linux
filesystems.  But first, let's skim through some other existing software
that could do the task.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x113f580.0x12377c0"></a>
Ext2fsd</h2></div></div><p>
Ext2fsd is one of the oldest projects in this area.  It allows access
from Windows to ext2 filesystems and can be downloaded from
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ext2fsd" target="_self">sourceforge.net/projects/ext2fsd</a>.  It installs as a filesystem
driver, not as a regular application.  Making Ext2fsd a filesystem
driver integrates ext2 partitions transparently into Windows and allows
Windows to use ext2 partitions as if they were a native format and enables
full read/write support.  Ext2fsd does not only read ext2 partitions,
but also Ext2 was one of the first de facto Linux filesystems, and many new Linux
filesystems, such as ext3 and ext4 are backward-compatible with it.  Thus,
the driver can work with ext3 and possibly ext4.  The picture is
currently unclear with respect to ext4, as ext4 was recently added
to the mainline kernel for testing.  But, when using ext3/4 with Ext2fsd, you
will be using only the features of ext2; any other additional features,
such as enhanced journaling capabilities, will not be used.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9449f1.large.jpg"><img src="9449f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Ext2fsd makes an ext2 filesystem look like any other filesystem in
Windows.
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x113f580.0x1237ad8"></a>
rfstool</h2></div></div><p>
ReiserFS increasingly has become a popular Linux filesystem, because
of its fault-tolerance capabilities.  rfstool allows
access to ReiserFS partitions from Windows to Linux; however, it
supports only read-only access, and the developers, according to
their Web site, have no plans to change that.  The tool is available from
<a href="http://freshmeat.net/projects/rfstool" target="_self">freshmeat.net/projects/rfstool</a>.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x113f580.0x1237c38"></a>
LTOOLS</h2></div></div><p>
The previous tools lead us to the tool to which this article is dedicated.  Unlike Ext2fsd and rfstool, which are specific to one particular
class of filesystems, LTOOLS are more generic.  They support ext2, ext3
and ReiserFS.  LTOOLS are a set of command-line tools, along with two
GUIs and a Web-based front end, to enable the reading of and writing to
Linux ext2/3 and ReiserFS filesystems from nearly all DOS or Windows (XP,
2000, NT, ME, 9.x or 3.x) versions, running on the same machine or
remotely.  So, whenever you're running DOS or Windows, and you desperately
need to read or write to a Linux partition, which may be on your own
computer or any other, you can make use of LTOOLS.  LTOOLS also is a great
tool for fixing your Linux installation, if you do not have a live CD.
</p><p>
As mentioned previously, LTOOLS comes with two different GUI interfaces to enable
you to access your Linux partitions.  LTOOLS comes with LTOOLSgui, which
is a Java-based graphical user interface for local or remote access to
your Linux files, and LTOOLSnet, which is a Microsoft .NET-based user
interface, which also provides local or remote access.
</p><p>
If you do not like using non-free Java or MS .NET, you can use your
Web browser as a graphical front end for LTOOLS.  To achieve this
functionality, the package contains LREADsrv, which is a simple Web
server, making your Linux filesystem available in an Explorer-like view
in your Web browser.  Using LREADsrv, you can allow remote access to your
Linux partitions, as well as to your DOS/Windows partitions.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x113f580.0x1237df0"></a>
Installation of LTOOLS</h2></div></div><p>
LTOOLS comes with a default Windows installer, which seems quite
dated.  After following the normal installation procedure, the installer
creates an entry in your start menu called LTOOLS from which you
can access a plethora of interfaces that allows you to access your Linux
filesystems.
</p><p>
LTOOLS comes with support for nearly all Windows versions;
however, all of the interfaces won't run on all Windows versions.  LTOOLS
provides two different console versions for Win9x/ME and Windows NT/XP.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x113f580.0x1237f50"></a>
Overview of LTOOLS&mdash;Command-Line Interface</h2></div></div><p>
The command-line interface provides basic functionality for writing and
retrieving data from Linux.  LTOOLS commands have the
following format.  All commands have three files associated with them,
for example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">ldir.bat</pre><p>
This command lists directories; however, it is not a program but a
script.
This script, depending on your system, further invokes either of these
two programs: LdirDOS.exe or ldirNT.exe.
The first one is for Win9x/ME, and the second one is for Windows NT/XP.
</p><p>
Many LTOOLS commands have a logical syntax.  For example, partition names
are Linux names.  So, if I want to copy a file called vars.inc
from /root (which is on /dev/hda2) to my C: drive, I would do the
following:</p><pre     class="programlisting">lread.bat --s/dev/hda2 /root/vars.inc C:\vars.inc</pre><p>
Similarly, for writing to Linux, I would do this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">lwrite.bat --s/dev/hda2 C:\vars.inc /root/vars.inc</pre><p>
Along the same lines, LTOOLS also has the commands shown in
Table 1.
</p><div class="table"><a name="N0x113f580.0x12382c0"></a><p class="title"><b>Table 1. LTOOLS Commands</b></p><table     summary="Table 1. LTOOLS Commands" border="1"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><tbody><tr><td>
lread.bat</td><td>
Read and copy files from Linux to DOS;
sample usage: <tt  >lread.bat --s/dev/hda2 /root/vars.inc
C:\vars.inc</tt></td></tr><tr><td>
lwrite.bat</td><td>
Copy files from DOS to Linux;
sample usage: <tt  >lwrite.bat --s/dev/hda2 C:\vars.inc
/root/vars.inc</tt></td></tr><tr><td>
ldel.bat</td><td>
Delete Linux files or (empty) directories&mdash;same as rm --f and rmdir in
Linux;
sample usage: <tt  >ldel.bat /root/vars.inc</tt></td></tr><tr><td>
lchange.bat</td><td>
Change Linux file attributes and owners&mdash;analogous to chmod;
sample usage: <tt  >lchange.bat --s/dev/hda2 754
/root/vars.inc</tt></td></tr><tr><td>
lren.bat</td><td>
Rename Linux files&mdash;analogous to mv;
sample usage: <tt  >lren.bat --s/devhda2 /root/vars.inc
/root/var2.inc</tt></td></tr><tr><td>
lmkdir.bat</td><td>
Create a new Linux directory&mdash;analogous to mkdir;
sample usage: <tt  >lmkdir.bat --s/dev/hda2
/root/newdir</tt></td></tr><tr><td>
lln.bat</td><td>
Create a symbolic link&mdash;analogous to ln;
sample usage: <tt  >lln.bat --s/dev/hda8 /root/link
/root/vars.inc</tt></td></tr><tr><td>
lcd.bat</td><td>
Change directory&mdash;analogous to cd;
sample usage: <tt  >lcd.bat /home/</tt></td></tr><tr><td>
ldrive.bat</td><td>
Set the default Linux disk drive;
sample usage: <tt  >ldrive /dev/hda8</tt></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>
ReiserFS is not supported via the above-mentioned tools.  Thus, LTOOLS also ships
with rfstool, which can be used to read from ReiserFS partitions.  In
order to read the hard disk under Windows NT/2000/XP or UNIX/Linux, you
need administrator rights.  If you are running LTOOLS under a
non-administrator
account, you may not be able to access the hard disk.  LTOOLS does not
respect Linux ownership.  This means that if users were to mount the root
device, they could change anything, including /etc/passwd/.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x113f580.0x122f968"></a>
LTOOLS .NET Framework Client</h2></div></div><p>
The .NET framework client is one of the most feature-rich clients
available in LTOOLS.  To run it, you need to download a copy of
the Microsoft .NET framework from the Microsoft Download Web site
(<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads" target="_self">www.microsoft.com/downloads</a>).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9449f2.large.jpg"><img src="9449f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. The C# LTOOLS File Manager
</p></div></div><p>
The client allows you to view all Windows and Linux partitions,
and you can transfer files between them, delete files, edit files and
modify them.  It is also possible to mount a remote device and edit its
contents.  This is extremely useful when I have some problems with my
Web server.  I mount the drive remotely if I'm using a Windows machine
and make all the modifications necessary to get it running.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x113f580.0x122fcd8"></a>
LTOOLS Java Framework Client</h2></div></div><p>
If your Windows installation is Windows95/98/ME and does not support
the MS .NET framework, the Java interface is for you.  To run the
Java interface, you need a copy of the Java Runtime Environment, which
you can download from <a href="http://java.sun.com" target="_self">java.sun.com</a>.
The Java interface has features analogous to the .NET client.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x113f580.0x122fe38"></a>
LTOOLS Web-Based Interface</h2></div></div><p>
The best interface in LTOOLS, based on my experience, is the
Web-based service.  LTOOLs comes with a built-in Web server, LREADsrv.exe,
which allows users to start it and access their filesystems via a Web
browser.  This has great potential if you want to share files with
other people remotely.  I would not recommend running LREADsrv.exe on a
server that is globally accessible, as it could compromise your data,
so you should share it in an environment where only legitimate users
have access to it, such as a virtual private network.  LREADsrv.exe still
has some problems; however, they will be fixed in future releases.
</p><p>
LREADsrv is still alpha and has certain limitations, which include
problems with HTTP 1.1 Web browsers, such as Internet Explorer, which slows
the response from the server considerably.  Another limitation is that
LREADsrv, in its current version, has been implemented as a mono-threaded
application&mdash;meaning that if multiple people are accessing
the filesystem at the same time, the changes they make are applied globally, which can
lead to lost updates and concurrency problems.  LREADsrv's error checking
is weak.  Most user input (filenames and so on) is not validated.  So, if a
user types some filenames incorrectly or mistypes a hard disk partition,
the Web server can go into an unstable state, which, fortunately,
does not result in any data loss.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x113f580.0x122ff98"></a>
Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Linux users have increasingly more mature support for Windows filesystems.  LTOOLS provides a unified way to access the most popular Linux
filesystems through a plethora of interfaces from Windows.  However,
support for Linux filesystems in Windows still has a way to
go.  Windows support for various other Linux/open-source filesystems, such
as XFS, is not yet available.  Drivers capable of using advanced features,
such as journaling in ext3 and ReiserFS, are not mature.  Integration of
Linux filesystems with Windows is an important area, and the lack of it
can be a serious impediment to an OS migration.  Thus, to enable enhanced
interoperability between MS Windows and Linux, given that Windows is
still the dominant desktop operating system, the Open Source community
must focus on adding mutual support for filesystems.
