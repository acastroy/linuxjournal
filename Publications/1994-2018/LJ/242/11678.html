<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #242, June 2014</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>David Herrmann</b></span> wanted to disable the
<span   class="bold"><b>virtual terminal subsystem</b></span> in order to
save space on a kernel that didn't need a VT. But, he still wanted to see
kernel oops output for debugging purposes. The problem was that only the VT
subsystem would display oops output&mdash;and he'd just disabled it.
</p><p>
No problem. David posted a patch to implement <span   class="bold"><b>DRM-log</b></span>, a separate console
device that used the direct rendering manager and that could receive
kernel oops output.
</p><p>
Over the course of a discussion about the patch, <span   class="bold"><b>Alan
Cox</b></span> mentioned that
there didn't seem to be anything particularly DRM-specific in David's code.
It easily could exist at a yet more generic layer of the kernel. And
although
David agreed with this, he said the DRM folks were more amenable to taking
his patch and that &ldquo;I've spent enough time trying to get the attention of
core maintainers for simple fixes, I really don't want to waste my time
pinging on feature-patches every 5 days to get any attention. If someone
outside of DRM wants to use it, I'd be happy to discuss any code-sharing.
Until then, I'd like to keep it here as people are willing to take it
through their tree.&rdquo;
</p><p>
That's a fairly surprising statement&mdash;a bit of an indictment of existing
kernel patch submission processes. There was no further discussion on that
particular point, but I would imagine it got some folks thinking.
</p><p>
The rest of the current thread focused on some technical details about oops
output, especially font size. David's code displayed oops output pixel by
pixel, essentially defining its own font. But for extremely high-resolution
monitors, such as <span   class="bold"><b>Apple's Retina display</b></span>,
as <span   class="bold"><b>Bruno Pr&eacute;mont</b></span> pointed out,
this could result in the oops output being too small for the user to see.
</p><p>
David's answer to this was to implement integer scaling. His font could be
any integer multiple larger than the default. This seemed fine to Bruno.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Eugene Shatokhin</b></span> posted some code to make
use of <span   class="bold"><b>Google's ThreadSanitizer</b></span>
tool (<a href="https://code.google.com/p/thread-sanitizer" target="_self">https://code.google.com/p/thread-sanitizer</a>). ThreadSanitizer detects
a particular type of race condition that occurs when one thread tries to
write to a variable while another thread either tries to read from or write
to the same variable.
</p><p>
Eugene called his own code <span   class="bold"><b>Kernel Strider</b></span>
(<a href="https://code.google.com/p/kernel-strider" target="_self">https://code.google.com/p/kernel-strider</a>). It collected statistics on
memory accesses, function calls and other things, and sent them along to
be analyzed by Thread Sanitizer. Eugene also posted a link to a page
describing several race conditions that Kernel Strider had uncovered in the
3.10.x kernel series.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Waiman Long</b></span> posted some code implementing
<span   class="bold"><b>qspinlock</b></span>, a new type of spinlock
that seemed to improve speed on very large multiprocessor systems. The idea
behind the speed improvement was that a CPU would disable preemption when
spinning for a lock, so it would save the time that might otherwise
have been used migrating the looping thread to other CPUs.
</p><p>
The big problem with that kind of improvement is that it's very
context-dependent. What's faster to one user may be slower to another,
depending on one's particular usual load. Traditionally, there has been no
clean way to resolve that issue, because there really is not any
&ldquo;standard&rdquo;
load under which to test the kernel. The developers just have to wing it.
</p><p>
But, they wing it pretty good, and ultimately things like new spinlock
implementations do get sufficient testing to determine whether they'd be a
real improvement. The problem with Waiman's situation, as he said on the
list, is that the qspinlock implementation is actually slower than the
existing alternatives on systems with only a few CPUs&mdash;in other words, for
anyone using Linux at home.
</p><p>
However, as <span   class="bold"><b>George Spelvin</b></span> pointed out, the most common case is when a
spinlock doesn't spin even once, but simply requests and receives the
resource in question. And in that case, qspinlocks seem to be just as fast
as the alternatives.
</p><p>
To qspinlock or not to qspinlock&mdash;<span   class="bold"><b>Rik van
Riel</b></span> knew his answer and sent
out his &ldquo;Signed-Off-By&rdquo; for Waiman's patch. Its merits undoubtedly
will continue to be tested and debated. But there are many, many locking
implementations in the kernel. I'm sure this one will be used somewhere,
even if it's not used everywhere.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Yuyang Du</b></span> recently suggested separating
the <span   class="bold"><b>Linux scheduler</b></span> into two
independent subsystems: one that performed load balancing between CPUs and
the other that actually scheduled processes on each single CPU.
</p><p>
The goal was lofty. With the scheduler performing both tasks, it becomes
terribly complex. By splitting it into these two halves, it might become
possible to write alternative systems for one or the other half, without
messing up the other.
</p><p>
But in fact, no. There was almost universal rejection of the idea.
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Peter
Zijlstra</em></span> said, &ldquo;That's not <span   class="emphasis"><em>ever</em></span> going
to happen.&rdquo; <span   class="bold"><b>Morten Rasmussen</b></span> said
the two halves couldn't be separated the way Yuyang wanted&mdash;they were
inextricably bound together.
</p><p>
You never know though. Once upon a time, someone said Linux never would 
support any architecture other than i386. Now it runs on anything that
contains silicon, and there's undoubtedly an effort underway to port it to
the human brain. Maybe the schedule can be split into two independent
halves as well.

It seems like every day there's a new mobile game that takes the world by
storm. Whether it's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Flappy Bird</em></span> or <span   class="emphasis"><em>Candy
Crush</em></span>, there's something about
simple games that appeals to our need for quick, instant gratification.
</p><p>
I don't normally recommend games, unless they're particularly nostalgic
or something, but this month I have to mention <span   class="emphasis"><em>2048</em></span>. Maybe it's the
math nerd in me that loves powers of 2, or maybe it's that this
game is just the right amount of challenging and infuriating. Whatever
the secret recipe for a great mobile game is, <span   class="emphasis"><em>2048</em></span> has discovered it.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11678androidf1.large.jpg"><img src="11678androidf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
The basic premise is you keep combining similarly numbered blocks to get
higher and higher numbered blocks. To win the game, you get the coveted
2048 block. I know our own <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> bookkeeper has gotten further
than that, however, and has scored at least 4096, with rumors of getting
as high as 8192. Do you like math? Do you hate sleep? This game might
be just for you. And like the title says, I'm so, so sorry. Get your
copy today&mdash;just search for &ldquo;2048&rdquo; at the Google Play store. (There are
several similar games, I don't want to favor one over the other.)

<h2 class="title">rc.local, Cron Style</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #242, June 2014</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Occasionally as seasoned Linux users, we run across simple things we
never knew existed&mdash;and are amazed. Whether it's tab autocompletion,
<tt  >sudo !!</tt> for when you forgot to type sudo or even recursive file listing
with <tt  >ls</tt>, the smallest tricks can be so incredibly useful. Not long ago,
I had one of those moments.
</p><p>
Most people know rc.local is the file where you put commands you want to have
start on system boot. Sometimes the rc.local script is disabled, however,
and it doesn't work. It also can be difficult to remember the syntax
for starting a particular program as a specific user. Plus, having a
long list of programs in rc.local can just become ugly. Little did I know,
cron supports not only periodic execution of commands, but it also can start
programs when the system starts as well!
</p><p>
A normal crontab entry looks like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
* * * * * /usr/bin/command
</pre>
</p><p>
That runs the command every minute. There are countless variations to
get very specific intervals, but until recently, I didn't know there were
options to the five fields. The following is a crontab entry that runs a
command every hour on the hour:

<pre     class="programlisting">
@hourly /usr/bin/command
</pre>
</p><p>
And, there are many more: <tt  >@annually</tt>,
<tt  >@monthly</tt>, <tt  >@daily</tt>,
<tt  >@midnight</tt> and
most interesting for this article, <tt  >@reboot</tt>. If you have a crontab entry
like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
@reboot /usr/bin/command
</pre>
</p><p>
it will execute when the system starts up, with the ownership and
permission of the person owning the crontab! I researched a lot to
make sure it wasn't just on reboot, but also on a cold boot&mdash;and yes,
the <tt  >@reboot</tt> terminology just means it runs once when the system first
boots. I've been using this as a quick hack to start programs, and it
works amazingly well.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11678cronf1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
I know 99.9% of you already knew this juicy bit of info, but for that .1%
who have been living in the dark like me, I present you with a sharp new
arrow for your system administrator quiver. It's a very simple trick,
but all the best ones are!

<h2 class="title">Non-Linux FOSS: My Portable Windows Lab</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #242, June 2014</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Portable apps aren't anything new. There are variations of &ldquo;single
executable apps&rdquo; for most platforms, and some people swear by keeping
their own applications with them for use when away from home. I don't
usually do that, as most of what I do is on-line, but there is one
exception: security.
</p><p>
When I'm asked to help a Windows user figure out what is wrong with
his or her computer, I generally take a USB drive and nothing else. I also
usually run <tt  >dd</tt> on that Flash drive when I get back home, because Windows
can be a breeding ground for nasty infections. In order to build
a USB device quickly that I can use to help my Windows friends, I like to use
the awesome open-source program at <a href="http://portableapps.com" target="_self">portableapps.com</a>.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11678fossf1.large.jpg"><img src="11678fossf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
The downloadable program provides a sort of &ldquo;app store&rdquo; for downloading
individual portable apps. It makes sure all of your apps are up to date,
and it's a great way to browse the different categories and look for
apps that might be useful. Granted, many of the portable apps themselves
aren't open source, but the program that manages them for you is. If you
ever need to help friends or acquaintances with their infected systems,
a USB drive prepped with the Windows-based portableapps.com application
is a great way to start.

<h2 class="title">Scientific Graphing in Python</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Joey Bernard</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #242, June 2014</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
In my last few articles, I looked at several different Python modules
that are useful for doing computations. But, what tools are available to
help you analyze the results from those computations? Although you could
do some statistical analysis, sometimes the best tool is a graphical
representation of the results. The human mind is extremely good at
spotting patterns and seeing trends in visual information. To this
end, the standard Python module for this type of work is matplotlib
(<a href="http://matplotlib.org" target="_self">matplotlib.org</a>). 
With matplotlib, you can create complex
graphics of your data to help you discover relations. 
</p><p>
You 
always can install matplotlib from source; however, it's easier to install
it from your distribution's package manager. For example, in Debian-based
distributions, you would install it with this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo apt-get install python-matplotlib
</pre>
</p><p>
The python-matplotlib-doc package also includes extra documentation
for matplotlib.
</p><p>
Like other large Python modules, matplotlib is broken down into several
sub-modules. Let's start with pyplot. This sub-module
contains most of the functions you will want to use to graph your
data. Because of the long names involved, you likely will want to import
it as something shorter. In the following examples, I'm using:

<pre     class="programlisting">
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
</pre>
</p><p>
The underlying design of matplotlib is modeled on the graphics module
for the R statistical software package. The graphical functions are
broken down into two broad categories: high-level functions and low-level
functions. These functions don't work directly with your screen. All of
the graphic generation and manipulation happens via an abstract graphical
display device. This means the functions behave the same way, and
all of the display details are handled by the graphics device. These
graphics devices may represent display screens, printers or even file
storage formats. The general work flow is to do all of your drawing in
memory on the abstract graphics device. You then push the final image
out to the physical device in one go.
</p><p>
The simplest example is to plot a series of numbers stored as a list. The
code looks like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
plt.plot([1,2,3,4,3,2,1]) plt.show()
</pre>
</p><p>
The first command plots the data stored in the given list in a regular
scatterplot. If you have a single list of values, they are assumed to be
the y-values, with the list index giving the x-values. Because you did not
set up a specific graphics device, matplotlib assumes a default device
mapped to whatever physical display you are using. After executing the
first line, you won't see anything on your display. To see
something, you need to execute the second <tt  >show()</tt> command. This
pushes the graphics data out to the physical display (Figure 1).
You should notice that there are several control buttons along the
bottom of the window, allowing you to do things like save the image
to a file. You also will notice that the graph you generated is
rather plain. You can add labels with these commands:

<pre     class="programlisting">
plt.xlabel('Index')
plt.ylabel('Power Level')
</pre>
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11678matf1.large.jpg"><img src="11678matf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. A basic scatterplot window includes controls on the bottom of the
pane.
</p></div></div><p>
You then get a graph with a bit more context (Figure 2). You
can add a title for your plot with the <tt  >title()</tt>
command, and the
<tt  >plot</tt> command is even more versatile than that. You can change the plot
graphic being used, along with the color. For example, you can make green
triangles by adding <tt  >g^</tt> or blue circles with
<tt  >bo</tt>. If you want more than
one plot in a single window, you simply add them as extra options to
<tt  >plot()</tt>. So, you could plot squares and cubes on the same plot with
something like this:


<pre     class="programlisting">
t = [1.0,2.0,3.0,4.0]
plt.plot(t,[1.0,4.0,9.0,16.0],'bo',t,[1.0,8.0,27.0,64.0],'sr')
plt.show()
</pre>
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11678matf2.large.jpg"><img src="11678matf2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. You can add labels with the xlabel and ylabel functions.
</p></div></div><p>
Now you should see both sets of data in the new plot
window (Figure 3). If you import the numpy module and use arrays,
you can simplify the plot command to:

<pre     class="programlisting">
plt.plot(t,t**2,'bo',t,t**3,'sr')
</pre>
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11678matf3.large.jpg"><img src="11678matf3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. You can draw multiple plots with a single command.
</p></div></div><p>
What if you want to add some more information to your plot, maybe a text
box? You can do that with the <tt  >text()</tt> command, and you can set the location
for your text box, along with its contents. For example, you could use:

<pre     class="programlisting">
plt.text(3,3,'This is my plot')
</pre>
</p><p>
This will put a text area at x=3, y=3. A specialized form of text box is
an annotation. This is a text box linked to a specific point of data. You
can define the location of the text box with the <tt  >xytext</tt> parameter and
the location of the point of interest with the <tt  >xy</tt> parameter. You 
even can set the details of the arrow connecting the two with the
<tt  >arrowprops</tt>
parameter. An example may look like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
plt.annotate('Max value', xy=(2, 1), xytext=(3, 1.5), 
 &#8618;arrowprops=dict(facecolor='black', shrink=0.05),)
</pre>
</p><p>
Several other high-level plotting commands are available.
The <tt  >bar()</tt> command lets you draw a barplot of your data. You can change
the width, height and colors with various input parameters. You even
can add in error bars with the <tt  >xerr</tt> and
<tt  >yerr</tt> parameters. Similarly, you
can draw a horizontal bar plot with the <tt  >barh()</tt>
command. Or, you can draw box and whisker
plots with the <tt  >boxplot()</tt> command. You can create plain contour
plots with the <tt  >contour()</tt> command. If you want
filled-in contour plots,
use <tt  >contourf()</tt>. The 
<tt  >hist()</tt> command will draw a histogram,
with options to control items like the bin size. There is even a command
called <tt  >xkcd()</tt> that sets a number of parameters so all of the
subsequent drawings will be in the same style as the xkcd comics.
</p><p>
Sometimes, you may want to be able to interact with your
graphics. matplotlib needs to interact with several different toolkits,
like GTK or Qt. But, you don't want to have to write code for every
possible toolkit. The pyplot sub-module includes the ability to add event
handlers in a GUI-agnostic way. The FigureCanvasBase class contains
a function called <tt  >mpl_connect()</tt>, which you can use to connect some
callback function to an event. For example, say you have a function
called <tt  >onClick()</tt>. You can attach it to the button press event with
this command:


<pre     class="programlisting">
fig = plt.figure()
...
cid = fig.canvas.mpl_connect('button_press_event', onClick)
</pre>
</p><p>
Now when your plot gets a mouse click, it will fire your callback
function. It returns a connection ID, stored in the variable
<tt  >cid</tt> in this
example, that you can use to work with this callback function. When you
are done with the interaction, disconnect the callback function with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
fig.canvas.mpl_disconnect(cid)
</pre>
</p><p>
If you just need to do basic interaction, you can use the
<tt  >ginput()</tt>
command. It will listen for a set amount of time and return a list of
all of the clicks that happen on your plot. You then can process those
clicks and do some kind of interactive work.
</p><p>
The last thing I want to cover here is animation. matplotlib includes a
sub-module called animation that provides all the functionality that
you need to generate MPEG videos of your data. These movies can be made
up of frames of various file formats, including PNG, JPEG or TIFF. There
is a base class, called Animation, that you can subclass and add extra
functionality. If you aren't interested in doing too much work, there are
included subclasses. One of them, FuncAnimation, can generate an animation
by repeatedly applying a given function and generating the frames of
your animation. Several other low-level functions are available
to control creating, encoding and writing movie files. You should have
all the control you require to generate any movie files you may need.
</p><p>
Now that you have matplotlib under your belt, you can 
generate some really stunning visuals for your latest paper. Also, you
will be able to find new and interesting relationships by graphing them.
So, go check your data and see what might be hidden there.

<h2 class="title">Sicker Than Sickbeard?</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #242, June 2014</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
When I wrote about Usenet and Sickbeard a while back, I got many e-mails
that I had broken the first rule of Usenet: don't talk about Usenet. I'm a
sucker for freedom though, and I can't help but share when cool programs
are available. This month, I switched from Sickbeard to NZBDrone for
managing my television shows.
</p><p>
NZBDrone is a program designed to manage a local collection of television
shows. It also has the capability of working with Usenet programs to
automate the possibly illegal downloading of episodes, but that's truly
not all it's good for. NZBDrone will take your TV show files and organize
them into folders, download metadata and let you know if you're missing
files. It also will show you when your favorite shows are going to be airing next.
</p><p>
Although it hasn't given me a problem, the fact that NZBDrone runs on Mono
makes me nervous. The installation guide on the <a href="http://www.nzbdrone.com" target="_self">www.nzbdrone.com</a> Web site
makes setup simple enough, but there will be a boatload of dependencies
that you might have to install due to its Mono infrastructure.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11678nzbdronef1.large.jpg"><img src="11678nzbdronef1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
NZBDrone will work with your existing Plex media server, XBMC machines
and SABNzb installs, and it automatically performs most of its features if
you allow it to do so. The interface is beautiful, and even with a
large collection of television shows (I have more than 15TB of TV shows on
my server), it's very responsive. Whether you record your TV episodes,
rip your television season DVDs or find your episodes in other ways,
NZBDrone is a perfect way to manage your collection. It's so intuitive
and user-friendly, that it gets this month's Editors' Choice award!
