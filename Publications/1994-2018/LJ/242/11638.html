Use some simple Linux tools and a laptop to get access to the
Internet traffic sent and received by your smartphone.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2639580.0x27311f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The ubiquity and convenience of smartphones has been a real boon
for getting information on the go. I love being able to jump on a
Wi-Fi hotspot, catch up on my mail, check my banking balance or read the
latest tech news&mdash;all without having to bring along or boot up a laptop.
Now that mobile development is mainstream, most of this access is done
via specialized apps, instead of via a Web browser.
</p><p>
This migration away from direct Web access in favor of dedicated
smartphone apps has made for a richer user experience, but it also has made
knowing exactly what is going on &ldquo;under the hood&rdquo; a lot harder. On our
Linux boxes, there are many tools to help user peer into the internals
of what's going to and from the machine. Our browsers have simple HTTP
versus HTTPS checks to see if there's encryption, and there are simple but
easy-to-use browser plugins like Firebug that let us view exactly what's
being sent and retrieved over the Web. At the operating system level,
powerful tools like Wireshark let us drill down even further, capturing
<span   class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span> traffic flowing through a network interface.
Smartphones 
usually are locked up to a point where it's almost impossible for a regular
user to run any network monitoring or tracing software directly on the
phone&mdash;so how can a curious user get access to that phone
traffic?
</p><p>
Fortunately, with just a little bit of work, you can use Linux to transform
almost any laptop into a secret-sharing wireless access point (WAP),
connect your phone and view the data flowing to and from the phone with
relative ease. All you really need is a laptop running Linux with one
wireless and one Ethernet connection.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2639580.0x2731568"></a>
Intercepting Traffic</h2></div></div><p>
The first step is to set up your own &ldquo;naughty&rdquo; WAP where you can
capture and log all the Internet traffic passing through
it&mdash;simulating the kind of information that a rogue employee could
be obtaining from a coffee-shop Wi-Fi hotspot. Let's do this in a
distribution-independent way that doesn't mess around with your existing
router (no need to change security settings) and doesn't require rooting
or installing anything unseemly on your phone.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2639580.0x27316c8"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>False Starts</b></p><p>
It may be tempting to try a shortcut for capturing this traffic.
Here are a few techniques I tried and discarded before sticking with a
hostapd/dnsmasq/iptables solution.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Ubuntu's Built-in Hotspots:</b></span> 
</p><p>
Ubuntu has a handy &ldquo;Use as
Hotspot&rdquo; feature tucked away in its networking settings. Unfortunately,
it creates hotspots in ad hoc mode, which isn't compatible with most
versions of Android. I didn't try Fedora's implementation, but the
method I recommend instead will work on any distribution.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Monitor Mode:</b></span> 
</p><p>
It's tempting just to put the wireless card in
monitor mode and capture <span   class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span> wireless traffic, independent of SSID.
This is pretty cool, but there are quite a few &ldquo;gotchas&rdquo;:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
The drivers for your wireless card must support monitor mode. Many,
but not all cards support this mode.
</p></li><li><p>
Your capture needs to include the four WPA &ldquo;handshake&rdquo; packets.
</p></li><li><p>
You'll probably have to compile and use airmon-ng to start monitor mode
and then capture on the mon0 pseudo-device airmon creates.
</p></li><li><p>
If the WAP is using encryption, the packets you capture also will be
encrypted. Wireshark does have a facility to help decode the packets,
but you'll need to enter information about the security scheme used by
the WAP and toggle a few sets of options until the decoded packets
look right. For a first-time user, it's hard enough making sense out
of Wireshark dumps without having to worry about toggling security
options on and off.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Capturing with the Android Emulator:</b></span> 
</p><p>
Another approach would be
to use an Android emulator on your capture device, install and then run
the target application, and capture the traffic from the emulator.
It's much harder than it sounds actually to get a banking app on the
emulator though:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Due to recent Android licensing changes, the major Android VMs no
longer include the Google Play store. (I tried both the Android SDK
and the free product from Genymotion.) 
</p></li><li><p>
If your phone isn't rooted, it's
not easy to get the application's .apk off your phone and onto the VM.
</p></li></ul></div></div><p>
To turn a laptop into a WAP, you'll first use hostapd to use the wireless
card as an access point mode (broadcasting an SSID, authenticating with
security and so on). Next, you'll use dnsmasq to provide DNS and DHCP services
for clients connecting on the wireless connection. Finally, iptables'
masquerading features will be used to direct IP traffic from clients on
the wireless connection to the Internet (via your Ethernet connection), and
then rout responses back to the correct client on the wireless side.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2639580.0x2732278"></a>
hostapd</h2></div></div><p>
hostapd is a small utility that lets you create your own wireless
access point. Installation is straightforward, and configuration is
just as easy. Most wireless cards and modern kernels will be using the
mac80211 driver. Check yours via <tt  >lsmod|grep mac80211</tt>. If that's your
driver, find your wireless device via <tt  >ifconfig</tt>, and set up the SSID of
your choice as shown below for an unsecured, totally open access point:

<pre     class="programlisting">
===[/etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf]======
interface=wlan0
driver=nl80211
ssid=WatchingU
channel=1
===[/etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf]======
</pre>
</p><p>
I recommend not using Wi-Fi security for this test; it would be overkill,
as your access point will only be temporary. Should you desire a
more permanent solution, hostapd supports many different authentication
options.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2639580.0x27324e0"></a>
dnsmasq</h2></div></div><p>
Now that hostapd is ready to start letting clients connect to your
wireless connection, you need dnsmasq to serve DCHP and provide DNS for
your access point. Fortunately, dnsmasq is also very easy to install and
configure. The example below is the minimum required. Make sure the
<tt  >dhcp-range</tt> you specify will not conflict with anything already on your
network. By default, dnsmasq will read your existing /etc/resolv.conf
and propagate the DNS settings listed there to its clients. That's a
pretty sane default configuration, but if you need something else,
use the <tt  >no-resolv</tt> option and specify the DNS servers
manually:

<pre     class="programlisting">
========[/etc/dnsmasq.conf]===============
interface=wlan0
dhcp-range=10.0.0.3,10.0.0.20,12h
========[/etc/dnsmasq.conf]===============
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2639580.0x2732748"></a>
iptables</h2></div></div><p>
The final piece of your wireless access point is iptables, which will
use IP Masquerading to get the traffic from the wireless connection,
send it over the wired connection and route any responses to back to the
correct source on the wireless side. There are many distribution-specific
ways to save and script iptables rules, but it's simpler to create a
distribution-independent shell script to enable iptables and network
address translation (NAT). A script for iptables that ties in hostapd
and dnsmasq would look like the following (modify the wlan0 and eth0 entries to
match your system):


<pre     class="programlisting">
=======[makeWAP.sh]==============
#!/bin/bash                                                                    
export DEV_IN=wlan0;
export DEV_OUT=eth0;

echo "Bringing up $DEV_IN"
#This address/mask should match how you configured dnsmasq
ifconfig $DEV_IN up 10.0.0.1 netmask 255.255.255.0

echo "Starting dnsmasq"
dnsmasq

echo "Configuring iptables"
#Clear everything in iptables                                                   
iptables -Z;
iptables -F;
iptables -X;

#Turn on iptables NAT, forwarding, and enable 
#forwarding in the kernel
iptables --table nat --append POSTROUTING --out-interface 
 &#8618;$DEV_OUT -j MASQUERADE
iptables --append FORWARD --in-interface $DEV_IN -j ACCEPT
 &#8618;sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1

echo "Starting hostapd"
hostapd /etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf 1&gt; /dev/null
=======[makeWAP.sh]==============
</pre>
</p><p>
To test everything, connect your capture laptop to a wired connection
with Internet access and disconnect any existing wireless connections.
Run the makeWAP.sh script (<tt  >sudo ./makeWAP.sh</tt>) to start up the WAP.
</p><p>
On the phone, turn off mobile data (for Android 4.3, this is done via
Settings&rarr;Data Usage&rarr;Mobile data&rarr;Off), turn on Wi-Fi, and connect
to the new WAP (in the example above the SSID would be &ldquo;WatchingU&rdquo;).
Once connected, test a few sites to make sure you can access data from
the Internet.
</p><p>
If everything works, congratulations, you have transformed your laptop
into the world's most ridiculously overqualified wireless router!
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2639580.0x2732ab8"></a>
Wireshark</h2></div></div><p>
Wireshark is a network packet analyzer that you'll use to capture
and make sense of the data flowing on your newly created access
point.
You'll be merely scratching the surface of its capabilities, as it is an
extremely powerful tool with abilities stretching well beyond &ldquo;poke
at a few packets&rdquo; as used in this project.
</p><p>
Install Wireshark for your version of Linux. If at all possible,
get version 1.10 or higher, as 1.10 adds support for decoding gzip'ed
HTTP data on the fly (and there's a <span   class="emphasis"><em>lot</em></span> of that). Prior to
1.10, you'd have to save the TCP stream to a file, edit out the header
and then gunzip it to view the raw data. This becomes tedious quickly,
so having Wireshark do all that for you behind the scenes is awesome.
</p><p>
When running Wireshark for the first time, if it complains that there are
no devices available for capture, you have to give your ID permissions
for the various devices and applications used by Wireshark. For Ubuntu,
run <tt  >sudo dpkg-reconfigure wireshark-common</tt>, and select the option to
let nonroot users capture packets, and make sure your ID is in the
&ldquo;Wireshark&rdquo; group. For other distributions, search for which devices
and scripts need to be owned by which groups.
</p><p>
Before moving on to capturing traffic, shut down every non-essential
app and service on the phone to make it easier to find the traffic
of interest. The fewer packets you have to sort through, the better.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2639580.0x2b2b0d0"></a>
Capturing Unencrypted Web Traffic</h2></div></div><p>
Before you start looking for sensitive data, let's first get familiar
with what unencrypted traffic looks like in Wireshark.
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
From the Wireshark starting screen, select the wireless device (wlan0)
and then the &ldquo;Start&rdquo; icon to start a new capture.
</p></li><li><p>
On the phone, use a browser to go to <a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com</a>.
</p></li><li><p>
Once the page finished loading on the phone, press the &ldquo;Stop&rdquo; icon in
Wireshark, and save the capture file somewhere safe, called something
like &ldquo;Capture_LJ.pcapnp&rdquo;.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Now, let's take a look at this dump. With the dump file open in Wireshark,
go to View&rarr;Name Resolution and make sure &ldquo;Enable for Network
Layer&rdquo;
is checked. This will improve readability by translating IP addresses
to hostnames. The initial view (Figure 1) can be sort of
intimidating, but there are some simple tips to make decoding this
data easier.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11638f1.large.jpg"><img src="11638f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Wireshark Output
</p></div></div><p>
As shown in Figure 1, Wireshark's dump screen has one row per TCP packet, but the
data is more easily consumed when reassembled into a full TCP stream. To
get the full stream, right-click on any row where the source or destination
is www.linuxjournal.com, and choose &ldquo;Follow TCP Stream&rdquo;. This 
automatically will find all the related packets and group them together in an
easier-to-read format. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11638f2.large.jpg"><img src="11638f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Follow TCP Stream
</p></div></div><p>
In this example, you can see the HTTP GET request from my phone in red,
and the HTTP response from the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> Web server in blue. Here is
where you can start to see unencrypted information flowing back and forth
from the server. Since the server response's &ldquo;Content-Type&rdquo; header
indicates that the response is a JPEG image, you can view that image
with a little bit of extra manipulation. Press the &ldquo;Save As&rdquo; button to
save the stream to a temporary file (use RAW format), then use an editor like
emacs or vi to trim out the header text from the image binary contents.
It takes a little bit of practice, but it's usually pretty obvious where
the HTTP header stops and the binary bits begin.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11638f3.large.jpg"><img src="11638f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Raw TCP Dump
</p></div></div><p>
Once you've removed the header (and any stray footer or additional header
sections), you can save the file with a .jpeg extension and view it.
</p><p>
Continue browsing through the dump manually and look for interesting
TCP segments. You also could take a more systematic approach by using
Wireshark's filtering capabilities. Use a filter like <tt  >tcp.stream eq
1</tt> (Figure 4), and keep iterating the stream ID until you've seen
all the streams, drilling down with &ldquo;Follow Stream&rdquo; if the packets
look promising.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11638f4.large.jpg"><img src="11638f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Filtering to a Single TCP Stream
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2639580.0x2b2c0a0"></a>
Capturing Low-Sensitivity Application Traffic</h2></div></div><p>
Now that you're getting a little more comfortable with capturing and
viewing dumps with Wireshark, let's try peeking at the information coming
to and from an Android application. For this next test, I used the app
&ldquo;reddit is fun&rdquo; since it sends and receives non-sensitive data that
is probably not encrypted.
</p><p>
Capture an app search or query using the same technique as before: start
Wireshark on the laptop, launch and exercise the app from the phone,
then stop Wireshark and save the capture file.
</p><p>
Figure 5 shows an example
TCP stream from &ldquo;reddit is fun&rdquo;.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11638f5.large.jpg"><img src="11638f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. Gzip-Encoded JSON
</p></div></div><p>
Again, the request from the app is in red, and the response from the
reddit server is in blue. Note that since the request is not encoded,
anyone monitoring the WAP would be able to detect your interest in
&ldquo;Raspberry Pi&rdquo; data. The content-type of the response is JSON,
and even though the Content-Encoding is set to &ldquo;gzip&rdquo;, Wireshark is
letting you view the content body as pure JSON. If the data in your TCP
Stream page looks garbled, you may have an older version of Wireshark
that doesn't support on-the-fly gzip decoding. Either save the contents
to a file and gunzip on your own, or upgrade your version of Wireshark.
</p><p>
Note:
look at that hilarious &ldquo;Server&rdquo; header in
the response&mdash;is some clever reddit engineer sending an SQL injection
attack to some script kiddies?
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2639580.0x2b2c678"></a>
Capturing High-Sensitivity App Data</h2></div></div><p>
By now, the process to capture traffic from an app should be pretty
straightforward. Let's try running a banking or high-sensitivity app
and use the tricks described earlier to see if you can detect the
application sending any information in the clear that it shouldn't.
To be perfectly honest, the odds of finding such a low-level (and easily
avoidable) flaw are going to be very, very low. Android application
development is pretty mature now, and the Android libraries make using
SSL encryption pretty easy. It feels good to double-check though, so
follow the same steps as before, but log on to a banking application of
your choice.
</p><p>
Now, as you step through the TCP streams, you should note a few major
differences. Most of the traffic will be HTTPS instead of HTTP, and
the protocol will be TLS instead of TCP or HTTP. In addition, the TCP
stream no longer will contain human-readable content, even after trying
the standard gunzip tricks (Figure 6).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11638f6.large.jpg"><img src="11638f6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. Encrpyted Traffic
</p></div></div><p>
Step through the TCP streams, following each one, and verify that there's
no plain text or unencrypted communications that are exposing anything
scary.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2639580.0x2b2c9e8"></a>
Next Steps</h2></div></div><p>
Now that you've almost certainly <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> found anything scary,
where else can these network monitoring skills be applied? Here are
some fun ideas:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Attach a console like a Wii or PS3 and see what kind of information
it sends at startup and logon.
</p></li><li><p>
Create a WAP that doesn't actually go anywhere and just see what
tries to connect. Maybe there's a device using Wi-Fi that you didn't
even know about?
</p></li><li><p>
Get the SSL certificate for a server you support, and try out
Wireshark's SSL decoding.
</p></li><li><p>
Reverse the wlan0 and eth0 designations in the scripts and set up the
system backwards (connect the laptop's Wi-Fi to your existing WAP, and
plug a device in to the laptop's Ethernet port) to monitor the output
of wired-only devices. My &ldquo;smart&rdquo; Blu-ray player was communicating
with all sorts of unexpected places at startup!
