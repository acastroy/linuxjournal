I tend to be a fairly funny guy. Well, at least I think I'm funny. My kids
might disagree. The thing is, it's hard to find a group of people to
understand obscure networking jokes. At a non-tech conference, for example,
if I say to the person next to me, &ldquo;Jeez, that speaker must have delivered
his presentation with UDP packets, because he never stopped to see if any
of us were getting what he was talking about!&rdquo;&mdash;exactly zero people
laugh. In fact, I usually get really weird looks. At a Linux conference,
however, the same comment usually gets an eye-roll. (As a father of
teenagers, I consider an eye-roll the equivalent to amusement.) That's why I
love <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> so much. This month, we're talking about Networking, and
everyone in our little &ldquo;room&rdquo; understands what we're talking about! So
let's peel this issue apart one OSI layer at a time.
</p><p>
Reuven M. Lerner starts us out with URLs. That ubiquitous string of text
that takes you to a location (usually a Web site) is something we often take
for granted. As the Internet matures, however, an understanding of how URLs
work is vital. Reuven teaches us everything from protocol designations to
URL fragments. If you've ever wondered about those seemingly out of place
# characters in a URL, you'll want to read his column. Dave Taylor
follows with a great look at the evolution of scripting. Just like we no
longer have to hand-crank our car engine to get it running (mine doesn't
even have a key anymore, just a button), shell scripting has changed
through
the years. Supporting legacy systems (or legacy code) is a problem we all
need to deal with, as Dave shows us with one of his real-world experiences.
</p><p>
Kyle Rankin continues his theme this month and teaches how to encrypt
our e-mail&mdash;specifically text-based Mutt e-mail. Kyle remains true to
his command-line preferences, and rather than switch to a GUI e-mail app, he
describes how to use GPG with Mutt. If you're a Mutt user like Kyle, or just
want to learn about implementing GPG, don't miss his column. I follow Kyle
with a continuation on last month's scripting basics article. Rather than
leaving you with a simple set of tools, I tried to come up with some
examples of using those tools in real-world situations. My scripts are
basic and my techniques are simple, but that's the point. Don't be
intimidated by the command line. It's powerful and not terribly difficult
to master.
</p><p>
Sniffing network traffic is often a critical part of diagnosing a problem
or detecting a potential one. Brian Trapp explains how to sniff the
packets of our smartphones. That seems like a simple enough task, until you
realize capturing traffic from a wireless device to the network can be
challenging. (Using Firesheep will garner you tons of Web information, but
if you want every packet, that gets a little rougher.) Brian shows how
to capture the traffic, and then how to dissect it with Wireshark. Marco
Alamanni follows Brian with an in-depth article on OSSIM, a server-based
program for detecting problems on your local network. With its Web
interface and powerful collection of snooping tools, OSSIM can be 
incredibly useful for early detection of problems or threats.
</p><p>
Any network user or administrator is familiar with firewalling tools. Most
of us, however, aren't nearly as familiar with Berkeley Packet Filters.
Valentine Sinitsyn walks through using BPF to do some very low-level
traffic filtering. This powerful system can add an incredible set of tools
to your network filtering needs. And finally, Mark Dotson gives us an
in-depth tutorial on Ansible. Managing multiple systems is becoming more
and more complex, but thankfully with tools like Ansible, we can deploy and
configure countless machines quickly and, most importantly, securely. 
</p><p>
Like every issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>, this one is chock full of tech tips,
product announcements and recommendations. The networking issue
touches on so many disciplines and interest areas in the Linux community,
that it's always one of our favorites. The large majority of folks still
won't understand our networking jokes, but that's okay, they can sit around
as bored as a teenager in a Faraday cage while we all enjoy this issue.
(Thank you, thank you, I'll be here all night....)
