    A simple command-line utility for planning and managing deferred
    program executions.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x158c580.0x1684558"></a></h2></div></div><p>Drawing from the communications world,
services fall in one of two broad categories, immediate or
deferred. Immediate communication services include
teleconferencing, on-line chat, etc.; while deferred services
include e-mail and fax. This column presents an overview of the
Linux <span   class="bold"><b>at</b></span> utility that allows for
the deferred (or scheduled) execution of a program.
</p><p>Of course, most programs need to be launched in an immediate,
do-it-now mode. Still, it's often desirable and perhaps required to
schedule the execution of a program (or job, in ancient Geek) at a
particular time for a variety of practical reasons. Consider any of
the following scenarios:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>A development group has developed a script that
rebuilds their source tree and updates the application's staging
area. The script is completely mechanized, but it is very time- and
CPU-intensive. As a practical matter, the group decides this job
should be scheduled to run in the late evening when it would be
competing with fewer users and processes.</p></li><li><p>A high-quality color printer/plotter is in high
demand during regular business hours. Multiple times a week, a
project manager uses the printer to reprint a quickly evolving
project plan of 200+ pages. To avoid monopolizing the printer
during its peak usage period, the project manager decides the print
job should be run in the early morning&mdash;before most users are
active.</p></li><li><p>A project leader wants to distribute meeting
reminder/agenda notes via e-mail to participating staff members
four hours before a meeting scheduled for next Friday at 4:00
<b  >P.M</b>.</p></li><li><p>A system administrator (SA) has been receiving
reports of extremely poor system performance at the start of the
business day. The cause of the degrading performance is not
obvious. Rather than comb through numerous system logs, the SA
decides to schedule the execution of a program that captures system
load information. The job is to be executed the next day, every
five minutes during the 9:00 <b  >A.M.</b> hour.</p></li><li><p>An external data source used to update a local data
warehouse becomes available at 6:00 <b  >P.M.</b> every
Friday. If the lengthy update procedure does not complete
successfully, it's to be retried an hour later. Otherwise, it is
rescheduled for the next Friday.</p></li></ol></div><p>The scheduling requirements outlined in each of the above
scenarios can be addressed by the at utility. Furthermore, these
scenarios represent a broad range of the most common applications
for at. The at utility is ideal for performing CPU-intensive tasks
when little user-processing demand is present on the system,
utilizing scarce resources at a time when they're generally more
available, distributing reminders at a specific time, executing
jobs that need to run at a time when the user has no intention of
being actively connected to the system and executing jobs that are
dependent on resources becoming available at a specific time.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x158c580.0x1684c38"></a>at's Features</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>at</b></span> is actually a collection
of related programs that allow Linux users to schedule and manage
the execution of deferred jobs. If you're thinking at is only
suitable for noninteractive tasks, you are correct. Programs
scheduled through at are expected to be capable of running as
background processes, since at does not associate user-display
devices with executing jobs. Users generally find the at
command-line interface to be quite intuitive. Yet, it is expressive
enough to meet any conceivable scheduling requirement. Before
presenting examples of the command-line interface, let's summarize
the basic services provided by at. It allows for scheduling the
execution of a job at a specific time/date, displaying information
about jobs currently scheduled, canceling a job currently scheduled
and administrating the list of users that have permission to use at
programs.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x158c580.0x1684d98"></a>Using at</h2></div></div><p>The examples presented here assume you have a basic
familiarity with shell command execution and Bourne shell syntax.
Each of the examples were tested on a Red Hat Linux 7 (2.3 kernel)
platform. However, I would expect the examples to work as presented
on all common distributions.</p><p>Obviously, the most fundamental capability offered by at is
that of scheduling the execution of a program at some later time.
Generally installed at /usr/bin/at, the basic command-line syntax
for the at program is as follows:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
at [options] TIME [DATE] &lt; bourne-shell-file
</pre><p>This syntax implies the following alternate ways of invoking
at would work as well:
<pre     class="programlisting">
cat bourne-shell-file | at [options] TIME [DATE]
at [options] TIME [DATE]
## Anything normally accepted by the bourne shell
## interpreter will be accepted. Terminate with
## Ctrl-D (^d)
statement 1
statement 2
statement 3
statement 4
^d
</pre>


The first significant detail here is the proper notation for the
time and date. The date is always optional. When it's omitted from
the command line, the date is assumed to be the next day the
specified time will occur, that is, either today or tomorrow. For
example, if the time is specified as 1:30 <b  >P.M.</b>
and it's already 4:30 <b  >P.M.</b>, the job will be
scheduled for the next day at 1:30 <b  >P.M</b>.
<span   class="bold"><b>at</b></span> accepts a time/date notation
that extends the POSIX.2 standards. That notation may be documented
on your installation under the /usr/doc directory in a file called
timespec.
</p><p>Let's learn through some examples. The time/date
specification examples in Table 1 will give you a good idea of what
the at program will accept.</p><p><a href="4719t1.html" target="_self">Table 1. Possible Time/Date
Entries</a></p><p>As shown, the at program accepts a fairly rich and intuitive
notation. It attempts to interpret the time/date specified by
parsing its command-line arguments from left to right. If its
time/date specification is violated, a &ldquo;Garbled time&rdquo; error
diagnostic is displayed&lt; and the program terminates. It usually
provides a terse hint as to why it became troubled. For example,
review the following invocation attempt below:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ at 6am Mar 32
Error in day of month. Last token seen: 32
Garbled time
$
</pre><p>The following invocation succeeds at scheduling a job.
Consider the third usage scenario outlined above for this
submission:
<pre     class="programlisting">
$ at 1pm friday
warning: commands will be executed using /bin/sh
    STAFF="moe larry curly"
    cd mail
    mail -s"Meeting Reminder" $STAFF &lt; friday_agenda.txt
    ^d
job 6 at Fri Apr  13 13:00:00 2001
$
</pre>


If you're following closely, some questions should begin to
formulate. Do the standard output and standard error streams of a
scheduled job get captured somewhere? All standard output and
standard error diagnostics are captured by the at service
(/usr/sbin/atd program) and e-mailed to the submitting user when
the scheduled job finishes. The e-mail will appear with a subject
heading such as the following:
</p><p>Subject: Output from your job 17</p><p>Are we limited to scheduling Bourne shell scripts? As the
feedback from the example above indicates, at uses the system
Bourne shell program (/bin/sh) to interpret the user-provided
program statements. Therefore, anything you would type at a Bourne
shell prompt would be valid, including a Bourne shell script or the
launch of any executable found in your environment, even a
different language interpreter. Review the following example for
scheduling the execution of a Perl script:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ at 6pm tomorrow
warning: commands will be executed using /bin/sh
    perl /home/moe/perls/script1.pl
    ^d
job 28 at Wed Apr  18 18:00:00 2001
$
</pre><p>What system users/groups get assigned to the scheduled
process? What attributes of the job submission environment are
preserved and carried over into the job execution environment?
Discovering how a utility provides a service behind the curtains is
usually not of interest to most users. In the case of at, however,
an actual example of what the utility does is fairly simple to
follow and shows what's possible, what isn't and why. Every
scheduled job results in a generated Bourne shell script placed
under the /var/spool/at/ directory. These generated scripts are
comprised of the following sections:
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Program comments that provide some clues as to
which user is notified when the job completes. Also, the effective
user and group ID assigned to the job is specified.</p></li><li><p>umask setting dictates how new files/directories
should be created.</p></li><li><p>A full listing of environment variable assignments
at the time the job was submitted (except those related to display
devices, such as TERM and DISPLAY).</p></li><li><p>The current directory changes to where the user was
when the task was scheduled. If that directory does not exist when
the job executes, the job aborts and an e-mail notification is
sent.</p></li><li><p>An appended copy of the program text that was
submitted to at.</p></li></ul></div>

</p><p>With this in mind, Listing 1 is an abbreviated example of a
script generated on behalf of a job scheduled by our user Moe. To
complete our command-line interface description of the at program,
see Table 2 for some of its more useful command-line
options.</p><p><a href="4719l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1. Sample&mdash;Moe's
Job</a></p><p><a href="4719t2.html" target="_self">Table 2. Command-Line
Options</a></p><p>The following is another example of scheduling a job with
at:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ at -mf /home/curly/shells/program1  6pm tomorrow
warning: commands will be executed using /bin/sh
job 29 at Thu Apr  12 18:00:00 2001
$
</pre><p>Two other programs are tied to the basic at program: atq and
atrm. As you might guess, atq lists jobs currently scheduled while
atrm cancels one or more specified jobs. While the root user is
capable of viewing and canceling any and all jobs, nonroot users
can only view and cancel what they schedule.
</p><p>Listing 2 shows an example of the output displayed by atq, as
viewed by the root user (I inserted the field labels for better
readability&mdash;unfortunately the Linux implementation of atq does not
provide them).</p><p><a href="4719l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2. Sample atq
Output</a></p><p>Rank is a unique sequence value used to identify scheduled
jobs to other at programs. In addition to the scheduled time and
the submitting user, a queue value is listed. Unless the user
specified otherwise, jobs are placed on the &ldquo;a&rdquo; queue. (Reference
the on-line manual page for the implications of specifying an
alternate queue value to the at program&mdash;it essentially controls
the runtime priority of the job.)
<span   class="bold"><b>atq</b></span> qualifies currently running
jobs with a &ldquo;=&rdquo; value in the queue field. So job 17, seen in
Table 3, is currently executing.</p><p>What if a user submits a job and then realizes either the
time and/or program is incorrect? The atrm utility can be used to
remove one or more scheduled jobs. For example, the root user could
cancel the first and second jobs listed in Table 3 with the
following command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
atrm 18 19
</pre><p><span   class="bold"><b>atrm</b></span> provides no feedback. A
subsequent atq listing would then display a queue like the one in
Listing 3.
</p><p><a href="4719l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3. Revised Sample atq
Output</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x158c580.0x1a7e1c8"></a>Administering at</h2></div></div><p>If your attempt to use one of the at programs produces the
following diagnostic: &ldquo;You do not have permission to use at&rdquo;, you
need to contact your local SA. Linux SAs can manage at with a fair
amount of flexibility.</p><p>As you might expect, the root user has absolute permission to
use the at utility and can grant the same permission to nonroot
users. Two system files, /etc/at.allow and /etc/at.deny, control
access to the at utility. Table 3 shows how their presence and
content determines users' permission on a given system.</p><p><a href="4719t3.html" target="_self">Table 3. Controlling User Access to
at</a></p><p>Note that if the /etc/at.allow files exist, /etc/at.deny is
completely ignored. Users are identified in both files by their
Linux login, each appearing on a separate line.
<span   class="bold"><b>at</b></span> does not provide a command-line
utility to control the content of these files. SAs generally select
their favorite text editor and manually edit the files as needed.
This hardly can be considered a shortcoming, though, given the
likely infrequency of change.</p><p>To summarize, nonroot users can be explicitly or implicitly
assigned or denied permission to use at. SAs either can choose to
manage access to at by exclusion or inclusion. Select the approach
that makes the most sense for your particular installation. For
example, a highly sensitive production site probably should be
managed based on inclusion (i.e., nonroot users do not have
permission unless it's explicitly granted&mdash;the /etc/at.allow file
exists). Conversely, the Linux default configuration might be fine
for most development/test environments (i.e., nonroot users have
permission unless it's explicitly denied&mdash;/etc/at.allow does not
exist and /etc/at.deny has zero or more entries).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x158c580.0x1a7e4e0"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>Collectively, the at programs offer an intuitive way to
manage the deferred execution of applications. Despite its
simplicity and usefulness, the at utility is often ignored by Linux
administrators and developers. Other less frequently used at
command-line options exist that I chose not to cover here. I
encourage you to review the at manual page by typing <b  >man
at</b> at your favorite shell's prompt to review all details.
Also, most Linux overview books provide some coverage of at and
similar programs, such as O'Reilly's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux in a
Nutshell</em></span> by Ellen Siever, et. al.</p><p><a href="4719s1.html" target="_self">Miscellaneous at
