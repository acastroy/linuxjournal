Expense</h2></div></div><p>Netcraft's July Web Server Survey
(<a href="http://www.netcraft.com/survey" target="_self">netcraft.com/survey</a>)
showed a huge jump in Microsoft IIS' share of web server software
usage on 31,299,592 surveyed net-connected computers. After
reaching a plateau of around 20% in 1998, IIS suddenly jumped
nearly 5% to 25.88%. Apache reciprocally declined by 4.29% to
58.73%. Microsoft's gain represented about 2% of all active sites
on the Web.</p><p>Netcraft attributed the gain to a single event: the
conversion of domain registrar Namezero's servers from Solaris to
Windows 2000 and from Apache to IIS, along with a related move by
part of Network Solutions' domain registration system. Network
Solutions also moved physically from Digex to Interland (where
Microsoft has held a minority interest). &ldquo;These large
installations had previously been masking a general decline in
Solaris share on the Web, which is now down four percentage points
over the last year&rdquo;, Netcraft reported. &ldquo;Additionally, the
Network Solutions site was by far the largest Netscape-Enterprise
installation in terms of numbers of hostnames, and one would expect
that Netscape-Enterprise overall share will drop toward the 2-2.5%
it has in the active sites analysis over the next few
months.&rdquo;</p><p>The previous month's survey also showed a shift in Windows'
direction, again at Solaris' expense. In that survey, which
attempted to count computers rather than hosts, Netcraft found that
49% of the surveyed computers were running Windows. Linux accounts
for about 28%. And, all UNIX-related computers accounted for 45%.
The remaining 6% were non-UNIX or unknown. &ldquo;As some of the 3.6% of
computers not identified by Netcraft operating system detector will
in reality be Windows systems&rdquo;, Netcraft reported, &ldquo;it would be
fair to say about half of public web servers world-wide are run on
Microsoft operating systems.&rdquo;</p><p>Netcraft also reported that Linux &ldquo;has been consistently
gaining share since this survey started but, interestingly, not
significantly to Windows' detriment. Operating systems that have
lost share have been Solaris and other proprietary operating
systems, and to a small degree BSD.&rdquo;</p><p>The significant interpretation of the data, Netcraft
suggests, is that Solaris is &ldquo;being continually chased further and
further up market by Intel-based operating systems, with Sun in
turn progressively eliminating the other proprietary UNIX operating
systems.&rdquo;</p><p>&mdash;Doc Searls</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2800580.0x28f9c60"></a>OpenPGP Signatures: the New Baseball
Cards?</h2></div></div><p>How well-connected are you? Drew Streib can tell you to four
decimal places. Drew, who now runs an OpenPGP keyserver in addition
to his other thankless tasks, is currently publishing monthly
reports on how closely OpenPGP users are connected to the Web of
Trust. His math, based on earlier calculations by Neal McBurnett,
is complicated, but the result is a current map of the community's
Web of Trust.</p><p>Closest to the center of the Web are crypto luminaries and
organizers of keys-signing events, including Peter N. Wan, Ingmar
Camphausen and Theodore Ts'o. Philip R. Zimmermann, who wrote the
original PGP, is only number 24.</p><p>Drew's report comes at an exciting time for encrypted mail.
GNU Privacy Guard, a free OpenPGP implementation, is available in
common distributions, support in popular mailers such as mutt makes
encryption convenient to use and the FBI's much-publicized
Carnivore snooping system certainly hasn't hurt.</p><p>Signing people's keys to do better in Drew's rankings might
seem like a pointless game, but it really does expand the Web of
Trust. You can never lose juice by exchanging signatures with
someone else, and it helps everyone's ability to send trusted,
encrypted mail. Even if you sign the key of some &ldquo;lamer&rdquo; at the
bottom of the list, you'll both move up next month. (As for me, I
got a Theodore Ts'o! Look out next month.)</p><p>Get started with PGP using the free implementation, GNU

about</h2></div></div><p>On Monday, July 30, 2001 the US Copyright Office convened the
Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel (yes, CARP,
<a href="http://www.loc.gov/copyright/carp" target="_self">loc.gov/copyright/carp</a>)
to make a decision shortly on conditions under which webcasters
will be required to make royalty payments. The results could be
highly inconvenient for webcasters of all kinds. Howard Greenstein,
a webcasting pioneer, puts it this way in his weblog:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Webcasters, many of whom have been accounting for
what they have estimated they would have to pay under a negotiated
compulsory license (and putting aside revenue for years) are about
to find out (within 60 days) what it will cost them. Unless, of
course, they are an &ldquo;interactive&rdquo; station. If you're a standard
station under the Digital Millenium Copyright Act, you play music
in a certain way. You don't give people much choice about what they
hear.</p></blockquote></div><p>Yet the number of streaming sources on the Net runs into
uncounted thousands (or perhaps millions). What's more, many of
these are far more interactive than traditional broadcasting has
ever been or can even comprehend. What's the news for them? Easy:
work outside the system.
</p><p>That's what KPIG has been doing since it became the first
commercial radio station ever to broadcast on the Web. KPIG
broadcasts from (no kidding) Freedom, California on 107-oink-5 on
the FM band. On the Web, however, KPIG is a virtual Idaho. Its
128KB MP3 stream is one of the Web's hi-fi music beacons. So are
the half-dozen or so other streams the station puts out at various
speeds for various clients and bandwidths (and with content other
than KPIG alone). Naturally (their site reports) they digitize that
content on a Linux PC with an open-source LAME MP3 encoder
(<a href="http://www.mp3dev.org/mp3" target="_self">mp3dev.org/mp3</a>).</p><p>KPIG, which once described its format as &ldquo;mutant cowboy rock
and roll&rdquo;, is one of the few remaining commercial stations where
the disc jockeys still choose the music, and community ties are so
close it's hard to tell where the station ends and its constituency
begins. As a successful business (it has always done pretty well in
the ratings and sells plenty of advertising), KPIG also has managed
to remain both artist- and industry-friendly. Every song the
station plays is listed live on the Web, along with links that make
it easy to buy the CD, research the artist or follow a tour
schedule. Without a doubt, KPIG owns the high-mud mark for
combining commercial success, community involvement, resourceful
use of free and open-source software and adaptiveness to a
surreally perverse environment.</p><p>The hacker in chief at KPIG is &ldquo;Wild Bill&rdquo; Goldsmith, one
of KPIG's Founding Farmers and the proprietor of RadioParadise.com.
Unencumbered by the need to participate in the fully regulated
environment of commercial broadcasting, Radio Paradise is beating a
path through the uncharted wilderness where artists and technically
smart connoisseurs will rebuild their own industry from the outside
in. Asked for the technical angle on Radio Paradise, Bill
writes:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>[Radio Paradise is] based on a set of software
tools&mdash;for picking and scheduling music and doing voice tracks from
anywhere over the Net, and for accepting and organizing listener
feedback on my playlist. Everything I'm doing software-wise is 100%
open source: Linux, PHP, Perl, Postgres, and Icecast.
</p><p>I am convinced that what you see at
<a href="http://www.radioparadise.com" target="_self">radioparadise.com</a>
represents the future of radio, or of quality radio, anyway: very
interactive, tightly controlled artistically (no random segues,
everything happens for a reason)--completely free from the
influences of the radio/music industry hype machine (to the best of
my ability, anyway)--and supported primarily by voluntary
contributions from listeners.</p><p>This isn't a game plan that's going to make anyone rich. But
it can make it possible for anyone with talent to make a very
comfortable living without compromizing their integrity in any
way&mdash;and that's all I for one have ever wanted.</p></blockquote></div><p>I'm an old radio freak and have been a fan of KPIG and its
ancestors going back to the Sixties. Living, breathing radio
stations like KPIG, run by people who love the business more for
the good it does than for the money it makes, have gone out like
candles in the rain&mdash;first one by one, then by the dozens and
finally by the thousands.
</p><p>It's not surprising to find a hacker starting a bonfire with
the last candle that stands.</p><p>&mdash;Doc Searls</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2800580.0x2cf28a8"></a>They Said It</h2></div></div><p>Sober nations have all at once become desperate gamblers and

laws, they still violate the integrity of the Web. Part of the
appeal of the Web is that it allows anyone to publish anything, to
take their thoughts, feelings and opinions and put them before the
world with no censors or marketroids in the way. By adding Smart
Tags to web pages, Microsoft is interposing itself between authors
and their audience. Microsoft told Walter Mossberg, &ldquo;The feature

deciding how authors should write, and how developers should build,
web sites.</p><p>&mdash;Chris Kaminski</p><p>Intellectual property (IP) has been driving the species for

brandishing a tube of Preparation H.</p><p>&mdash;Christopher Locke</p><p>We are natural villagers. For most of mankind's history we
have lived in very small communities in which we knew everybody and
everybody knew us. But gradually there grew to be far too many of
us, and our communities became too large and disparate for us to be
able to feel a part of them, and our technologies were unequal to
the task of drawing us together. But that is changing.</p><p>&mdash;Douglas Adams</p></div></div>
