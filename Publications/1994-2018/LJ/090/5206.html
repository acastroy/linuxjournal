can find about Kylix in anticipation of trying it out one of these
days. However, I was disappointed in Petr Sorfa's review of the
product (<i  >LJ</i> August 2001 issue), in particular
with his unsupported assertion that &ldquo;the main problem, of course,
is the Object Pascal programming language itself.&rdquo;</p><p>If that's the main problem with the product, at least say
why. As far as I can tell from the review his major problem with
the language was &ldquo;getting used to the := symbol for assigning
variable values&rdquo;. Big deal&mdash;all new languages take some getting
used to.</p><p>Methinks there's some C++ snobbery here. Object Pascal is,
admittedly, a proprietary language (like Java), which is what he
may be getting at. However, it is a full-featured, object-oriented
language similar to Java in features and general approach (with the
exception of Java's automatic garbage collection). I think it
deserves a little respect.</p><p>&mdash;Tom HavilandTHAVILAN@suss.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d45580.0x1e3d348"></a>Geek Disclaimer</h2></div></div><p>I've been interested to read the Geek Law column in the last
couple of issues of <i  >LJ</i>. While I wasn't
surprised to see a disclaimer at the end of each column, I was
surprised that there's no mention of the advice being relevant only
to the US legal system. While the articles so far have mentioned
Congress and the US, I think it would be helpful for it to be
stated explicitly that the author is writing from the point of US
law.</p><p>Even in the UK (from where I am writing), we have three
different judicial systems: one for England and Wales, one for
Scotland and one for Northern Ireland. There's no guarantee that
something that is legal in England and Wales is legal in Scotland,
for example.</p><p>&mdash;Martin Radfordmartin@zamenhof.demon.co.uk</p><p>Who says one voice can't make a difference? Larry reminds us
that not only does law vary nation to nation, but even within the
US from state to state. He has modified the disclaimer.</p><p>&mdash;Editor</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d45580.0x1e3d608"></a>Ditch the French</h2></div></div><p>I have to comment on the Cooking with Linux column by Marcel
Gagn&eacute;. The French chef gag is funny for about two minutes.
Then it becomes tiresome. Another few minutes and it becomes
downright irritating. By the time I finish a column, I'm ready to
lock Fran&ccedil;ois in the wine cellar and throw away the key. So
I seldom finish the column, which is a shame because otherwise it's
well written and interesting. Please, Marcel, consider ditching the
gag.</p><p>&mdash;Daniel D. Jonesetc-daniel.d.jones@cnet.navy.mil</p><p>Mon cher ami, perhaps the ungarnished and simple shipboard
food you enjoy in the navy has influenced your palate. Some people
like a little French seasoning with their technical staples. Linux
isn't all free bi&egrave;re&mdash;un peu du vin est n&eacute;cessaire
aussi.</p><p>&mdash;Editor</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d45580.0x1e3d818"></a>Surprised but Unoffended</h2></div></div><p>I am surprised that one of your readers should be offended by
a biblical reference in the June 2001 Best of Technical Support,
page 96. Perhaps Noel Moss has nothing better to do than to take it
upon him/herself to try to curtail the author's first amendment
right to freedom of the press, regardless of literary intent. I'm
certain the reader would not have been offended if the reference
had come from the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Koran</em></span>, or the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Book
of the Dead</em></span>, rather than the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Bible</em></span>.
I read <i  >Linux Journal</i> cover to cover and have
not once been offended by its content. Keep up the good
work.</p><p>&mdash;Paul Barkerpdbarker@nevinslake.com</p><p>Thanks Paul, I was beginning to think there were no
unoffended readers left.</p><p>&mdash;Editor</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d45580.0x1e3db88"></a>Searching for Open Kylix</h2></div></div><p>The August 2001 issue of <i  >Linux Journal</i>
