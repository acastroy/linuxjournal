    Reuven takes a detour this month and shows you how to bridge the

    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x267d580.0x27756b8"></a></h2></div></div><p>Over the last few months, we have been
looking at server-side Java programming from a variety of
perspectives. From servlets to JSPs to the Enhydra application
server, we've seen several different ways to create dynamic,
database-driven web sites using open-source Java
technologies.</p><p>I had originally planned to continue in that vein this month,
looking at Enhydra's intriguing DODS object-to-relational modeling
software. DODS provides a high-level Java abstraction layer for
tables in a relational database. DODS methods are translated
automatically into the appropriate SQL, which is then handed to the
database. The result: you see Java objects and methods, your
database sees tables and SQL, and everyone is happy.</p><p>Unfortunately, the help and goodwill expressed by folks at
Lutris (the corporate backer of Enhydra) were no match for the
Israeli customs service and our local branch of FedEx. The CD and
book with additional explanations of DODS sit in a warehouse as I
write this, forcing me to take a short detour from my original
plan.</p><p>However, investigating DODS for this month's article revived
my interest in the subject of object-relational mappings. One of
the most interesting and easy-to-use tools that I've seen for this
purpose is Alzabo, a set of Perl modules that allows server-side
Perl programmers to wrap their relational database schemata inside
of an object. (The project is named for a creature in the science
fiction work of Gene Wolfe.) I was quite impressed by what I saw
and believe that many Perl programmers will be equally happy to
discover such a powerful tool.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x267d580.0x27758c8"></a>The Problem</h2></div></div><p>Programmers have reaped many benefits by working with
objects, from reusability to inheritance to encapsulation. But
while programmers have taken to object-oriented programming in
droves, object databases have been less popular for a variety of
reasons. Instead, relational databases have become increasingly
popular over the last few years, with huge quantities of data being
placed within them. The problem, then, is how we can model our data
as objects, while storing them as tables.</p><p>One possibility is to model each table as a class, each table
column as an instance variable and each table row as an instance of
that class. But anyone who has tried this quickly discovers it is
easier said than done, particularly when creating web
applications&mdash;how can we join two tables? What happens when two
programs modify the same row in memory and only later commit those
changes to the database? How can we ensure that changes to our
class definition are reflected in the database and vice
versa?</p><p>Another possibility is to read an entire table into an object
instance, modifying the object and writing it out when a particular
method is invoked. This works pretty well for small tables, but
what happens when your tables become several megabytes (or
gigabytes or terabytes) in size? Your boss might be willing to buy
more memory for the web server but not if you're wasting it all
reading entire tables into memory! Besides, modeling tables inside
of your object means you also have to create a decent locking
mechanism, complete with commits and rollbacks&mdash;something that most
programmers are equipped to do.</p><p>We can easily dismiss these problems when working on a small
application. But as applications and databases scale up, we want to
ensure that things will work as expected. This is particularly true
when creating an object-to-relational mapping system, such as
Alzabo. One of my employees and I created a simple
object-to-relational mapping middleware layer last year and were
very happy with what we had done&mdash;until we found that we hadn't
taken nearly enough corner cases into account, ending up with a
mess of exceptions and default values.</p><p>Luckily for the Perl programmers among us, Dave Rolsky took
the time to sit down and map out all of these problems, as well as
many others. Alzabo gives us an object-oriented middleware layer
that removes our need to interact directly with a database.</p><p>But Alzabo does more than provide a high-level interface to
your database. It also gives you a programmatic way to modify your
database schema definitions, including a browser-based table
creation and maintenance tool that creates SQL for you
automatically. Moreover, Alzabo can take an existing database and
reverse-engineer it, allowing you to use Alzabo with existing
databases as well as new ones.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x267d580.0x2775b88"></a>Installing Alzabo</h2></div></div><p>Like most Perl modules, Alzabo is available for download from
CPAN. However, installing Alzabo can be more complicated than other
modules, simply because Alzabo depends on many modules. Not only
does Alzabo require the use of DBI (for database access) and either
DBD::mysql or DBD::Pg (for PostgreSQL), but the browser-based
schema-creation tool uses HTML::Mason, which in turn requires
mod_perl. If all of these are installed on your system, then
installing Alzabo should be relatively straightforward.</p><p>I was able to install Alzabo without too much difficulty,
using the CPAN modules to download and install automatically each
of the prerequisites and then Alzabo itself.</p><p>I accepted the default values for almost all of the questions
asked during the software's configuration and installation, with
the exception of the .mhtml suffix that Alzabo assumes you use for
Mason components. I normally give Mason components the simple .html
suffix; because my Apache configuration didn't know what to do with
the .mhtml extension, it sent them as Content-type text/plain,
displaying the Mason component's source code in my browser window.
Changing the suffix of the installed Mason components to .html
worked on my computer, but I could have modified my Mason or Apache
configuration just as easily.</p><p>Alzabo tracks each schema in its own directory, called
/usr/local/alzabo by default. Inside of this directory is a
schemata directory, with a single subdirectory for each of the
database schemata that Alzabo is modeling. For example, the
appointments schemata would be in
/usr/local/alzabo/schemas/appointments.</p><p>There were two small hitches in my Alzabo installation that I
had to fix. First, I had to change the permissions
/usr/local/alzabo so that my web user could read and write to it.
Secondly, I had to modify my PostgreSQL startup script to include
the -i option, so that clients could connect via the network. By
default, most PostgreSQL installations (including RPM versions) do
not turn on -i, meaning that even the most liberal configuration in
pg_hba.conf (the PostgreSQL host access control file) will fail to
work. While you normally can connect to PostgreSQL without the
network using UNIX sockets, Alzabo always specifies a hostname,
which in turn requires a network connection even on the local
computer.</p><p>To install the web-based schema generator, at least one
directory under your Apache server must be controlled by
HTML::Mason. The Alzabo installation script will create a
new/alzabo subdirectory there, along with the Mason components that
create and modify the schema definitions that you create. My
workstation, for instance, has all of its Mason components in
/usr/local/apache/mason, which is mapped to URLs beginning with
/mason. The web part of my Alzabo installation is thus in
/usr/local/apache/mason/alzabo, accessible via the URL
/mason/alzabo. If you have not done so already, you may wish to
tell Apache (via the DirectoryIndex directive) that index.mhtml is
an acceptable index page for a directory.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x267d580.0x2775e48"></a>Editing Schemas</h2></div></div><p>Now that we have installed Alzabo, let's create a simple
database schema using the browser-based design tool. Admittedly
this is not as slick as commercial or client-side tools, but it
does the job rather well.</p><p>Begin by creating a new schema (known in PostgreSQL and MySQL
parlance as a database) to which you must give a name. The schema
must be a legitimate database name within either PostgreSQL or
MySQL. I choose to work with PostgreSQL because of its built-in
referential integrity, foreign keys, views and triggers, as well as
a more standard dialect of SQL and the ability to write stored
procedures in a variety of languages.</p><p>Let's create a simple phone book and appointment calendar
using Alzabo. We will keep track of people we know, their addresses
and telephone numbers, and appointments we have scheduled with
them. Using this database, we can learn about the people with whom
we're meeting on a given day or about all of the appointments with
a given person.</p><p>To create this schema, we point our web browser at the URL
alzabo/schema under the Mason directory we mentioned earlier (on my
computer, I pointed the browser to
http://localhost/mason/alzabo/schema.) This brings up the schema
creation/editing page that allows us to edit an existing schema,
create a new one or reverse-engineer an existing one. While the
last option is the most interesting, allowing you to access legacy
databases using Alzabo, we will create a new schema. I entered the
name (I chose addressbook, for lack of a better idea) and indicated
that we wish to use PostgreSQL as our back-end database.</p><p>After clicking on &ldquo;submit&rdquo;, several possibilities were
presented: I could add a new table to this schema, delete the
entire schema or examine the SQL that Alzabo will generate
automatically. Right now, of course, there isn't any SQL to
display. Over time, we will see this SQL grow considerably.</p><p>However, because Alzabo has not created any SQL doesn't mean
that no work has been done on the back end. Indeed, Alzabo
automatically created the addressbook directory within
/usr/local/alzabo/schemas, containing three files:
addressbook.create.alz and addressbook.runtime.alz (both are stored
in a binary format) and addressbook.rdbms, which contains the
single word PostgreSQL. In this way, Alzabo tracks the database
server in which the schema is stored.</p><p>Once inside the addressbook schema, I added a &ldquo;People&rdquo;
table by entering &ldquo;People&rdquo; in the &ldquo;add a table&rdquo; text field and
clicking on &ldquo;submit&rdquo;. (PostgreSQL ignores case in table and
column names, but I like Joe Celko's convention of initial caps for
Table Names, all lowercase for column names and all caps for SQL
RESERVED WORDS.)</p><p>Within my People table, I created columns, each of a
different data type. Alzabo offers a menu of potential data types,
but we can enter our own if we want; this can be particularly
useful in PostgreSQL, which allows us to create our own data
types.</p><p>I generally prefer to work with synthetic primary keys in
such a table, giving each row its own value. In PostgreSQL, we
accomplish this using the SERIAL data type. But you will notice
that no such data type exists in the Alzabo selection list. You
might be tempted to indicate that this is an INTEGER column and to
mark the &ldquo;sequenced&rdquo; check box at the bottom of the column
editor. Doing so, however, will create an INTEGER column, as well
as a totally unrelated PostgreSQL sequence object. Rather, to get a
synthetic primary key you must manually enter SERIAL in the text
field below the &lt;select&gt; list of column types.</p><p>An additional check box lets you indicate if a column is the
primary key and automatically marks it with &ldquo;pk&rdquo; in column
listings. And a third check box allows you to indicate if a column
may contain NULL values, a subtle way of reminding new database
designers that NULLs complicate life and should be avoided whenever
possible.</p><p>To create a foreign key (REFERENCES) or CHECK clause, add it
in the &ldquo;attributes&rdquo; text fields toward the bottom of the HTML
form. Remember that you're only modeling the schema in Perl at this
point, meaning that you will be free to add and remove such clauses
in the future without having to send ALTER TABLE queries to the
database. You also can create indices on one or more columns using
the Alzabo editor.</p><p>You can use the Alzabo table and column editors to create
many tables and columns, moving between them using a set of
hierarchical menus and listings. The Alzabo display even places
&ldquo;&lt;&rdquo; and &ldquo;&gt;&rdquo; marks next to each column, allowing you to
move them relative to each other within a particular
definition.</p><p>As you work with the browser-based schema editor, I suggest
that you occasionally preview the SQL that Alzabo generates. Not
only will this ensure that Alzabo is doing the right thing (as we
saw with the SERIAL column), but it will give you a better sense of
the low-level details your schema is creating.</p><p>After you have finished creating the schema, use the
&ldquo;execute SQL&rdquo; button from within the &ldquo;SQL preview&rdquo; page to send
your SQL to the database server. If the database server returns any
errors, Alzabo will produce a lengthy and detailed error message
describing what happened.</p><p>In some cases, you may need to fix your table or column
definitions, while in others you may need to ensure that the server
is running with the correct permissions. Also ensure that you have
defined a PostgreSQL user (created with the command-line createuser
program) whose name matches the username under which Apache runs,
unless you explicitly name another user in the HTML form.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x267d580.0x2776420"></a>Using Our Schema from a Program</h2></div></div><p>Once you execute the SQL from within the schema editor, you
have two ways to access the data. You may, of course, access it
directly using DBI (or a similar interface from another language),
creating and executing SQL queries.</p><p>For example, let's assume that I have created my addressbook
schema with the following table:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
CREATE TABLE People (
    person_id    SERIAL    NOT NULL,
    first_name   TEXT      NOT NULL,
    last_name    TEXT      NOT NULL,
    birthday     DATE      NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY(person_id)
);
</pre><p>In order to make things a bit more interesting, let's
populate our table with some values:
<pre     class="programlisting">
INSERT INTO People (first_name, last_name, birthday)
VALUES ('Reuven', 'Lerner',
'1970-Jul-14');
INSERT INTO People (first_name, last_name, birthday)
VALUES ('Atara Margalit', 'Lerner-Friedman',
        '2000-Dec-16');
</pre>


Listing 1 contains a simple Perl program that uses DBI to retrieve
the names (and birthdays) of people in our addressbook who match
the SQL pattern entered on the command line. (SQL patterns are much
simpler than UNIX regular expressions&mdash;there are only two
characters: % matches zero or more characters and _ matches exactly
one character.)
</p><p><a href="4887l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1.
retrieve-today-birthday.pl, which uses DBI to retrieve the names of
people in our addressbook table whose birthdays are
today.</a></p><p>We retrieve the user's input on the command line and place %
signs before and after it to ensure that the string will match,
regardless of where it occurs in the first_name or last_name
column. Then we connect to the database, turning on AutoCommit (as
the DBI documentation encourages us to do) and activating the
RaiseError and PrintError diagnostic aids.</p><p>Finally, we create our SQL query in the $sql variable, making
sure to use placeholders (&ldquo;?&rdquo;) instead of directly interpolating
variables. Not only does this reduce the risk of someone messing
with our SQL, but some database drivers will take advantage of our
placeholders in subsequent queries, giving us a speed boost.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x267d580.0x27767e8"></a>Rewriting in Alzabo</h2></div></div><p>Let's rewrite this program using Alzabo instead of straight
DBI. We won't write the SQL ourselves or connect to the database
ourselves. Rather, we will create a new schema object, naming the
schema that we created with Alzabo's interactive tool. This object
has a number of methods that let us perform many of the tasks for
which we would otherwise use DBI.</p><p>As you can see from Listing 2, there are not many differences
between the two versions until we connect to the data source. In
the DBI version of the program, we connected to the data source
itself with <b  >DBI-&gt;connect</b>. In Alzabo, however,
we connect to a schema, which is presumably attached to a database,
and assign it to the object $schema.</p><p><a href="4887l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2.
retrieve-birthday-alzabo.pl, an Alzabo implementation of the
program in Listing 1.</a></p><p>Using $schema, we retrieve a table object associated with one
of our tables:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
my $people = $schema-&gt;table("People");
</pre><p>Now that we have an object mapped to our People table, we can
retrieve selected rows from the table. The easiest way to retrieve
rows is with the rows_where method. This returns a single object of
type Alzabo::Runtime::RowCursor:
<pre     class="programlisting">
my $row_cursor =
    $people-&gt;rows_where
        (where =&gt; [[$people-&gt;column('first_name'),
                   'LIKE', $look_for_name],
                 'or',
                 [$people-&gt;column('last_name'),
                  'LIKE',
                  $look_for_name]]);
</pre>


Alzabo's WHERE clauses usually consist of a three-element list: a
column object, a comparison operator and a value or second column
object. We can compare the first_name column for equality with
Zaphod with:
<pre     class="programlisting">
where =&gt; [$table-&gt;column('first_name'), '=',
'Zaphod']
</pre>


In Listing 2, we have made this a bit more complicated, linking two
array references with the OR boolean operator:
<pre     class="programlisting">
where =&gt; [[$people-&gt;column('first_name'),
           'LIKE', $look_for_name],
          'or',
          [$people-&gt;column('last_name'),
           'LIKE', $look_for_name]]
</pre>


Alzabo is smart enough to realize that the first and third elements
of its WHERE clause are array references, and it turns the above
code into the appropriate SQL.
</p><p>Once we have our RowCursor object, we iterate through each
row with the next_row method:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
while (my $row = $row_cursor-&gt;next_row)
{
   my $first_name = $row-&gt;select('first_name');
   my $last_name = $row-&gt;select('last_name');
   my $birthday = $row-&gt;select('birthday');
   print "$first_name $last_name
          (birthday: $birthday)\n";
   $rows_returned++;
}
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x267d580.0x276d5a0"></a>Caches and Exceptions</h2></div></div><p>If Alzabo simply provided a set of methods that create SQL,
it wouldn't be a very powerful tool. However, Alzabo provides
caching and exception-handling as part of its suite of tools,
making it easier in some ways to work with databases.</p><p>Alzabo's caching functionality keeps a table in memory rather
than returning to the database server each time we request a value
from it. Obviously, caching isn't appropriate for tables that
change on a regular basis, but for tables that rarely change, you
can activate the cache and enjoy a nice boost in speed.</p><p>You can activate caching by loading the Alzabo::ObjectCache
module in your program. The RowCursor object, which we used to
retrieve rows in Listing 2, returns Row objects with each iteration
of the next_row method. See the documentation for
Alzabo::Runtime::Row and Alzabo::ObjectCache for information about
the different kinds of caches available to you, as well as the
issues associated with them.</p><p>Alzabo also uses Perl's built-in exception-handling system,
meaning that it invokes &ldquo;die&rdquo; if something goes wrong. Therefore,
you should wrap your Alzabo-using programs (or individual calls
within them) in &ldquo;eval&rdquo; blocks:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# Try to run this code
eval {
    my $row_cursor =
        $people-&gt;rows_where(
            where =&gt; [[$people-&gt;column('first_name'),
                       'LIKE', $look_for_name],
                     'or',
                     [$people-&gt;column('last_name'),
                      'LIKE',
                      $look_for_name]]);
};
</pre><p>You can find out if something went wrong by checking the
special Perl variable $@, which is set if an error occurs within
the previous eval. But Alzabo uses the Exception::Class object
(available from CPAN) for more sophisticated exception-handling in
Perl. The $@ variable isn't set to a text string describing the
error, rather it is set to an instance of the appropriate exception
class. You can thus test $@ with UNIVERSAL::isa to determine just
what kind of object it is and what kind of problem occurred within
your code. The Mason component common/exception, installed under
the alzabo directory in your Mason-controlled Apache content
directory, demonstrates how to do this in detail.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x267d580.0x276d860"></a>Issues</h2></div></div><p>There are obviously costs associated with Alzabo, as with any
tool that tries to bridge the object-relational gap. For starters,
SQL is a fairly standard means for working with relational
databases. Using Alzabo means you will be moving away from that
standard and toward a different solution that is incompatible with
anything else. I'm not opposed to new ways of doing things, and
there are a number of significant advantages to using Alzabo. That
said, I'm always cautious about doing old, standard things in new,
nonstandard ways.</p><p>While I normally prefer to create my tables using handcrafted
SQL, that technique doesn't scale above 10 or 20 tables without
forcing me to scroll wildly within my Emacs buffer. Alzabo's
web-based schema design tool does make it easier to keep track of a
large number of tables to create relations between them and modify
them. I recently spent half an hour trying to remember how Oracle's
syntax was different from that of PostgreSQL and would have greatly
benefitted from a tool like Alzabo.</p><p>As we saw earlier, creating complex queries based on equality
isn't difficult within Alzabo, even when those queries include OR
and AND operators. The Alzabo::Runtime::Table object includes a
function method, which is meant for executing arbitrary SQL
functions. However, I found it difficult, and in some cases
impossible, to create Alzabo WHERE clauses that would let me create
an SQL query based on multiple function calls. I admit that I'm
relatively new to Alzabo and only tried it for an hour or two, but
a query that took me 20 seconds to write in SQL shouldn't take much
longer than that in Alzabo.</p><p>One of the more difficult issues when mapping objects to
relational databases has to do with joins. Joins make a lot of
sense when working with tables, but the meaning is less obvious
when working with objects. Alzabo does have some built-in support
for joins, but it is marked as being largely new and
experimental.</p><p>Finally, there is also a speed trade-off associated with any
middleware layer. The speed differences between Listings 1 and 2
were quite noticeable when I executed them from the command line,
owing in no small part to the fact that using Alzabo imports a
large number of Perl classes. In a mod_perl environment (where
Alzabo is designed to shine), the speed differences will be much
smaller, since much of the time is spent loading different modules
from disk. Because mod_perl compiles programs only once before
executing them, the speed difference between Alzabo and raw DBI
calls is probably not that great.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x267d580.0x276dac8"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>Alzabo provides a relatively simple way to wrap objects
around your relational database tables. There is a lot of good news
here: the data-modeling tool is quite sophisticated, there is a
large amount of nice functionality, the methods largely make sense,
and the documentation is vast and generally well written. As the
Open Source community has long said, using an existing,
battle-tested and open tool is almost always better than rolling a
new, proprietary package that solves the same problem.</p><p>But wrapping relational database tables inside of objects is
always fraught with danger and problems, and Alzabo is no
exception: joins are still clunky, and it's not clear how to create
some queries. Alzabo isn't at fault here; it's an inherent problem
when working with two technologies that see the world in different
ways.</p><p>It's certainly clear that I'll be using Alzabo in the future
for some of my server-side programs, particularly those that need
more sophisticated caching and exception-handling than I could
otherwise provide.</p><p>Next month, customs permitting, we will return to our tour of
server-side Java, comparing Enhydra's DODS package with Alzabo and
its kin.</p><p><a href="4887s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
