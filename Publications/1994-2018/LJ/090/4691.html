    BackupEDGE from Microlite is an excellent
    backup product.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24a3580.0x259b3f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>BackupEDGE from Microlite is an excellent
backup product. It has a flexible command-line and menu interface,
will back up over networks and can be used for disaster recovery.
Documentation is extensive and readily available. It is a
proprietary product, priced competitively. BackupEDGE uses existing
utilities in Linux, such as rsh or ssh and crontab for its
operations, making it easier to adjust BackupEDGE to live with
other programs.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24a3580.0x259b500"></a>Installation</h2></div></div><p>The product is delivered on CD-ROM. If your target computer
does not have a CD-ROM drive, you can make installation floppies on
another computer from the CD-ROM. You can even make floppies using
that other operating system from Redmond, and you can get a 60-day
evaluation copy via FTP. If you decide to buy, Microlite will send
you a key that makes your evaluation copy permanent.</p><p>The installation script is easy to use. It is a command-line
script with character graphics (see Figure 1), similar to the main
program. Arrow keys move the cursor from field to field, but the
tab key may not. I found the inconsistent responses to the Tab key
to be disconcerting. For text entry, you can toggle between insert
and overwrite modes using the Insert key on a standard PC keyboard,
which is very nice. I used that capability to prepend the type of
drive to the description of each tape drive. On-line help is
readily available during both installation and normal usage (see
Figure 2).</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4691f1.large.jpg"><img src="4691f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

Figure 2. Installation Script with On-Line Help
</p></div></div><p>The installation does an excellent job of determining what
tape drives you have. It correctly identified both of my SCSI tape
drives, probably by reading the /proc filesystem. The installation
script also will detect whether your tape drive will do fast seeks
and what the threshold for changing to a fast seek might be (see
Figure 3). Fast seeks are great for restoring one or just a few
files, a common restoration scenario. The installation is the best
tape-drive characterization process I've seen on Linux so
far.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4691f3.large.jpg"><img src="4691f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Installation Script Determining Fast Forward Threshold
</p></div></div><p>The installation script will even set up a background task to
check for sparse files (Microlite calls them &ldquo;virtual files&rdquo;).
Correct handling of sparse files can save vast amounts of media on
backup and even greater amounts on restore. For those systems that
have sparse files, lack of proper sparse-file handling can rule out
a backup product. Unfortunately, on both of my testbed computers,
the search program failed with an error number but no real
explanation why. Fortunately, there is a text file of sparse files
you can hack, and Microlite documented doing so. BackupEDGE also
supports raw filesystem partitions, useful for database
servers.</p><p>The installation even put an icon on my KDE desktop. A simple
hack to the shell script launched by the icon allowed me to fix the
font size, a necessity for us geriatric penguinistas.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24a3580.0x259bc90"></a>The Program</h2></div></div><p>The first thing I did after installation was fire up the
program, edgemenu, from the command line (see Figure 4). The
program's color scheme, a blue background with gray characters,
reminded me of Colorado Memory Systems DOS-based menus of ancient
history. Your choices for color schemes appears to be gray on light
blue or monochrome. Sometimes when exiting edgemenu, it leaves its
color scheme on both the KDE konsole and xterm. Big deal, I can
live with this for reliable backups.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4691f4.large.jpg"><img src="4691f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. edgemenu
</p></div></div><p>There is a full command-line capability, rather like tar, and
&ldquo;man edge&rdquo; lists all the options available. Also, since the
console-mode menu program is a front end for the command-line
programs, you can study the commands it produces.</p><p>You can easily schedule automatic backups with the edgemenu
program. It installs the backups into root's crontab, making it
easy for you to adjust the backup in order to play with other cron
jobs.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24a3580.0x259c000"></a>Backing Up</h2></div></div><p>Naturally, the first thing I tried to do was a small test
backup of about 9MB using my /etc directory. When I first tried
this, the backup failed. Possibly the scan for sparse files
affected the SCSI host adaptor. In any case, once I rebooted my
system, I got successful backups on both of my tape drives.</p><p>The reason for the reboot was that I used another computer to
test backups over the network, a process Microlite calls &ldquo;remote
backups&rdquo;. I reconfigured BackupEDGE to use ssh because I already
have ssh working with public key authentication, thus allowing
secure transfers of data without passwords. I was able to configure
the client machine and start a backup, but it locked up the server.
Oops. After rebooting the server, I was able to back up on the
server, but not on the client. My second attempt did not crash the
server, which was an improvement. You also can use any host to
administer another host. Apparently, the rsh or ssh connection is
made and broken over the course of a session, so you may have waits
while hosts authenticate.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24a3580.0x259c160"></a>Verification</h2></div></div><p>Verifications can be done against the original file or by
checking the CRC checksums stored with the data. The latter is
useful for verifying a file after the original has changed. It is
also a quick-and-dirty acceptance test of tape-drive head
alignment, which is useful for less expensive tape drives, like
some of the QIC offerings. Verification can be done as a routine
part of the backup process, which is great.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24a3580.0x259c268"></a>Restoration</h2></div></div><p>Restoration is easily done from the edgemenu program. You can
restore redirected files to another location via any of the three
interfaces. For the GUI addicts, there is an X-based restore tool,
edge.emx (see Figure 5), that you may launch from edgemenu. It is
suited for restoring individual files. Selecting a directory also
selects the files and directories under it, if the directory is not
expanded. The process is simple enough: select a database and click
on it. Click your way down the tree until you select all the files
you want. Click on Transfer to add the selected files to the
restore window. Then click on Restore to restore the data.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4691f5.large.jpg"><img src="4691f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24a3580.0x259c528"></a>Documentation</h2></div></div><p>The manual is large, over 270 pages. With reasonably large
type and a fair amount of white space, it is easy to read. Seventy
pages of the manual duplicates the man pages, and some of that is
for operating systems other than Linux. Then there is another 130
pages of documentation on the crash recovery software. A good
contents page is provided in each volume, but the index is a bit
sparse. For example, there is no entry for sparse files, and you
have to already know that Microlite calls them &ldquo;virtual files&rdquo;.
Overall, the documentation is plentiful, extensive, conversational
and easy to read. Microlite gets an &ldquo;A&rdquo; here.</p><p>Part of the documentation expands on error messages. When a
program produces a terse error message, you can look it up in the
documentation and get a more detailed explanation. Other software
vendors should learn to do this.</p><p>The documentation even tells you how to customize some
aspects of BackupEDGE. For example, remote backups are done using
rsh. However, the exact steps you need to take in order to use ssh
are documented.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24a3580.0x259c6e0"></a>Support</h2></div></div><p>Customer support is provided via e-mail, phone, fax or web
site. There is no e-mail list that allows customers to exchange
experiences directly. I did run into one problem that led me to
customer support: I tried to substitute ssh for rsh. We never did
get that to work, possibly because I took sick while trying to
debug this problem. The support I got was polite but appeared to be
perfunctory. E-mail responses were timely and had I not gotten
sick, we probably would have gotten ssh working in time for this
review.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24a3580.0x259c7e8"></a>Disaster Recovery</h2></div></div><p>Disaster recovery should be very easy to do with RecoverEDGE,
BackupEDGE's disaster recovery software, once you have it set up. I
say &ldquo;should be&rdquo; only because I actually have not tested the
restore process. Using HP's OBDR (basically a bootable tape drive)
or a floppy disk set you build with BackupEDGE, you can make a
backup tape for disaster recovery. When you need it, boot to the
floppy or tape drive and away you go. The Microlite RecoverEDGE
software will also adjust your partition sizes as needed in case
you are restoring to a larger hard drive. Even machines that back
up over the Net can use RecoverEDGE, which is more than you can do
with OBDR.</p><p>Please note: the current version of this product was not
