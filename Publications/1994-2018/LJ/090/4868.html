players have weighed in with their new distribution offerings. I've
checked out my favorites and found them all wanting, but still a
site better than those from the past. This time, though, I've
noticed what I would consider a lot more griping and general
discontent than before among the user community. I always figured
new releases were a time of rejoicing that someone else went to the
trouble of upgrading everything for me. Last time around I seem to
recall a lot of whining about the distros installing with
everything in the world turned on (Telnet, FTP, etc.). The distros
heard this and tightened down. Now I hear the same gripe, only this
time it's because nothing (or almost nothing) is turned on by
default. Guess some things just never change. But I for one am
enjoying the moment, discovering where the engineers squirreled
away all the scripts and configuration files this time. It'll soon
be old hat. And when I've got the half-dozen distros I'm running
here down pat, I guess I'll just have to go check out the other
112-plus. I feel like a kid at Burger King, having it all my way.
Gee, it's great to be running Linux.
</p><p>FreeMED
<a href="http://www.freemed.org" target="_self">freemed.org</a></p><p>The FreeMED program is striving for ISO9000 compliance with a
complete package for a medical practice or hospital. It's not there
yet, lacking several major features, but looks good, performs well
and is quite easy to install. For security, just drop this into
your secure web document root and go. Requires: web server w/ PHP4
and MySQL support, MySQL server, phpwebtools, web browser.
</p><p>EthStatus
<a href="http://ethstatus.calle69.net" target="_self">ethstatus.calle69.net</a></p><p>If you want to monitor the status of one or more Ethernet
interfaces in a system, this small utility is for you. It will show
you, both graphically and in numbers, what your interface is doing
and even whether it's up or down. The author has included a small
utility to set up startup at boot. But even if you don't have one
of the distributions mentioned, you can set it up. Output can be
sent to an unused VT for monitoring at any time by anyone.
Requires: libncurses, glibc.
</p><p>Sysmon
<a href="http://www.sysmon.org" target="_self">sysmon.org</a></p><p>If you have a lot of systems you need to watch, Sysmon can
handle them all fairly easily. Designed for a NOC (network
operations center), you set up one system as your monitoring
station running the sysmon d&aelig;mon, and you can check it via
the sysmon client from anywhere on your network. The most difficult
part is the configuration, which isn't well documented, so novices
may find setup daunting. Requires: libresolv, libnsl, libncurses,
glibc.
</p><p>wavemon
<a href="http://www.jm-music.de/projects.html" target="_self">jm-music.de/projects.html</a></p><p>If any of you use a wireless network, you are almost
certainly aware of the paucity of tools for these cards. Well, for
those using the WaveLAN or similar, at least one tool is available.
While wavemon isn't a panacea; it's a start. It works for a myriad
of cards, including the Lucent Orinoco and many others. Now, if
some tool would just allow this card to be used under Linux as an
access point. Requires: libm, libncurses, glibc.
</p><p>popaccess
<a href="ftp://ftp.innercite.com/pub/popaccess" target="_self">ftp.innercite.com/pub/popaccess</a></p><p>I know many administrators face the problem of allowing only
certain authorized individuals access to their mail server without
making it a relay for low-life spammers. But when your road
warriors are traveling, or, like me, you have folks who access the
server from all over the world, you need something. What I liked
about popaccess is that it's all in one file, not three or four.
Configuration is simple and it works. Requires: Perl, perl module
IO::Seekable.
</p><p>SimpleCDR
<a href="http://ogre.rocky-road.net/cdr.shtml" target="_self">ogre.rocky-road.net/cdr.shtml</a></p><p>I have nothing against xcdroast. I also have nothing against
X. But sometimes working from a TTY is faster or easier, so often I
do. SimpleCDR works in most any environment but is particularly
well suited to a VT. It won't burn your CD any faster, but you
don't need to fire up X to use it. Requires: libncurses, libstdc++,
libm, glibc.
</p><p>multiCD
<a href="http://multicd.rmdashrf.org" target="_self">multicd.rmdashrf.org</a></p><p>Sometimes, you just need to create multiple CDs. Most systems
I've worked on would require several CDs if you wanted to use them
for backups. <span   class="bold"><b>multiCD</b></span> was made just
for that purpose. Even as it's burning one CD, it can be creating
the next so that burning can continue uninterrupted. For obvious
reasons, this won't work on a slow system. Requires: Perl.
</p><p>IC-RADIUS
<a href="http://radius.innercite.com" target="_self">radius.innercite.com</a></p><p>If you require a RADIUS server, for whatever purpose, you'll
at least want to take a look at IC-RADIUS. Once installed, all
administration is performed through a web browser (though you'll
want a secure server to perform remote administration). You can
create groups, users, view statistics and more. Network logins via
dialup are very fast. Requires: MySQL, libmysqlclient, libm,
libcrypt, libnsl, libz, glibc.
</p><p>Until next month.</p></div></div>
