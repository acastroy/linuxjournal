    Mick picks up where he left off with GnuPG and gets even more
    paranoid with signing and verifying keys.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f9c580.0x20945b0"></a></h2></div></div><p> Last month I introduced the GNU Privacy
Guard, a free but underutilized implementation of the OpenPGP
encryption standards. GnuPG is, as you may know, extremely useful
for encrypting and decrypting electronic files, especially e-mail,
and for creating and verifying digital signatures.
</p><p>But alas, by the time I was done explaining the basics of
public key cryptography and the Web of Trust, not to mention doing
my best to frighten you into signing each other's keys and checking
unknown keys for validity, all there was room for in the way of
practical examples was some compiling/installing advice and a
little tutorial on verifying digitally signed files.</p><p>Well, this month is the payoff for the more technically
inclined. Let's pick up right where we left off!</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f9c580.0x2094768"></a>Generating Your Key Pair</h2></div></div><p>Before you encrypt, decrypt or sign anything, you need to
build your own public and private keyrings; let's start by
generating a GnuPG key pair. This is one of the more interactive
gpg functions: the command syntax is simply <b  >gpg
--gen-key</b>, which triggers a question-and-answer session
prior to your keys actually being generated. Listing 1 shows a
sample key-generation session (user input in boldface). As you can
see, you need to decide several things when generating a key: key
type, key length, expiration date and the e-mail address (identity)
you wish to associate with the key.</p><p><a href="4892l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1. Generating a GnuPG Key
Pair</a></p><p>For a general-purpose key pair, choose DSA/ElGamal (option
#1). This actually gives you two sets of keys: a DSA key pair that
will be used by gpg for signing/verifying and an ElGamal pair that
gpg will use for encrypting/decrypting. Don't worry that this will
double the amount of keys you need to keep straight: the DSA and
ElGamal keys are stored as a single file, as are the two public
keys.</p><p>If you want to generate a signing-only key pair, choose DSA
only (option #2). If you want an encryption-only key pair, choose
ElGamal only (option #3).</p><p>I recommend against creating a dual-purpose ElGamal key pair,
however (option #4). In <span   class="emphasis"><em>Applied Cryptography</em></span>,
Bruce Schneier describes a simple attack that can work against
schemata that use the same key pair used for both signing and
encrypting. This &ldquo;chosen plaintext&rdquo; attack is quite literally a
textbook example of the danger of using the same key material for
both encryption and digital signatures.</p><p>Key size is of the utmost importance. The smallest key size
supported by GnuPG is 768 bits, but 1,024 is recommended as having
the best balance of security and performance. (A longer key is more
secure but takes longer to compute and to use; a shorter key is
faster to compute and use but is less secure.) Note that when you
choose a combined DSA/ElGamal key pair, the DSA key length
automatically is set to 1,024 bits, and the key length you're
prompted for actually applies to the ElGamal key.</p><p><a href="4892s1.html" target="_self">I Thought 128 Bits Was a Large Key
Length!</a></p><p>Next you need to think about how long you want this key pair
to remain in circulation. On the one hand, if your key never
expires, you never have to go to the trouble of generating new key
pairs. The disadvantage of this is that if you forget the private
key's passphrase and haven't created and kept a revocation
certificate (which I'll explain shortly), it will be very difficult
to remove the key from any keyservers it's listed on.</p><p>On the other hand, if your key expires after some period of
time, then you need never worry about obsolete keys sitting around
on public keyservers indefinitely: if your e-mail address changes,
you decide that your key's length is no longer adequate, or if
someone obtains a copy of your private key, you can rest assured
that even if for some reason you can't revoke your old key it will
die of old age. The only disadvantage of finite-lifetime keys is
having to generate, distribute and get people to use your new keys
periodically.</p><p>I used to use only non-aging keys but have become convinced
that the pros of expiration dates outweigh the cons. Therefore, I
recommend that you set your key to expire after no more than 18 or
24 months. For me, one year is too short (<span   class="emphasis"><em>tempis
fugit</em></span>!), but I doubt that a key much older than a year
and a half or two years can stand up to the inevitable advances in
computing power and/or factoring technology (i.e., public-key
cracking methods) that will have occurred over its lifetime.</p><p>Next you need to specify a name, e-mail address and also an
optional comment. Note that you can associate additional e-mail
addresses with your key later by using gpg's --edit-key flag and
issuing an adduid and/or an addkey command.</p><p>The last thing you need to think about in generating your key
is a good passphrase. And I do mean
pass<span   class="emphasis"><em>phrase</em></span>: it can and should contain spaces.
The longer it is, the more secure it is. You should also
incorporate some combination of numbers, mixed case (e.g., bOTTLE
rockeT) and punctuation. Lately, I've taken to generating my
passphrases with dice and a word list. See
<a href="http://www.diceware.com" target="_self">diceware.com</a> for a
handy procedure for doing this yourself.</p><p>Whatever you do, don't choose a short, predictable or
otherwise guessable passphrase. It doesn't have to look like
&ldquo;B1&amp;SSja-sd0c as-d$%@KFSAAs-,ssd w0a-00sdp23m&rdquo;, nor should it
look like &ldquo;My lame passphrase&rdquo;. It's okay to write your
passphrase on a small card you keep in your wallet if doing so
makes it easier for you to use hard-to-guess passphrases. (Just be
careful never to leave it sitting around and to always put it away
when you're done with it!)</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f9c580.0x2094ef8"></a>Create a Revocation Certificate</h2></div></div><p>After you've generated your key, you should immediately
create a revocation certificate. This is a string of text that you
can send to a keyserver if and when you need to revoke your
key.</p><p>Of course, you can create a revocation certificate at any
point. The reason it makes sense to create one now is that it's not
uncommon for even very knowledgeable and careful people to forget
their passphrase. You need your passphrase to create a revocation
certificate, but not to use one you created earlier.</p><p>That's why it's a good idea to create a revocation
certificate now and save it in a safe place (you can even print it
out and save it in &ldquo;meatspace&rdquo;--revocation certificates aren't
very long). Just be sure to set its file permissions to be as
strict as your private key's (e.g., not group- or world-readable or
writable). The ramifications of someone sending the certificate to
a keyserver without your permission aren't as scary as if someone
can actually use your private key, but at the very least a
prematurely revoked key could inconvenience you.</p><p>To generate a revocation certificate, enter this
command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
gpg --output <span   class="emphasis"><em>rev_cert_filename.asc</em></span> --gen-revoke <span   class="emphasis"><em>keyname</em></span>
</pre><p>where <span   class="emphasis"><em>rev_cert_filename.asc</em></span> is the
filename you'd like the certificate to have (just make sure it ends
in .asc) and <span   class="emphasis"><em>keyname</em></span> is the key's ID number
(e.g., 0586AF78) or part of your identity (&ldquo;Smooth JoJo&rdquo; would be
enough to identify our example key).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f9c580.0x2095318"></a>Exporting Your Public Key</h2></div></div><p>GnuPG stores its files in a subdirectory of your home
directory called .gnupg. Any private keys you have are stored in a
file called secring.gpg; public keys are stored in pubring.gpg. By
default, secring.gpg is readable only by you; leave it that way.
It's extremely important that you protect this file. By all means,
back it up to a floppy or CD-ROM, but keep your backup in a safe
place. If anyone obtains a copy of your secret keyring, they may be
able to guess or brute-force-crack the passphrase of your private
key and effectively steal your identity (or at least be able to
decrypt your stuff).</p><p>Both pubring.gpg and secring.gpg are binary data files. To
add, delete or change keys on either keyring, you need to use
various flags with the gpg command.</p><p>For example, you're going to want to distribute your public
key to your friends, right? So let's extract that key from your
public keyring into a text file (see Sidebar &ldquo;Armored ASCII vs.
Binary GPG Files&rdquo;). To print your public key to the screen, from
whence it can be copied and pasted as needed, you need simply
enter:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
gpg --armor --export
</pre><p>the output of which will look something like Listing 2.
</p><p><a href="4892l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2. A Public
Key</a></p><p>I took the liberty of simplifying a bit here; if you don't
specify a user ID, gpg will dump the public portion of your default
key pair. If you only have one private key, then that key pair is
your default key and that pair's public key will be dumped.</p><p>If, on the other hand, you wish to dump some other public
key, you need to specify a user ID. Continuing our example using
Mr. Figplucker, to display JoJo's public key we enter:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
gpg --armor --export jojo
</pre><p>As you can see, gpg is fairly intelligent when trying to
determine which key you want to work with. In fact, it works a lot
like grep: if you give a snippet of your e-mail address or some
other text as your key identifier, gpg will match the first key
whose user ID contains the string. In managing my own keyrings, in
which I have several private-public key pairs and therefore
numerous user IDs containing my name, I find it easiest to provide
gpg with the entire e-mail-address portion of the key I wish to
work with at any given time, e.g., <b  >gpg --armor --export
mick@visi.com</b>.
</p><p>By the way, if you want to print a key to a file rather than
to the screen, specify a filename with the --output option. To
write JoJo's public key to the file jojo_pub.asc, the command would
look like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
gpg --armor --output jojo_pub.asc --export jojo
</pre><p><a href="4892s2.html" target="_self">Armored ASCII vs. Binary GPG
Files</a>
</p><p>Have you backed up your new keys yet? You may consider
exporting your entire key pair, including your private key, but I
recommend against doing this. You're much better off simply copying
the keyring files pubring.gpg and secring.gpg from ~/.gnupg to a
safe place. But if for some reason you do need to export your
entire key pair, it's the same as exporting a public key except
that you use the <b  >--export-secret-keys</b> command
rather than <b  >--export</b>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f9c580.0x2095a50"></a>Importing, Verifying and Signing a Friend's
Key</h2></div></div><p>Your friend Dan Sparty has just e-mailed you a copy of his
new public key, in the form of a file called danskey.asc. Here's
how you import it to your public keyring:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
gpg --import ./danskey.asc
</pre><p>But wait a minute. Internet e-mail isn't a very secure
medium. How do you know Dan's key wasn't tampered with in transit,
or that it even was Dan that sent it in the first place?
</p><p>By checking its fingerprint, that's how. Every gpg key has a
secure hash called a fingerprint that is unique to each key (pair)
but is short enough to be read over the phone, written on a
postcard, etc. If you call Dan on the phone and ask him to read you
the fingerprint of his new key, it should match the output from the
following command (executed on your system after importing his
key):</p><pre     class="programlisting">
gpg --fingerprint dan
</pre><p>Note that as with the --export command, you can specify just
part of the key as long as that part is unique to the key you wish
to fingerprint. The output will look something like this:
<pre     class="programlisting">
pub  1024D/C9F34866 2001-07-27 Dan Sparty (Party Down!)
       &lt;dan@boogiemeister.org&gt;
     Key fingerprint = D084 F92C EC62 8955 98E2  58FB
       178A 2673 D1F3 6866
sub  1024g/C5569A5B 2001-07-27 [expires: 2001-08-10]
</pre>


Alternatively (let's say it's only noon and you don't want to wake
Dan up), if Hugh has this fingerprint in his e-mail signature and
has furthermore made postings to Usenet or on public e-mail lists,
you can simply find one of these messages and compare that
signature. This illustrates an important aspect of key
fingerprints: the more places your public key and/or its
fingerprint is archived, the harder it is for someone to pretend to
be you.
</p><p>Now that you know this is really Dan's new key and not a
forgery, you can do Dan and the world a favor by publicly and
cryptographically vouching for its veracity. In other words, you
can sign it with your private key. To do so, you run gpg with the
command <b  >--edit-key</b>. This, like
<b  >--gen-key</b>, triggers an interactive session.
Listing 3 shows a key-editing session in which the user signs a key
with their own default key.</p><p><a href="4892l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3. Editing (Signing) a
Key</a></p><p>Did you notice the final save command? This saves any changes
you've made to the key (in this case, the signature you created for
it) and exits the key-editing session. If we now list the key with
the command <b  >gpg --list-sigs dan</b> we'll
see:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
jojo@linux:~ &gt; gpg --list-sigs dan
pub  1024D/B9E0868B 2001-07-27 Dan Sparty (Party On!)
     &lt;dan@boogiemeister.org&gt;
sig        B9E0868B 2001-07-27  Dan Sparty (Party On!)
           &lt;dan@boogiemeister.org&gt;
sig        C1C34866 2001-07-27  John J. Figplucker
           (Smooth JoJo) &lt;jojo@figpluckers-supreme.to&gt;
sub  1024g/A0B78448 2001-07-27 [expires: 2001-08-26]
sig        B9E0868B 2001-07-27  Dan Sparty (Party On!)
           &lt;dan@boogiemeister.org&gt;

</pre><p>In addition to Dan's own signatures (when you generate a key
it's automatically self-signed) you can now see JoJo's. Now, all
that remains is for JoJo to export his new signed version of Dan's
public key:
<pre     class="programlisting">
gpg --output dan_jojosig.asc --export dan
</pre>


JoJo then needs to send this file to Dan via e-mail or some other
convenient means (remember, it's a public key, so confidentiality
isn't an issue), and Dan needs to import the signed key back into
his own public keyring:
<pre     class="programlisting">
gpg --import ./dan_jojosig.asc
</pre>


Importing may seem counterintuitive: Dan's actually updating his
public key, not importing a new one. But trust me, that's what he
needs to do in order to join the proud ranks of gpg users who
actually have bothered to get their friends to vouch for their
keys.
</p><p>Now that Dan's got a superelite signed key, he's ready to
post it to a keyserver so other people can start sending him
encrypted messages (and adding their signatures to his key). To do
so he can issue the command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
gpg --keyserver pgp.mit.edu --send-keys dan@boogiemeister.org
</pre><p>The option --keyserver is used to specify the name or IP
address of a PGP/GPG keyserver. Alternatively you could add to
~/.gnupg/options a line like this:
<pre     class="programlisting">
keyserver pgp.mit.edu
</pre>


But, note that doing so will cause gpg to download new keys
automatically from the keyserver if it encounters an unknown key
when verifying signatures.
</p><p>Remember last month when I verified a detached signature file
for a software package? The first time I tried to verify the
signature with the gpgv command, I received an error message since
the key used to create the signature wasn't present in my public
keyring.</p><p>The solution was to query for, and download, the key from the
keyserver pgp.mit.edu; this would have happened automatically if a
keyserver had been set in my options file. It's up to you to decide
whether this is a feature or an annoyance, and whether therefore to
make it the default behavior. (The command-line option
<b  >--no-auto-key-retrieve</b> will override
auto-key-retrieval.)</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f9c580.0x248e5e8"></a>Using GnuPG to Encrypt and Decrypt
Things</h2></div></div><p>And now, at long last, JoJo's ready to start encrypting
everything in sight. Suppose JoJo wants to send an encrypted e-mail
to Dan. The most common way for him to do this is to compose his
message with the text editor or word processor of his choice and
save it to disk. JoJo writes a letter with vi and saves it as
dan0729.txt. Then he encrypts it with the command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
gpg --output dan0729.txt.asc --encrypt --recipient dan@boogiemeister.org dan0729.txt
</pre><p>Finally, he sends the file dan0729.txt.asc as an e-mail
attachment or even listed in the body of an e-mail message (JoJo's
got an &ldquo;armor&rdquo; line in his options file).
</p><p>Note that if JoJo encrypts without passing gpg the --armor
flag and he doesn't have an armor line in his options file, he
should call the encrypted file dan0729.txt.gpg instead since it
will be saved in the gpg binary format. Also, it will only be
transmittable as an attachment. Remember, Armored ASCII is much
more versatile. The gpg binary format may be preferable if file
size matters because it tends to produce less output than Armored
ASCII.</p><p>When Dan receives this file, he should save it to disk and
decrypt it with the command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
gpg --output dan0729.txt --decrypt dan0729.txt.asc
</pre><p>Unlike encrypting, you don't need to specify a key when
decrypting. <span   class="bold"><b>gpg</b></span> automatically
determines which key to try to decrypt it with. Similarly, it
doesn't matter whether the file Dan tries to decrypt is in gpg
binary or Armored ASCII format; gpg will determine which format the
file is in automatically, after prompting Dan for a passphrase. If
Dan doesn't type his passhprase correctly, gpg won't decrypt the
file.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f9c580.0x248e958"></a>Using GnuPG to Sign and Verify Things</h2></div></div><p>Signing and verifying is very similar to decrypting and
encrypting things. Suppose JoJo writes a nonconfidential but
important letter to Dan that he wants Dan to be able to verify the
validity of but doesn't need to actually encrypt. To sign his file
beercontract.txt, JoJo would enter the command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
gpg --output beercontract_signed.txt --clearsign beercontract.txt
</pre><p>This will add a signature header and footer to the file and
save it as beercontract_signed.txt. It's important that the output
file be named differently than the input file, or the original file
will be replaced with a signature for an empty file. You should use
the clear-text method of signing when you want to be able to
copy-and-paste your signed message into or out of e-mail, or
otherwise treat it as plaintext.
</p><p>The alternative is, you guessed it, to create a binary
signature. There are two types of these. To create a binary
signature that contains the original document and the signature in
one compressed binary file, use the --sign command instead of
--clearsign. To create a much smaller binary file containing a
signature but not the file it references, use the --detach-sig
command. Both --sign and --detach-sig should be preceded by an
--output directive.</p><p>When Dan receives JoJo's beer contract, he can verify the
signature appended to it by saving the file to disk, say as
bcs.asc, and entering the command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
gpg --verify bcs.asc
</pre><p>Remember, if Dan doesn't have JoJo's public key in his
keyring, gpg will return an error. If Dan does have JoJo's public
key and the signature checks out, gpg will return something like
the following:
<pre     class="programlisting">
gpg: Signature made Fri 27 Jul 2001 04:46:46 PM CDT
     using DSA key ID C1C34866
gpg: Good signature from "John J. Figplucker
     (Smooth JoJo) &lt;jojo@figpluckers-supreme.to&gt;"
</pre>


Then and only then will Dan know for sure that the contract he just
received was signed by the bearer of JoJo's private key. Could JoJo
have had a spear pointed at his <span   class="emphasis"><em>tuckis</em></span>? We
don't know. Could JoJo have left his passphrase scrawled on the
bottom of his keyboard, to be used by his office mates for
impersonation pranks? Again, we really don't know. But if we trust
JoJo to use and protect his key properly, we can be fairly sure
that he did indeed create this valid signature.

and commands (Welcome to UNIX!). This has really been more of a
survey than anything else; there's much I haven't covered. But I do
believe that gpg is an important and useful tool. So much so that a
number of people are working on more user-friendly front ends for
it. The official GnuPG GUI is called the GNU Privacy Assistant

promising indeed. It uses the GIMP toolkit, and is, unsurprisingly,
nice to look at indeed.</p><p>Other GUIs under various stages of development include
Seahorse and GnomePGP for the GNOME desktop; Geheimnis for KDE;
TkPGP (written in Tk and therefore relatively
windowmanager-agnostic); and a variety of wrappers, plugins and
