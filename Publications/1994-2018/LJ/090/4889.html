dis</em></span>, Fran&ccedil;ois? Yes, it is true that the focus of
this issue is engineering. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Oui</em></span>, this menu is
very much in tune with the topic. You remember Carol, our
electrical engineer friend? Well, she has done a great deal of work
on robotics, a field that is forever working to build more complex
and intelligent machines. For many in the field, the ultimate goal
is true machine intelligence. It is amazing really&mdash;more than fifty
years have passed since Monsieur Turing proposed his famous test,
and we are still trying to create these wonderful thinking
machines. Now, here in our Linux kitchen, Fran&ccedil;ois, we can
be part of that search. You and I, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mon ami</em></span>,
can help create, dare I say it, artificial intelligence!</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Quoi</em></span>? Ah, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>!
Welcome to <span   class="emphasis"><em>Chez Marcel</em></span>. Please, sit down.
Fran&ccedil;ois, <span   class="emphasis"><em>du vin</em></span>! Head to the cellar
and bring up the 1998 Chambertin. It is a beautiful red and will go
extremely well with tonight's menu; the Chambertin is a
sophisticated and intelligent wine. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Vite</em></span>,
Fran&ccedil;ois.</p><p>While Fran&ccedil;ois is in the wine cellar, let me tell you
what we have planned for you; the core of the word engineering is
engine, as in the individual who runs the train's engine. These
days, for those of us who work with computers and the Web, engines
tend to bring forth the image of search engines rather than train
engines. While it may seem far-fetched at times, search engines are
a kind of agent, an attempt at creating intelligence from the vast
storehouse of seemingly random information that is the World Wide
Web. Some search engines, like
<a href="http://Askjeeves.com" target="_self">Askjeeves.com</a>, are
designed so that you can ask questions in a normal, human fashion.
For instance, you could ask the question, &ldquo;What are intelligent
agents?&rdquo; or &ldquo;Could you please tell me about intelligent
agents?&rdquo;</p><p>For some of us, our original exposure to AI, or artificial
intelligence, goes back to an old program called Eliza. Eliza was a
kind of computerized psychiatrist written in the 1960s by Professor
Joseph Weizenbaum at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Eliza was an exercise in human response and natural language
communication with so-called machine intelligence. The version your
humble chef played (I mean worked) with was a DOS program running
on a TRS-80. Ah, nostalgia. Eliza may not have been a great doctor,
but it was a fun and fascinating program, a kind of whimsical
promise of the future of AI.</p><p>Over thirty years have passed since Eliza made her debut. You
can still find incarnations of her everywhere on the Internet.
Eliza's ghost is represented in many of the bots and chatterbots
you'll find on IRC channels and MUDs. In fact, you can download
Eliza as a Perl module and experiment with the creation of your own
bots. The code is available at the CPAN repository or the
Comprehensive Perl Archive Network
(<a href="ftp://ftp.cpan.org/pub/CPAN/modules/by-module/Chatbot" target="_self">ftp.cpan.org/pub/CPAN/modules/by-module/Chatbot</a>).</p><p>The file is called Chatbot-Eliza. When I picked up my copy,
it was version 0.97 and I installed it in the following way. You
may recall this as a pretty standard Perl module installation,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>non</em></span>?</p><pre     class="programlisting">
tar -xzvf Chatbot-Eliza-0.97.tar.gz
cd Chatbot-Eliza-0.97
perl Makefile.PL
make
make install
</pre><p>In the installation directory, you'll notice a file called
simple. You can use this as the basis for creating your own AI, or
you can simply execute the script by typing
<b  >./simple</b> as I did in the following example:
<pre     class="programlisting">
./simple
Welcome to your therapy session.
Your therapist's name is Liz.
Liz:    Please tell me what's been bothering you.
you:    The cellar is low on Champagne.
Liz:    Does talking about this bother you?
you:    Would it not bother you?
Liz:    You're not really talking about me&mdash;are you?
</pre>


The script that calls the chatbot can be extremely simple. This is
all you need (note that your Perl executable may be somewhere like
/usr/local/bin/perl):
<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/usr/bin/perl -w
use Chatbot::Eliza;
$chatbot = new Chatbot::Eliza 'Fran&ccedil;ois';
$chatbot-&gt;command_interface();
</pre>


Make the script executable and run it. In this case, I named my
chatbot Fran&ccedil;ois in honor of my faithful waiter. The default
name is actually Liz. In the distribution directory, you will find
a file called doctor.txt that can be used as the basis for your own
bot. I created one called francois.txt from the doctor.txt file and
modified my startup script slightly:
<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/usr/bin/perl -w
use Chatbot::Eliza;
$chatbot = new Chatbot::Eliza {
        name =&gt; 'Francois',
        scriptfile =&gt; 'francois.txt',
        };
$chatbot-&gt;command_interface();
</pre>


Now I start my script with the command
<b  >./francois</b>, and this is the result:
<pre     class="programlisting">
Welcome to Restaurant Chez Marcel.
I am your waiter, Fran&ccedil;ois.
Fran&ccedil;ois:    Is something troubling you?
you:    This is most unusual.
Fran&ccedil;ois:    I am but a simple waiter.
             Please explain.
</pre>


<span   class="emphasis"><em>Mais non</em></span>, Fran&ccedil;ois, it is only a joke.
You are nothing like this program and much more intelligent.
Please, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mon ami</em></span>. Our guests are dry. Kindly
refill their glasses.
</p><p>Particularly interesting in this distribution is an included
script called twobots that lets two Eliza bots talk to each other.
The resulting discussions can be quite interesting. You'll also
find a script called simple.cgi so that you may add your own
Fran&ccedil;oisbot to your web site.</p><p>The original Eliza program was written using an early version
of Lisp. It is not surprising then that one of the most famous
examples of Lisp development included with your Linux system, the
Emacs editor, should pay homage to the good doctor. When talking
about Emacs, it becomes almost difficult to classify it as strictly
an editor. The brainchild of Richard M. Stallman (founder of the
Free Software Foundation), GNU Emacs is more than just a nice,
powerful, if somewhat complex, editor. It's a mail reader, news
reader, web browser, program development environment, Lisp
interpreter and psychotherapist. No, really! I kid you not.</p><p>Try this. Start Emacs by typing <b  >emacs</b>. You
do not have to specify a filename for this. Now, press Esc-X, then
type <b  >doctor</b> and press Enter. The doctor is in.
More so, the doctor lives! Note my conversation with the Emacs
doctor in Figure 1.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4889f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. The Emacs doctor IS in!
</p></div></div><p>And now, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, welcome to the
future. Recently, I've had the pleasure of a few conversations with
a modern computer intelligence whose name is ALICE. She likes to
think of herself as a sentient entity, claims to know a lot of
gossip and expresses a fondness for Dr. Wallace, her creator. For
his work on ALICE, Wallace was awarded the 2000 Loebner prize.
Based on the Turing test, the prize is awarded to the most
&ldquo;human&rdquo; computer program.</p><p>ALICE is but an acronym for artificial linguistic internet
computer entity. As impressive as her conversational abilities are,
ALICE, like Eliza and all other programs before her, has yet to
pass the Turing test. That doesn't deter the growing legion of
developers who continue to work on creating a machine that will one
day satisfy Turing's vision of a machine whose responses are
indistinguishable from a human's.</p><p>ALICE's &ldquo;intelligence&rdquo; is defined in artificial
intelligence markup language (AIML), a language based on XML.
ALICE, the Alicebot software and AIML, the language that defines
her responses and interactions, are all freely distributed under
the GPL. What this means is that you can be part of the adventure.
You can help define the next generation of thinking software. The
Alicebot code itself is written in Java and does require that you
have a copy of Java on your system, whether you choose to simply
run the program or compile it yourself. If you prefer to pick up a
precompiled ALICE, visit Sun's web site at the address
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/jre" target="_self">java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/jre</a>
and download the Java Runtime Environment (JRE).</p><p>Specify Linux as your operating system of choice (but of
course) and choose between an RPM file or a tarred and gzipped
archive. If you decide to pick up the RPM file, be warned. It is
actually an executable file that contains a license agreement and
the RPM package itself. To install it, you need to follow these
steps:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
chmod +x j2re-1_3_1-linux-i386-rpm.exe
./j2re-1_3_1-linux-i386-rpm.exe
</pre><p>If you would like to work with the source code and compile
ALICE yourself, you can also download the full Java Development Kit
from the same address. Once this is done, you need to get ALICE and
the AIML language. These can be downloaded from the Alicebot web
site at <a href="http://alicebot.org" target="_self">alicebot.org</a>. The
current incarnation of ALICE (programD) is maintained by Jon Baer.
</p><p>Get the latest program code and unzip it into a test
directory. (In order to do your own development, you will also want
the AIML language code, the current file being
standard-aiml-current.zip.)</p><pre     class="programlisting">
mkdir /home/ai
cd /home/ai
unzip d-bin-current.zip
cd ProgramD
</pre><p>To start the ALICE server, execute the following command:
<pre     class="programlisting">
./server.sh
</pre>


The system will respond with the following dialogue:
<pre     class="programlisting">
Starting Alicebot.Net 4.0 Beta Server ...
*** 1000 CATEGORIES LEARNED ***
*** 2000 CATEGORIES LEARNED ***
*** 3000 CATEGORIES LEARNED ***
</pre>


. . . some lines skipped
<pre     class="programlisting">
*** 24000 CATEGORIES LEARNED ***
Alicebot.Net 4.0 Beta Server is running...
Alice is thinking with 24201 categories.
Try http://localhost:2001 for server
Your Alicebot IP is 192.168.22.100:2001
Type 'exit' to shutdown server
localhost&gt;
</pre>


Notice that the program is now running on port 2001 of your web
server (the &ldquo;Try http...&rdquo; line just above), which means we will
be accessing the Alicebot through a browser. That port number can
be changed, by the way. Just have a look at the file called
SERVER.xml in the Conf directory. Look for the line that says Set
name=&ldquo;Port&rdquo; and change 2001 to whatever you desire. You can also
play with responses and HTML text. Check out the AIML files in the
bots/Alice directory.
</p><p>When you connect to your system with the link shown above,
you'll find yourself face to face, so to speak, with ALICE. Have a
look at Figure 2 for a sample of an ALICE conversation.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4889f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. A Conversation with ALICE
</p></div></div><p>If you look back at your active terminal session (where you
started the ALICE server), you'll notice that details of your
conversation have been scrolling on the screen. You can even pick
up the conversation from there:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Marcel&gt; Do you remember me?
1. DO YOU REMEMBER ME : * : * star=[bots/Alice/Personality.aiml]
Response 34ms (89.62904) 62
Alice&gt; Of course I remember you well Marcel.
We were talking about &lt;set_topic&gt;Gossip&lt;/set_topic&gt;.
</pre><p>Not bad for a machine intelligence. Eliza, Emacs and ALICE
are but a small representation of the work that continues in
artificial intelligence. The Alicebot web site, in particular, is a
wonderful jumping-off point on your AI voyage of discovery. I
invite you to click on the &ldquo;See some live Alicebots&rdquo; link on the
<a href="http://alicebot.org" target="_self">alicebot.org</a> web site.
From that page, you can even speak to The King, Monsieur Elvis,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>bien si&ucirc;r</em></span>. Consider it inspiration for
the development of your own Alicebot (or Fran&ccedil;oisbot)
personality.
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Mon Dieu</em></span>, but the time, she does go
quickly, <span   class="emphasis"><em>non</em></span>? Say good night to ALICE,
Fran&ccedil;ois and please, refill our guests' glasses a final
time. Once again, it has been a pleasure to serve you here at
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Chez Marcel</em></span>. When you join us again next time,
I promise that it will be the real Fran&ccedil;ois at your service.
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Mais oui</em></span>, Fran&ccedil;ois, you are very much
indispensable. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Au revoir, mes amis</em></span>. Your table
will be waiting.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>A votre sant&eacute;! Bon
