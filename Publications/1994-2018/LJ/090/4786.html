supporting only two different types of devices in the 2.2.7 kernel
(mice and keyboards), to over 20 different types of devices in the
2.4 kernel. Linux currently supports almost all USB class devices
(standard types of devices like keyboards, mice, modems, printers
and speakers) and an ever-growing number of vendor-specific devices
(such as USB to serial converters, digital cameras, Ethernet
devices and MP3 players). For a full list of the different USB
devices currently supported, see Resources.
</p><p>The remaining kinds of USB devices that do not have support
on Linux are almost all vendor-specific devices. Each vendor
decides to implement a custom protocol to talk to their device, so
a custom driver usually needs to be created. Some vendors are open
with their USB protocols and help with the creation of Linux
drivers, while others do not publish them, and developers are
forced to reverse-engineer. See Resources for some links to handy
reverse-engineering tools.</p><p>Because each different protocol causes a new driver to be
created, I have written a generic USB driver skeleton, modeled
after the pci-skeleton.c file in the kernel source tree upon which
many PCI network drivers have been based. This USB skeleton can be
found at drivers/usb/usb-skeleton.c in the kernel source tree. In
this article I will walk through the basics of the skeleton driver,
explaining the different pieces and what needs to be done to
customize it to your specific device.</p><p>If you are going to write a Linux USB driver, please become
familiar with the USB protocol specification. It can be found,
along with many other useful documents, at the USB home page (see
Resources). An excellent introduction to the Linux USB subsystem
can be found at the USB Working Devices List (see Resources). It
explains how the Linux USB subsystem is structured and introduces
the reader to the concept of USB urbs, which are essential to USB
drivers.</p><p>The first thing a Linux USB driver needs to do is register
itself with the Linux USB subsystem, giving it some information
about which devices the driver supports and which functions to call
when a device supported by the driver is inserted or removed from
the system. All of this information is passed to the USB subsystem
in the usb_driver structure. The skeleton driver declares a
usb_driver as:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
static struct usb_driver skel_driver = {
     name:        "skeleton",
     probe:       skel_probe,
     disconnect:  skel_disconnect,
     fops:        &amp;skel_fops,
     minor:       USB_SKEL_MINOR_BASE,
     id_table:    skel_table,
};
</pre><p>The variable name is a string that describes the driver. It
is used in informational messages printed to the system log. The
probe and disconnect function pointers are called when a device
that matches the information provided in the id_table variable is
either seen or removed.
</p><p>The fops and minor variables are optional. Most USB drivers
hook into another kernel subsystem, such as the SCSI, network or
TTY subsystem. These types of drivers register themselves with the
other kernel subsystem, and any user-space interactions are
provided through that interface. But for drivers that do not have a
matching kernel subsystem, such as MP3 players or scanners, a
method of interacting with user space is needed. The USB subsystem
provides a way to register a minor device number and a set of
file_operations function pointers that enable this user-space
interaction. The skeleton driver needs this kind of interface, so
it provides a minor starting number and a pointer to its
file_operations functions.</p><p>The USB driver is then registered with a call to
usb_register, usually in the driver's init function, as shown in
Listing 1.</p><p><a href="4786l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1. Registering the USB
Driver</a></p><p>When the driver is unloaded from the system, it needs to
unregister itself with the USB subsystem. This is done with the
usb_unregister function:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
static void __exit usb_skel_exit(void)
{
   /* deregister this driver with the USB subsystem */
   usb_deregister(&amp;skel_driver);
}
module_exit(usb_skel_exit);
</pre><p>To enable the linux-hotplug system to load the driver
automatically when the device is plugged in, you need to create a
MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE. The following code tells the hotplug scripts
that this module supports a single device with a specific vendor
and product ID:
<pre     class="programlisting">
/* table of devices that work with this driver */
static struct usb_device_id skel_table [] = {
    { USB_DEVICE(USB_SKEL_VENDOR_ID,
      USB_SKEL_PRODUCT_ID) },
    { }                      /* Terminating entry */
};
MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE (usb, skel_table);
</pre>


There are other macros that can be used in describing a
usb_device_id for drivers that support a whole class of USB
drivers. See usb.h for more information on this.
</p><p>When a device is plugged into the USB bus that matches the
device ID pattern that your driver registered with the USB core,
the probe function is called. The usb_device structure, interface
number and the interface ID are passed to the function:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
static void * skel_probe(struct usb_device *dev,
unsigned int ifnum, const struct usb_device_id *id)
</pre><p>The driver now needs to verify that this device is actually
one that it can accept. If not, or if any error occurs during
initialization, a NULL value is returned from the probe function.
Otherwise a pointer to a private data structure containing the
driver's state for this device is returned. That pointer is stored
in the usb_device structure, and all callbacks to the driver pass
that pointer.
</p><p>In the skeleton driver, we determine what end points are
marked as bulk-in and bulk-out. We create buffers to hold the data
that will be sent and received from the device, and a USB urb to
write data to the device is initialized. Also, we register the
device with the devfs subsystem, allowing users of devfs to access
our device. That registration looks like the following:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/* initialize the devfs node for this device
   and register it */
sprintf(name, "skel%d", skel-&gt;minor);
skel-&gt;devfs = devfs_register
              (usb_devfs_handle, name,
               DEVFS_FL_DEFAULT, USB_MAJOR,
               USB_SKEL_MINOR_BASE + skel-&gt;minor,
               S_IFCHR | S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR |
               S_IRGRP | S_IWGRP | S_IROTH,
               &amp;skel_fops, NULL);
</pre><p>If the devfs_register function fails, we do not care, as the
devfs subsystem will report this to the user.
</p><p>Conversely, when the device is removed from the USB bus, the
disconnect function is called with the device pointer. The driver
needs to clean any private data that has been allocated at this
time and to shut down any pending urbs that are in the USB system.
The driver also unregisters itself from the devfs subsystem with
the call:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/* remove our devfs node */
devfs_unregister(skel-&gt;devfs);
</pre><p>Now that the device is plugged into the system and the driver
is bound to the device, any of the functions in the file_operations
structure that were passed to the USB subsystem will be called from
a user program trying to talk to the device. The first function
called will be open, as the program tries to open the device for
I/O. Within the skeleton driver's open function we increment the
driver's usage count if it is a module with a call to
MODULE_INC_USE_COUNT. With this macro call, if the driver is
compiled as a module, the driver cannot be unloaded until a
corresponding MODULE_DEC_USE_COUNT macro is called. We also
increment our private usage count and save off a pointer to our
internal structure in the file structure. This is done so that
future calls to file operations will enable the driver to determine
which device the user is addressing. All of this is done with the
following code:
<pre     class="programlisting">
/* increment our usage count for the module */
MOD_INC_USE_COUNT;
++skel-&gt;open_count;
/* save our object in the file's private structure */
file-&gt;private_data = skel;
</pre>


After the open function is called, the read and write functions are
called to receive and send data to the device. In the skel_write
function, we receive a pointer to some data that the user wants to
send to the device and the size of the data. The function
determines how much data it can send to the device based on the
size of the write urb it has created (this size depends on the size
of the bulk out end point that the device has). Then it copies the
data from user space to kernel space, points the urb to the data
and submits the urb to the USB subsystem (see Listing 2).
</p><p><a href="4786l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2. The skel_write
Function</a></p><p>When the write urb is filled up with the proper information
using the FILL_BULK_URB function, we point the urb's completion
callback to call our own skel_write_bulk_callback function. This
function is called when the urb is finished by the USB subsystem.
The callback function is called in interrupt context, so caution
must be taken not to do very much processing at that time. Our
implementation of skel_write_bulk_callback merely reports if the
urb was completed successfully or not and then returns.</p><p>The read function works a bit differently from the write
function in that we do not use an urb to transfer data from the
device to the driver. Instead we call the usb_bulk_msg function,
which can be used to send or receive data from a device without
having to create urbs and handle urb completion callback functions.
We call the usb_bulk_msg function, giving it a buffer into which to
place any data received from the device and a timeout value. If the
timeout period expires without receiving any data from the device,
the function will fail and return an error message (see Listing
3).</p><p><a href="4786l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3. The usb_bulk_msg
Function</a></p><p>The usb_bulk_msg function can be very useful for doing single
reads or writes to a device; however, if you need to read or write
constantly to a device, it is recommended to set up your own urbs
and submit them to the USB subsystem.</p><p>When the user program releases the file handle that it has
been using to talk to the device, the release function in the
driver is called. In this function we decrement the module usage
count with a call to MOD_DEC_USE_COUNT (to match our previous call
to MOD_INC_USE_COUNT). We also determine if there are any other
programs that are currently talking to the device (a device may be
opened by more than one program at one time). If this is the last
user of the device, then we shut down any possible pending writes
that might be currently occurring. This is all done with:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/* decrement our usage count for the device */
--skel-&gt;open_count;
if (skel-&gt;open_count &lt;= 0) {
   /* shutdown any bulk writes that might be
      going on */
   usb_unlink_urb (skel-&gt;write_urb);
   skel-&gt;open_count = 0;
}
/* decrement our usage count for the module */
MOD_DEC_USE_COUNT;
</pre><p>One of the more difficult problems that USB drivers must be
able to handle smoothly is the fact that the USB device may be
removed from the system at any point in time, even if a program is
currently talking to it. It needs to be able to shut down any
current reads and writes and notify the user-space programs that
the device is no longer there (see Listing 4).
</p><p><a href="4786l4.html" target="_self">Listing 4. The skel_disconnect
Function</a></p><p>If a program currently has an open handle to the device, we
only null the usb_device structure in our local structure, as it
has now gone away. For every read, write, release and other
functions that expect a device to be present, the driver first
checks to see if this usb_device structure is still present. If
not, it releases that the device has disappeared, and a -ENODEV
error is returned to the user-space program. When the release
function is eventually called, it determines if there is no
usb_device structure and if not, it does the cleanup that the
skel_disconnect function normally does if there are no open files
on the device (see Listing 5).</p><p><a href="4786l5.html" target="_self">Listing 5. Cleanup</a></p><p>This usb-skeleton driver does not have any examples of
interrupt or isochronous data being sent to or from the device.
Interrupt data is sent almost exactly as bulk data is, with a few
minor exceptions. Isochronous data works differently with
continuous streams of data being sent to or from the device. The
audio and video camera drivers are very good examples of drivers
that handle isochronous data and will be useful if you also need to
do this.</p><p>Writing Linux USB device drivers is not a difficult task as
the usb-skeleton driver shows. This driver, combined with the other
current USB drivers, should provide enough examples to help a
beginning author create a working driver in a minimal amount of
time. The linux-usb-devel mailing list archives also contain a lot
of helpful information.</p><p><a href="4786s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
