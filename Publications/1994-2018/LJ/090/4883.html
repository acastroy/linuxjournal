    Linux&mdash;more popular than Jesus? According to Google's
    authoritative search engine&mdash;yes.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20eb580.0x21e3450"></a></h2></div></div><p>If Google isn't already the number one
search engine, it might as well be. What else is there? Even Yahoo
gave up and started OEMing Google a few months back. They've got
10,000-plus Linux boxes sending out bots that crawl over 1.3
billion pages and bring back results so complete that every page is
cached in searchable form. They're also on top of images and Usenet
groups in a huge way, even though they hardly publicize either
while they continue (at this writing) to tweak the systems publicly
as beta.
</p><p>Advertising on Google has more in common with your
newspaper's classifieds than with anything on billboards, magazines
or TV screens. This observation is meant as flattery. They are
about the only form of advertising that enjoys positive demand,
which means Google stands a chance of becoming the first outfit to
create a form of web-based advertising that users welcome&mdash;no mean
feat if they pull it off.</p><p>Their search results are relevanced (how's that for a
neoverb?) by inbound links rather than by clever metatags and other
sneaky HTML hacks on the searched pages. If anything, Google
measures authority more than anything else. Since linking isn't an
automatic matter with most text processing software, it takes a
conscious effort for an author to point. Therefore, Google's
thinking (roughly) goes, every link to a page is a vote by an
interested human being for the value of the pointed-to page as a
source.</p><p>Google calls its system &ldquo;a unique combination of hardware
and software&rdquo;. Specifically, it's ten thousand boxes running
Linux. We all know the technical answer to the &ldquo;Why Linux?&rdquo;
question. There's an obvious economic one too: it's cheap to deploy
on commodity hardware. More importantly, it lowers the threshold of
deployment. It was easier for Google's creators to imagine the
service running on Linux than on anything else. But finally, Google
provides a democratic answer with its own search results.</p><p>See, in addition to ranking search results, Google also lists
the number of unique pages found to contain the search term (or
terms). When I looked a few minutes ago (when putting together the
<i  >LJ</i> Index, where these sort of numbers are also
posted), Google found 31.6 million pages containing the word
&ldquo;linux&rdquo;. Let's put this in perspective:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>active x: 2,350,000</p></li><li><p>python: 2,080,000</p></li><li><p>gates: 3,020,000</p></li><li><p>kde: 3,560,000</p></li><li><p>gnome: 3,720,000</p></li><li><p>perl: 7,650,000</p></li><li><p>jesus: 8,800,000</p></li><li><p>boy: 10,800,000</p></li><li><p>solution: 13,300,000</p></li><li><p>market:31,200,000</p></li><li><p>girl: 13,600,000</p></li><li><p>microsoft: 20,200,000</p></li><li><p>god: 24,300,000</p></li><li><p>sun: 25,500,000</p></li><li><p>sex: 28,400,000</p></li><li><p>linux: 31,600,000</p></li><li><p>business: 86,900,000</p></li><li><p>have: 231,000,000</p></li><li><p>naked:8,080,000</p></li><li><p>Tcl:1,910,000</p></li><li><p>foobar: 113,000</p></li><li><p>hampster dance:8,930</p></li></ul></div><p>On that last one, the top two (out of 231 million) were
LinuxGames.com and Richard Stallman's Why Software Should Not Have
Owners page.
</p><p>If markets are conversations, what does this say about the
Linux market? Is this market&mdash;our bazaar&mdash;really bigger than sex
and Microsoft?</p><p>Apparently.</p><p>Why? Because there's a lot to talk about and keep talking
about; because it constantly changes. No matter how important
Microsoft continues to make itself (by expertly leveraging its
incumbent importance), the company's protectiveness about its
intellectual property puts a lid on the quantity of Microsoft
subjects one can talk about.</p><p>There is a limit to how deeply one can enjoy expertise in&mdash;or
involvement with&mdash;Microsoft software. Where a significant hunk of
Microsoft intellectual property is nobody's business, all of Linux
is anybody's business.</p><p>Which means Linux, as a topic of expertise, is better for
business than Microsoft, or any other commercial software company
that limits conversation around the very software on which it wants
everybody to depend.</p><p>This is what we need to remember when we speculate about the
viability of Linux companies. A lot of them got clobbered in the
dot-com bust, along with everybody else. If we want to put our
trust in market forces, it's pretty hard to ignore one of the
world's biggest conversations.</p></div></div>
