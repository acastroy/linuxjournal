    All about SPICE: how to get it and what to do with it.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b13580.0x1c0b500"></a></h2></div></div><p>SPICE is the Simulation Program with
Integrated Circuit Emphasis, first released from the University of
California at Berkeley in the early 1970s. Before the existence of
SPICE engineers designed circuits by hand, possibly with the aid of
a slide-rule or calculator. A prototype was constructed from the
original design, and its performance evaluated against the
designer's goals.
</p><p>Designing many of today's circuits would be impossible
without the aid of SPICE. Frequently analog circuits contain
hundreds or thousands of devices. Design and analysis involve
finding solutions to simultaneous equations. These equations can be
of simple algebraic form or involve nonlinear differential
equations. Prototypes are still constructed to gauge performance,
but given costs running in the hundreds of thousands of dollars,
performance must be largely anticipated through computer simulation
before prototype fabrication begins.</p><p>SPICE is not limited to integrated circuit design. Rather,
SPICE is useful for analyzing any circuit which can be described in
terms of voltage sources, current sources, resistors, capacitors,
inductors, transistors and a few other components.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b13580.0x1c0b6b8"></a>Where to Get SPICE for Linux</h2></div></div><p>SPICE version 3f4 was released in 1993, and the source code
is freely available to those friendly to the U.S.A. You can get a
copy of the source code from
ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/apps/circuits/spice3f4.tar.gz.</p><p>I run Red Hat Linux and use the Red Hat Package Manager
(rpm). If you're running rpm, you can take advantage of Andrew
Veliath's spice-3f4-2.src.rpm package. You can find a copy on
ftp.redhat.com and mirrors. If you don't use rpm, you might want to
consider building it and using rpm2cpio to unpack the
spice-3f4-2.src.rpm package, since it contains two very useful
patches to the pristine source for building on Linux
systems.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b13580.0x1c0b818"></a>How to Build/Install SPICE on a Linux
System</h2></div></div><p>If you're using rpm, building SPICE is as easy as:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
rpm -ba -vv SRPMS/spice-3f4-2.src.rpm
rpm -i -U -vv RPMS/i386/spice-3f4-2.i386.rpm
</pre><p>The first line builds the installable package from the source
package. The second line installs the package and updates the rpm
database.
</p><p>If you're not using rpm, building and installing SPICE is a
little more involved but not too bad. The basic process is as
follows:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
rpm2cpio SRPMS/spice-3f4-2.src.rpm | cpio -i
tar xzpf spice3f4.tar.gz
patch &lt; spice3f4.newlnx.patch
patch &lt; spice3f4.dirs.patch
cd spice3f4
util/build linux
</pre><p>Compiling took 12 minutes on my 200MHz Pentium system.
<pre     class="programlisting">
util/build linux install
strip /usr/bin/{spice3,help,nutmeg,sconvert,multidec,\
        proc2mod}
install -m 644 man/man1/spice.1 /usr/man/man1
install -m 644 man/man1/nutmeg.1 /usr/man/man1
install -m 644 man/man1/sconvert.1 /usr/man/man1
install -m 644 man/man3/mfb.3 /usr/man/man3
install -m 644 man/man5/mfbcap.5 /usr/man/man5
</pre>


After installation comes the real fun&mdash;creating and simulating
circuits. While a minimal Linux system can run SPICE adequately,
analysis time can be significantly improved when it is run on a
system with a fast processor(s), 133MHz or above. Additional RAM is
equally important, especially for larger circuits. I have 32MB in
my home Linux/Pentium system and 128MB in my SunOS/Sparc20 at work.

Schematic</a></p><p>Figure 1 shows a the schematic of a differential pair circuit
constructed from bipolar junction transistors and resistors. This
circuit can be used for either digital or analog purposes and, in
either case, can be simulated using SPICE. The circuit operates in
the following manner. Very little current flows through the base of
transistor Q2, so the base can be considered to be held near ground
potential, zero volts. When the input voltage, VIN, is low, near
ground, Q1 will be off and Q2 will be on. No current will flow
through Q1, so VO1 will be high, equal to VCC. All of the current
in IEE will flow through Q2. The voltage drop across RL2 will
be:</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2169greek1.jpg"></div><p>So the voltage VO2 will be 5V below VCC. So, VO2 will be
0V.</p><p>In linear analog operation VIN will be held near ground
except for small signal excursions away from ground. Under this
condition the differential pair will serve as an amplifier where
the voltage gains are:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
AV1 = VO1 / VIN = -(gm1/2) * RL1
</pre><pre     class="programlisting">
AV2 = VO2 / VIN = (gm2/2) * RL2
</pre><p>where gm1 and gm2 are the transconductances of the two
transistors. These values can easily be calculated by hand, but
since the point of this story is to show SPICE at work, we'll let
SPICE tell us the transconductance values.
</p><p><a href="2169l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a></p><p>Listing 1 shows the SPICE input file corresponding to the
circuit in Figure 1. The SPICE input file contains a description of
the circuit and its connections, input stimuli, statements to
control what kind of analysis SPICE will perform, statements to
control output, comments and a title. The first line is always the
title and the last non-blank line is always
<b  >.end</b>. Comment lines begin with an asterisk
(<b  >*</b>). Control lines of any kind begin with a
period (<b  >.</b>). The line continuation character is a
plus sign (<b  >+</b>) which goes at the beginning of a
line being continued from the previous line. This is a little
different from the common backslash (<b  >\</b>) line
continuation, used elsewhere in Linux, where that continuation
character goes at the end of the line being continued on the next
line.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b13580.0x1c0c268"></a>Line by Line</h2></div></div><p>The options lines shown here:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
 .opt nopage
 .width in=72
 .width out=80
</pre><p>specify that no page breaks will be in the generated output
text and the line length of the input and output text. The first
line below instructs SPICE to perform a DC analysis of the circuit
where VIN is run from -0.15V to 0.15V in 0.010V increments. The
next line tells SPICE to generate operating point information for
the circuit. It is this line that reports the transconductances of
each transistor.</p><pre     class="programlisting">

varying&mdash;&ldquo;transient&rdquo; in SPICE jargon&mdash;portion of the input
voltage is a sine wave centered at 0V with an amplitude of 0.3V
oscillating at a frequency of 5MHz. The AC portion of the input
will be normalized to 1V. That is, the AC analysis in SPICE doesn't
exercise large signal behavior of the circuit. Digital behavior is
the extreme of large signal behavior. Large signal performance of a
circuit can be simulated using transient analysis in SPICE.</p><pre     class="programlisting">

transistors and a number of other types of circuit elements. This

the voltage values at nodes out1 and out2 calculated during the DC

spice3 -b diffpair-1.cir

mode. Listing 2 shows the output of the SPICE analysis. The
operating point information gives the DC bias voltages for all the
nodes in the circuit and the current through every voltage source.
A customary trick to measure current is to insert a voltage source
whose voltage is zero. This does not hinder simulated performance,
but the circuit will simulate slightly slower, since there's more
in it. Model parameters are reported for each type of circuit model
used in the simulation. Operating characteristics for the two
<b  >bjt</b> instances show the transconductance of each
transistor to be 0.0191 A/V.</p><p><a href="2169f2.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 2.

from left to right, ranging over 0V to 5V and shows the input

time I view a plot like this I get nostalgic, recalling the days
when I would flip switches on the front panel of a PDP-8 and load
boot programs from paper tape. But that's another story. This plot
certainly isn't fancy by today's standards, but it does convey the
necessary information.</p><p>Finally, SPICE reports that the simulation took just under
1/10th of a second to run.</p><p><a href="2169l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3</a></p><p>Listing 3 adds more analysis directives to the SPICE input
file from Listing 1. The analyses to be performed are DC, transfer
function, AC and transient. This time we'll start SPICE with an
option to save the resulting data to a file, like so:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
spice3 -b -r diffpair-2.raw diffpair-2.cir
</pre><p>After running SPICE the data file can be perused with
<b  >nutmeg</b>, which comes with the SPICE package.

nutmeg diffpair-2.raw
</pre><p><a href="2169l4.html" target="_self">Listing 4</a></p><p>Listing 4 captures an interactive session with nutmeg. At the
first nutmeg prompt I entered <b  >setplot</b> to give me
the names of analysis data sets within the raw data file. I
selected <b  >dc1</b> and then plotted the output
voltages, shown in Figure 2. When plotted in this way, you can zoom
in on sections of the plot using the right mouse button to define
the zoomed plot's borders. You can also find the coordinates of any
point on the plot or pair of points by either clicking or clicking
and dragging the left mouse button. The coordinates display in the
window where nutmeg runs. You can put labels on the plot by typing
with the keyboard. By setting the type of hard copy device
appropriately you can save the plot in a file for later printing,
as shown in nutmeg commands 3 through 5.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="2169f4.large.jpg"><img src="2169f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 4: AC Analysis Plot in
Radians</p></div></div><p>Next, in Listing 4, I selected the transfer function data.
The display command shows me the variables I can query from the
transfer function data. At prompt number 9 I asked to see the
transfer function that SPICE reports to be 44.60971. This differs
somewhat from the idealized gain equation, which neglects output
resistance of the <b  >bjt</b>.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2169greek2.jpg"></div><p>Rather than just selecting one variable for display, at
prompt number 10 I selected all variables for display. This shows

voltage phase at node out2 in degrees, voltage phase at node out2
in radians and magnitude of the voltage at node out2. These are
shown in Figures 3 through 5, respectively.</p><p>Prompts 17 through 19 resulted in Figure 6, which shows the
input voltage sine wave and the output voltage sine wave. Notice
that the output voltage shows distortion of an over-driven
amplifier.</p><p>At prompt 20 I ran a Fourier analysis on the time domain
voltage to find the harmonic content of the distorted sine wave. I
had to specify the fundamental frequency as 5MHz, the same as was
given in the input file, and the node voltage the Fourier analysis
should inspect. As expected from the compressed shape of the output
sine wave, the total harmonic distortion (THD) is quite
high.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="2169f5.large.jpg"><img src="2169f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 5: AC Analysis Plot as a Function of

will be with a circuit you can't analyze. The good news is that
SPICE3 is improved in this respect, and you have some control over
how numerical solutions are determined. When SPICE calculates node
voltages and branch currents, it uses thresholds for tolerable
errors to determine when a simulation reaches its answer&mdash;that is,
when it reaches numerical convergence. The three parameters
controlling the thresholds can be set on the
<b  >.options</b> statement and are named ABSTOL, VNTOL
and RELTOL. ABSTOL is the smallest current you want SPICE to
accept. Increasing ABSTOL from its default value of 12pA can help a
simulation to converge. VNTOL is the smallest voltage that you want
SPICE to accept. Increasing VNTOL from its default value of 10V can
help a simulation to converge. RELTOL is the ratio of the numerical
answer found during the present iteration to the numerical answer
found during the last iteration. Increasing RELTOL can help a DC
analysis to converge, but increasing RELTOL can also cause
transient analysis problems. If you get a warning from SPICE saying
&ldquo;timestep too small&rdquo;, RELTOL is probably set too large.</p><p>The parameters ITL1 through ITL6 control the number of
iterations to perform before SPICE gives up, and control methods
are used to attain convergence.</p><p>Obviously the accuracy of the simulation results can be no
better than the convergence thresholds used during analysis. If you
don't need to relax the thresholds, this won't present a problem
since the tolerances on component values and variations in
component performance stand to present much more discrepancy
between nominal simulated performance and real-world measured
performance.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="2169f6.large.jpg"><img src="2169f6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 6: Input and Output Voltage Sine

SPICE can do for you and how to use it to its fullest advantage.
SPICE is both prevalent and useful to engineers, and has been so
for nearly 30 years. If you never use SPICE, I hope you caught at
least a glimpse of an engineer's bread and butter. If you use or
will use SPICE, I hope this article gave you some insight into its
use on Linux machines.</p><p><a href="2169s1.html" target="_self">References</a></p></div></div>
