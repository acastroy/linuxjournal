    A simple command with a lot of uses.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1802580.0x18fa3f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>The <span   class="bold"><b>wc</b></span>
(word count) command is a very simple utility found in all Unix
variants. Its purpose is counting the number of lines, words and
characters of text files. If multiple files are specified,
<span   class="bold"><b>wc</b></span> produces a count for each file,
plus totals for all files.
</p><p>When used without options <span   class="bold"><b>wc</b></span>
prints the number of lines, words and characters, in that order. A
word is a sequence of one or more characters delimited by
whitespace. If we want fewer than the three counts, we use options
to select what is to be printed: <b  >-l</b> to print
lines, <b  >-w</b> to print words and
<b  >-c</b> to print characters. The GNU version of
<span   class="bold"><b>wc</b></span> found in Linux systems also
supports the long options format: <b  >--chars</b> (or
<b  >--bytes</b>), <b  >--words</b>,
<b  >--lines</b>.</p><p>When I applied <span   class="bold"><b>wc</b></span> to an
earlier version of the LaTeX source file with this text, I received
the following information from
<span   class="bold"><b>wc</b></span>:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
wc wc.tex
     98     760    4269 wc.tex
</pre><p>This line means that the file had 98 lines, 760 words and
4269 characters (bytes). Actually, I seldom use
<span   class="bold"><b>wc</b></span> alone. Due to its simplicity
<span   class="bold"><b>wc</b></span> is mostly useful when used in
combination with other Linux commands.
</p><p>If we use a file system other than Linux (or Unix), namely
DOS, there is an ambiguity due to a line break being a combination
of a carriage return and a line feed. Should <b  >-c</b>
count a line break as two characters or only one? The POSIX.2
standard dictates that <b  >-c</b> actually counts bytes,
not characters, and it provides the <b  >-m</b> option to
count characters. This option cannot be used together with
<b  >-c</b>, and for that matter, GNU
<span   class="bold"><b>wc</b></span> does not support
<b  >-m</b>. If we desperately need it, we can always
subtract the line count from the byte count to obtain the char
count of a DOS file. Here are two different ways to achieve
this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
wc /dosc/autoexec.bat | awk '{print $3-$1}'
tr -d '\015' &lt; /dosc/autoexec.bat | wc -c
</pre><p>The first solution uses <b  >awk</b> to subtract
the first field (the line count) from the third field (the byte
count). The second solution uses <b  >tr</b> to delete
the carriage returns (char 15 in octal) from the input before
feeding it to <span   class="bold"><b>wc</b></span>.
</p><p>Recently I used a CD-ROM writer that was connected to a
machine that was slightly sick. Now and then a block of 32
consecutive bytes got corrupted while copying amongst different
hard disk partitions. This caused quite a few CD-ROM backups to be
damaged. Sometimes the damage affected a large file, and in this
case, it was cheaper to keep the bad file and add a small patch
file to the next backup. To decide whether we should make a new
full backup of a corrupted file or just make a differential patch,
we used the <b  >cmp</b> command to detect the
differences, followed by <span   class="bold"><b>wc</b></span> to
count them:.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cmp -l /original/foo /cdrom/foo | wc -l
</pre><p>The <b  >-l</b> option to <b  >cmp</b>
provides a full listing of the differences, one per line, instead
of stopping on the first difference. Thus, the above command
outputs the number of bytes that are wrong.
</p><p>If we want to count how many words are in line 70 of file
<b  >foo.txt</b> then we use:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
head -70 foo.txt | tail -1 | wc -w
</pre><p>Here, the command <b  >head -70</b> outputs the
first 70 lines of the file, the command <b  >tail -1</b>
(i.e., the number 1) outputs the last line of its input, which
happens to be line 70 of <b  >foo.txt</b>, and
<span   class="bold"><b>wc</b></span> counts how many words are in
that line.
</p><p>If our boss presses us to include in our monthly project
report a count of the number of lines of code produced, then we can
do it like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
wc -l */*.[ch] | tail -1 | awk '{print $1}'
</pre><p>This assumes that all our code is in files with extension
<b  >.h</b> or <b  >.c</b>, and that these
files live in subdirectories one level deep from our current
directory. If file depth is arbitrary, we use the following:
<pre     class="programlisting">
wc -l `find . -name "*.[ch]" -print` | \
         tail -1 | awk '{print $1}'
</pre>


Notice the use of back quotes in the <b  >find</b>
command line, and forward (normal) quotes in the
<b  >awk</b> command. The command <b  >find . -name
"*.[ch]" -print</b> outputs the <b  >*.c</b> and
<b  >*.h</b> files located below the current directory,
one per line. The back quotes cause that command to be executed,
and then replace each newline in the command's output with a blank,
and pass that output to the <span   class="bold"><b>wc</b></span>
command line.
</p><p>If in good GNU style you mark all current bugs and dirty
hacks in your source code with the word <b  >FIXME</b>,
then you can see how much urgent work is pending by typing:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
grep FIXME *.c | wc -l
</pre><p>The <b  >grep</b> outputs all lines that have a
<b  >FIXME</b>, and then we just have to count them.
</p><p>As you can see there is nothing special about the
<span   class="bold"><b>wc</b></span> command; however, half of my
shell scripts would stop working if that command was not
available.</p></div></div>
