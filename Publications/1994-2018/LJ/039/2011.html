    Here are some good tips on how to get
    connected to the Internet as an addressable host.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b8e580.0x1c863f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>The Internet is a vast collection of
machines and networks that allows a user on one machine to connect
to another machine across the nation or across the world. One way
to join the Internet community is to sign up with an Internet
service provider (ISP) and go through a shell account. Some of the
more popular ones are America Online (AOL), Prodigy, NetCom,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>etc.</em></span> However, every computer junky wishes to
be connected directly. This article gives some tips and details on
how to get connected to the Internet and how to be an addressable
host. Before becoming a host you should be comfortable with basic
system administration duties; otherwise, once on the Internet your
machine can be vulnerable. The rewards of &ldquo;full&rdquo; connectivity
outweigh any possible disadvantages.
</p><p>The first step is to decide how to connect to the Internet.
My goal was to <span   class="emphasis"><em>do it</em></span> as cheaply as possible,
i.e., without huge monthly expenses. For this reason I opted out of
ISDN, which is about 5 times faster than a fast (33.6 Kbps) modem,
but the start-up costs are excessive plus they then typically cost
$50 to $100 per month depending on your usage. In the near future,
cable companies such as @HOME will provide cable modem connections
about 200 times faster than ISDN and promise a price comparable to
a present day POTS (Plain-Old Telephone Service) line plus an ISP
connection. For my current setup I pay about $16 for a second phone
line and $31 per month for an ISP connection. Make sure your ISP is
a local call and pay the extra fee for a
<span   class="bold"><b>static</b></span> IP address. If you don't
have a static IP address, you might as well skip the rest of this
article, since the information contained herein won't be of any
help to you.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b8e580.0x1c86660"></a>Different Domains</h2></div></div><p>Once you have a static IP number, this address can be
registered in any of the top level domains. Not too long ago you
could register in any of the domains for free&mdash;that changed in
1995. The InterNIC (http://www.internic.net/) and its partner
company Network Solutions, Inc. (http://www.netsol.com/) now handle
the registration of second-level domains in the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>com</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>gov</em></span>,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>edu</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>org</em></span> and
<span   class="emphasis"><em>net</em></span> top-level domains. Annual fees of $50 are
charged for each second-level domain in the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>org</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>net</em></span> and the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>com</em></span> domains. A first-time registration cost
$100 and covers a 2 year period. For a company or organization this
represents an insignificant cost, but for a Linux die-hard this
amounts to gross extortion and is contrary to the principles that
the Internet embodies. An alternative is to register in one of the
other domains&mdash;for U.S. residents the <span   class="emphasis"><em>us</em></span>
top-level domain. Each country has its own top-level domain and may
or may not charge fees, non-US residents will have to research the
details for their own country of residence.</p><p>The US Domain is an official top-level domain in the Domain
Name Service (DNS) of the Internet community. It is administered by
the US Domain Registry at the Information Sciences Institute of the
University of Southern California (ISI), under the Internet
Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). (See
http://www.isi.edu/in-notes/usdnr/.) The levels under the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>us</em></span> domain are geopolitically based. The hosts
in California are in the second-level domain
<b  >ca.us</b>, the hosts in Minnesota are in
<b  >mn.us</b>, and so on. The geopolitical third-level
domains are usually city names. For example, San Jose, CA
translates to <b  >san-jose.ca.us</b>. Abbreviations were
allowed at one time and are supported for existing registered
hosts. There are are other special third-level and fourth-level
domains for schools (<b  >k12</b>), city governments
(<b  >ci</b>), county governments
(<b  >co</b>), community colleges
(<b  >cc</b>), <b  >etc.</b>, but these usually
don't apply to most personal Linux hosts.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b8e580.0x1c86df0"></a>Domain Name Service</h2></div></div><p>First of all, &ldquo;what is Domain Name Service?&rdquo; DNS is a
hierarchy of name servers. Each level of the hierarchy maintains a
database of all IP addresses and host names for the next lower
level. So when you send e-mail to, say,
<b  >rk@owen.san-jose.ca.us</b>, your machine will send a
query to the <b  >root</b>(.) name server to resolve who
is the <b  >us</b> domain name server. Your machine
repeats its query to the <b  >us</b> domain name server
to resolve who is the <b  >ca.us</b> name server. This
process is repeated to find the <b  >san-jose.ca.us</b>
name server from the <b  >ca.us</b> name server. The
<b  >san-jose.ca.us</b> name server then sends your
machine the IP address for <b  >owen.san-jose.ca.us</b>.
Once the IP address is known then a connection can be established
with <b  >owen.san-jose.ca.us</b> to transfer an e-mail
message. The IP address is by required machines and networks to
route a connection through the Internet. The host domain name is
just a convenience for us mere humans who have a tough time
remembering a sequence of numbers such as 199.184.169.67 (that is,
the <i  >Linux Journal</i> web server).</p><p>If this process of name resolution had to be performed every
time a domain name was used, the root machines would be the busiest
in the world and the network would grind to a slow crawl. In most
cases the IP addresses for often used machines are cached in local
routing tables and most name resolutions can be satisfied at a
fairly local level. To discover which machines are name-servers use
the <b  >nslookup</b> command. The
<b  >nslookup</b> command and its output are shown
below.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
nslookup -query=ns us
Server:  norad.mcdn.net
Address:  168.253.48.19
Non-authoritative answer:
us      nameserver = VENERA.ISI.EDU
us      nameserver = EXCALIBUR.USC.EDU
us      nameserver = NS.ISI.EDU
us      nameserver = RS0.INTERNIC.NET
us      nameserver = NS.UU.NET
us      nameserver = ADMII.ARL.MIL
Authoritative answers can be found from:
</pre><pre     class="programlisting">
US      nameserver = VENERA.ISI.EDU
US      nameserver = EXCALIBUR.USC.EDU
US      nameserver = NS.ISI.EDU
US      nameserver = RS0.INTERNIC.NET
US      nameserver = NS.UU.NET
US      nameserver = ADMII.ARL.MIL
VENERA.ISI.EDU  internet address = 128.9.0.32
VENERA.ISI.EDU  internet address = 128.9.176.32
</pre><p>You can also look at lower level domains and their name
servers. You'll find, however, that the local geopolitical domain
name server corresponds to an organization that has been
<span   class="emphasis"><em>delegated authority</em></span> over that domain. Look at
http://www.isi.edu/in-notes/us-domain-delegated.txt to find out who
administers the third-level domains in your area or use the
http://www.isi.edu/in-notes/usdnr/rwhois.html form.
</p><p>Now you know who to contact. The question now is &ldquo;what?&rdquo;
Grab ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc1480.txt (Request-For-Comment
number 1480&mdash;the Internet parlance for a semi-official standard),
which describes the US domain and how to register your host. The
most important part is Appendix II which contains the registration
form. Don't alter the form except to add your information. The
appendix contains enough examples and descriptions to make it
fairly straight forward to answer the various questions. Everyone
needs to answer questions 1 through 7. Question 2 requests your
fully qualified domain name. The <span   class="emphasis"><em>cool</em></span> thing to
do is use your last name followed by the geopolitical domain, for
example, owen.san-jose.ca.us. First determine whether the name
you've chosen is not being used by someone else by typing the
command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
nslookup -query=any owen.san-jose.ca.us
Server:  norad.mcdn.net
Address:  168.253.48.19
*** norad.mcdn.net can't find owen.san-jose.ca.us:
Non-existent host/domain
</pre><p>List yourself in questions 6 and 7 as the administrative and
technical contact. (Do not list your ISP technical support&mdash;they do
not administer your machine.) For an individual host answer
question 10, where you give the IP address assigned to you by your
ISP. Send off the form to the delegated authority in your area and
sit back and wait. It takes up to 8 working days before your
machine gets registered and another day for the routing tables to
get updated. (Some delegated authorities may charge a nominal fee
of about $10, so it may not be free for everyone.) If your host
doesn't get added after a few days give the delegated authority a
phone call. The delegated authorities are usually adding SOA
(start-of-authority) records, that is, delegating fourth-level
domains. You may need to remind them that all you need is an A (or
<span   class="emphasis"><em>address</em></span>) record to be added. The A record is
the DNS way of specifying the host domain name for a single IP
address. They also will add a HINFO (<span   class="emphasis"><em>host
information</em></span>) record which lists the hardware and
operating system (Linux in this case) of your host.
</p><p>Once your IP address has been registered then the output of
<b  >nslookup</b> command will look like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
nslookup -query=any owen.san-jose.ca.us
Server:  norad.mcdn.net
Address:  168.253.48.19
Non-authoritative answer:
owen.san-jose.ca.us     internet address = 205.179.57.217
Authoritative answers can be found from:
san-jose.CA.US  nameserver = ns.scruz.net
san-jose.CA.US  nameserver = ns2.scruz.net
san-jose.CA.US  nameserver = morris.ucsc.edu
ns.scruz.net    internet address = 165.227.1.1
ns2.scruz.net   internet address = 165.227.2.10
morris.ucsc.edu internet address = 128.114.142.6
morris.ucsc.edu internet address = 128.114.1.6

address. This is only half of the story, what about the reverse
process? More secure sites may refuse connections with your
machine, if they can't resolve the domain name from the IP address.
Also, several utilities such as <span   class="emphasis"><em>sendmail</em></span> will
attempt to resolve IP addresses to host names.</p><p>The fully qualified domain name represents a &ldquo;logical&rdquo;
network. The best example of this is a multi-national corporate
network, say <span   class="emphasis"><em>ibm.com</em></span>. Without getting into too
much detail about the various classes of IP addresses, the IBM
hosts may be in different address classes even though all the IBM
hosts are in the <span   class="emphasis"><em>ibm.com</em></span> domain.</p><p>Your ISP is given a block of IP addresses that it can assign
for either the short term (dynamic IP addresses) or for the long
term (static IP addresses). All these IP addresses are similar
except for the last one or two octets in the address. These IP
addresses are based on the actual physical network. Hence, to do
the reverse look-up the information needs to be
<span   class="emphasis"><em>served</em></span> by the physical network&mdash;in other
words, your ISP. The mechanism is very similar to the domain name
resolution as described above. What you need to do is send e-mail
to your ISP. State that you need an IN-ADDR PTR record added to
their DNS database. This associates your IP address with a fully
qualified domain name, the same one you registered with the US
domain delegated authority. In fact, your ISP is probably connected
directly with the delegated authority, which serves as your ISP's
ISP. Once this record is added, you'll be able to query the special
<b  >in-addr.arpa</b> domain to find your host name
associated with your IP address. To do this use
<b  >nslookup</b> again, which performs a process similar
to the one described above for name resolution. For example,
suppose your IP address is 205.179.57.217 . Reverse the order of
the octets and slap on the <b  >.in-addr.arpa</b> domain
name and the results will look something like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
nslookup -q=any 217.57.179.205.in-addr.arpa
Server:  norad.mcdn.net
Address:  168.253.48.19
217.57.179.205.in-addr.arpa     name = owen.sj.ca.us
179.205.in-addr.arpa    nameserver = kudonet.com
kudonet.com     internet address = 165.227.52.1
</pre><p>In my case, I first registered my machine with the name
owen.sj.ca.us, and this is the name that is returned even though I
have three other names registered with this same IP address.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b8e580.0x1c7e5a0"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>The steps outlined here will lead you through the networking
maze of authorities that comprise the Internet and to successful
registration of your Linux box as a full member of this
<span   class="emphasis"><em>prestigious</em></span> community. In summary:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Get a static IP address from your ISP.</p></li><li><p>Find the delegated authority for your area.</p></li><li><p>Send them a filled out domain registration
form.</p></li><li><p>Contact your ISP to add an IN-ADDR PTR record to
its name server database. Be the envy of all your friends as you
give out your e-mail address that is your own machine name&mdash;not
some shell account. It has also helped me professionally when I
decided to change jobs. My new employers were quite impressed with
my e-mail address rk@owen.sj.ca.us (URL: mailto:rk@owen.sj.ca.us),
and it's easy to remember too.</p></li></ol></div></div></div>
