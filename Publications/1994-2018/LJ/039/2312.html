    Jon &ldquo;maddog&rdquo; Hall dreams up the ideal configuration for
    an Intel Linux system in this fantasy letter to Bob Palmer, President
    and CEO of Digital Equipment
    Corporation.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe22580.0xf1a450"></a></h2></div></div><p>Dear Bob:
</p><p>I have finished configuring your Intel Linux system for you.
I think you will be highly pleased with the resulting
capabilities.</p><p>First, I split the disk space up into a small amount for
Windows for Workgroups and WNT, with the rest of the space devoted
to Linux. I did this so that you could do a triple-boot, booting
either Windows for Workgroups, WNT or Linux. I know you like to
experiment with those other operating systems, and when you have
visitors from Redmond you like to at least pretend you run their
operating systems from time to time, so having the triple-boot
capability is handy. This also gives you access to their new 32-bit
applications, as well as ensuring that their old 16-bit
applications work without a hiccup.</p><p>I continued with a basic installation of Red Hat Linux (Red
Hat, Inc., Durham, NC), installing the FVWM-95 window manager,
which gives a Windows 95 &ldquo;look and feel&rdquo;. This will also help
with surprise visits from your Washington friends, but I added the
&ldquo;accelerated X&rdquo; window server and the Common Desktop Environment
(CDE) desktop from Xi Graphics, both of which are available from
WorkGroup Solutions of Aurora, Colorado. By using these products
you can run those really great 3D modeling programs on your Digital
UNIX server, and display them on your Linux box using the optional
OpenGL extensions. You also get exactly the same look and feel of
your Digital UNIX desktop on your Linux system. I am sure this will
make you more comfortable with Linux, since CDE is used in your
existing environments.</p><p>From time to time I know you like to run breadboard
simulation applications that run only on a Mac, just to keep your
hand in electronic design. I have installed a Macintosh emulator
called &ldquo;Executor 2&rdquo; from ARDI (Albuquerque, NM) on the Linux box,
and tied that into CDE so you can easily launch it. Likewise for
those dull moments, you can execute Wabi (available from Caldera,
Inc.) and run solitaire there, as well as a whole bunch of other
Windows 3.1 applications which you can launch directly off the W3.1
part of the disk, since Linux can mount MS-DOS file systems. And
Bob, you will be amused to find out the &ldquo;disk copy&rdquo; function
under W3.1 actually works faster with Wabi than it does running
native on the hardware. In fact, a lot of the Windows programs
running under Wabi seem to execute faster than they do in native
mode. Perhaps that is only my perception (I do admit a bias), but
it could also be that Wabi takes advantage of the buffer cache of
Linux in its input/output operations, as well as the virtual
address space and virtual memory protections of Linux.</p><p>Speaking of faster, I would not have done all of this work if
I could not give you a better environment than you had before, and
with the addition of two more tools, I believe I have accomplished
that goal. Of course, I realized you still wanted to take advantage
of the power and high availability of your 64-bit Digital UNIX
system, with its huge address spaces, fail over capabilities and
over 5,000 commercial applications available. On the other hand, I
know you want to minimize the network traffic over the Internet and
create a seamless environment in which you get the most compute
power on your desk for the least amount of money. Therefore, I
enlisted the aid of Empress Software, Inc. of Markham, Ontario,
Canada and Platform Computing of Toronto, Canada. Empress has a
distributed a relational database that runs on 1500 Unix platforms,
and when it can take advantage of a 64-bit environment (as in the
case of Digital UNIX), it does so. This is particularly important
(as you know) when you are trying to process large unstructured
binary objects. In addition, the Empress RDBMS can attach to an
Oracle Parallel Server database and extract information, bringing
it directly back to your Linux system. This allows you to intermix
the SQL calls with some of the data coming from the Empress
database and some coming from the Oracle database, but only the
pertinent data coming back directly to your Linux system with the
least possible impact on the network. Sure beats grepping those
terabyte files over NFS, doesn't it?</p><p>Finally, the use of Platform Computing's Load Sharing
Facility (LSF) has me really excited. You know Digital UNIX has
clustering capability with really fast recovery from a variety of
failures, but Platform Computing has developed software that allows
you to have a cluster in a heterogeneous environment. Supported on
almost every Unix platform (and even Bill's WNT), it allows you to
execute from your Linux system a program on whatever system is best
able to run that program, with the output of the application coming
right back to your Linux system as if it was executing locally. So,
for example, if you were executing GIMP or Emacs, you would
probably be executing it on your desktop Linux system, but if you
wished to execute PV-WAVE (which runs on both platforms), LSF might
transparently run that on the Digital UNIX platform to take
advantage of the Alpha's superior floating point capabilities. Or,
if you wished to execute that specialized accounting package which
only runs on Digital UNIX, by typing in the application's name, LSF
realizes it works only on Digital UNIX and finds the least loaded
Digital UNIX system (taking into account CPU, I/O, memory
constraints, etc.) to run it on, and send the output back to your
system. And the accountants will be happy to know LSF can also do
that batch processing they have been asking for. LSF truly makes
use of the network as an extension of your computer.</p><p>So Bob, I hope you enjoy the Linux system I have created for
your desktop. Whether you choose CDE or Windows 95 as the &ldquo;Look
and Feel&rdquo; of Linux, you will still be able to have access to these
features, since all of these applications run both on Intel Linux
and Digital UNIX, creating that seamless environment you keep
demanding.</p><p>I will have a little time next week, so I will be happy to
duplicate this environment for your Hi-Note Ultra II laptop.</p><p>Please say &ldquo;Hello&rdquo; to Mrs. Palmer for me, and thank her for
the cookies.</p><p>Sincerely,Jon &ldquo;maddog&rdquo; HallExecutive Director, Linux
