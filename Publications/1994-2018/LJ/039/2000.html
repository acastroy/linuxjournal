kernel, let me clear the air&mdash;<span   class="emphasis"><em>The Basic Kernel</em></span>
is about 386BSD. If you are a savvy OS person, you've already
figured that out from the names of the authors; Bill and Lynne
Jolitz are the creators of 386BSD. So, why review it? Because it is
a good book that covers the internals of operating systems
design&mdash;and 386BSD, the system it covers, is available in source
code.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>The Basic Kernel</em></span> is the first volume in
a series entitled <span   class="emphasis"><em>Operating System Source Code
Secrets</em></span>. The second book in the series is titled
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Virtual Memory</em></span>. The first thirty pages of the
book explain why such a book is necessary, and define both what a
kernel is and the notation used in the book.</p><p>The book then talks about what code needs to be done for the
kernel, presenting code fragments with explanations. About 60 pages
cover the assembly code necessary to interface to the 386
processor. Not being a 386 assembly language programmer (but having
extensive systems programming experience), I had some problems
here. The explanations were clearly for someone with an assembly
language background. I would have liked to see more in the way of
&ldquo;how it works&rdquo; explanations. However, if you are interested in
386 code, it is probably fine.</p><p>I felt more comfortable with the next chapter, covering C
code. The beginning of that chapter is typical of what follows, so
I will use it as an example. The trap.c routine is introduced,
along with a listing and brief explanation of its functions,
followed by a detailed explanation of what the functions are, how
to call them and how they are implemented. The implementation
details consist of code fragments with text explanations.</p><p>The book continues in this style, covering i386/trap.c,
i386/cpu.c, kern/config.c, kern/malloc.c, kern/fork.c, kern/exit.c,
kern/sig.c, kern/cred.c, kern/priv.c, kern/synch.c, kern/lock.c,
kern/execve.c and kern/descrip.c. If you have looked at or worked
with a POSIX kernel, you can probably guess what functions are
found in these files.</p><p>Three appendices cover kernel source organization,
network-level security and dynamic make files. The book ends with
answers to the exercises included in the chapters, and an index
with entries for all the functions described.</p><p>The book is well-written, and, I expect, accurate. If you
want to know how the 386BSD kernel works, this book will tell you.
And, if you want to know how to implement low-level functionality
that requires dealing with 386 hardware, this book has a wealth of
information on the subject.</p><p>What this book won't tell you is how Linux is implemented.
While the same sort of tasks have to be done in Linux, different
design decisions were made for 386BSD than for Linux. As I was
reading the text, many times I was thinking, &ldquo;Gee, I wonder if
this is done the same way in Linux?&rdquo; If that comparison is of
interest to you, buying both <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Basic Kernel</em></span>
and <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Kernel Internals</em></span> (reviewed in
<i  >Linux Journal</i>, December, 1996) would probably
fill your needs.</p></div></div>
