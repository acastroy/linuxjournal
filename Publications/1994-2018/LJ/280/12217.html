JMR SiloStor NVMe SSD Drives</h2></div></div><p>
Compute-intensive workflows are the environments in which the newly developed JMR
SiloStor NVMe family of SSD drives is designed to show its colors. Ideal for HPC,
data centers, genome research, content creation, CGI/animation, codec processing
and gaming, among others, the SiloStor drive family comes in three NVMe/PCIe
configurations: single-drive module, x4 PCIe connectivity in 512GB/1TB/2TB
capacities; dual-drive, x8 connectivity in 1TB/2TB/4TB capacities; and quad-drive
module, x8 connectivity, available in 2TB/4TB/8TB capacities. The dual- and
quad-drive cards incorporate a PCIe switch, and the drives can be striped (on a
single card) for additional performance. All SiloStor designs incorporate active
heatsink coolers on the drive modules themselves, maintaining low operating
temperatures even during intensive sequential write operations. Key performance
metrics include &lt;1 mS average access time of &lt;1 mS, 2 million hours MTBF, 1,200
TBW minimum endurance, 90,000/70,000 IOPS random 4K read/write speed and
4,000/3,000 MB/sequential read/write speed.

TeamViewer Linux Host</h2></div></div><p>
At last abandoning WINE and launching native Linux support, TeamViewer announced
the availability of a new preview version of its Linux Host with native Linux
support. The new release of TeamViewer, a solution for remote support, remote
access and online meetings, addresses additional critical system administrator
requirements, including support of Wake-On-LAN, assignment of TeamViewer accounts
via GUI and additional regulation capabilities. Wake-On-LAN support givers users
the power to wake up Linux devices that are in standby mode and connected to a
power supply. Meanwhile, account assignment via GUI on the TeamViewer client
permits account owners to share their contacts with each other to support the
wider team as well as maintain devices around the clock 24/7. Finally, a
&ldquo;Confirm all&rdquo; setting lets users ensure that all actions must be
directly confirmed from that device, which improves overall security. The
TeamViewer Linux Host requires at least Qt 5.2, Linux Kernel 2.6.27 and GLIBC
2.17.

Zed A. Shaw's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Learn Python 3 the Hard Way</em></span> (Addison-Wesley
Professional)</h2></div></div><p>
Author Zed A. Shaw makes a simple promise in his <span   class="emphasis"><em>Hard Way</em></span> series of books from
publisher Addison-Wesley Professional: &ldquo;It'll be hard at first. But soon,
you'll just get it&mdash;and that will feel great!&rdquo; Shaw's latest book
in the series is called <span   class="emphasis"><em>Learn Python 3 the Hard Way: A Very Simple Introduction to
the Terrifyingly Beautiful World of Computers and Code</em></span>. In the book, readers learn
Python by working through 52 &ldquo;brilliantly crafted exercises&rdquo; in a
purposefully proscribed manner. After reading the exercise, readers type the
code precisely&mdash;with no copying and pasting! Then readers fix their mistakes
and watch the program run. The process teaches essentials of how a computer
works, what good programs look like, and how to read, write and think about
computer code. Shaw teaches even more in 5+ hours of video where he shows readers
how to break, fix and debug code&mdash;live, as he's doing the exercises. Lessons
cover topics from installing a complete Python environment to working with code,
basic mathematics, variables, looping and logic, object-oriented programming,
Python packaging, automated testing and much more. Readers bring the discipline,
commitment and persistence to Shaw's formula, and the output will be a Python
programmer!

BeBop Sensors, Inc.'s Marcel Modular Data Gloves</h2></div></div><p>
In the fabric-embedded sensors space, all controllers need to be accurate and
fast. &ldquo;If latency is more than 6&ndash;8 milliseconds, you are out of the
band&rdquo;,
cautions BeBop Sensors Inc., maker of the new Marcel Modular Data Glove solution
for virtual and augmented reality OEMs. Utilizing BeBop's patented fabric
sensor technology and designed for accurate, real-time control and navigation in
these environments, the BeBop Data Gloves are available to OEMs in 5, 10 and 14
sensor versions. They provide haptic&mdash;that is, kinesthetic&mdash;feedback and sense knuckle
and abduction motion of the human hand. BeBop's basic configuration provides
high-speed sensor processing as well as a 6 or 9 degrees-of-freedom inertial
measurement unit that measures acceleration and angular rate. Fast, deterministic
sensing provides sub-frame latency at 120Hz for real-time control of games and
environments. Mezzanine boards can be added to the printed circuit board assembly
stack to add functionality, such as translation and haptic electronics. A haptic
audio creation kit is available, enabling content creators to customize and add to
the haptic library.

Ocado Technology's Kubermesh</h2></div></div><p>
Instead of relying on servers concentrated in one large data center, the new
Kubermesh is designed to simplify data-center architectures for smart factories by
elegantly and cost effectively leveraging a distributed network of computing nodes
spread across the enterprise. Developed by Ocado Technology, a division of
Ocado (the world's largest online-only supermarket), the Kubermesh package uses
container-based technology and the Kubernetes system to implement an on-premises
private cloud architecture in which desktop computers can be configured as nodes
supporting the compute or storage functionality typically delivered by
high-performance servers in a data center. Ocado Technology observes that
Kubermesh-based nodes are fault-tolerant, secure, flexible and designed to process
the generous amounts of real-time data generated in smart factories. By
distributing data-center functionality into a mesh network of nodes, Kubermesh
alleviates the need for a dedicated data center and complex networking
infrastructure, resulting in significant reductions in not just energy consumption
but also the capital and significant operational expenditures that come with
maintaining in-house high-performance servers. With Kubermesh, Ocado Technology
hopes for internal gains through unlocking the potential of container
technology and external gains as the Open Source community deploys and develops
Kubermesh in new and exciting ways.
