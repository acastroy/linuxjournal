One of the nifty things about being a Linux user is how bizarre life can
get. One moment you can be writing cutting-edge code, and the next you can
get stuck in a nostalgia rabbit hole installing Afterstep because you used
NeXTStep machines in college (guilty). This month my life got a little
crazy because I had to install Microsoft Office for my daughter. The
computer I had to install it on? Linux. Yet, in this wacky world we live
in, it ended up working perfectly&mdash;sort of. There seems to be something
new every day in the Linux world, and this month, there are lots of new
things to talk about.
</p><p>
Reuven M. Lerner starts off this issue with some tips on disaster
planning&mdash;not
&ldquo;evil genius&rdquo; sort of planning, but rather planning for what to do when
disaster inevitably happens. Yes, the obvious answer is &ldquo;have a
backup&rdquo;,
but it's a bit more complicated than that, and Reuven provides sound
advice.

Dave
Taylor decides you deserve a bit of a break, and although you still will learn some
awesome coding skills, you do it while creating a dice game. The name of
the game is Bunco, which sounds like something he made up, but
nonetheless, it's interesting. Be sure to check it out.

Kyle Rankin teaches how to take a vacation properly this month. If
you've known Kyle for a while, you know that he's been in the awkward
situation of fixing remote servers from atop a ski lift before, so his
preparatory skills are worth reading.

I start a new series this issue on
Ansible. I'm a big fan of DevOps tools, but so many of them have such a steep
learning curve, it makes them difficult to integrate into your system.
Ansible is one of my favorite configuration management platforms because
it uses standard SSH for connecting to client computers. This makes it
easy to start small and add more clients as you learn to take
advantage of how powerful it can be.

Streaming music is the method most people use for listening nowadays,
whether it's from Pandora, Spotify or any of dozens of other services.
Bill Dengler shows how to create your own streaming radio station using
open-source tools. If you've ever wanted to stream a live event without
going through the hassle of video, it's an article you won't want to
miss.
</p><p>
Charles Fisher finishes off the issue with instructions on using inotify
to fire off events on a Linux system. I'm guilty of resorting to timed
cron jobs for most things relating to filesystem changes, but with
inotify, it's possible to have a filesystem change launch a process. It's
a proactive way of accomplishing a task, and far, far more efficient.
Charles walks through the process and helps you avoid some pitfalls
along the way.
