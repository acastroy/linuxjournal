</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe96580.0xf8e500"></a></h2></div></div><p>I wasn't bored: I don't have time to be
bored. Texas Agricultural Extension Service operates a fairly large
enterprise-wide network that stretches across hell's half acre,
otherwise known as Texas. We have around 3,000 users in 249
counties and 12 district offices who expect to get their e-mail and
files across our Wide Area Network. Some users actually expect the
network to work most of the time. We use Ethernet networking with
Novell servers at some 35 locations, about 15 have routers that are
connected via a mixture of 56Kb circuits, fractional T1,
frame-relay and radio links. We are not currently using barbed wire
fences for our network, no matter what you may have heard.</p><p>I am privileged to be part of the team that set up and
maintains the network. We do not live in a perfect network
world&mdash;things happen. Scarcely a day goes by that we do not have
one or more WAN link outages, usually of short duration. We
sometimes have our hands full just keeping all the pieces
connected. Did I mention that the users expect the mail and other
software to actually work?</p><p>Cruising the USENET newsgroups, I read a posting about &ldquo;Big
Brother, a solution to the problem of Unix Systems Monitoring&rdquo;
written by Sean MacGuire of Montr&eacute;al, Canada. I was intrigued to
notice that Big Brother was a collection of shell scripts and
simple C programs designed to monitor a bunch of Unix machines on a
network. So what if most of our mission critical servers were
Novell-based? Who cares if some of our web servers run on
Macintosh, OS/2, Windows 95 or NT? We use both Linux and various
flavors of Unix in a surprisingly large number of places.</p><p>System administrators often reported difficult installations
and software incompatibilities with the monitoring software; thus,
frustrated users often gave us our first hint that all was not
well. We had cooked up a number of homemade monitoring systems;
pinging and tracerouting to all the servers can be very
informative. We even looked at a bunch of proprietary (and
expensive) network monitoring systems. It is amazing how much money
these systems can cost.</p><p>According to the blurb by Sean MacGuire on Big
Brother:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Big Brother is a loosely-coupled distributed set
of tools for monitoring and displaying the current status of an
entire Unix network and notifying the system administrator should
need be. It came about as the result of automating the day to day
tasks encountered while actively administering Unix systems.</p></blockquote></div><p>The USENET news article provided a URL to the home site of
Big Brother, http://www.iti.qc.ca/iti/users/sean/bb-dnld/. I
pointed my browser to it and was rewarded with a blue image of a
sinister face peering out under the caption &ldquo;big brother is
watching &rdquo;against a purple background. After my initial shock, I
learned that Big Brother featured:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Web-based status display</p></li><li><p>Configurable warning and panic levels</p></li><li><p>Notification via pager or e-mail</p></li><li><p>Free and included source code</p></li></ul></div><p>I was fascinated, especially by the last item: &ldquo;Free and
includes source code.&rdquo; (I often tell people that Linux isn't free,
but priceless.) So what could a priceless package do for me? What
does Big Brother check?</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Connectivity via ping</p></li><li><p>HTTP servers up and running</p></li><li><p>Disk space usage</p></li><li><p>Uptime and CPU usage</p></li><li><p>Essential processes still running</p></li><li><p>System-generated messages and warnings</p></li></ul></div><p>Overall, very sensible. Looking for some &ldquo;gotchas&rdquo;, I found
I would need a Unix-based machine, a functioning web server and
browser (for the display), a compiler, Kermit and a modem line (for
the pager). A web server was no problem, as we run many. A C
compiler came with Linux, and we use Kermit on many machines with
modems. So far, so good.</p><p>The Big Brother web site provided links to a few
demonstration sites, and a link to download the program as well. I
connected to a demonstration site and was greeted with an amazing
display:</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2225f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

</pre><p>As you can see, Big Brother is watching. While enduring the
scrutiny of the Orwellian face peering out at me, I examined the
rest of the display. It is colored like a traffic signal
(green/yellow/red), and the update time is clearly displayed
beneath it. To the right of &ldquo;Big Brother&rdquo; are four buttons,
marked clearly <b  >Help</b>, <b  >Info</b>,
<b  >Page</b> and <b  >View</b>. Beneath the
header area is a table with six column headings and three rows,
each neatly labelled with a computer host name. The boxes formed by
the intersection of the rows and columns contain attractive green
and yellow balls. The overall effect is like a decorated tree. The
left side of the screen has a yellow tint, gradually becoming black
at the center.
</p><p>Selecting the <b  >Help</b> button gives a brief
explanation of Big Brother. Choosing the <b  >Info</b>
Button provides a much longer and more detailed explanation of the
system, including a graphic that really <span   class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span>
worth a thousand words. The <b  >Page</b> button sends a
signal to a radio-linked pager&mdash;not at all what I had expected.
Finally, the <b  >View</b> selection provides a brief but
perhaps more useful view of the information, isolating only the
systems with problems.</p><p>In my case, only the &ldquo;iti-s01&rdquo; system was displayed. My
browser cursor indicated a link as it passed over each colored dot,
so I clicked on the blinking yellow dot and received this
message:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
yellow Tue Feb 18 22:50:53 EST 1997 Feb 16 12:22:33
iti-s01 kernel: WARNING: / was not properly dismounted
</pre><p>This puzzled me at first. How on earth could it know that? It
turns out that Big Brother (BB) checks the system /var/log/messages
file periodically and alerts on any line that begins with either
WARNING or NOTICE. As I am certain Sean MacGuire is very
conscientious, I suspect he adds that line to his message file, so
the viewer can see how Big Brother reports its findings.
</p><p>Suddenly, my screen spontaneously updated. The update time
had changed by five minutes, and a blinking yellow dot appeared
under the column labelled <b  >procs</b>. I clicked on
the blinking yellow dot and was informed that the
<b  >sendmail</b> process was not running. This got me
really interested&mdash;Big Brother can monitor whether selected
processes are running.</p><p>Being a little puzzled about the screen's ability to update
itself, I viewed the document source and discovered some HTML
commands that were new to me:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;META HTTP-EQUIV="REFRESH" CONTENT="120"&gt;
&lt;META HTTP-EQUIV="EXPIRES"
CONTENT="Tue Feb 18 23:22:07 CST 1997"&gt;
</pre><p>The first <b  >META</b> line instructs browsers to
get an update every 120 seconds. The second tells the browser to
get a new copy after the expiration time and date&mdash;very clever.
</p><p>I returned to the graphics window and discovered that the
yellow area on the left had changed to red. A new host name row
appeared with a blinking red dot under the column labelled
<b  >conn</b>. I clicked on the blinking red dot and read
this message:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
red Tue Feb 18 22:59:11 CST 1997 bb-network.sh:
Can't connect to router''000... (paging)
</pre><p>The connection to the machine called
<b  >router-000</b> had been interrupted, and the
administrator had been paged. Amazingly, while in Texas, I had
become aware of a network outage in Montr&eacute;al, Canada. This really
had possibilities&mdash;perhaps someday I may get to take a vacation.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe96580.0xf8fc08"></a>Big Brother Installation</h2></div></div><p>I was so impressed with Big Brother that I decided to use it.
Sean has thoughtfully made its acquisition easy, but requests that
you fill out an on-line registration form with your name and e-mail
address. He also likes to know where you heard about Big Brother. I
filled out his forms in early November 1996, and received an e-mail
survey form in late December. To download Big Brother and to get
technical information about how the system works and how to install
and configure the package, go to
http://www.iti.qc.ca/iti/users/sean/bb-dnld/bb-dnld.html.</p><p>When I clicked on the link to download Big Brother, I ended
up with a file called bb-src.tgz. I impetuously gunzipped this to
get bb-src.tar. I then thought better of the impending error of my
ways and decided to download and print the installation
instructions before going further. Installation procedures for Big
Brother can be found at
http://www.iti.qc.ca/iti/users/sean/bb-dnld/bb-install.html, as
well as other information about how to set up the system. Just in
case, I also grabbed and printed the debugging information (as it
turned out, I did not need it) provided at
http://www.iti.qc.ca/iti/users/sean/bb-dnld/bb-debug.html.</p><p>I had no problems following the installation instructions. I
decided to make the $BBHOME directory /usr/src/bb. The automatic
configuration routines are said to work for AIX, FreeBSD, HPUX 10,
Irix, Linux, NetBSD, OSF, Red Hat Linux, SCO, SCO 3/5, Solaris,
SunOS4.1 and UnixWare. I can vouch for Linux, Red Hat Linux,
Solaris and SunOS 4.1. The C programs compiled without incident,
and the installation went smoothly. As always, your mileage may
vary. In less than an hour, I was looking at Big Brother's display
of colored lights.</p><p>At this point, it's a good idea to re-examine the
documentation and information files. Personalize your installation
as desired, and above all, have fun.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe96580.0x1388068"></a>Hacking Big Brother</h2></div></div><p>I admit it. I am a closet hacker. I saw many things about the
stock BB distribution that I wanted to improve. Big Brother's
modular and elegantly simple construction makes it a joy to modify
as desired. The shell scripts are portable, simple, well documented
and easy to understand. The use of the modified hosts file to
determine which hosts to monitor was gratifyingly familiar. The
<b  >bbclient</b> script made it extremely easy to move
the required components to another similar Unix host. Sean has done
a remarkable job in making this package easy to install.</p><p>I became obsessive-compulsive about hacking BB and modified
it slightly, working from Sean MacGuire's v1.03 distribution as a
base. I forwarded my changes to him for possible inclusion in a
later distribution.</p><p>Features I added to BB proper include:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Links to the info files in the brief view
(bb2.html), where I needed them most.</p></li><li><p>Links to html info files for each column heading
and the column info files themselves. I placed these files in the
html directory along with bb.html and bb2.html, and gave them
boring names like conn.html, cpu.html, ... smtp.html.</p></li><li><p>Checks to determine if ftp servers, pop3 post
offices and SMTP Mail Transfer Agents (MTAs) are accessible
($BBHOME/bin/bb-network.sh). These checks all use
<b  >bbnet</b> to <b  >telnet</b> to the
respective ports. I followed Sean's style of adding comments to the
bb-hosts file as follows:</p></li></ul></div><pre     class="programlisting">

</pre><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Updated the bb-info.html and bb-help.html pages to
reflect a version of 1.03a and a date of 10 February 1997. I also
modified them to add brief mention of the new ftp, pop3 and smtp
monitoring checks. Specifically, I changed the bb-help.html file to
add new pager codes as follows:</p></li></ul></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>100&mdash;Disk Error. Disk is over 95% full...</p></li><li><p>200&mdash;CPU Error. CPU load average is unacceptably

the ftp, pop3 and smtp monitoring.</p></li><li><p>Used a standard tag-line file on each html page
that identifies the author and location of the page. Thus, mkbb.sh
and mkbb2.sh now look for an optional tag-line file to incorporate
into the html documents that they generate. The optional files are
named mkbb.tag (for mkbb.sh) and mkbb2.tag (for mkbb2.sh). The
shell scripts look for the optional tag-line files in the
$BBHOME/web directory, which is also where the mkbb.sh and mkbb2.sh
files reside.</p></li><li><p>Went through ALL of the html-generating scripts and
html files to ensure that they actually had sections and properly
placed double quotes around the various arguments.</p></li><li><p>Edited the files so that, for the most part,
everything fits on an 80-column screen.</p></li><li><p>Modified $BBHOME/etc/bbsys.sh to make it easier to
ignore certain disk volumes as follows:</p></li></ul></div><pre     class="programlisting">

pretty obvious in the source of the info file. The cgi scripts are
very simple shell scripts as shown in
<a href="2225l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a>.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe96580.0x1389770"></a>Future Enhancements of Big Brother</h2></div></div><p>Sean MacGuire is the primary author of Big Brother. In the
finest tradition of decentralized shared software development, Sean
solicits improvements, suggestions and enhancements from all. He
then skillfully incorporates them as appropriate into the Big
Brother distribution. Thus, like Linux, Big Brother is in a dynamic
state of positive evolution with contributions from a cast of
thousands (at least dozens). This constrained anarchy produces
interesting results with an international flavor.</p><p>Jacob Lundqvist of Sweden is actively improving the paging
interface. He has done a superb job of enhancing the paging
portion, adding support for alphanumeric and SMS pagers. Darren
Henderson (Maine, US) added AIX support. David Brandon (Texas, US)
added proper IRIX support and Jeff Matson (Minnesota, US) made some
IRIX fixes. Richard Dansereau (Canada) ported Big Brother to SCO3
and provided support for other df's. Doug White (Oregon, US) made
some paging script bug fixes. Ron Nelson (Minnesota, US) adapted BB
to Red Hat Linux. Jac Kersing (Netherlands) made some security
enhancements to bbd.c. Alan Cox (Wales) suggested some shell script
security modifications. Douwe Dijkstra (Netherlands) provided SCO 5
support. Erik Johannessen (Minnesota, US) survived SunOS 4.1.4
installation. Curtis Olson (Minnesota, US) survived IRIX, Linux and
SunOS installations. Gunnar Helliesen (Norway) ported Big Brother
to Ultrix, OSF and NetBSD. Josh Wilmes (Missouri, US) added Solaris
changes for new <b  >ping</b> stuff.</p><p>Many other unsung heroes around the world are undoubtedly
working to enhance BB at this very moment.</p><p>I am (ab)using Big Brother in ways not originally envisioned
by its creator, Sean MacGuire. Texas Agricultural Extension's
networks are wildly heterogeneous mixtures of different operating
systems and protocols, rather than a homogeneous Unix-based
network. I would like to see Big Brother learn about IPX/SPX
protocols for Novell connectivity monitoring. I would also like to
see Big Brother data collection modules for Macintosh, Novell,
OS/2, Windows 3.1x, Windows'95 and Windows NT. Rewriting Big
Brother in Perl might better serve these disparate platforms, if I
could only find the time.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe96580.0x13899d8"></a>Big Brother's Impact at Texas Agricultural
Extension Service</h2></div></div><p>We now monitor around 122 hosts. Only 20 are actually
Unix-based hosts that run Big Brother's bb program internally. Some
28 are Novell servers, 39 are routers, and the rest are a mixture
of Macintosh, OS/2, Windows 3.1x, Windows'95 and Windows NT
machines running one or more types of servers (34 FTP or 26 HTTP).
We also find it useful to monitor our 31 PopMail post offices and
43 mail hosts and gateways. We are checking connectivity on three
DNS servers as well, since they are mission critical.</p><p>Big Brother (or, as I now affectionately refer to it, &ldquo;Big
Bother&rdquo;) is now alerting us to outages five or more times daily.
Typically, the system administrator receives a page. BB's display
is checked and the info file is used to
<b  >traceroute</b> and <b  >ping</b> the
offending machine to validate the outage. Many connection outages
involve routers, DSU/CSUs and multiplexors as well as the actual
host. BB's display allows us to quickly see a pattern that aids in
diagnosis. The ability to dynamically <b  >traceroute</b>
and <b  >ping</b> the host from the html info page also
helps to rapidly determine the actual point of failure. If the
administrator paged cannot correct the problem, he relays it to the
responsible person or agency.</p><p>Before we installed Big Brother, we were frequently notified
of these failures by frustrated users telephoning us. Now, we are
often aware of what has failed before they call. The users are also
becoming aware that they can monitor the network through the WWW
interface. In many instances, we are able to actually correct the
problem before it disturbs our users. It is difficult to accurately
measure the time saved, but we estimate that Big Brother has had a
net positive effect overall.</p><p>We have a machine in a publicly visible area displaying the
brief view of Big Brother. The green, yellow, red and blue screen
splashes are clearly visible far down the hall, helping our network
team to be more aware of problems as they occur. The accessibility
of the WWW page has made Big Brother useful even to people at the
far ends of our network. Thus, Big Brother has become a helpful
member of our network team. Maybe now I'll have time to be
bored.</p></div></div>
