    Why you need a firewall and how to best set it up to meet your needs
    for network security.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1688580.0x1780450"></a></h2></div></div><p>A firewall can be your best friend; it
can also be the cause of a lot of unforeseen problems. When should
you consider placing a firewall into your network? And if you are
sure you need one, where in the network do you put it? Too often,
firewall policy results from a non-technical board meeting, on the
basis of the chairman's &ldquo;I think we want a firewall to secure our
network&rdquo; remark. An organization needs to think about its reasons
for installing a firewall&mdash;what is it meant to protect against, and
how should it go about doing its job? This article aims to clarify
some of the issues that require consideration.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1688580.0x1780558"></a>What is a Firewall?</h2></div></div><p>Although this question seems easy to answer, it is not. The
security experts say a firewall is a dedicated machine that checks
every network packet passing through, and that either drops or
rejects certain packets based on rules set by the system
administrator. However, today we also encounter firewalls running
web servers (Firewall-1 and various NT and Unix machines) and web
servers running a firewall application. It is now common practice
to call anything that filters network packets a firewall. Thus, the
word <span   class="emphasis"><em>firewall</em></span> usually refers to the function
of filtering packets, or to the software that carries out that
function&mdash;and less often to the hardware that runs the
application.</p><p>It is by no means necessary to purchase specialized firewall
hardware or even software. A Linux server&mdash;running on a $400 386
PC&mdash;provides as much protection as most commercial firewalls, with
much greater flexibility and easier configuration.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1688580.0x1780710"></a>Are Firewalls Necessary?</h2></div></div><p>A few years ago I attended a Dutch Unix Users Group (NLUUG)
conference. One of the topics was &ldquo;Using Firewalls to Secure Your
Network&rdquo;. After listening to a few speakers, I had not found a
single argument that justified the necessity of a firewall. I still
believe this is basically true. A good network doesn't need a
firewall to filter out nonsense; all machines should be able to
cope with bad data. However, theory and practice are two different
things.</p><p>Unless you have incredibly tight control over your network,
your users are likely to install a wide variety of software on
their workstations, and to use that software in ways you probably
haven't anticipated. In addition, new security holes are discovered
all the time in common operating systems, and it's very difficult
to make sure each machine has the latest version with
<span   class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span> the bugs fixed.</p><p>For both of these reasons, a centrally-controlled firewall is
a valuable line of defense. Yes, you should control the software
your users install. Yes, you should make sure the security controls
on their workstations are as up-to-date as possible. But since you
can't rely on this being true all the time, firewalls must always
be a consideration and nearly always a reality.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1688580.0x1780920"></a>The Ping of Death</h2></div></div><p>A few months ago, a small crisis arose in the Internet
security world&mdash;the infamous &ldquo;Ping of Death&rdquo;. Somewhere in the
BSD socket code, there was a check missing on the size of certain
fragmented network packets. The result was that after reassembling
a fragmented packet, the packet could end up being a few bytes
larger than the maximum allowed packet size. Since the code assumed
this could never happen, the internal variables were not made
larger than this maximum. The result was a very nasty buffer
overflow causing arbitrary code to be generated, usually crashing
the machine. This bug affected a large community, because it was
present in the BSD socket code. Since this code has often been used
as a base for new software (and firmware), a wide variety of
systems were susceptible to this bug. A list of all operating
systems vulnerable to the &ldquo;Ping of Death&rdquo; can be found on Mike
Bremford's page, located at http://prospect.epresence.com/ping/. A
lot of devices other than operating systems were susceptible to
this problem&mdash;Ethernet switches, routers, modems, printers, hubs
and firewalls as well. The busier the machine, the more fatal the
buffer overrun would be.</p><p>A second reason this bug was so incredibly dangerous was that
it was trivial to abuse. The Microsoft Windows operating systems
contain an implementation of the ICMP ping program that
miscalculates the size of a packet. The maximum packet you can tell
it to use is 65527, which is indeed the maximum allowed IP packet.
But this implementation created a data segment of 65527 bytes and
then put an IP header on it. Obviously, you end up with a packet
that is larger than 65535. So all you had to do was type:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ping -l 65527 victim.com
</pre><p>Once this method was known, servers were crashing around the
world as people happily pinged the globe.
</p><p>As you can see from the list on Mike's page, patches are not
available for all the known vulnerable devices. And even if they
were, the system administration staff would need at least a few
days to fix all the equipment. This is a situation where a firewall
has a very valid role. If a security problem of this magnitude is
found, you can disable it at the access point of your network. If
you had a firewall at the time, most likely you filtered out all
ICMP packets until you had confirmed that your database servers
were not vulnerable. Even though not a single one of these machines
should have been vulnerable, the truth is that a
<span   class="emphasis"><em>lot</em></span> of them were.</p><p>The conclusion we draw from this experience is that the speed
and power of response a firewall gives us can be an invaluable
tool.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1688580.0x1780c38"></a>How Do We Secure Our Network with One or More
Firewalls?</h2></div></div><p>These are the basic questions you should ask:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>What do we need to protect?</p></li><li><p>Against whom do we need to protect?</p></li><li><p>Where do we place the firewall(s) in the
network?</p></li><li><p>How do we configure the firewall?</p></li><li><p>How do we monitor what is going on?</p></li></ol></div><p>To answer these questions correctly, it is of vital
importance that you map your entire network. You don't need to map
every single device in the network, since that changes often
anyway. Try to map the separate subnets, the routers, the hubs and
the physical locations (floors, offices, classrooms). Include the
important parts of the network that you wish to secure the
most.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1688580.0x1781160"></a>What Do We Need to Protect?</h2></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="2159f1.large.jpg"><img src="2159f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Firewall Placement
</p></div></div><p>Most firewalls are used to protect the entire Local Area
Network (LAN). In this case, the Internet router usually acts as
the firewall. A properly configured Internet router filters out the
IP numbers used locally (for instance 10.*, 127.* ,192.x.y.*) to
prevent IP spoofing. It should also filter out all packets from the
outside with an IP number that normally can come only from the
inside. Any packet in this category can only be an attempt to trick
your machines, and it should be denied access immediately. Next,
filter out any outgoing IP traffic that doesn't have your
registered class of IP numbers. This is not only to prevent sending
out bogus packets (or to keep your people from spoofing the
Internet), it's also for your own security. In particular, Windows
products tend to disregard RFCs. One day I found a Windows 95
machine that shared its local printer by giving it the IP number
6.6.6.6. If your Internet router doesn't filter out these packets,
you might be routing your printed documents onto the
Internet.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="2159f2.large.jpg"><img src="2159f2.jpg"></a></div><p>Another frequent use for firewalls is to protect a single
machine. If you want to protect a single machine with a firewall,
you must make sure it doesn't depend on anything outside the
firewall; otherwise, your firewall serves no purpose apart from
giving a false sense of security. If the protected server is using
data from an unprotected PC, someone can falsify the information on
the PC in order to do potentially serious damage to your server's
data. Someone gaining access to the PC could also reach the server
by pretending to be the trusted PC user. If the machine relies on
other machines, you want to place your firewall a bit further
upstream, so that it can protect those machines as well. NFS is a
good example of an application you would not want to allow through
the firewall in this setup. This type of firewall is easy to
configure. Block all protocols not in use on the sensitive server,
forward only those packets with the server's IP, and don't forget
to prevent IP spoofing of your server's IP number from the
outside.</p><p>A script to set up typical firewall rules to protect a single
machine or small subnet is shown in
<a href="2159l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1. Script for Typical Firewall
Rules</a>.</p><p>Obviously, real networks aren't as simple as the above
examples. Most networks have various machines which are multi-homed
and part of different subnets. Larger organizations, like schools,
have a problem in that a lot of people have physical access to the
Ethernet. The best way to protect portions of these networks is to
use subnets on physically separate cables. For example, it would be
an excellent policy to give the system administration office a
separate subnet, since system administrators often need to use the
privileged accounts.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1688580.0x1781688"></a>The Complex Network</h2></div></div><p>Quite often a network you wish to protect does only a few
limited tasks. On a typical administration network, people want to
use the Web, e-mail, POP and quite often a telnet connection to the
administrative database server (hidden in a Windows application).
Masquerading works best for these networks. It makes sure the
individual machines in the administrative network are not reachable
(unless the masquerading host itself is compromised, which is next
to impossible if it doesn't run any services), while keeping all
the basic functionality of being connected to the Internet. This
has an additional advantage. Often access to database servers is
protected through a TCP wrapper, which allows only a certain set of
hosts to access the database. For each new client machine added to
the network, an entry into the appropriate /etc/hosts.* files must
be made. With masquerading, this entry isn't necessary, since the
new machine will be masqueraded and the IP number of the
masquerading host is already known to the database server.</p><p>If you cannot physically separate the administrative network,
you might want to consider using some form of encryption. Kerberos
is often used in these cases, but you could also use an ssh-PPP
tunnel (ssh is a key-pair encryption algorithm). With ssh you can
easily create a virtual private (encrypted) network between your
masquerading host(s) and your database server. That should take
care of any eavesdropping risks from students booting rogue Linux
machines on the network.</p><p>With complex networks, it is important to know who the threat
is. The threat typically comes from the inside and not the outside,
which is protected by the Internet Router/Firewall machine. Also,
don't forget to protect yourself against your modem pool&mdash;IP
spoofing can occur from there as well.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1688580.0x1781840"></a>Configuring the Firewall</h2></div></div><p>There are basically two ways of configuring your firewall.
The first and most secure setup is &ldquo;Deny everything unless we
explicitly allow it.&rdquo; The disadvantage is that you will have a lot
of users wondering why certain things don't work. You might
consider this approach in a setup where your firewall protects a
very small subnet containing only servers and no clients. A script
for setting up this type of firewall is shown in
<a href="2159l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2. &ldquo;Deny Everything..&rdquo;
Firewall</a>. This type of firewall requires quite a bit of
knowledge about how certain protocols work. Do not attempt it
unless you have proper documentation and plenty of time to devote
to it.</p><p>The second, and easier setup is &ldquo;Allow everything unless we
explicitly deny it.&rdquo; This one makes your network fairly open, but
controls a few dangerous or unwanted protocols. For example, some
ISPs use this feature to block all &ldquo;CU-SeeMe&rdquo; traffic, as this
type of traffic can congest their entire network. A script setting
up this type of firewall is shown in
<a href="2159l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3. &ldquo;Allow Everything...&rdquo;
Firewall</a>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1688580.0x1781a50"></a>How Do We Monitor What is Going On?</h2></div></div><p>As you might have noticed in the two previous examples, all
deny rules have the option <b  >-o</b> set to instruct
the Linux kernel to explicitly log all denied packets using the
syslog facility. If you deny packets without logging them, someday
you will be bug hunting for hours before you realize the problem
was a packet filter. Depending on how you have configured the
syslog daemon (/etc/syslog.conf), these messages will show up in
either the /var/log/messages file or the /var/log/syslog file. You
should regularly check these log files on your firewall machines.
Make sure there is enough disk space to log even an attack that
floods you with messages. If possible, use a separate partition for
your log files.</p><p>Here are a few log entries from our syslog to demonstrate
some common problems. These log entries come from our Livingston
router, as well as our Linux machine.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Jan  2 15:17:57 unreachable.xtdnet.nl 15 deny: UDP from 130.244.101.74.137
to 194.229.18.53.137
</pre><p>This is perhaps the most frequent hit our firewall rules get.
Port 137 is the NetBios name-service port used by Microsoft Windows
machines to look up names in the local network. However, poor
implementation and bad configuration often lead to Windows machines
making NetBios requests to another machine. These requests might
have been generated by a user's telnet, FTP or even WWW request.
You might want to enable your deny rule without the
<b  >-o</b> flag, so that your log file is not filled up
with these very common errors. One of our clients had his root
partition entirely filled with netbios logs, stopping his genuine
logging from operating and almost crashing the server.
<pre     class="programlisting">
Jan  2 17:12:34 unreachable.xtdnet.nl  2 deny: TCP from 10.0.3.1.61007 to
194.229.18.29.80 seq 1471CB0, ack 0x0, win 8192, SYN
</pre>


This message is caused by a badly configured host. The IP numbers
in the 10.*.*.* range are reserved for local area networks. We
found out this host was a misconfigured masquerading host on the
Internet, which used its IP number from the local masqueraded
network instead of its real Internet IP number. This
misconfiguration traveled through many other routers before being
caught by our firewall. Large backbone ISPs don't filter out bogus
packets, resulting in easy IP spoofing from almost anywhere on the
Internet to anywhere else. Don't trust your ISP to filter out
anything; do it yourself.
<pre     class="programlisting">
Jan 20 06:57:33 unreachable.xtdnet.nl 14 deny: UDP from xx.yy.zz.aa.904
to 194.229.18.27.1112
</pre>


Our firewall proved its value on this attack. Someone tried to ask
our RPC daemon (<b  >udp port 111</b>) which daemons we
are running. Even though an attacker can still find most RPC
services by doing a total port scan, it is still a good idea not to
give them the information so readily. There is almost never a need
to have RPC services exchanged with a server on the Internet. Port
scans are easily spotted because they leave a giant trace of
occurrences of all your filter rules in your log files.
<pre     class="programlisting">
Jan  3 22:16:55 unreachable.xtdnet.nl 44 deny: TCP from xx.yy.zz.aa.17231
to 194.229.18.27.23 seq 7A3731D0, ack 0x0, win 49152, SYN
</pre>


This is another true firewall hit. We banned this host after we
received a couple of the above attacks on our RPC server. Since the
postmaster of this particular site didn't respond, we blocked
access for the host on all ports.
<pre     class="programlisting">
Feb  4 09:10:17 polly.xtdnet.nl kernel: IP fw-in deny eth1 UDP 0.0.0.0:68
255.255.255.255:67 L=328 S=0x00 I=4 F=0x0000 T=60
</pre>


Port 68 is bootp (DHCP). Some machine was broadcasting and asking
for a bootp server. This could be a Win95 computer or even some
intelligent HUB which needs an IP number to support SNMP. (This one
had us puzzled for months.)
<pre     class="programlisting">

</pre>


This machine didn't define the masquerading host as router, so it
tried to be smart&mdash;but it still didn't find the right gateway.
<pre     class="programlisting">
Jan 28 12:23:50 masq.xtdnet.nl kernel: IP fw-in deny eth0 TCP 194.229.18.2:3128

</pre>


To understand what happened, we need to dig a little into the inner
workings of TCP/IP. All connections are identified by a unique
combination of source IP, source port, destination IP and
destination port. However, to find well-known services, such as
telnet, WWW or cache, it is a common practice to use specific
ports. To uniquely identify connections to such a well-known
service, a random but unique port is allocated on the local
machine. If this machine now makes a connection to a well-known
service on another machine, it is guaranteed to have a
distinguishable TCP/IP connection. Port numbers below 1024 are
normally not assigned as random ports, because they're often used
or reserved for the well-known services.
</p><p>Now, let us look back at the log entry. The computer
194.229.18.36 wanted to set up a connection to the machine
194.229.18.2 on port 3128 (the cache server). It first asked the
operating system for a unique random port and was given port 2049.
It then initiated the connection to the cache server (194.229.18.2
port 3128). The cache server responded by sending its answer back
in a packet to 194.229.18.36 port 2049. But 194.229.18.36 is also
using firewall rules, and one of its rules is to block all attempts
to connect to the NFS service, which, unlike many other well-known
services, is not located on a port below 1024, but on port 2049.
Thus, the cache server's response is filtered out. You can solve
this problem of distinguishing the connection based on whether or
not it originated from your site. You can determine the point of
origin by whether the SYN or ACK flag in the TCP header is set. The
correct way of filtering out connections to port 2049, while still
allowing connections to be initiated from it, is as follows:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/sbin/ipfwadm -I -i deny -S 0.0.0.0/0 \
 -D 0.0.0.0/0 2049 -P tcp -y -Weth0 -o
</pre><pre     class="programlisting">
Jan  2 11:22:58 unreachable.xtdnet.nl 38 deny: TCP from 193.78.240.90.8080
to 194.229.18.2.1642 seq F72DA7C6, ack 0xED8FDEA1, win 31744, SYN ACK
</pre><p>A similar situation happened here. Port 1642 was assigned by
some machine as the random unique port, but the firewall decided
that port 1642 was bad. Livingston Portmaster software uses this
port to communicate between a Unix host and their
routers/firewalls, so that is why we filter these ports for the
outside.
</p><p>In general, try to avoid blocking high ports, and if you do
block out a high port, block that port only for the machine that
needs the protection. For example, block port 1642 only for your
routers and terminal servers, but leave it open for Unix servers.
Then, if the router/firewall receives a packet destined for port
1642 on an internal machine, it will pass it to that internal
machine even if port 1642 on the router itself is blocked.</p><p>A minor drawback is that we are giving away a bit of
information to potential hackers. They can check all your IP
numbers to see which ones are routers, firewalls or Unix hosts that
talk to the routers or firewalls; however, they can usually find
that same information through other means as well. For example, the
<b  >traceroute</b> command yields a lot of information
about which machines are used for packet transfer and are therefore
either a router, a firewall or both. You can also use the
<b  >-y</b> option mentioned in the previous example. Not
all hardware routers/firewalls offer these options.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1688580.0x1a8cff8"></a>Random Notes</h2></div></div><p>Most attacks on your firewall are simple probing. This is
analogous to a person trying your door handle to see if the door is
locked. The above firewall rules should protect you against these
without much of a problem.</p><p>What if a person is trying to find out more than simply
whether your door is locked? What if someone appears to have a true
interest in <span   class="emphasis"><em>you</em></span>? The first sign of this will
be a sudden increase in the number of hits on your firewall from a
small set of hosts or networks. Your first step should be to
contact the system administrator of those systems. If you are
really feeling paranoid at this stage, don't e-mail postmaster and
don't trust the technical support phone number on their web site.
Look up the general number of the company in a paper phone book or
dial an operator to assist you. Once you get through to the
company, tell them what is going on and offer them as much
information as possible. If you can trust the administration of the
sites, this usually guarantees that the attacks will stop.</p><p>Only rarely does this approach fail&mdash;either because the
company's administrators are colluding in the attack, or because
the attack is coming from a large provider who gives its users
access to a Unix shell. For these providers, it is impossible to
trace the abuser just from the timestamp of your firewall logs
because dozens of people would have been logged on at the
time.</p><p>So far, this has happened to us only once. We suspected that
the administration itself was responsible for the probes and
hacking attempts to our sites. We decided to let the hacker
<span   class="emphasis"><em>through</em></span> our firewall temporarily, so we could
gather more information on what they were doing.</p><p>We used two tools to gather information. First, we replaced
the normal Internet super server (<b  >inetd</b>) with
<b  >xinetd</b>. This version of <b  >inetd</b>
has the option to log an incredible amount of valuable information.
Second, we needed to run a special version of our
<b  >nologin</b> program to make sure the connection
stayed up long enough for us to send out an
<b  >ident</b> probe.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/* nologin.c */
main() {
  printf("You have no login on this machine.\n");
  sleep(60);
}
</pre><p>We enabled the services to be probed in /etc/xinetd.conf. For
example to set up the remote login shell <b  >rsh</b>:
<pre     class="programlisting">
service shell
{
   socket_type     = stream
   protocol        = tcp
   wait            = no
   user            = nobody
   server          = /bin/nologin
}
</pre>


And we enabled <b  >ident</b> lookups and remote host
logging for all services:
<pre     class="programlisting">
defaults
{
   log_type            = FILE /var/log/xinetd.log
   log_on_success      = HOST USERID
   log_on_failure      = HOST RECORD USERID ATTEMPT
   instances           = 10
}
</pre>


And finally we were ready to open our firewall for these pseudo
services on our host.
</p><p>Be aware that the described level of logging is very
high&mdash;your log files will be extremely large. But don't be tempted
to disable the logging for real services. For example, we logged a
few apparently harmless <b  >finger</b> requests which
were followed by probes from another machine on several occasions.
The machines responsible for the probes were very uninformative.
But this hacker made the mistake of using his normal machine for a
<b  >finger</b> command first, to see if any system
administrator was logged on, before he started his probes from the
secure system. And his regular machine was running an
<b  >ident</b> daemon, so our logs recorded his user
name.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1688580.0x1a8d838"></a>Firewalls Are Needed</h2></div></div><p>As can be seen by the &ldquo;Ping of Death&rdquo; example, firewalls
can be a life saver. Furthermore, we have seen that it is fairly
easy to configure the firewall, once you have some knowledge about
how the TCP/IP protocol works.</p><p>When visiting one of our clients recently, I peeked at their
two firewalls briefly. Both firewalls had an uptime of 108 days.
They had been up ever since installation of Alan Cox's ping patched
Linux kernel version 2.0.23. One firewall, protecting the main
Internet server, logged four attempts to send oversized ping
packets. It also prevented access by some students trying to use
illegal IP numbers (whether by mistake or on purpose was not
known). It also logged various misconfigured machines sending out
bogus IP traffic. The firewall that protects their main Internet
server (which also handles a full Usenet news-feed) had routed
close to a terrabyte of IP traffic. Their firewalls have proven to
be a very stable and valuable addition to their network security,
where they have to be concerned about not trusting internal
machines as well as external machines and where total control of
the Ethernet cables is not guaranteed throughout the entire
complex.</p><p><a href="2159s1.html" target="_self">Glossary</a></p></div></div>
