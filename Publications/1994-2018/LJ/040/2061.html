bookstore, you have seen the mind-boggling number of Java-related
books available. Many bookstores have sections dedicated solely to
Java, just as they have sections for programming languages and the
Internet. What makes this even more incredible is that the first
Java book showed up just a little over a year ago.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>The Java Series</em></span> is a set of nine books
written by members of the Java team. This series is published by
Addison-Wesley.</p><p>Since <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Java Series</em></span> is from the
writers of the actual software, it is the official source of
information regarding the Java programming language, virtual
machine and API. If you want the definitive answer to a
Java-related question, these books are the place to look.</p><p>This review covers five of the books from <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Java
Series</em></span>. The first four are <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Java Virtual
Machine Specification</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Java Language
Specification</em></span> and <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Java Application
Programming Interface</em></span> (two volumes). These are the
technical references that describe the entire Java environment.
Also included is a review of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Concurrent Programming in
Java</em></span>, which isn't a definitive reference like the rest
but certainly deserves its place in the series.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Title: The Java Virtual Machine
Specification</p></li><li><p>Authors: Tim Lindholm and Frank Yellin</p></li><li><p>Price: $36.75</p></li><li><p>ISBN: 0-201-63452-X</p></li></ul></div><p>All too often, people either forget or don't know that Java
is more than just a programming language. Actually, the most
important part of Java may be the virtual machine. It provides the
binary portability that makes Java so important in network
environments, and where would Java be without the Internet? That is
why I chose to start with <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Java Virtual Machine
Specification</em></span>.</p><p>One way of looking at the JVM is to think of it as just
another 32-bit CPU. It has many of the same components, including
an instruction set, registers and the ability to do common
operations on a similar set of data types. In many ways,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>The Java Virtual Machine Specification</em></span> is like
a reference manual you would get from a major CPU manufacturer&mdash;it
contains an instruction reference and other reference
material.</p><p>However, just as the JVM isn't exactly like most CPUs,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>The Java Virtual Machine Specification</em></span> isn't
exactly like most CPU reference manuals. It is a well-written book
that is more than just instruction set references and explanations
of the data types. This book (excluding the instruction set
reference) can be read straight through and enjoyed. For example,
Chapter 7 provides a very interesting tutorial called &ldquo;Compiling
for the JVM&rdquo;. Not only would this be useful to compiler writers,
but it would give any Java programmer insight into what his code is
really doing. Actually, the book presents this information so well
that it might encourage people, who wouldn't otherwise do so, to
write useful bytecode utilities.</p><p>The book begins with a short and unexceptional introduction.
It consists of a one-page history of Java, a one-page introduction
to the virtual machine and a very brief chapter summary.</p><p>Chapter 2 is titled &ldquo;Java Concepts&rdquo;, and it summarizes the
features of the Java programming language. The next chapter details
the structure of the Java Virtual Machine. Data types, registers,
stacks and many similar concepts are defined. The class file format
and instruction set are introduced towards the end of Chapter
3.</p><p>In Chapter 4, the class file format is defined. Like most
file format descriptions, a pseudo-code data structure is given
which shows how the data are arranged in the file. Each field in
this structure is described in an easy-to-understand and thorough
manner.</p><p>Constant pool resolution is the topic of Chapter 5. The
constant pool is similar to the symbol table found in conventional
languages. In Java the constant pool allows the instruction set to
refer to objects with a pair of bytes instead of the full name. In
addition to describing the reason for the constant pool, the
chapter explains how it is used in the process of loading, linking
and initializing class files.</p><p>The instruction set for the Java Virtual Machine is found in
Chapter 6. A short introduction is followed by 180 pages of well-
organized bytecode descriptions.</p><p>Chapter 7 outlines the process of compiling source code to
the JVM. This is done with examples of Java source code and the
corresponding JVM bytecodes. The authors then describe how and why
the compiler generated the bytecodes it did. Many examples in the
chapter describe everything from compiling a simple
<b  >for</b> loop to throwing and handling
exceptions.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>The Java Virtual Machine Specification</em></span>
is a very useful book that is well worth reading. Although it is
fundamentally a reference, it is remarkably easy to read.
Therefore, I recommend it to anyone who wants to know more about
the low-level workings of Java.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Title: The Java Language Specification</p></li><li><p>Authors: James Gosling, Bill Joy and Guy
Steele</p></li><li><p>Price: $36.75</p></li><li><p>ISBN: 0-201-63451-1</p></li></ul></div><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>The Java Language Specification</em></span> defines
the Java programming language. For those of you who are trying to
learn the Java programming language, you should know that this book
is not a tutorial. It is a reference that includes every possible
detail of the Java programming language.</p><p>In addition to defining the structure of the language,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>The Java Language Specification</em></span> has numerous
code samples that help illustrate specific rules. These are very
helpful, especially since the descriptions often favor syntactic
precision over human understanding.</p><p>The introduction consists of a quick description of Java and
a chapter summary. It is followed by a brief chapter describing the
grammar the rest of the book uses to explain the Java
language.</p><p>The lexical structure of Java is described in Chapter 3. It
begins with some notes on how Java uses Unicode, then goes into the
low-level parsing of the source code files. This includes the
definition of things such as white space, identifiers, keywords and
so on. The chapter ends with a definition of the various types of
literals, separators and operators.</p><p>&ldquo;Types, Values and Variables&rdquo; (Chapter 4) defines the
various types that are available in Java. Primitive types are
discussed first, including the ranges and operations of the
integer, floating-point and boolean types, then reference types are
defined. Since references deal with objects, some of the more
primitive objects are outlined, including the class
<b  >Object</b> and class <b  >String</b>. The
chapter ends with a summary of the seven different types of
variables in Java.</p><p>&ldquo;Conversions and Promotions&rdquo; (Chapter 5) defines the ways
that the type of a variable can be changed. Conversions on both
primitive and reference types are defined, as is the unique string
conversion.</p><p>Chapter 6 defines the concept of a name in Java. Names are
used to refer to packages, classes, members of an object and
variables. The concepts of scope, inheritance and access control
are also defined to the extent that they are used in naming.</p><p>In Java, classes can be organized into groups based on their
functionality. These groups, called packages, are defined in
Chapter 7. Included in this chapter are conventions for the naming
and storing of packages.</p><p>Classes and interfaces are described in Chapters 8 and 9.
These chapters provide good descriptions of all aspects, from
keywords that modify classes and interfaces to the workings of
inheritance and overloading.</p><p>Chapter 10 describes how arrays work in Java. The chapter
begins with the assertion that arrays are objects, but of a
distinct type. The chapter describes how arrays are similar to and
different from other objects.</p><p>Exceptions are defined in Chapter 11. The chapter begins with
a basic description of how the language constructs interact with
the <b  >Throwable</b> objects. It moves on to the causes
of exceptions, and the end of the chapter describes all the
exceptions the programmer will face.</p><p>Chapter 12 defines in an interesting way how the language
interacts with the Java Virtual Machine. It begins with a
description of what the virtual machine does when it is starting
up. It moves on to a description of the loading and linking of
classes, and ends with a description of how the virtual machine
exits.</p><p>Probably the most interesting chapter of the book is Chapter
13. It describes in what ways old class files should remain
compatible with new class files. The authors give many examples of
code that should be binary compatible and how to make sure they
are.</p><p>Chapters 14 and 15 describe the more traditional aspects of
the Java language. The statements are defined, and then the way in
which they are executed is outlined.</p><p>In Java, a value must be assigned to a local variable before
it can be used. This is called &ldquo;definite assignment&rdquo; and is the
topic of Chapter 16. It is very slow reading and will most likely
be best used as a reference.</p><p>Threads and locks are introduced in Chapter 17, beginning
with a description of how things differ when more than one thread
of Java code is executing at a time. The chapter ends with some
examples of situations that make multi-threaded code difficult, and
the corresponding Java constructs that can solve the
problems.</p><p>Java takes the two comment styles present in C++ and adds a
third. This new comment style allows class interfaces, hierarchies
and programmer documentation to be turned into web pages. Chapter
18 gives a description and an example.</p><p>Chapter 19 lists the LALR(1) grammar&mdash;probably of tremendous
interest to compiler writers.</p><p>Finally, the book ends with an API reference that covers the
java.lang, java.util and java.io packages. These are the core
packages that must be present in all Java environments. They are
covered in a bit more detail here than they are in <span   class="emphasis"><em>The
Java API</em></span>.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>The Java Language Specification</em></span> is a
good language reference. However, I don't think most people need a
book this specific. I recommend it primarily to compiler writers or
anyone else who is building a language-based tool.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Title: The Java Application Programming Interface,
Volumes I &amp; II</p></li><li><p>Authors: James Gosling, Frank Yellin and The Java
Team</p></li><li><p>Price: $38.75 each</p></li><li><p>ISBN: 0-201-63453-8, 0-201-63453-7</p></li></ul></div><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>The Java API</em></span> is a reference book
describing the classes that are part of the Java Development Kit.
It is fairly simple and doesn't contain very detailed
descriptions.</p><p>The book is split into two volumes sold separately. Volume I
contains &ldquo;Class Hierarchy Diagrams&rdquo;, &ldquo;Package java.lang&rdquo;,
&ldquo;Package java.io&rdquo;, &ldquo;Package java.util&rdquo; and &ldquo;Package
java.net&rdquo;. Volume II contains &ldquo;Package java.awt&rdquo;, &ldquo;Package
java.awt.image&rdquo;, &ldquo;Package java.awt.peer&rdquo; and &ldquo;Package
java.applet&rdquo;.</p><p>I have a hard time recommending <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Java
API</em></span>. There are now several books that are better deals.
<span   class="emphasis"><em>The Class Libraries</em></span> is basically a superset of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>The Java API</em></span> with more information about the
way the classes work, and it includes numerous code samples. Or, if
you are looking to save some money, you might want to get
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Java in a Nutshell</em></span> by O'Reilly and Associates.
It has a very nice, albeit small, API reference and only costs $20.
It is my favorite Java book and is nice and soft from nearly a year
of constant use.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Title: Concurrent Programming in Java</p></li><li><p>Authors: Doug Lea</p></li><li><p>Price: $23.86</p></li><li><p>ISBN: 0-201-69581-2</p></li></ul></div><p>Although there are many Java books out there, I haven't found
many that use Java to teach an advanced programming concept.
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Concurrent Programming in Java</em></span> is one of the
few. I have always been aware of Java's concurrency mechanisms, but
this book taught me how they can be used for real work.</p><p>The introduction is much better than those of the other four
Java books reviewed here. First, the author lists some advantages
and limitations of concurrency. Then the purpose of the book is
given, followed by a typical chapter summary and a description of
Java's concurrency mechanisms.</p><p>Chapter 2 defines the concept of safety with regard to
concurrent programming; it outlines the methods by which multiple
threads can execute on the same data so that &ldquo;nothing bad ever
happens&rdquo;. These methods include using immutable objects,
synchronization and containment.</p><p>Liveness could be considered the opposite of safety. Chapter
3 describes liveness problems and methods that can be used to solve
them.</p><p>Chapter 4 covers the concept of state-dependent action. The
author describes many possible actions that can be taken when a set
of states is reached.</p><p>Concurrency control is covered in Chapter 5. Three approaches
to concurrency control are covered. Examples are shown using Java,
but the concepts are useful in any language.</p><p>Chapter 6 is titled &ldquo;Services in Threads&rdquo;. It explains how
common tasks can be separated into threads. At this point the book
becomes really interesting, because the reader can see how the
concurrency concepts can work in real programs.</p><p>Chapter 7 describes how the flow policies implemented by a
program affect safety and liveness issues. Finally, methods of
coordinating more independent objects are outlined in Chapter
8.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Concurrent Programming in Java</em></span> is a very
good book. It is nice to see a book go into the details of a
subject that hasn't already been beaten to death (the Applet class,
for example).</p><p>If you have a lot of experience doing multi-threaded
programming, you may find <span   class="emphasis"><em>Concurrent Programming in
Java</em></span> a bit too simple and vague. Probably all you need
is a description of Java's concurrency mechanisms. However, if you
have little or no experience making concurrent programs, this book
has a lot to teach you.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21ce580.0x26c1038"></a>Conclusions</h2></div></div><p>The series as a whole works well. As the marketing material
says, it represents the definitive source of Java information. I
haven't found any books outside this series that add much in terms
of raw information.</p><p>Although these books are well-produced and provide valuable
information, I can't recommend that everyone go buy them. If you
are a student with a limited budget, as I am, you might want to
look into something like <span   class="emphasis"><em>Java in a Nutshell</em></span>
(O'Reilly and Associates). It provides a tutorial for C programmers
who are trying to learn Java and also has an good API reference.
Other places to find cheap information on Java include the SSC API
reference cards and JavaSoft's web page.</p><p>On the other hand, if the price of a $30-$40 reference book
doesn't make a dent in your wallet and you need to have the
official source of Java information, all five of these books are
very good deals.</p><p>One final consideration&mdash;a new version of the Java
Development Kit has just been released. It has introduced numerous
changes and additions to the class library. Therefore, I suggest
waiting to buy an API reference until it includes JDK 1.1
information.</p></div></div>
