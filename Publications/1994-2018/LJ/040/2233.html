    SATAN checks out your network for possible openings that hackers can
    use to invade your system.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xae1580.0xbd9500"></a></h2></div></div><p>The creators of SATAN (System
Administrator's Tool for Analyzing Networks) feel that the reason
most systems are vulnerable to attack is that most System
Administrators don't think like system crackers. Actually, thinking
this way may require you to look at simple, seemingly harmless
network services in a new light.
</p><p>To the system cracker, basic network services are a doorway
into a computer system. So, before you go into the office one
morning and see a bunch of unusual <b  >utmp</b> entries,
it is beneficial to check just how accessible those doorways are. A
great starting point for checking the doors is to run a SATAN scan
on your network.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xae1580.0xbd96b8"></a>Requirements</h2></div></div><p>SATAN can be run on Linux with a few modifications.
Requirements for running SATAN are:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>A machine that can handle it&mdash;which means a box
with a relatively fast processor (e.g., Alpha, 486) and at least
32MB of RAM</p></li><li><p>A recent distribution of the SATAN source code
(satan-1.1.1)</p></li><li><p>Perl 5 or greater</p></li><li><p>A set of BSD-4.4 compatible include files,
available from
ftp://ftp.wooddimensions.com/webserv/security/linux/</p></li><li><p>A patch to fix the mistaken assumptions about how
<b  >select()</b> works in tcp_scan.c
(tcp_scan.c.diff)</p></li><li><p>A WWW browser (A graphical browser like Netscape or
Mosaic is preferable, but you can also use a text browser like
Lynx.)</p></li><li><p>A C compiler like <b  >gcc</b></p></li></ol></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xae1580.0xbd9d98"></a>Building SATAN</h2></div></div><p>When you have all of these elements, you can begin to build
SATAN. First you want to untar the archive. Just issue the
command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
zcat satan-1.1.1.tar.Z | tar xvf -
</pre><p>This command creates a subdirectory called satan-1.1.1. Next,
apply the patch to tcp_scan.c. I tend to use Emacs for patching, as
it makes everything a little more visual. Load the patch into one
buffer, tcp_scan.c into another, and choose
<b  >Patch</b>. Of course, using the patch command works
fine too. Now, untar the BSD-4.4 compatible include files. The
easiest way to do this is to <b  >gunzip</b> the archive
and move it into the root of the satan-1.1.1 directory, and then
type:
<pre     class="programlisting">
tar xvf BSD-4.4.includes.tar
</pre>


The archive will expand into the include/netinet/ directory.
</p><p>Having done this, you are ready to compile SATAN. The program
comes with a script, called <b  >reconfig</b>, which will
configure it on your system. Any Linux user who has used SATAN
before knows that bash has trouble with the syntax of this script.
The easiest way around this is to type:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
perl reconfig
</pre><p>at the command prompt, rather than:
<pre     class="programlisting">
./reconfig
</pre>


The <b  >reconfig</b> script will detect your web browser
and Perl and compile the SATAN binaries. If it detects the wrong
web browser, edit the script config/paths.pl and change the line:
<pre     class="programlisting">
$MOSAIC="program name"
</pre>


You are now ready to run SATAN. Type <b  >./satan</b> at
the command prompt, and SATAN will fire up your web browser.
</p><p>If Netscape is your browser of choice, make sure you have a
mime type defined for application/x-perl, and no suffix is defined
for this type. Defining the suffix as .pl will result in errors
every time you try to execute a script.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xae1580.0xbda370"></a>Stay Away from Precompiled Binaries</h2></div></div><p>Even if all of the above steps sound like a major pain, you
should still get the sources and build SATAN yourself. I would
strongly urge you not to request, post or use precompiled binaries
of SATAN. SATAN must be run as root, and a bad or malicious build
can do volumes of damage. There have already been several reports
of Trojans found in builds for Linux. Building SATAN for Linux
might take a few extra steps, but it is definitely worth the
effort.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xae1580.0xbda478"></a>After the Scan</h2></div></div><p>SATAN will dutifully scan your network and report back all
the potential weaknesses that it finds&mdash;that is its job. It will
even tell you how those weaknesses might be exploitable. It will
not fix any problems or keep unwanted guests out&mdash;that is your job.
No program can be a substitute for an astute Security
Administrator.</p><p>To run a tight ship you must keep the crew in line, which
means educating your users on the importance of a good password.
(It's up to you whether you send out security memos, post in the
MOTD or actually periodically attempt to crack /etc/passwd and lock
out accounts you were able to crack.) Along with password
education, educate your users on the dangers of keeping large
.rhosts files in their home directories. The more unknown systems
trusted, the greater the risk to your own system.</p><p>Finally, take a look at your system in the same way an
educated cracker might. Subscribe to <span   class="emphasis"><em>2600</em></span> and
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Phrack</em></span>, if your hacking skills are not up to
snuff. Take a look at the network services you are running and
think of possible ways you could exploit them. Read the latest CERT
(http://www.cert.org/). advisories for all systems (as many common
programs come from the same roots, they sometimes share the same
weaknesses) and, using this information, periodically try to break
into your own system. If you are new to system security or if you
are unsure how to go about exploiting network services, try all the
cookbook approaches used in such texts as <span   class="emphasis"><em>The System
Administrator's Guide to Cracking</em></span> (included with the
SATAN distribution). There are also a lot of IRC channels and web
sites where hacking and cracking are discussed. Visit these sites
and listen in or ask questions. Your users are depending on you to
have the system up and running&mdash;with a little work, you won't
disappoint them.</p></div></div>
