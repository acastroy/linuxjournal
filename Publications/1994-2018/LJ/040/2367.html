    Readers sound off.

descriptions were huge and targeted complex tasks. That's why I
always delayed configuring my system for a simple PPP
connection.</p><p>That was true until I read the article &ldquo;A 10-Minute Guide
for Using PPP&rdquo; in the April issue of <i  >LJ</i>. I
followed the instructions (just changed the init-string for my
modem) and...it worked at once. Wow! Thanks very much to Terry
Dawson for his excellent article and to <i  >LJ</i> for
publishing it. &mdash;Andreas Zisowsky,
Berlin zisowsky@fokus.gmd.de</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2170580.0x22682f0"></a>Exit Xenix, Linux is here.</h2></div></div><p>In the March 1997 issue of <i  >LJ</i>, E.
Leibovitch wrote an article entitled &ldquo;The Death of Xenix&rdquo; about
the opportunities offered by the near death of Xenix. Undoubtedly,
<i  >LJ</i> is in touch with its readers, or at least
one of them.</p><p>I would like to tell you about my experience. A few years
ago, the library of a high school (Lycee Victor Hugo, Colomiers,
France) was computerized by means of an AT386PC with Xenix as OS
and dedicated software. This system is now collapsing.</p><p>As a technical engineer working for the CRDP (Centre Regional
de Documentation Pedagogique&mdash;a government organization acting in
the area of educational services), I proposed that the existing
system be replaced with an actual PC box with Linux as OS and the
existing Wyse terminals should be reused. Our goal was to expand by
installing an Intranet service to distribute the library databases
into all the lycee (schools) using the existing Ethernet-based
pedagogic network.</p><p>I encountered a few difficulties caused by:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>lack of personal knowledge of the necessary
setup,</p></li><li><p>inability to find not-too-new hardware (yesterday's
software doesn't always work on today's hardware),</p></li><li><p>problems compiling the dedicated software: it
worked first under IBCS, but I thought it would be better to get a
genuine version. I am now in the test assembly stage.</p></li></ol></div><p>Many thanks to <i  >LJ</i> and its team for
helping to sustain the Linux movement. &mdash;Jean Francois
Bardou France devpoly@crdp231.crdp-toulouse.fr</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2170580.0x22688c8"></a>PPP Control for Mortals</h2></div></div><p>I tried your C program as shown in <i  >LJ</i> in
the article &ldquo;Safely Running Programs as root&rdquo; by Phil Hughes in
the May 1997 issue. It compiled and worked like a champ. Keep it
up; that sort of program is very helpful to strugglers like myself.
Looks to me as though I could simply add it to the root menu in
FVWM to bring it up and take it down. I'll let you know if it
works. Thanks. &mdash;Jim Smith jim@oz.net</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2170580.0x2268a28"></a>Bristol Zoo Location</h2></div></div><p>On page 14 of May's <i  >LJ</i> (<span   class="emphasis"><em>From
the Editor</em></span>), you stated that Bristol Zoo is in Swansea.
In fact, Bristol Zoo is in Bristol (75 miles from Swansea).</p><p>The confusion may have arisen because Alan Cox, at least at
one point, had a Swansea University e-mail address and may still
live in Swansea. I've never met Alan, so this is mere
speculation. &mdash;Martin Radford M.P. Radford@exeter.ac.uk</p><p>Yes, the press release from Alan Cox originated from Swansea,
and I assumed quite wrongly that the zoo was located there.
Sorry &mdash;Ed.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2170580.0x2268c90"></a>Linux Appliance</h2></div></div><p>I read your article &ldquo;Linux&mdash;The Internet Appliance&rdquo; in the
April issue of <i  >Linux Journal</i>. It is a subject
I have also thought about and agree with your main points.</p><p>I think you missed one key point: the users you target
probably don't want a floppy or a CD-ROM. A disposable small IDE
hard disk would serve your machine much better. What do I mean by
disposable? One that can be changed out without disrupting their
service. One that is automatically backed up by the ISP. One that
serves the following needs:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>boot device</p></li><li><p>swap space</p></li><li><p>web-page cache</p></li><li><p>off-line letter writing</p></li><li><p>configuration information</p></li></ul></div><p>In short, performance. Changing out the hard disk (to one
that has been freshly dd(1)'d from a master, followed by a
10-second transfer of the account's setup from the ISP database)
will be almost transparent to the customer, except that all the
caches are empty, and therefore, they will slog along for a while
like everybody else at home. When the caches fill up (200MB is
cheap), all the usual pages and images will work as we rich,
ethernetted folk expect.</p><p>Besides, by dropping the CD-ROM and floppy, and going to a
smaller case and power supply, I think the cost total (including
$200 monitor) is closer to $600 today than the $800 you
suggest.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>80 Fast 486 motherboard w/CPU</p></li><li><p>50 8M RAM (we have swap, remember?)</p></li><li><p>50 1M Cirrus video card (intended 800x600 16-bit
mode)</p></li><li><p>120 540M IDE drive (buy out a warehouse of
discontinued models)</p></li><li><p>60 28.8 modem</p></li><li><p>40 Sound card &ldquo;Hi, my name is Leenus Torrrvalds
and I pronounce Leeenux as Leeenux&rdquo;</p></li><li><p>50 Case, Power supply, Keyboard, Mouse, lousy
speakers</p></li><li><p>200 14 inch 800x600ni monitor</p></li><li><p>50 Assembly and testing</p></li><li><p>600 Total</p></li></ul></div><p>Perilously close to the $500 target, right? In volume, you
could probably get there now by contracting a custom motherboard,
with embedded video, modem, sound, and power supply. It would then
no longer be a PC-compatible (no ISA slots), but anyone who wanted
that stuff could trade in for a &ldquo;real&rdquo; PC. The assumption of your
article, which I support, is that there will be a large volume of
people who don't want to fuss with it&mdash;just plug it in and use
it. &mdash;Larry Doolittle ldoolitt@jlab.org</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2170580.0x2269a50"></a>Bliss Misinformation</h2></div></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>McAfee didn't find it [i.e., the Bliss virus,
mentioned in <span   class="emphasis"><em>From the Editor</em></span>, May
1997&mdash;Ed.]&mdash;they were told about it. The author announced the fact
that his Trojan had &ldquo;accidentally&rdquo; got out. Was it really an
accident? Who knows?</p></li><li><p>It didn't &ldquo;spread&rdquo; to Linux systems. The released
version of the Trojan was targeted specifically at Linux, although
the author confirms OpenBSD, NT and other compile builds [with the
Trojan] are trivial.</p></li></ol></div><p>Bliss is a very simple Trojan. It sits on the front of files,
copies itself into other stuff when run and spreads in that way. As
such, not doing things as root will help a lot. Basic common sense
like using PGP-signed packages and not installing random binaries
as root also helps. &mdash;Alan Cox alan@cymru.net</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2170580.0x2661fb8"></a>Script Listings</h2></div></div><p>I look forward to each issue of <i  >Linux Journal</i> and usually read it from cover to cover the day
it arrives in my mailbox. Your article on page 10 of the May issue,
&ldquo;Safely Running Programs as Root&rdquo;, was very helpful. Before, my
method of logging in to the Internet was to log in to my computer
as <b  >root</b>, start <b  >ppp-go</b>, run
<b  >ifconfig</b> and edit /etc/hosts, then switch to
another virtual terminal, log in with my <b  >davidm</b>
user name and fire up the X-server and Netscape.</p><p>Whenever I wanted to disconnect from my access provider, I
would have to switch to <b  >su</b> and run
<b  >ppp-off</b>. Now, things are much simpler. I grabbed
your listing from the FTP site and in five minutes had your ppp.c
program up and running. I am able to open and close my access
connection at will without having to switch to root. Thanks for the
story and for putting the code listings on your FTP server.</p><p>I thoroughly enjoy using Linux and reading <i  >Linux Journal</i>. If you get a chance, check out my column on
Linux at the following URL:
http://www.charleston.net/entertain/click3.html. &mdash;David W.
MacDougall, South Carolina davidm@Charleston.Net</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2170580.0x2662430"></a>Linux in Schools</h2></div></div><p>In my free time, I read a whole slew of computer magazines on
subjects ranging from Windows NT to LANs. One thing that struck me
the other day was how much fun it was to read the <i  >Linux Journal</i>. It seems that every columnist writes with such
enthusiasm for the subject. This is a refreshing change from the
other mainstream magazines, which seem to complain about
<span   class="emphasis"><em>everything</em></span>. Your authors enjoy writing about
how far Linux can be pushed and how it can be reshaped into
something new.</p><p>Granted, Linux is not a high-dollar commercial OS like the
others, but I believe that is to its advantage. You have to be
amazed with the way it was, and is, being developed. It shows how a
large diversity of people can come together for a common cause (one
that didn't include money) to create an extremely fun and useful
product.</p><p>I have specified Linux as the OS for one of the servers
(Pentium Pro 200 MHz, 128MB RAM, 4GB HD) in the public school
system I work for. I look forward to using it both at home and
work. I'd like to hear from other EdTech folks who use Linux in a
school environment. &mdash;Rob Bellville, Millbury,
MA rob@millbury.k12.ma.us</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2170580.0x2662698"></a>Linux&mdash;Not for Newbees?</h2></div></div><p>I am still a Newbee after 18 months of working with Linux off
and on. I feel I must comment on <span   class="emphasis"><em>Stop the
Presses</em></span> by Phil Hughes in your April issue:
&ldquo;Usenix/Uselinux in Anaheim&rdquo; on page 8. In that report it was
stated that Linus Torvalds hinted at &ldquo;world domination&rdquo; with
Linux.</p><p>After my venture into the Linux OS, it seems to me that there
is still a long way to go. It appears that Linux has been authored
by a large number of academics who each make a mark on the system.
I have found a large number of help files to be out of sync with
the code they are trying to explain. I have just started working
with <b  >pppd</b> after signing up with an ISP provider
and find the various configurations expressed in the files
confusing. It is true I am not a genius, but if one wants to have a
system appeal to the &ldquo;regular joes&rdquo; out in the real world,
setting the system up will have to be made easier.</p><p>I am certain I will eventually sort out my problem. It will
take a lot of work and learning on my part, which I don't mind&mdash;I
enjoy sorting out a difficulty and getting it solved. I am going to
stick it out until I can connect with my Linux box and get some
work done out on the Internet. To that end, I have Linux on
separate hard drives on two machines so that I have a backup in
case I corrupt one.</p><p>Anyhow, keep up the great work in <i  >LJ</i>, as
I do find it very helpful to keep abreast of what is going on out
there. &mdash;Kurt Savegnago ksaves@prairienet.org</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2170580.0x26629b0"></a>Article Choices</h2></div></div><p>I used to like <i  >Linux Journal</i> because of
the low-level, programmer-oriented topics in it. Unfortunately, the
past few issues have been on the boring parts of Linux, such as
platforms and networking. The majority of Linux users are not into
the many platforms or top-of-the-line systems, but into the hacking
of the kernel and the fun of how it works. I am more than willing
to have some articles included on the higher levels of technology,
but I would also like to see many articles on the hacking of the
kernel and nifty applications for Linux.</p><p>Thank you for putting out such a good magazine. I would hate
to see it turn into just another <span   class="emphasis"><em>PC Magazine</em></span>
type of magazine.  &mdash;Patrick Temple patemple@erols.com</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Platforms and networking certainly seem to be
popular subjects, judging from the response we get to articles
about them. Although we sometimes miss, we do always try to have
a</em></span> Kernel Korner for the kernel hackers as well as
articles on new applications. We do our best to present a balance
of topics &mdash;Ed.</p></div></div>
