    Make web site design changes easier by using templates&mdash;HTML
    pages with embedded Perl code.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f7c580.0x20743a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>If you are running a small web site, then
you are probably responsible for everything&mdash;server administration,
the site's content and the CGI programs that produce variable and
dynamic content.
</p><p>If your site is of any significant size, the work is probably
divided among a number of people. Indeed, most large sites divide
their staffs between the people who are responsible for the site's
content and design, and those who are responsible for the
infrastructure and technical side of the site.</p><p>Such a division undoubtedly makes it easier to administer a
site. After all, it is much easier to find someone to write content
or to write CGI programs than to do both. In addition, splitting
the work according to function allows everyone to do what he does
best.</p><p>At the same time, such a division makes it difficult for
sites to maintain a uniform presentation style. CGI programs
produce HTML that must match the style of the rest of the site.
This might mean inserting a certain header at the top of each page,
using a particular background color or inserting a graphic on the
side of each page.</p><p>In other words, there are two separate sources for HTML
content on a web site. The pages of HTML created by the designers,
and the HTML produced by the CGI programs. If a site does not
change its style often (or at all), the fact that the HTML comes
from two sources does not matter. The designers establish a style
for the site, which is then adopted by both designers and
programmers for their work.</p><p>However, many sites have taken to redesigning every few
months, partly due to continually improved technology that allows
designers to create more interesting, exciting experiences on their
sites. Every time a site's design changes, all of the existing
content must be rewritten to fit the new design. Sites that have
split their content between programmer-generated HTML and
CGI-generated HTML will find themselves having to convert two types
of files with two separate staffs.</p><p>For example, let's assume that a site has standardized
white-on-blue text. Each time the designers create a new page, they
make sure to include a <b  >&lt;body&gt;</b> tag of the
form:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;body bgcolor="blue" fgcolor="white"&gt;
</pre><p>In order for the site to have a uniform look, all of the CGI
programs on this site must include a similar
<b  >&lt;body&gt;</b> tag at the top of their output.
Here is a basic &ldquo;hello, world&rdquo; page that demonstrates how to
accomplish this:
<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/usr/bin/perl -w
use strict;
use diagnostics;
use CGI; # Available from http://www.perl.com/CPAN
# Create an instance of CGI
my $query = new CGI;
# Send an appropriate MIME header
print $query-&gt;header("text/html");
# Begin the HTML, with our colors indicated
print $query-&gt;start_html(
        -title =&gt; "Hello, world!",
         -bgcolor =&gt; "blue",
         -fgcolor =&gt; "white");
# Send our message
print "&lt;P&gt;Hello, world!&lt;/P&gt;\n";
# End the HTML
print $query-&gt;end_html;
</pre>


If this program were run as a CGI program from within a web server,
it would produce a short page of HTML on our screens, with a the
text appearing in white text on a blue background. (And yes, we
should use hex codes for consistent colors across platforms, but
this is just meant to be an easy example.)
</p><p>After creating an instance of CGI (an object module freely
available from CPAN at http://www.perl.com/CPAN), the program sends
a MIME header indicating that it will be sending HTML-formatted
text to the user's browser. Following that MIME header, it sends a
<b  >&lt;body&gt;</b> tag, hidden somewhat by the
<b  >start_html</b> method that takes care of such tag
production for us.</p><p>Finally, we send our short message, marked up in HTML, and
invoke the end_html method, which sends a
<b  >&lt;/body&gt;</b> tag to end the body of the HTML
text and an <b  >&lt;/html&gt;</b> tag to indicate the
end of the HTML page.</p><p>What happens when the designers decide that white-on-blue
text is passe, and that they would rather have a more modern look
(along the lines of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Wired</em></span> magazine) with
orange text on a green background? It would not be very difficult
for the designers to perform a global &ldquo;search and replace&rdquo; on the
<b  >&lt;body&gt;</b> tags appearing within the HTML
files on the site. To modify each of the CGI programs on the server
is much trickier.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f7c580.0x2074b88"></a>A Simple Solution</h2></div></div><p>One solution is to put all of our design-related variables in
a library module that we can import into our programs. Here is an
example of such a module called
<b  >SiteDesign</b>:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#!/usr/bin/perl -w
package SiteDesign;
$background_text = "white";
$foreground_text = "blue";
1;
</pre><p>The above module is named by the <b  >package</b>
statement. Following that statement, variables and functions are
assumed to begin with the string <b  >SiteDesign::</b>.
To avoid problems with the package names when variables are
imported into a program, we have turned off the normally helpful
construct <b  >use strict</b>.
</p><p>Assume that the above code is placed in a file named
<b  >SiteDesign.pm</b>, and the file is placed in a
directory named by the special Perl variable
<b  >@INC</b> (the list of directories in which Perl
modules are located). Our programs should now be able to include
this library with the statement:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
use SiteDesign;
</pre><p>In other words, we could rewrite our &ldquo;Hello, world&rdquo; program
as:
<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/usr/bin/perl -w
use strict;
use diagnostics;
use CGI; # Available from http://www.perl.com/CPAN
use SiteDesign;
# Create an instance of CGI
my $query = new CGI;
# Send an appropriate MIME header
print $query-&gt;header("text/html");
# Begin the HTML, with our colors indicated
print $query-&gt;start_html(
        -title =&gt; "Hello, world!",
        -bgcolor =&gt; $SiteDesign::background_text,
        -fgcolor =&gt; $SiteDesign::foreground_text);
# Send our message
print "&lt;P&gt;Hello, world!&lt;/P&gt;\n";
# End the HTML
print $query-&gt;end_html;
</pre>


This code is certainly an improvement over the first version of our
program, in that the HTML produced by our programs can be changed
without having to modify the programs. Existing CGI programs do
have to be changed so that they make use of SiteDesign.pm&mdash;but you
only have to change your existing code once, rather than each time
the site's design changes.
</p><p>This approach is useful in many ways, but it does not solve
all of the problems. While we have reduced the amount of work that
a site's programmers need to perform each time the designers change
their minds, we have not eliminated it entirely. The designers
still have to come to the technical staff each time they wish to
make such changes.</p><p>Furthermore, there is a practical limit to the number of ways
in which we can affect our programs' output by setting variables.
We could add a variable indicating which image, if any, should be
displayed at the top of each page, another variable indicating
whether an image should be displayed at the bottom of the page,
another variable indicating the font size, yet another for whether
the first paragraph should be centered, and so forth, ad infinitum.
Sure, it would still be easier to change these variables than to
change the output of each CGI program, but this solution does not
scale well to a large number of variables. Would you want to be the
programmer asked to modify 30 configuration variables each time the
site's design was changed?</p><p>One possible solution to this problem is to put the variables
in a configuration file, similar to the quiz file that we have
discussed over the last few months. Such a file, particularly if it
were masked by an interface consisting of CGI programs and HTML
forms, would allow designers to modify the site's design without
having to bother the programmers. However, designers would still
have to deal with the large number of configuration variables, as
well as understand what they mean. And programmers would still have
to write code taking all sorts of styling possibilities into
account.</p><p>In other words, the use of variables to indicate styling is
better than nothing at all but is far from a perfect solution. What
we would like is a way of creating pages of HTML that could be
modified by designers, and also gives the possibility of executing
code within those pages of HTML.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f7c580.0x2075210"></a>Templates</h2></div></div><p>Luckily, we can create such hybrid Perl/HTML pages using the
<b  >Text::Template</b> Perl module, written by
Mark-Jason Dominus. This module, available from CPAN at
http://www.perl.com/CPAN/, allows us to take such hybrid files,
evaluate the Perl parts, leave the pure HTML alone and send the
results to the user's web browser. While the
<b  >template</b> module is identified as beta software
and is not guaranteed to be stable, I have been using it for some
time and have not encountered any problems. (I wish that I could
say that about some of the commercial software that I use.)
Although The <b  >template</b> module is not designed to
work exclusively with HTML pages, it is in this area that I have
found it to be highly useful.</p><p>Templates are pages of HTML that contain zero or more pieces
of Perl code. (Thus, a plain HTML file is also a template, although
such files don't do anything special.) The Perl code is contained
inside the curly braces that Perl uses to identify blocks within
programs. For example, here is one template that displays the time
of day as recorded on the server:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;HTML&gt;
&lt;Head&gt;
&lt;Title&gt;Welcome to our site&lt;/Title&gt;
&lt;/Head&gt;
&lt;Body&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Welcome to our site!The time is now
{localtime;}
&lt;/&gt;P
&lt;/Body&gt;
&lt;/HTML&gt;
</pre><p>At first glance, the above template appears to be HTML and
nothing more. If you look within the curly braces ({ }), you will
see Perl code hiding there. In this particular case, we have used
the Perl function &ldquo;localtime&rdquo;, which prints out the time and date
using the standard Unix format.
</p><p>Because the above file looks and acts like HTML&mdash;it
<span   class="bold"><b>is</b></span> HTML, after all, except for the
Perl code&mdash;we can give it to our designers, who can change the
layout in any way they might like. If they wish to insert an image
before/after the time or if they wish to center the time of day,
they can do so by using the familiar HTML tags. The site's
programmers merely have to stress the importance of not modifying
the text contained within the curly braces, which should be
off-limits to them. By the same token, the site's programmers
should only modify the code contained within the curly braces,
since that is the portion for which they are responsible.</p><p>By using templates, we get the best of both worlds. Pages can
contain programs, and thus, can modify their output depending on
circumstances, while styling is still determined by the HTML
surrounding the blocks of code.</p><p>Writing templates is admittedly something that takes a bit of
time to grasp; however, the principles of writing templates are
easy to understand. As mentioned above, anything within curly
braces is considered to be Perl code and is replaced by the results
of its evaluation. Thus, the expression:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
{ 2 + 2; }
</pre><p>returns 4, and the expression:
<pre     class="programlisting">
{
        $browser = $ENV{"HTTP_USER_AGENT"};
        $outputstring = "&lt;P&gt;You are using \"$browser\"
as your browser.&lt;/P&gt;\n";
}
</pre>


returns a string telling the user which browser he is using,
bracketed by HTML &ldquo;paragraph&rdquo; tags.
</p><p>It is also possible to make calculations in one block of Perl
and to use the results of those calculations in a later block.
Thus, we can create the following:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;HTML&gt;
&lt;Head&gt;
&lt;Title&gt;Welcome to our site&lt;/Title&gt;
&lt;/Head&gt;
{
$time = localtime;
$browser = $ENV{"HTTP_USER_AGENT"};
}
&lt;Body&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Welcome to our site! The time is now
{ $time; }
&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;You are using {$browser;} to view our site.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;/Body&gt;
&lt;/HTML&gt;
</pre><p>In this code, we use the first block of Perl to assign
variables needed in the rest of the template. It might seem a bit
contrived but can be of great help when creating large, complicated
templates to set up a number of variables in the first block and
then to refer to them in subsequent blocks.
</p><p>If we are not careful when writing blocks of code, we can
accidentally insert some extraneous characters into our resulting
page of HTML. In the above example, the first block of code assigns
values to variables. The code block itself returns the value of
<b  >$browser</b>, since that was the last variable
assignment. In other words, our users see the name of their browser
twice&mdash;once where the first block sits and the second, where we
might expect to see it, in the third Perl block.</p><p>In order to avoid such problems, I generally use a variable
named <b  >$outputstring</b>, which is used solely for
the purpose of sending output to the resulting page of HTML. At the
beginning of each block, I assign <b  >$outputstring</b>
the empty string (<b  >""</b>), ensuring that it is not
tainted by values from previous blocks. The last line of each block
is then set to <b  >$outputstring;</b>, which evaluates
to the value of <b  >$outputstring</b> and is sent to the
user's browser. In between these two uses of
<b  >$outputstring</b> I can perform any calculations
that I want&mdash;and anything that I want to send to the user is simply
concatenated onto the current value of
<b  >$outputstring</b>.</p><p>Since CGI variables are actually environment variables and
child processes inherit environment variables from their parents,
we can also access CGI variables from within our templates. We have
already seen this in the above examples, when we retrieve
<b  >$ENV{"HTTP_USER_AGENT"}</b>, which should return the
identifying string that web browsers send to web servers along with
their document requests.</p><p>Because the code inside templates is full-blown Perl, we can
use all of the techniques and code that we ordinarily use,
including the use of library modules for databases, centralized
libraries of code, and just about anything else available.</p><p>Of course, you need to be sure that your code is debugged
before releasing it on an unsuspecting public. It is quite
embarrassing to create a template and put it out in a public area
of your web site, only to discover a bug that causes the entire
template to crash. Actually, the template won't crash; the
<b  >template</b> module is smart enough to catch
problems and point them out on the resulting page of HTML.
Debugging templates can be tricky, so be sure to allocate
additional testing and debugging time whenever you use templates
rather than straight CGI programs.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f7c580.0x206c650"></a>The Template Wrapper</h2></div></div><p>So, how do we turn a hybrid Perl/HTML template into plain
HTML to be sent to the user's browser? If users were shown these
templates without some sort of translation, they would appear as
HTML files with the Perl reproduced verbatim on the user's screen.
This display is obviously not desirable.</p><p>The key is to have a CGI program, called wrapper.pl, to take
the name of a template in its query string (i.e., the argument that
a CGI program receives following the question mark in the URL).
Once it has received the template name, wrapper.pl creates an
instance of <b  >Text::Template</b> and instructs that
module to perform the magic necessary to turn our template into a
page of HTML.We can then send the resulting HTML to our user's
browser. As far as the user is concerned, the page was and is HTML;
he does not know that we have used a template to create our
output.</p><p>Here is a simple version of wrapper.pl:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#!/usr/bin/perl -
use strict;
use diagnostics;
use CGI;
use Text::Template;
# Create an instance of CGI
my $query = new CGI;
# Send an appropriate MIME header
print $query-header("text/html");
# Get the name of the template
my $file = "/home/httpd/html/templates/" . $query-param("keywords");
# Create an instance of template
my $template = new Text::Template(-type =&gt; FILE,
        -source =&gt; $file);
# Perform the evaluation, and send the results
# to the user's browser
print $template-fill_in;
</pre><p>This program may appear quite simple, but we have hidden a
great deal of depth within our calls to
<b  >Text::Template</b>&mdash;first when we open the file and
when we ask the <b  >Template</b> object to evaluate each
of the small Perl programs inside the indicated template, it does
so. Finally, we take the results of that evaluation and send them
to the user's browser with the <b  >print</b> statement.
</p><p>Assuming the directory in which templates are stored not only
makes the resulting URLs shorter but also makes your site somewhat
more secure, since outsiders will not know your file system. It is
also a good idea to remove any references to the parent directory
(represented with &ldquo;..&rdquo;) in the filename passed to wrapper.pl, so
as to avoid turning our program into a convenient way of looking at
all of the files on the server's hard disk. One easy way to do this
is to replace the original assignment of <b  >$file</b>
with the following two lines:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# Get the name of the template
my $file = "/home/httpd/html/templates/" . $query-&gt;param("keywords");
# Remove possible security problems
$file =~ s|/\.\./|/|g;
</pre><p>This will remove attempts to ascend one or more directories,
making it more difficult for someone to spy on the contents of our
server.
</p><p>Thus, if we have a template named
/home/httpd/html/templates/test.tmpl and a site called
www.oursite.com, we can view the template in translated form by
using the URL http://www.oursite.com/cgi-bin/wrapper.pl?test.tmpl.
If we have another template in the same directory named foo.html,
we can view it using the URL
http://www.oursite.com/cgi-bin/wrapper.pl?foo.html.</p><p>One odd note that you should remember when creating templates
is the fact that they are effectively served out of the CGI
directory on your server (usually called
<b  >cgi-bin</b>). In all of the above templates, this
does not make any difference. If our templates were to incorporate
images whose URLs were named relatively (i.e., without a leading
slash) rather than absolutely (i.e., with a leading slash), this
could cause a problem.</p><p>For example, it is quite common for HTML files to be placed
in one directory, while the images used by those files are placed
in a subdirectory, perhaps named &ldquo;images&rdquo;. In order to create an
HTML file with an image inside of it, we could do the
following:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;HTML&gt;
&lt;Head&gt;
&lt;Title&gt;Example of image&lt;/Title&gt;
&lt;/Head&gt;
&lt;Body&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This is a sample Web page, containing an image.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;img src="images/graphic.gif"&gt;
&lt;/Body&gt;
&lt;/HTML&gt;
</pre><p>But if we were to take this same file and feed it through
wrapper.pl, the image would no longer appear. That's because the
&ldquo;image&rdquo; subdirectory exists relative to the directory in which
the HTML file resides, rather than the directory in which the CGI
program resides.
</p><p>One quick solution to this problem is to use the
<b  >&lt;base&gt;</b> HTML tag, with a URL other than the
one under which it was invoked. The <b  >&lt;base&gt;</b>
tag looks like:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;base href="http://www.oursite.com/text/english/"&gt;
</pre><p>With this tag in place, our browser will know to load the
image in the above template from
http://www.oursite.com/text/english/images, regardless of whether
the document was loaded from within the CGI directory or the
original HTML directory. The problem with this approach is that it
makes it more difficult to move files and directories to other
places on the site&mdash;a trade-off that is often worth making.
</p><p>One word of warning before I conclude. Normally, access to
the CGI directory and to the programs contained within it is
restricted to a small set of programmers who can be trusted to
write and modify code on your system. With templates, that group is
suddenly expanded to include all of the site's designers, who could
theoretically modify the code within a template to perform
malicious acts. Remember that since templates include code, it is a
good idea to restrict access to the directory containing the
templates, rather than granting it to everyone on your
system.</p><p>In short, templates are a useful way to separate the design
of a web site from the CGI programs it contains. By using them
wisely, you will give everyone more freedom to do what they enjoy,
as well as what they do best.</p></div></div>
