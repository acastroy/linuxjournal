xv image manipulation software long before I ever heard of XVScan.
So when I heard that someone had added the ability to acquire
images from an HP ScanJet scanner to xv, I was immediately
intrigued. Sean Reifschneider, who wrote the software, posted the
following message to comp.os.linux.hardware in 1995:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>When I first got the ScanJet I wrote a
<b  >hpscanpbm</b> (I don't think the real one was
available then, and anyway, it only took 4 hours) that I used for a
couple of months until I could get the time to write something
better.</p></blockquote></div><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>The end result is &ldquo;XVScan&rdquo;, a scanning
extension to XV. While the &ldquo;hpscanpbm&rdquo; worked okay, this is about
a thousand times better. I mean, I used to do the scan, load it
into xv, and maybe I'd have to tweak, re-load, etc... Now I can
just scan directly into XV.</p></blockquote></div><p>Now, if you've never used xv, you might not understand my
enthusiasm for it; it is, after all, a simple, straightforward
tool. It certainly isn't in the same league as PhotoShop, but it's
good at what it does&mdash;reading and writing files in a dozen
different formats, window capturing, color-map editing, cropping
and some fairly interesting image manipulation algorithms. In
short, while it may not have all the fancy bells and whistles, it
does have those things I use on a regular basis when manipulating
images.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d91580.0x1e89ce8"></a>Installation</h2></div></div><p>XVScan should run with any version of Linux&mdash;it's been tested
with the 1.2.x and 2.0.x kernels, but it hasn't been tested with
MkLinux yet. (Mac users&mdash;if you try this and get it to work, let
tummy.com know&mdash;they're interested.) XVScan requires built-in
generic SCSI driver support&mdash;no earlier than version 1.1.79. You
don't need Motif, and you can use any version of XFree (X11R5,
X11R6).</p><p>If you're not running Linux, you can also run XVScan under
HP-UX, BSD/OS, FreeBSD, SunOS and Solaris&mdash;although if you're using
Solaris and require SG, the generic pass-through SCSI driver, there
is an extra charge.</p><p>XVScan was installed by Peter Struijk, one of SSC's Systems
Administrators, before I started using it. A few minutes of looking
through the documentation for XVScan makes installation seem easy,
as Peter confirmed.</p><p>There's a setup program, used by the INSTALL-xvscan script,
that searches your hardware for a scanner&mdash;namely, a SCSI ScanJet
scanner, the only type XVScan can currently use. If one is found,
the script creates the /dev/scanjet device file. Seems
straightforward to me. In the Linux version, if XVScan can't find a
scanner attached to the SCSI chain, you can still use the regular
xv functions&mdash;just the scanning is disabled. Peter tells me the
only tricky business is to remember that if in the future you
change any of your SCSI devices, you must rerun this setup program;
otherwise, XVScan will no longer be able to find the
scanner.</p><p>Some users, apparently, even pick up XVScan just to have an
easy-to-install, pre-built copy of xv. This makes sense when you
consider that the $50 price tag includes the $25 xv license fee,
it's distributed with full source code and updates are free for the
first year.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d91580.0x1e89f50"></a>Getting Started</h2></div></div><p>When I first started up XVScan, my first thought was, &ldquo;This
looks exactly like xv&rdquo;--and it does. Only when you look at the
Control menu do you notice the addition of a
<b  >Scanner</b> button that, when clicked, brings up the
scanning window in which the scanned image is displayed. Other
differences are even less apparent. Another change from the normal
release of xv are the defaults used when XVScan starts.</p><p>By default, XVScan turns on <b  >-nolimits</b>,
which lets images be larger than your screen&mdash;sometimes much, much
larger. I suppose I can see the point of doing this, but I found it
annoying not to have the image appear as a small, convenient window
I could easily move around on my screen.</p><p>On the other hand, the other default it changes is that
<b  >-rwcolor</b>--read/write color entries&mdash;is set
&ldquo;on&rdquo; at startup. Thus, any color editing I do to the image
happens in real time, without having to manually
<b  >Apply</b> changes. That's kind of nice&mdash;I like
it.</p><p>According to the documentation, both of these default options
can be disabled. The documentation is handled nicely. When you
click on the scanning window's <b  >Help</b> button, it
automatically launches a web browser that points at the on-line
documentation at http://www.tummy.com/xvscan/. Therefore, you never
have to remember their URL, and you don't have to keep a copy of
their documentation on your hard drive. Of course, if you don't
have an Internet connection up all the time, you might not find
this so convenient.</p><p>The scanning window can be a little daunting to a first-time
user, as you're immediately presented with a display of options,
controls and buttons (see Figure 1). I suppose that's unavoidable
for a program this flexible, but at first I was a little worried
about the program's apparent complexity.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d91580.0x1e8a370"></a>Figure 1. XVScan Control Window</h2></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="2215f1.large.jpg"><img src="2215f1.jpg"></a></div><p>I shouldn't have worried. The interface is surprisingly easy
to decipher and use. There are generally several ways to do any one
task. For example, if you want to resize the area you're scanning,
you can enter numbers to resize it, pick from a standard selection
of paper sizes (conveniently, you can define your own common
document sizes) or click and drag the bars at the edges of the scan
window.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d91580.0x1e8a580"></a>Scanning</h2></div></div><p>Scanning is fast and the quality is high; XVScan can quickly
and easily handle scanning all the way up to 600 dpi. You can
precisely select the dpi to use for scanning and you can adjust the
brightness, the contrast, the gamma correction&mdash;most anything you'd
like to control.</p><p>Unlike a lot of scanners, XVScan doesn't give you a miniature
of the image in the &ldquo;pre-scan&rdquo; mode. Instead, when the
<b  >QuickScan</b> option is selected, XVScan scans the
image and adjusts the resolution so that the resultant image
exactly fits the scanning window. This action might end up
displaying the image at a lower resolution than you have in mind
for your final image; it might just as easily be higher. (For me,
it was often higher. I scan images to look good on a web page, not
to be printed, so I don't need to scan at resolutions higher than
72 dpi.)</p><p>Once you have your QuickScan image on screen, you can adjust
the appropriate settings as you wish to enhance it and, if
necessary, set crop limits. Once you click on <b  >Apply
Crop</b>, the cropped image is displayed filling the scanning
window. Now, click on <b  >Scan</b> for your next pass,
and XVScan scans only the area inside the crop limits&mdash;very
convenient.</p><p>That's great, I can hear you say, but I don't always want to
play around in a fancy X Windows' user interface&mdash;sometimes I'd
like to be able to just scan an image using the command line. You
can do that, too. Although their manual boasts that the GUI makes
their product &ldquo;more user friendly than
<b  >hpscanpbm</b>&rdquo;, it's also distributed with
<b  >sjscan</b>, a command-line scanning utility.</p><p>By the way, while XVScan can read and write in several
different image formats, their manual warns:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>xv has a whopping grand total of two internal
image formats: 8-bit color mapped and 24-bit RGB. Every image you
load is converted to one of these two formats, as part of the image
loading procedure, before you ever see the image.</p></blockquote></div><p>In other words, you might occasionally get some minor
artifacts creeping into the images as they're converted back and
forth&mdash;but if this is a serious problem, I have yet to encounter
it.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d91580.0x1e8aaa8"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>I did a search on DejaNews (http://www.dejanews.com/) while
researching this review, to see if I could find any negative
comments people had posted to Usenet about XVScan. I couldn't find
any. The closest thing I found to a negative remark was a few
die-hard free software fans grumbling about having to actually pay
money for it. On the whole, everyone who had used the software
seemed to recommend it. In fact, in response to a general question
about scanning under Linux, one user suggested that the person
asking should buy an HP ScanJet just so he could run XVScan.</p><p>Personally, I like having an environment that allows me to do
high-quality scans and to manipulate the image within the same
application. I'm far too used to programs that do just one thing
well; XVScan appears to aim at doing everything well, and I think
it succeeds.</p></div></div>
