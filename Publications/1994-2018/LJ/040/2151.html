    How the EXT2 file system is organized on the disk and how it gets
    its speed.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28e2580.0x29da3a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>Everyone wants a fast computer; however,
not everyone realizes that one of the most important factors of
computer performance is the speed of the file system. Regardless of
how fast your CPU is, if the file system is slow, then the whole
computer will seem slow. Many people who have very fast Pentium
Pros with slow disk drives and even slower networked file systems
rediscover this fact daily.
</p><p>Linux has a very fast file system called the
<span   class="bold"><b>Extended File System Version 2
(EXT2)</b></span>. The EXT2 file system was created by Remy Card
(card@masi.ibp.fr).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28e2580.0x29da558"></a>Disk Layout</h2></div></div><p>There are several objectives when deciding how to lay out
data on a disk.</p><p>First and foremost, the data structure should be
<span   class="bold"><b>recoverable</b></span>. If there is an error
while writing data to the disk (like a user pulling the power
cord), the entire file system should not be lost. Although losing
the data currently being written is sometimes acceptable, losing
all the data on the disk is not.</p><p>Second, the data structure must allow for an
<span   class="bold"><b>efficient implementation</b></span> of all
needed operations. The hardest operation to implement is normally
the hard link. When using a hard link, there is more than one
directory entry (i.e., file name) that points to the same file
data. Accessing the data by any of the valid file names should
produce the same data.</p><p>Another hard operation involves deleting an open file. If an
application has a file open for access at the same time that a user
deletes the file, the application should still be able to access
the file's data. The data should not be cleared off the disk until
the last application closes the file. This sort of behavior is
quite unlike DOS/Windows, where deleting a file results in
immediate loss of access to that file by any application in the
process of reading/writing to it. Applications exhibiting this type
of Unix behavior are more common than one might think, and changing
it would cause many applications to break.</p><p>Third, a disk layout should minimize seek times by
<span   class="bold"><b>clustering</b></span> data on the disk. A
drive needs more time to read two pieces of data that are widely
separated on the disk than the same sized pieces located close to
each other. A good disk layout can minimize disk seek time (and
maximize performance) by clustering related data close together.
For example, parts of the same file should be close together on
disk and, also, near the directory containing the file's
name.</p><p>Finally, the disk layout should
<span   class="bold"><b>conserve disk space</b></span>. Conserving
disk space was more important in the past, when hard drives were
small and expensive. These days, conserving disk space is not so
important; however, one should not waste disk space.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28e2580.0x29da978"></a>Partitions</h2></div></div><p>Partitions are the first level of disk layout. Each disk must
have one or more partitions. The operating system pretends each
partition is a separate logical disk, even though they may share
the same physical disk. The most common use of partitioning is to
place more than one file system on the same physical disk, each in
its own partition. Each partition has its own device file in the
<b  >/dev</b> directory (e.g., <b  >/dev/hda1,
/dev/hda2</b>, etc.). Every EXT2 file system occupies one
partition, and completely fills it.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28e2580.0x29dab30"></a>Groups</h2></div></div><p>The EXT2 file system is divided into
<span   class="bold"><b>groups</b></span>, which are sections of a
partition. The division into groups is done at the time the file
system is formatted and cannot change without reformatting. Each
group contains related data. A group is the unit of clustering in
the EXT2 file system. Each group contains a
<span   class="bold"><b>superblock</b></span>, a
<span   class="bold"><b>group descriptor</b></span>, a
<span   class="bold"><b>block bitmap</b></span>, an
<span   class="bold"><b>inode bitmap</b></span>, an
<span   class="bold"><b>inode table</b></span> and finally
<span   class="bold"><b>data blocks</b></span>, all in that
order.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28e2580.0x29daea0"></a>Superblock</h2></div></div><p>Some information about a file system belongs to the file
system as a whole and not to any particular file or group. This
information is stored in the
<span   class="bold"><b>superblock</b></span>, and includes the total
number of blocks within the file system, the time it was last
checked for errors and so on.</p><p>The first superblock is the most important one, since it is
the first one read when the file system is mounted. The information
in the superblock is so important that the file system cannot be
mounted without it. If a disk error occurred while updating the
superblock, the entire file system would be ruined; therefore, a
copy of the superblock is kept in each group. If the first
superblock becomes corrupted, the redundant copies can be used to
fix the error by using the command
<b  >e2fsck</b>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28e2580.0x29db0b0"></a>Group Descriptors and Bitmaps</h2></div></div><p>The next block of each group is the
<span   class="bold"><b>group descriptor</b></span>. The group
descriptor stores information on each group. Within each group
descriptor is a pointer to the table of inodes (more on inodes in a
moment) and <span   class="bold"><b>allocation bitmaps</b></span> for
inodes and data blocks.</p><p>An allocation bitmap is simply a list of bits describing
which blocks or inodes are in use. For example, data block number
123 is in use if bit number 123 in the data bitmap is set. Using
the data and inode bitmaps, the file system can determine which
blocks and inodes are in current use and which are available for
future use.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28e2580.0x29db2c0"></a>Inodes and Such</h2></div></div><p>Each file on disk is associated with exactly one
<span   class="bold"><b>inode</b></span>. The inode stores important
information about the file including the create and modify times,
the permissions on the file and the owner of the file. The inode
also contains the type of the file (regular file, directory, device
file like /<b  >dev/ttyS1</b>, etc.) and the location of
the file on disk.</p><p>The data in the file is not stored in the inode itself.
Instead, the inode points to the location of the data on disk.
There are fifteen pointers to data blocks within each inode.
However, this does not mean that a file can only be fifteen blocks
long. Instead, a file can be millions of blocks long, thanks to the
indirect way that data pointers point to data.</p><p>The first thirteen pointers point directly to blocks
containing file data. If the file is thirteen or fewer blocks long,
then the file's data is pointed to directly by pointers within each
inode and can be accessed quickly. The fourteenth pointer is called
the indirect pointer and points to a block of pointers, each one of
which points to data on the disk. The fifteenth pointer is called
the doubly indirect pointer and points at a block containing many
pointers to blocks each of which points at data on the disk. The
picture shown in Figure 1 should make things clear.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2151f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. The pointers between an inode and its associated data.
</p></div></div><p>This scheme allows direct access to all the data of small
files (files less than fourteen blocks long) and still allows for
very large files with only a few extra accesses. As Table 1 shows,
almost all files are actually quite small; therefore, almost all
files can be accessed quickly using this scheme.</p><p><a href="2151t1.html" target="_self">Table 1. Occurrence of Various File
Sizes</a></p><p>Inodes are stored in the inode table, which is at a location
pointed to by the group descriptor within each group. The location
and size of the inode table is set at format time and cannot be
changed without reformatting. This means that the maximum number of
files in the file system is also fixed at format time. However,
each time you format the file system you can set the maximum number
of inodes with the <b  >-i</b> option to
<b  >mke2fs</b>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28e2580.0x29db8f0"></a>Directories</h2></div></div><p>No one would like a file system where files were accessed by
inode number. Instead, people want to give textual names to files.
Directories associate these textual names with the inode numbers
used internally by the file system. Most people don't realize that
directories are just files where the data is in a special directory
format. In fact, on some older Unix systems, you could run editors
on the directories, just to see what they looked like internally
(imagine running <b  >vi /tmp</b>).</p><p>Each directory is a list of directory entries. Each directory
entry associates one file name with one inode number and consists
of the inode number, the length of the file name and the actual
text of the file name.</p><p>The root directory is always stored in inode number two, so
that the file system code can find it at mount time. Subdirectories
are implemented by storing the name of the subdirectory in the name
field and the inode number of the subdirectory in the inode field.
Hard links are implemented by storing the same inode number with
more than one file name. Accessing the file by either name results
in the same inode number, and therefore, the same data.</p><p>The special directories &ldquo;.&rdquo; and &ldquo;..&rdquo; are implemented by
storing the names &ldquo;.&rdquo; and &ldquo;..&rdquo; in the directory and the inode
number of the current and parent directories in the inode field.
The only special treatment these two entries receive is that they
are automatically created when any new directory is made, and that
they cannot be deleted.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2151f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

watch it in action.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28e2580.0x2dd4068"></a>Accessing a file</h2></div></div><p>To explain the EXT2 file system in action, we will need two
things: a variable named DIR that holds directories, and a path
name to look up. Some path names have many components (e.g.,
<b  >/usr/X11/bin/Xrefresh</b>) and others do not (e.g.,
<b  >/vmlinuz</b>).</p><p>Assume that a process wants to open a file. Each process is
associated with a current working directory. All file names that do
not start with &ldquo;/&rdquo; are resolved relative to this current working
directory and DIR begins with the current working directory. File
names that start with &ldquo;/&rdquo; are resolved relative to the root
directory (see <b  >chroot</b> for the one exception),
and DIR begins with the root directory.</p><p>Each directory name in the path to be resolved is looked up
in DIR in turn. This lookup yields the inode number of the
subdirectory we're interested in.</p><p>Next, the inode of the subdirectory is accessed. The
permissions are checked, and if you have access permissions, this
new directory becomes DIR. Each subdirectory in the path is treated
in this fashion, until only the last component of the path
remains.</p><p>When the last component of the pathname is reached, the
variable DIR contains the directory which contains the file name
we've been searching for. Looking in DIR we find the inode number
of the file. Accessing this final inode tells us the location of
the data. After checking permissions, you can access the
data.</p><p>How many disk accesses were needed to access the data you
wanted? A reasonable maximum is two per subdirectory (one to look
up the name, the other to find the inode) and two more for the
actual file name. This effort is expended only at file open time.
After a file has been opened, subsequent accesses can use the
inode's data without looking it up again. Further,
<span   class="bold"><b>caching</b></span> eliminates many of the
accesses needed to look up a file (more later).</p><p><a href="2151l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a></p><p>When a new file or directory is created, the EXT2 file system
must decide where to store the data. If the disk is mostly empty,
data can be stored almost anywhere. However, performance is
maximized if the data are clustered with other related data to
minimize seek times.</p><p>The EXT2 file system attempts to allocate each new directory
in the group containing its parent directory, on the theory that
accesses to parent and children directories will be closely
related. The EXT2 file system also attempts to place files in the
same group as their directory entries, because directory accesses
often lead to file accesses. However, if the group is full, the new
file or new directory is placed in some other non-full
group.</p><p>The data blocks needed to store directories and files can be
found by looking in the data allocation bitmap. Any needed space in
the inode table can be found by looking in the inode allocation
bitmap.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28e2580.0x2dd4640"></a>Caching</h2></div></div><p>Like most file systems, the EXT2 system relies very heavily
on caching. A <span   class="bold"><b>cache</b></span> is a part of
RAM dedicated to holding file system data. The cache holds
directory information inode information and actual file contents.
Whenever an application (like a text editor or a compiler) tries to
look up a file name or requests file data, the EXT2 system first
checks the cache. If the answer can be found in the cache, the
request can be answered very quickly indeed without using the
disk.</p><p>The cache is filled with data from prior requests. If you
request data that you have never requested before, the data must
first be retrieved from disk. Most of the time most people ask for
data they have used before. These repeat requests are answered
quickly from the cache, saving the disk drive much effort while
providing the user quick access.</p><p>Of course, each computer has a limited amount of RAM
available. Most of that RAM is used for other things like running
applications, leaving perhaps 10% to 30% of total RAM available for
the cache. When the cache becomes full, the oldest unused data
(least recently used data) is thrown out. Only recently used data
remains in the cache.</p><p>Since larger caches can hold more data, they can also satisfy
a larger number of requests. The figure below shows a typical curve
of the total cache size versus the percent of all requests that can
be satisfied from the cache. As you can see in Figure 3, using more
RAM for caching increases the number of requests answered from the
cache, and therefore increases the apparent speed of the file
system.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2151f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

possible, but no simpler. The EXT2 file system is rather more
complex than most people realize, but this complexity results in
both the full set of Unix operations working correctly, and good
performance. The code is robust and well tested and serves the
Linux community well. We all owe a debt of thanks to M.
Card.</p><p><a href="2151s1.html" target="_self">Sources for More
