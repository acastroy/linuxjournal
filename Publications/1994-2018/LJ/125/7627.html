A while ago, I had conversations with two of my least technically
inclined friends, both of whom brought up the topic of Wi-Fi within
minutes. In fact, one friend, a dancer and choreographer, called
me specifically to ask what he could do with &ldquo;the Wi-Fi thing in my
laptop&rdquo;. He'd bought a shiny new laptop on the recommendation of another
friend and now was confessing to me that although he knew what Wi-Fi
was theoretically, he wasn't sure what he could do with it.
</p><p>
Fast forward to the recent 4th of July weekend, when I spent time with
these friends and found out they've both figured out a whole lot
they can do with wireless. The choreographer told me he is working
on-line with dancers on a new production. He's also collaborating with
the cellist writing music for the piece. The cellist lives in San
Diego, and my friend is doing most of this work while running around
Seattle and hopping on any of the many hot spots he locates thanks to
SeattleWireless.net. And, although certainly not the most important
function that wireless technology ever served, without cell phones with IM
features, my other friend and I never would have located each other
among the 30,000+ people present at the fireworks display the evening of
July 4th.
</p><p>
For those of you who've mastered IM and who are able to locate a hot spot
blindfolded, the topic of this issue is Everything Wireless, and the
<i  >LJ</i> Web site offers even more project news, advice
and how-tos. Take, for example, &ldquo;Getting On-line Anywhere with Bluetooth and
GPRS&rdquo;, by Sreekrishan Venkiteswara (<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/7525" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/7525</a>).
This article offers an overview of how BlueZ and General Packet
Radio Service (GPRS) work and explains how they can be used when
designing embedded Linux products, including cell phones and PDAs.
Venkiteswara writes, &ldquo;Because Bluetooth supports device inquiry and
service discovery, the Bluetooth devices automatically can use a nearby
cell phone for Internet connectivity, without cumbersome configuration
of such details as physical addresses.&rdquo;
</p><p>
In &ldquo;A Linux-Based Implementation of Mobility Using SIP&rdquo;
(www.linuxjournal.com/article/7380), the developers explain how they
created the &ldquo;first open-source SIP implementation that supports
mobility&rdquo; by adding mobility capabilities to Vovida's VOCAL VoIP
software. They write, &ldquo;The software supports seamless SIP
signaling when the user moves from network to network, as well as
automatic handoff if the user is in the middle of a call while changing
networks.&rdquo;
</p><p>
On the end-user side, for those of you struggling with wireless
connectivity for your laptop, be sure to check out the latest
installment of Doc Searls' adventures with his new IBM T40 laptop,
&ldquo;The
Laptopia Odyssey, Part 2&rdquo; (<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/7636" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/7636</a>). A big
part of this stage in creating Doc's ultimate mobile workstation is
getting Wi-Fi to work as well and as consistently as he needs. Things
improved once he switched to SuSE Professional 9.1 and made a few other
changes, but it's still not perfect. He writes, &ldquo;Kismet seems to work, so
far. It sees 802.11b and b/g access points, two of each (three here, one
next door). I still need to figure out how to get the ThinkPad to switch
easily from one to another.&rdquo; Doc also writes about using FireWire and
the browser and office applications he likes best for his laptop.

If you're doing something new and interesting with wireless or if you've
improved your wireless experience, why not share it with the rest of the
Open Source community? Send me an article proposal at
