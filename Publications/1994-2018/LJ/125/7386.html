Developing a new generation of wireless
communications means you need FPGA
development tools, a cluster for simulation and an
embedded OS for prototype devices. Linux fits the need.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a69580.0x2b61558"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Here at Tait Electronics Group Research in Christchurch, New Zealand, we
quietly have been building an advanced wireless networking concept called
space-time (ST) processing. ST is predicted by many to drive the next
big-step improvement in wireless technology after 3G. The nature of space-time
is that the mathematics behind it and, consequently, its implementation,
are extremely complex. Many academic researchers are working on this,
but we have completed two world-first practical implementations on our
ST array research (STAR) platform. These are time-reversal
space-time block coding (TR-STBC) and the tongue-twisting single
carrier, adaptive multivariate decision feedback equalised multiple-in,
multiple-out (SC-AMV-DFE-MIMO) coding scheme. Without a doubt, these
achievements were possible
largely thanks to the performance and adaptability of Linux.
</p><p>
This article describes how Linux was key in enabling our mathematical
simulations and was adopted for our embedded processing and runtime control.
We cover such diverse aspects as message passing interface (MPI),
cluster computing, embedded Linux, PHP, shell scripts, network filesystem (NFS), SMB (server message block) and kernel modules on ARM,
Alpha and Intel architecture computers. We skip development details,
but describe the system as it operates today, highlighting some of
the real advantages we gained by using Linux.
</p><p>
In its basic configuration, each STAR platform consists of one
multichannel transmitter unit and one multichannel receiver unit,
both connected to a shared LAN and transmitting anything up to around
200Mb/s at microwave frequencies. There actually are 23 printed
circuit boards in each unit, which took 15 people a year to design
and build.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7386f1.large.jpg"><img src="7386f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. A bidirectional RF link uses one
multichannel transmitter and one multichannel receiver
on each STAR platform.
</p></div></div><p>
Figure 1 shows the system wired to a shared Ethernet as a bidirectional
RF link. The setup shown is for experimental purposes; an actual product
would not have a shared Ethernet between transmitter and receiver.
</p><p>
All of the clever radio processing is done on the digital board, not
by the ARM processor but by a dedicated field programmable gate array
(FPGA) and digital signal processor (DSP). We call FPGA code firmware
because we can't decide whether it's software or hardware; this way
we don't have to comply with either the software coding standards or
the hardware design standards of the company. In the middle of
last year, when we designed the system, we used the biggest, fastest
and most expensive FPGA and DSP we could obtain, and we since have added two
more big FPGAs. The ARM is not used for low-level processing because
we require over 50,000MIPS for ST processing.
With this complexity, even the fastest components alone are not enough,
so we decided early on to build a multiprocessor-capable system.
</p><p>
STAR units are extensible through high-speed low-voltage differential
signaling (LVDS) connections that run at up to 1Gb/s. Each board has
two sets of five-channel bidirectional LVDS interconnects to link two
neighbouring boards. At the same time, each board is wired to Ethernet.
High-speed data travels over LVDS, and control data uses Ethernet.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a69580.0x2b61a28"></a>
Development</h2></div></div><p>
Most processing occurs in the FPGA, coded in VHDL. A growing number of
VHDL tools are available for Linux (see sidebar), and we used Quartus
from Altera.
In our system, we developed algorithms first with GNU-Octave and then ported
them to VHDL. Octave and the mostly compatible MATLAB
are available for Linux and Microsoft Windows, but Octave has an MPI-enabled version that runs on clusters. We compiled
this for a cluster of old DEC Alphas we call zion. MPI-Octave really
screams on zion despite the fact that the fastest CPU is only 500MHz.
</p><p>
For our digital board, we used an ARM Linux toolchain from handhelds.org
to compile freshly patched 2.4.18 kernel sources.
Russell King began ARM Linux when working on a distribution for Acorn computers
in the early 1990s. Now, ARM is one of the best-supported processors
under Linux and is a real joy to us. Three days was enough to port
Linux to our custom hardware, although the Ethernet driver took a couple
more days to complete. ARM is easily the world's number one processor by sales, with a
huge amount of support for running Linux. This led Tait Electronics to
commit to ARM processors in our future processor road map.
</p><p>
With ARM Linux booting, it was time for a RAM disk. Having 16MB of SDRAM
and 2MB of Flash memory on the ARM, we opted for a maximum compressed
kernel and RAM disk size of 1,024K each, although the uncompressed RAM disk
is 4MB in size. Both are stored in Flash and allow booting without
external interaction.
</p><p>
We opted to use BusyBox for common tools, including ls, cd, mount, insmod and ping,
and TinyLogin for login and password support. Other onboard
utilities handle memory-mapped peripherals and Flash, and netkit-base
provides a telnet d&aelig;mon that uses TinyLogin functions. Tait Electronics
bought a range of MAC addresses from the IEEE to support its Linux-on-ARM
development programme, and the MAC address for each board is held in
Flash memory.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="7386f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Each unit has both a Flash-based and a RAM-based filesystem.
</p></div></div><p>
We developed many small applications and even got the Abyss Web server
running, but these all can't fit into Flash. We therefore NFS-mount a
directory from the zion mainframe to each ARM, accessing many gigabytes of extra
space. Figure 2 shows the filesystem arrangement.
</p><p>
We also set up SMB mounts to users' shared drives from zion, accessible
to the ARM boards over NFS. If a Web server is run on the ARM boards,
we end up with a highly interlinked system. Windows users can access
part of their own local drivespace through the Web served by way of an embedded
ARM board linked over NFS to a remote cluster server.

Zion</h2></div></div><p>
In late 2001, we obtained the old DEC Alphas (described as boat anchors)
and decided to see what we could do with them.
First, we modified the built-in bootloader to get
Red Hat 7.1 running.
We made two major changes. First, we chose one master machine and loaded
up its SCSI interface with six hard disks and a DVD-ROM. Five disks
became a level-5 RAID array (using raidtools) to store simulation or
experimental data, and the remaining disk is for
booting and recovery.
</p><p>
The second change was to install the MPI
on all machines. Although installation was fairly easy, the need to
derive all IP addresses through DHCP caused problems. In the end, we
negotiated a fixed IP address for the master machine, now called zion.
We run startup scripts on other machines that log their IP addresses
onto an SMB mount using RPC (Listing 1).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a69580.0x2b621b8"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>

#Grab IP address from ifconfig
address/sbin/ifconfig | grep Bcast \
  | sed 's/^.*addr://;s/Bcast.*//' &gt; \
  /mnt/bar/$HOSTNAME.ip

</pre></div><p>
Once MPI was working, we downloaded the latest Octave source and patched
it with Octave-MPI. Since then, Octave-MPI seems to have been taken over
by Transient Research (see the on-line Resources section).
We set up our MPI system with a script that gathers the IP addresses
stored by the script above, pings them and builds an rhosts file.
Once dynamic generation of rhosts is complete, we simply run Octave-MPI
over 4+1 machines with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
recon -v
lamboot
mpirun -v -c4 octave-mpi
</pre>
</p><p>
With the system running, the Octave processing load can be shared across
the cluster. We find that Alphas have significantly faster floating-point
performance than do Pentiums, but using Ethernet to pass MPI messages slows
the cluster down. We haven't benchmarked the system, but a simulation
that takes a couple of hours to complete on a 2GHz Compaq PC runs about 10% faster on
our first cluster of four Alphas (300MHz&ndash;500MHz).
</p><p>
We found GNU-Octave to be an excellent tool for numerical simulations.
When executed with the -traditional option, also known as -braindead,
it runs most MATLAB scripts. In some cases, Octave provides better
features than MATLAB does, although MATLAB has a better plotting capability
than the default gnuplot engine Octave uses.
</p><p>
Some engineers prefer to develop on Windows, so we provide
a Web interface to MPI-Octave. It uses a JavaScript telnet client
served from Apache on zion and some back-end scripting. Scripts were
adapted from an on-line MUD game engine. For Windows users, the telnet
client script automatically mounts their shared Windows drives on the zion
filesystem, runs Octave over telnet and sets up plotting capabilities so
that plots are written to a directory on the Web server in PNG format for
displaying with a browser. Another option lets users save plots directly
to their shared drives.
</p><p>
For debugging, a large debug buffer in the FPGA is accessible to the ARM.
We memory-mapped the FPGA with 32-bit high-speed asynchronous access
to the ARM, with access in userland or kernel space. Unsurprisingly,
in kernel space we use a character driver module accessed as a file.
This bursts up
to 1,024 data words at high speed and handles all signaling, although
the sustained speed is not so good. Userland access is accomplished through the neat
method of mmapping to the /dev/mem interface, as long as you remember
to create /dev/mem on your embedded filesystem first (Listing 2).

These tools allow us to upload known test vectors, saved from Octave on
zion, to the debug buffer. Under ARM control, we route the debug buffer
output to the input of a block under test, run the system for a few clock
cycles and capture the output back in the debug buffer. Analysing the
result in Octave tells us if the block works.

Figure 4. Visualising Channel Modes&mdash;The Complex
Paths from Transmitter to Receiver
</p></div></div><p>
We found visualisation to be an important factor. After our first
milestone, we invited some people to see the system. They saw boxes
humming away with a couple of green LEDs to indicate everything
was working. We noted a distinct lack of enthusiasm at what we believe was
a world-first demonstration of the technology, so we realised something
more was required. To this end, we chose to display channel models as they adapted
in near real time. A channel is the complex path from a transmitter to
a receiver, including reflections, multiple paths, dispersion and so on.
The system we built sent training symbols over the air to sound
the channel before sending data. Sounding gives us a picture of the
channel, which we decided to display.
We used the FPGA debug buffer on the receiver, with an ARM script running
periodically to execute a program to extract the channel data from the
buffer, format it and save in an Octave-compatible .mat file on zion.
Octave was run non-interactively on zion to read the
channel data periodically, analyse it and generate four plots as PNG
image files, which
a zion Web server PHP page displayed as a visualisation updated every
four
seconds (Figure 4).

Support</h2></div></div><p>
Our Linux-powered digital boards normally run complex processing
algorithms and communicate over air and Ethernet to other systems.
Even under laboratory conditions, it is difficult to know whether all components
are operating correctly, so we decided to utilise the power of Linux to
implement self-test and monitoring solutions. Like our visualisations, this ties many components together in a flexible way.
</p><p>
Nontechnical users demanded a graphical interface, which we
could have created using GTK, Tk, Qt or something similar, but we decided
instead on PHP-powered Web scripting. This allows users of all platforms
to access the system.
The C-like language syntax makes it easy and quick to use
for C programmers, and the
familiarity of modern users with Web interfaces helps. The source
code for most applications is less than 50KB in size, which is a
major advantage in debugging and testing and consequently improves our
confidence in that code.
</p><p>
Unfortunately, such a user interface has a couple of disadvantages:
first, when a background event must be brought to the attention
of a user and, second, when the system must interact directly
with hardware. The first problem can be solved through the use of
ticker-type messages in a separate frame. In our system, we solved the
second problem
through the use of small low-level C programs with a file-based interface
to PHP.
</p><p>
In truth, our system is quite convoluted. The controller in each unit is
the ARM processor, but the controller for all controllers in a multi-unit
system is the Web server serving the PHP scripts. For self-tests, the
system implements a repetitive monitor script running on each ARM every
five seconds and interrogates the system for the Web server. Details are
written to a file named after the IP address of the Ethernet on each ARM.
The monitor script also is responsible for ensuring that each operational
system is synchronised in time to zion. We didn't use NTP due to code
size and because we require sufficient time resolution only to prevent
shared filesystem time consistency errors. We script zion to write the
current time and date, using the date command, to the file every five seconds,
and each ARM reads that file every five seconds to set its time. This gets
around time synchronisation problems and fixes timestamps on files.
We also use it as a watchdog to reset boards more than a
minute out of date.
</p><p>
Apart from self-tests, the script also queries version numbers of RAM disk
and kernel on startup and writes this to a status file. A final use of
the script is to execute board-specific instructions. These are written
by the PHP control Web page to tell each ARM board what it should be doing.
Instructions from PHP are written as a shell script to be executed
by a single board, identified by IP address.
</p><p>
All units run identical kernels and RAM disks stored locally in
Flash memory and verified against master copies on zion at startup.
Any inconsistency causes the correct kernel or RAM disk to be burnt into
the local Flash memory. We built custom Flash memory tools to do this.
In practice, we have had no storage errors, but we use this to roll out new
versions of kernel and RAM disk without user intervention.
</p><p>
The PHP Web pages refresh every five seconds using the autoload HTML tag.
Of course, this works only if at least one user has a browser currently
viewing the page. If not, the information probably isn't required
anyway. A manager's-eye-view Web page hides almost all useful
information but looks great. Real users can click down through the
levels to get to individual scripts that customise each board.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a69580.0x2e6db80"></a>
Debugging and Monitoring</h2></div></div><p>
Linux software on the ARM sets up FPGA firmware to stream small packets of
data from the wireless system to a debug buffer in the FPGA. In slower
time, the ARM extracts this and stores it on zion. These files can be
analysed automatically to look for faults (like all 0s) and if found,
the user is alerted through the Web pages.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a69580.0x2e6dc88"></a>
Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
We recently have started to think about products rather than pure
research. It is likely that we will communicate IP packets and some form
of embedded Linux will power the product. This will happen not only because we relied
upon it during development, but there are few viable options for handling
IP packets.
WinCE is slow and bloated, and
VxWorks is lean but costly and lacks in protocol support.

</p><p>
Simulation tools let you write VHDL, simulate and debug it, but you need a
synthesis tool if you want to run your VHDL in hardware. Many simulation
tools have graphical waveform displays. Most professional VHDL tools will
run on Linux. Free tools include FreeHDL
and GHDL, a GCC front end for VHDL.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Synthesis</b></span>
</p><p>
Synthesis takes working VHDL and maps it to a hardware device, such as
an FPGA or MPGA (mask programmed gate array). This is
device-specific, so free tools are rare. Big manufacturers support Linux with
proprietary tools.
