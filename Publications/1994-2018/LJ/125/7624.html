If you want a Weblog package with minimal command-line setup and
a full-featured Web-based administration system, WordPress may be
for you.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xfb8580.0x10b03f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
A fitting end to
this series on Weblog software is a brief introduction to
WordPress, which offers a wide array of features and continues to
grow in popularity and sophistication.
WordPress is Weblog software with an
extremely clean, easy-to-use interface written in PHP with
a MySQL back end.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xfb8580.0x10b0500"></a>
Installing WordPress</h2></div></div><p>
Installing WordPress is amazingly straightforward if you have a bit
of experience with Apache and MySQL. WordPress stores all of its
information in a set of MySQL tables, which means you need
to create at least one database before installing WordPress.
WordPress allows you to have more than one Weblog inside of a single
database, which is useful if your site is hosted by a
company that gives you only a single MySQL database.
</p><p>
To create a new MySQL database, you need to use the mysqladmin
program, which is in /usr/local/mysql/bin on my system:


<pre     class="programlisting">
# /usr/local/mysql/bin/mysqladmin -p create wordpress
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xfb8580.0x10b0710"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The above command assumes you are running as root and
that the root user has administrative privileges. Once you have
created the database, you need to grant permissions for the
WordPress user on these tables; we do this by logging in to the
database:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# /usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql -p -u root
</pre>
</p><p>
Once you have logged in, you can grant permissions to the WordPress
user, which I called wpuser, with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON wordpress.*
    TO wpuser@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'wppass';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON wordpress.*
    TO wpuser IDENTIFIED BY 'wppass';
</pre>
</p><p>
Next, download the source code to WordPress (see the on-line Resources
section)
and open that .tar.gz file inside of your
Apache document root directory. You probably want to put the
WordPress files inside of their own directory or perhaps under a
virtual host, but all of the files must be within the document root
if they are to be of any use.
</p><p>
Now point your browser to wp-admin/install, and you're on your way.
The installation screens check that everything is installed correctly
and ask you to answer several questions. Typically, you
need to click on a link at the bottom of each page to continue with
and finish the installation.
</p><p>
If you fail to create the database first, WordPress tells you to do
this, reminding you that the database needs to be created
before it can install the tables.
You can use the WordPress installer only a single time. If
you try to run the installer on an already-installed system, you are
told to remove the old installation first. Attention to
these sorts of details is nice to see in a program aimed clearly
at a relatively nontechnical audience.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xfb8580.0x10b0a80"></a>
Using WordPress</h2></div></div><p>
Once you have installed WordPress, you can log in as the
admin user with a randomly generated password. Logging in as the
administrator allows you to add, edit and delete postings, as well as
configure the system for other users. WordPress allows you to create
any number of users, each of whom is assigned a privilege level
between 1 and 10. The administrator, with a privilege level of 10, is
allowed to do anything to the system; other users similarly can be
given free rein by being assigned 10s.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7624f1.large.jpg"><img src="7624f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

Figure 2. Display of That Posting with the Default WordPress Template
</p></div></div><p>
But, of course, you don't want to give every user the equivalent of
root access. The default WordPress installation raises the bar on a
number of features, so you can assign privilege levels to
different users. Thus, users with a level of 5 and above can manage
the list of links that appears on the right side of the page, and they
also
can upload images. These levels can be changed by using the
administrative interface.
</p><p>
WordPress administration is entirely Web-based; once you have created
the database tables, you can manipulate the entire system by using a Web
browser. A number of menus are available when you are inside the
administrative interface, and some of these menus have submenus as
well. Although I originally was confused by the placement of certain
features, I soon began to understand the layout of the system and was
able to locate and modify many of the different options.
</p><p>
For example, I decided that it would be nice to include my blogroll,
the list of Weblogs I read on a regular basis. I use
Bloglines.com, a Web-based aggregator, and was able to generate a list
of Weblogs in OPML (Outline Processor Markup Language), an XML
application that is the standard for such data. Importing the list into
WordPress was a snap by using the links menu and choosing
blogroll. One of the listed options was to import an OPML file; as
soon as I did that, my list of blogs was visible to the
world.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xfb8580.0x10b1000"></a>
User Interface</h2></div></div><p>
Open-source applications often are criticized for their
lack of a friendly user interface. This is largely because
open-source programmers are writing the software for themselves
and their colleagues, which means that anything other than core
functionality is cast aside.
</p><p>
The authors of WordPress, to their credit, have spent a great
deal of time on the user interface, trying to ensure that it is
straightforward and unsurprising for nontechnical users. For
example, many Weblogs assume that the author knows basic HTML tags
and understands how to add and remove them. The WordPress editing
window lets advanced users place such tags manually, but it also provides
a set of JavaScript buttons for less-experienced users. These buttons
not only indicate what possibilities exist, but change shape to
indicate that a particular format currently is in use. The Close
button at the end of the row was a particularly clever idea; it closes
all of the currently open tags.
</p><p>
Like most software with good user interfaces, WordPress includes many
small features that add up to a pleasant experience. For
example, it automatically creates en and em dashes when you use
two or three hyphens. It allows you to classify postings as
drafts (the default), private or public, which means that you can
start working on a Weblog entry, go to lunch and then return to work
on it.
</p><p>
WordPress is sensitive to the fact that deleting data is a dangerous
act that the user always should have to confirm. Thus, whenever the
mouse moves over a delete button, the background of that button
turns red. As an additional reminder, users are asked to confirm
the action with a JavaScript dialog box.
</p><p>
With the exception of deleting, it is easy to undo any mistake that
you might make in WordPress by returning to the menu in question and
changing the value. All entries, including drafts and comments, can
be edited repeatedly until they are ready for publication.
</p><p>
Finally, the look and feel of a WordPress Weblog can be changed by
modifying the CSS, which handles the fonts, colors, sizes and
placement; the templates, which largely are standard PHP; and even
the plugins, which can change almost anything. It is possible
to change the template within WordPress itself, although I expect that
most readers of this magazine would prefer to use Emacs or vi to change
the file directly on disk.
</p><p>
Installing a plugin requires downloading it and placing it within the
appropriate plugins directory, but activating it is completely
Web-driven. This means that system administrators can install a
number of plugins for their users and let the individuals choose
which plugins they would like to activate. Several sample plugins are
included in the WordPress distribution, and others are available from
the WordPress Web site.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Over the past few months, we have looked at a number of different
types of Weblog software. With the exception of COREBlog, a Zope
product that installed easily and quickly into my Zope server,
WordPress was by far the easiest and fastest to install. It has a
full list of features, many of which have to do with the clean,
easy-to-use user interface. Even novice computer users and Webloggers
can publish regularly with this software. Although the
underlying code and technologies used&mdash;PHP and MySQL&mdash;are not my
favorites, the set of features, growth of the platform and the large
community all make WordPress a winning choice.
