Although we use the phrase &ldquo;world
domination&rdquo;
somewhat tongue-in-cheek, the growing scope of devices and applications
controlled by Linux might make this philosophy a quiet though no less
real possibility.
Designed
for nearly any business task requiring barcode scanning, the AML
M7100 is a wireless Linux terminal from American Microsystems,
Ltd. By utilizing open-source tools, the M7100
could provide a robust and cost-effective means for businesses large and
small to track inventory. In its own way, the device opens new
inroads for Linux to the infrastructure of commerce, the business back end that's
a critical tool for management in commerce on any scale.
</p><p>
The M7100 is built around a custom Linux kernel and the widely used
Intel StrongARM processor, coupled with 16MB of RAM and 4MB of ROM. This
is the same processor found in such devices as the Sharp Zaurus and Yopy
Linux-based PDAs. Those devices utilize the StrongARM in 400MHz
configurations, while the M7100 processor is a bit slower at 133MHz. Given
the purpose-built nature of the device, the slower processor clearly is
not a drawback. The M7100 is intended to gather and
transmit data to a centralized application.
</p><p>
Weighing in at 16 ounces with a rechargeable battery, the M7100 is built as
much for durability as for portability. The weight is due in large part
to the device's rugged casing, an enclosure that's been
drop-tested onto concrete from up to four feet and survived.
This
device is designed for use in such locations as warehouses, stockrooms
and loading docks, where it could be destroyed
easily in a single gravity mishap. To further counteract the
weight issue, there's a non-removable nylon wrist strap
that's large enough to fit around even my oafish hands.
</p><p>
The M7100 has an
internal 802.11b wireless card. The card is
functional out of the box, hunting for and connecting to the nearest
available open access point without further configuration. Configuration
options, including the 802.11b Wireless Equivalent Privacy (WEP) and
static or DHCP addressing, are available from a menu.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="7481f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

letters.
</p></div></div><p>
The screen and keypad of the M7100 also reflect the rugged business
nature of the device. The screen is a
160&times;160 backlit LCD,
and the 55-key alphanumeric keypad comprises the bulk of the device's front
face. The keys are not arranged in the typical QWERTY configuration
but alphabetically for the letters, with a block of larger number
keys above.
Directly above the numeric keys
is a four-direction cluster of arrow keys straddled on either side
by Enter buttons. Finally, just below the display are small power
and backlight buttons surrounding a large and highly visible scan
key. This key activates the Long Range Laser scanner for five seconds,
allowing plenty of time to capture one barcode and move on to the next. The
five-second feature also provides a measure of battery conservation,
preventing the unnecessary power drain that would result from firing the
laser continuously. With a complement of fully customizable function
keys, the keypad is suited to nearly any purpose. The layout also lends
itself to use by either right- or left-handed operators. Although the
buttons feel a bit soft, they do provide enough tactile response
to help prevent manual data entry errors.
</p><p>
The M7100 ships with a docking cradle that doubles as both an in-unit battery
charger and a data-transfer dock. The cradle contains an additional slot
intended to charge a spare battery, and bright LED lights on the front
face signal power, as well as when main and spare batteries are charging. Power connects to
the back of the cradle between single USB and RS-232 serial ports. These
ports provide ample interfaces for connecting the cradle to a desktop or
server. They also provide hard-line alternatives to Wi-Fi for transferring
data from the terminal unit to a centralized location.
</p><p>
AML provides a pair of software-loaded CD-ROM discs. One disc contains
the CommandLink software, a Microsoft Windows-based tool for data transfer and
manipulation. According to the technical support staff at AML, however,
the software merely is provided in case the customer
doesn't have an existing communication and data-transfer package in place.
</p><p>
The real value in the software resides on the second disc. This disc
contains a full API and configuration tools.
Detailed documentation and a step-by-step HOWTO for
configuring and compiling the StrongARM tools allow in-house developers
to create business-specific applications with relative ease. For smaller
companies or those with small development budgets, several compatible
packages exist that communicate openly with the M7100. These include
the TrackWare Application Engine, a GUI builder for creating applications
to transform and interpret the data received from the device. In general,
though, AML expects that its customers are sending their barcode data
to legacy applications. The tools provided in the default configuration
are focused specifically on data transfer.
</p><p>
I initially was a bit baffled as to how to test the M7100. Then,
as I started to look around my cozy laundry-room office, I realized
how ubiquitous the barcode has become in the past few decades. Linux
distribution boxes, books, CDs, soda cans and old issues of <i  >Linux Journal</i> all had barcodes that were scanned easily with the
M7100&mdash;and that was
just my office.
The laser on the M7100 picks
up the barcodes much more easily and quickly than other
scanners.
It also
picks up labels from a considerably farther distance than others. I was able
to scan the barcode on my Dinty Moore stew cans from as
far as three feet.
</p><p>
The M7100 provides the capability to transfer this
scanned data almost immediately, by way of a telnet session with the
server. This session opens as soon as a wireless connection is
discovered, communicating with a server defined in the network
settings. Multiple servers may be defined in
this setting, with simultaneous telnet sessions opened to each server if
so desired.
The device also fully supports FTP for
both uploading and downloading data.
</p><p>
For as easily as the M7100 connects to a designated server on the network,
the telnet connection does seem to be a downside. Call me paranoid but,
given the security issues inherent in telnet, I'd much rather see this device
connect using a more secure protocol such as SSH. The device
clearly is intended for use on an internal network, but I find no
comfort in using a clear-text protocol on a wireless LAN.
Fortunately, AML works with individual customers at
no additional cost to provide SSH-based data-transfer capabilities for
the M7100.
</p><p>
Overall, AML's M7100 is a strong device, forging
new territory for Linux in the warehouses of
commerce. It's a well designed tool, achieving the
proper balance of mission-specific features and cost.
It's rugged yet easy to use. And, although a bit heavy
to carry for an eight-hour day, the device includes
a rugged wrist strap that should minimize the arm
strain.
The AML M7100 is available only through resellers.
