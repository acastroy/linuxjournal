A few simple utilities can make it
easier to figure out and maintain other people's
code.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x167c580.0x1774298"></a></h2></div></div><p>
This article presents a list of commands you should be able
to find on any Linux installation. These are tools
to help you improve your code and be more productive.
The list comes from my own experience as a programmer
and includes tools I've come to rely on repeatedly.
Some tools help create code, some help debug code
and some help reverse engineer code that's been dumped
in your lap.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x167c580.0x17743a0"></a>
1. ctags</h2></div></div><p>
Those of you addicted to integrated development environments (IDEs) probably never
heard of this tool, or if you did you probably think
it's obsolete. But a tags-aware editor is a
productive programming tool.
</p><p>
Tagging your code allows editors like vi and Emacs
to treat your code like hypertext (Figure 1).
Each object in your code becomes hyperlinked to
its definition. For example, if you are browsing
code in vi and want to know where the variable foo
was defined, type <tt  >:ta foo</tt>. If your cursor
is pointing to the variable, simply use Ctrl-right
bracket.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7330f1.large.jpg"><img src="7330f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. gvim at Work with Tags
</p></div></div><p>
The good news for the vi-impaired is ctags
is not only for C and vi anymore. The GNU version
of ctags produces tags that can be used with Emacs
and many other editors that recognize tag files.
In addition, ctags recognizes many languages other
than C and C++, including
Perl and Python, and even hardware design
languages, such as Verilog. It even can produce a human-readable
cross-reference that can be useful for
understanding code and performing metrics.
Even if you're not interested in using ctags in your
editor, you might want to check out the human-readable
cross-reference by typing <tt  >ctags -x *.c*</tt>.
</p><p>
What I like about this tool is that you get useful
information whether you input one file or one hundred
files, unlike many IDEs that aren't useful unless
they can see your entire application. It's not a
program checker, so garbage in, garbage out (GIGO)
rules apply.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x167c580.0x1774818"></a>
2. strace</h2></div></div><p>
strace lets you decipher what's going on
when you have no debugger nor the source code.
One of my pet peeves is a program that
doesn't start and doesn't tell you why. Perhaps
a required file is missing or has the wrong
permissions. strace can tell you what the program is
doing right up to the point where it exits. It can
tell you what system calls the program is using and
whether they pass or fail. It even can follow forks.
</p><p>
strace often gives me answers much
more quickly than a debugger, especially if the code
is unfamiliar. On occasion, I have to debug code on
a live system with no debugger. A quick run with
strace sometimes can avoid patching the system or
littering my code with printfs. Here is a trivial
example of me as an unprivileged user trying to delete
a protected file:

<pre     class="programlisting">
strace -o strace.out rm -f /etc/yp.conf
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x167c580.0x17749d0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The output shows where things went wrong:

<pre     class="programlisting">
lstat64("/etc/yp.conf", {st_mode=S_IFREG|0644,
st_size=361, ...}) = 0
access("/etc/yp.conf", W_OK) = -1 EACCES
(Permission denied)
unlink("/etc/yp.conf") = -1 EACCES (Permission
denied)
</pre>
</p><p>
strace also lets you attach to processes for
just-in-time debugging. Suppose
a process seems to be spending a lot of
time doing nothing. A quick way to find out what
is going on is to type <tt  >strace -c -p mypid</tt>.
After a second or two, press Ctrl-C and you might see a dump something like
this:


<pre     class="programlisting">

------ ----------- ----------- --------- --------- ----------------

</p><p>
In this case, it's spending most of its time in the poll system
call&mdash;probably waiting on a socket.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x167c580.0x1774ce8"></a>
3. fuser</h2></div></div><p>
The name is a mnemonic for file user and tells what processes have
opened a
given file. It also can send a signal to all those processes for you.
Suppose you want to delete a file but
can't because some program has it open and won't
close it. Instead of rebooting, type <tt  >fuser -k
<i>myfile</i></tt>.
This sends a SIGTERM to every process that has myfile opened.
</p><p>
Perhaps you need to kill a process that forked itself all over the place,
intentionally or otherwise. An unenlightened programmer might type
something like <tt  >ps | grep <i>myprogram</i></tt>.
This inevitably would be followed by several cut-and-paste operations with
the mouse. An easier way is to type <tt  >fuser -k
./<i>myprogram</i></tt>, where
<tt  ><i>myprogram</i></tt> is the pathname of the
executable. fuser typically is located
in /sbin, which generally is reserved for system
administrative tools. You can add /usr/sbin and
/sbin to the end of your $PATH.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x167c580.0x1775108"></a>
4. ps</h2></div></div><p>
ps is used to find process status, but many people
don't realize it also can be a powerful debugging
tool. To get at these features, use the
-o option, which lets you access many details
of your processes, including CPU usage, virtual
memory usage, current state and much more. Many of
these options are defined in the POSIX standard,
so they work across platforms.
</p><p>
To look at your running commands by pid and process state, type
<tt  >ps -e -o pid,state,cmd</tt>.
The output looks like this:


<pre     class="programlisting">
4576 S /opt/OpenOffice.org1.1.0/program/soffice.bin -writer
4618 D dd if /dev/cdrom of /dev/null
4619 S bash
4645 R ps -e -o pid,state,cmd
</pre>
</p><p>
Here you can see my dd command is in an uninterruptible sleep (state
D). Basically, it is blocking while waiting for /dev/cdrom. My
OpenOffice.org writer is sleeping (state S) while I type my example, and my
ps command is running (state R).
</p><p>
For an idea of how a running program is performing, type:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ps -o start,time,etime -p <i>mypid</i>
</pre>
</p><p>
This shows the basic output from
the time command, discussed later,
except you don't have to wait until your program
is finished.
</p><p>
Most of the information that ps produces is available
from the /proc filesystem, but if you are writing
a script, using ps is more portable. You never
know when a minor kernel rev will break all of
your scripts that are mining the /proc filesystem.
Use ps instead.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x167c580.0x1775580"></a>
5. time</h2></div></div><p>
The time command is useful for understanding your code's
performance. The most basic output consists of
real, user and system time. Intuitively,
real time is the amount of time between when the
code started and when it exited. User time and
system time are the amount of time spent executing
application code versus kernel code, respectively.
</p><p>
Two flavors of the time command are available.
The shell has a built-in version that tells you only
scheduler information. A version in
/usr/bin includes more information and
allows you to format the output. You easily
can override the built-in time command by preceding it
with a backslash, as in the examples that follow.
</p><p>
A basic knowledge of the Linux scheduler is helpful in interpreting the
output, but this tool also is helpful for learning how the scheduler works.
For example, the real time of a process typically is larger than the sum of
the user and system time. Time spent blocking in a system
call does not count against the process, because the scheduler is free to
schedule other processes during this time. The following
sleep command takes one second to execute but takes no measurable system or
user time:

<pre     class="programlisting">
\time -p sleep 1
real 1.03
user 0.00
sys 0.00
</pre>
</p><p>
The next example shows how a task can spend all of its time in user
space. Here, Perl calls the log() function in a loop, which
requires nothing from the kernel:

<pre     class="programlisting">
\time perl -e 'log(2.0) foreach(0..0x100000)'
real 0.40
user 0.20
sys 0.00
</pre>
</p><p>
This example shows a process using a lot of memory:

<pre     class="programlisting">
\time perl -e '$x = 'a' x 0x1000000'

0.06user 0.12system 0:00.22elapsed 81%CPU
(0avgtext+0avgdata 0maxresident)k
0inputs+0outputs (309major+8235minor)pagefaults
0swaps
</pre>
</p><p>
The useful information here is listed as pagefaults.
Although the GNU time command advertises a lot of
information, the 2.4 series of the Linux kernel
stores only major and minor page-fault information.
A major page fault is one that requires I/O; a
minor page fault does not.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x167c580.0x1775948"></a>
6. nm</h2></div></div><p>
This command allows you to retrieve information on symbol
names inside an object file or executable file. By default, the output gives
you a symbol name and its virtual address. What good is that?
Suppose you are compiling code and the compiler complains that you have an
unresolved symbol _foo. You search all of your source code and
cannot find anywhere where you use this symbol. Perhaps it got pulled in
from some template or a macro buried in one of the dozens of include files
that compiled along with your code. The command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
nm -guA *.o | grep foo
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x167c580.0x1775aa8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
shows all the modules that refer to foo. If you want to find out what library defines foo, simply use:

<pre     class="programlisting">
nm -gA /usr/lib/* | grep foo
</pre>
</p><p>
The nm command also understands how to demangle C++
names, which can be handy when mixing C and C++.
For example, forgetting to declare a C function with
<tt  >extern"C"</tt> produces a link time error something like
this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
undefined reference to `cfunc(char*)'
</pre>
</p><p>
In a large project with poorly defined headers, you might have a hard time
tracking down the offending module. In this case, you can look for all the
unresolved symbols in each object file with demangling turned on as
follows:

<pre     class="programlisting">
nm -guC *.o
extern-c.o:cfunc
no-extern-c.o:cfunc(char*)
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x167c580.0x1b6e010"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The first module is correct; the second is not.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x167c580.0x1b6e118"></a>
7. strings</h2></div></div><p>
This command looks for ASCII strings embedded in
binary files. It can be used for good or for evil.
The good uses include trying to figure out what
library is producing that cryptic string on stdout
every once in a while, for example:

<pre     class="programlisting">
strings -f /usr/lib/lib* | grep "cryptic message"
</pre>
</p><p>
On the evil side, the character strings can be used
to probe your format strings looking for clues and
vulnerabilities. This is why you should never put
passwords and logins in your programs.	It might be
wise to examine your own programs with this tool
and see what a clever programmer can see.
The version of strings that comes with the GNU
binutils has many useful options.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x167c580.0x1b6e2d0"></a>
8. od, xxd</h2></div></div><p>
These two commands do
basically the same thing, but each offers slightly
different features. od is used to
convert a binary file to whatever format you like.
When dealing with programs that generate raw binary
files, od can be indispensable. Although the
name stands for octal dump, it can dump data in
decimal and hexadecimal as well. od
dumps integers, IEEE floats or plain bytes.
When looking at multibyte integers or floats, the
host byte order affects the output.
</p><p>
xxd also dumps binary files but does not try to
interpret them as integers or floats, so
the host byte order does not affect the output, which
can be confusing or helpful depending on the file. Let's
create a four-byte file on an Intel
machine:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ echo -n abcd &gt; foo.bin
$ od -tx4 foo.bin
0000000 64636261
0000004

$ xxd -g4 foo.bin
0000000: 61626364         abcd
</pre>
</p><p>
The output of od is a byte-swapped 32-bit integer,
and the output of xxd is a group of four bytes in the
same byte order as they appear in the file. If you're
looking for the string abcd, xxd is the command
for you. But, if you're looking for the 32-bit number
0x64636261, od is the right command.
</p><p>
xxd also knows a few cool tricks that od doesn't, including the ability to format the output in
binary and to translate a binary file
into a C array. Suppose you have a
binary file that you want to encode inside an
array in your C program. One way to do this
is by creating a text file as follows:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ xxd -i foo.bin

unsigned char foo_bin[] = {
  0x61, 0x62, 0x63, 0x64
};

unsigned int foo_bin_len = 4;
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x167c580.0x1b6e5e8"></a>
9. file</h2></div></div><p>
UNIX and Linux have never enforced any policy
of filename extensions. Naming conventions have
evolved, but they are guidelines, not policies.
If you want to name your digital picture
image00.exe, go ahead. Your Linux photo application
gladly accepts the file no matter what the name is, although it may be
hard to remember.
</p><p>
The file command can help when you have to
retrieve a file from a brain-dead Web browser, which
mangles the name&mdash;say a file that should have
been named foo.bar.hello.world.tar.gz comes out as
foo.bar. The file command can help like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ file foo.bar

foo.bar: gzip compressed data,
was "foo.bar.hello.world.tar", from Unix
</pre>
</p><p>
Perhaps you received a distribution with a
bin directory full of dozens of files, some of which
are executables and some are scripts. Suppose you
want to pick out all the shell scripts. Try this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ file /usr/sbin/*  | grep script

/usr/sbin/makewhatis:  a /bin/bash script text
executable

/usr/sbin/xconv.pl:    a /usr/bin/perl script
text executable
</pre>
</p><p>
The file command identifies all the files in the bin
directory, and the grep command filters out everything
not a script.
Here are some more examples:

<pre     class="programlisting">
file core.4867

core.4867: ELF 32-bit LSB core file Intel 80386,
version 1 (SYSV), SVR4-style, from 'abort'

file /boot/initrd-2.4.20-6.img

/boot/initrd-2.4.20-6.img: gzip compressed data,
from Unix, max compression

file -z /boot/initrd-2.4.20-6.img

/boot/initrd-2.4.20-6.img: Linux rev 1.0 ext2
filesystem data (gzip compressed data, from Unix,
max compression)
</pre>
</p><p>
Just as you shouldn't judge a book by its cover,
you shouldn't assume the contents of a file based on
its name.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x167c580.0x1b6e958"></a>
10. objdump</h2></div></div><p>
This is a more advanced tool and is not for the faint
of heart. It's sort of a data-mining
tool for object files. A treasure trove of
information is encoded inside your object code, and this
tool lets you see it.
One useful thing this tool can do is dump
assembly code mixed with source lines, something <tt  >gcc
-S</tt> doesn't do for some reason. Your object code must
be compiled with debug (-g) for this to work:

<pre     class="programlisting">
objdump --demangle --source myobject.o
</pre>
</p><p>
objdump also can help extract binary
data from a core file for postmortem debug when
you don't have access to a debugger. A complete
example is too long for this article, but you need the
virtual address from <tt  >nm</tt> or <tt  >obdump
-t</tt>. Then, you can
dump the file offsets for each virtual address with
<tt  >objdump -x</tt>.
Finally, objdump is able to read from non-ELF file formats that gdb and
other tools can't touch.
</p><p>
This article is not intended as a definitive reference but as a starting
point to help you become more productive. Each one of these commands is
well documented in the Linux man and info pages. Consult them for more
information and more ideas. </p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Resources for this article:</b></span>
