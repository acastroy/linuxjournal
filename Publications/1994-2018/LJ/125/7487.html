They say Glade can make desktop application prototyping a quick and
painless process. To scratch my own itch with XM Satellite Radio on my
PC,
I decided to see exactly how fast and painless.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1414580.0x150c3a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
As American TV slowly sinks into the abyss of fictional reality,
you may find yourself, like me, returning to the roots of electronic
entertainment&mdash;radio. Satellite radio is the latest incarnation of
this medium, offering a wide range of stations accessible from nearly
anywhere you can drive your car.
</p><p>
Because I spend more of my time in front of a
monitor than behind a steering wheel, I was fortunate
to find a PC-based solution for satellite radio.
XMPCR is a USB-connected receiver for the XM Radio
satellite system that is sold primarily for Microsoft
Windows systems. The device is supported under Linux
by the OpenXM Project, a set of Perl scripts that
acts as a network d&aelig;mon for controlling the device.
Unfortunately, the only user interface for the d&aelig;mon
is a limited text-based tool.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1414580.0x150c500"></a>
A Preview of the Project Results</h2></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7487f1.large.jpg"><img src="7487f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. The main window, channels listings and preferences. The second
version shows the minimalist form, with the channel listings hidden.
</p></div></div><p>
Ximba Radio was born as a graphical front end to OpenXM. The application
provides a minimalist main window with current channel information
that can be expanded to show channel listings and user favorites. A button
bar across the top offers easy management of the radio and station
navigation as well as quick access to configuration options. The
menu bar gives users the comfort of a traditional desktop application.
</p><p>
Channel listings are shown in multiple formats. A main channel listing
window shows all channels, and category-specific tabs show related
channels. Separate tabs provide access to user-selectable artist and
channel favorites along with a current session history. Category tabs can be
hidden using the Preferences dialog, which also allows a user to set
performance settings and favorites notices.
</p><p>
On the back side of Ximba Radio is the OpenXM d&aelig;mon. This Perl script and
associated Perl module drive the connection to the USB port. The
d&aelig;mon
reads from a configuration file or can take command-line arguments.
Communication with the d&aelig;mon occurs on a configurable TCP port with a
list of acceptable clients. The d&aelig;mon also can run on Windows systems.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1414580.0x150c870"></a>
Design Goals</h2></div></div><p>
My goals for this application were to match the functionality
of the Windows version, provide a minimalist interface and be simple to
configure. Also, implementation would need to be completed in less than
one man-week (40 hours).
</p><p>
Another goal was to keep the user-interface code as independent of the
application code as possible. Application code should be able to be used
with any suitable user interface, so a good design could have a curses or
Web interface dropped on top with little additional work. This goal is in
line with GNOME development guidelines as well as future plans for Glade.
</p><p>
To meet these goals, I planned to use a single header file and a single C
module. To speed the implementation and solve some time-consuming
problems, I opted to use global variables. Remember, this is a prototype
of a simple desktop application, not an enterprise-ready 24/7 fault-tolerant behemoth. If managed correctly, the use of globals can be removed
with future updates.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1414580.0x150ca28"></a>
Getting Familiar with Glade</h2></div></div><p>
With goals in hand, I started working with Glade to sculpt the user
interface; I cover specific code details in the next section.
I configured Glade to generate C code and took the default settings for
everything else in the Options dialog. Most important here are the source
and header files that hold the user-interface definitions
(interface.c) and the widget callbacks (callbacks.c), along with the option
to generate a main.c file.
</p><p>
Glade generates a complete build environment for building an
application. This includes the source directory (src) and a directory for
image files (pixmaps). Image files used in GtkImage widgets need to
be in .xpm format. Other generated files include autoconf and automake
templates and pot files for internationalized strings.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="7487f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. The Options dialog for Glade allows you to generate code, specify
filenames and choose support for internationalized text.
</p></div></div><p>
Internationalization is optional and handled with GNU gettext support. The
interface.c file, for example, has gettext-enabled strings. Even
with this option enabled, you don't have to create pot files for any
language; Glade simply uses any text strings you provide as the
default language.
</p><p>
I found that prototyping Ximba Radio with Glade required hand-editing only
two of the generated files, main.c and callbacks.c. The former required
only minor additions for initialization options related to configuration
handling for the application. The callbacks.c file was modified mostly to
pass calls to my C module, utils.c.
</p><p>
As I edited my project in Glade and regenerated the C code, the callbacks.c
file was appended with new functions. Fortunately, Glade does a good job
of knowing when a callback already exists and didn't destroy any of my
changes. Unfortunately, it sometimes re-adds an existing function. It was necessary
to pull out those extra functions manually from time to time. When using
libGlade, which processes the Glade XML file directly instead of using
generated C code, this problem does not exist. Discussion of libGlade is
beyond the scope of this article.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1414580.0x150ce48"></a>
UI Design with Glade</h2></div></div><p>
Ximba Radio required two primary windows, the Main Window and the
Preferences Dialog, and a number of secondary pop-up windows. The Main
Window's button bar was created with Glade's toolbar widget, and the
buttons were added to that manually. GTK+ buttons can have text or images.
Glade allows a choice of application images, stock buttons or stock icons.
Stock buttons use the same icons as stock icons except that tooltips are
not available. Because of this, I suggest using stock icons and leaving
the stock button field blank.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7487f3.large.jpg"><img src="7487f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Glade's toolbar widget and the properties used to set icons in
buttons inside a toolbar.
</p></div></div><p>
Each button in the toolbar has a single callback function attached to the
click signal. The callback function can have any name and, if desired, be
passed the name of the widget itself as an argument. For callbacks
attached to click signals, the latter is not necessary. In callbacks
attached to realize signals, which I discuss in a moment, the widget
name is passed to the function.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="7487f4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Buttons in the toolbar have a single callback attached to the
clicked signal.
</p></div></div><p>
I added three GtkImage widgets in the Main Window. The first is a State
icon positioned to the right of the Host name field. I set this to the
Remove icon&mdash;Glade offers many stock icons&mdash;to show no connection to
the d&aelig;mon. To show a connected state I used the Apply icon. In order
to change the icon at runtime, I saved the widget ID of this GtkImage in a
realize callback. During normal use, this icon also can be changed to the
Off stock icon in order to show a connected but muted state. I
examine the code for handling these changes in the next section.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7487f5.large.jpg"><img src="7487f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. The State icon needs a realize callback to get the name of the
widget so we can update it at runtime.
</p></div></div><p>
The Favorites buttons are plus signs. Glade and GTK+ call these Add icons.
These buttons have a single callback attached to their click signal. The
callback adds the current artist or channel to the appropriate list of
favorites. The menu bar at the top of the main window was created using
Glade's built-in Menu Editor. The editor has many options, but for this
project I used only the Label, Name and Handler options, the latter to
define the function to be called when the menu item was selected.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7487f6.large.jpg"><img src="7487f6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. Glade's Menu Editor offers many options, but only Label, Name and
Handler are necessary for our prototype.
</p></div></div><p>
A notebook widget provides access to the
complete channel listings, as well as category, favorite and session-specific listings. All of these are provided through the CList widget.
Glade fully supports this widget even though GTK+ prefers that new code use the
newer and more complex Tree and List widget. I cover this controversial
decision in more detail a little later.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7487f6.large.jpg"><img src="7487f6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 7. Glade fully supports the CList widget, which is preferred over
the Tree and List widget for simple list management.
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1414580.0x150d948"></a>
Coding Process</h2></div></div><p>
Glade generates empty functions for callbacks, often referred to as stub
functions. The stub functions make it possible to follow a simple process
in prototype development: design the UI, generate code, write callbacks,
test and repeat. I left most of the callback coding&mdash;aside from menu quit
functions&mdash;until after the UI was complete. Later, I went back and
filled in the callbacks. This methodology allowed me to experiment with the
layout of the application before having to get involved too deeply with
what that layout actually would do. Again, this is part of the whole goal
of separating user-interface code from application code. By keeping these
two pieces separate, I allow future changes to the UI to happen without serious impact
on the core code. Callbacks are the glue between the UI and the
application code because they map UI events to code that performs some
action.
</p><p>
Callbacks have varying interfaces. Button click signals need callbacks
that take the button widget ID and user data as input arguments. CList
callbacks for the select-row signal, sent when a row is clicked on, get five
arguments. Letting Glade generate them makes it possible to learn these
varying interfaces quickly. In fact, because the API for callbacks is not
well documented&mdash;at least documentation is not easy to find&mdash;letting Glade create these
is the best way to learn callback syntax.
</p><p>
Filling in the callback code can be done directly in callbacks.c, but this
C module will be dropped in the future when I move to libGlade. Instead, I
usually pass parameters straight through to a similar function
in utils.c that does the actual work. Despite this general rule,
one important bit of code was put in callbacks.c: assigning widget IDs
to global variables. Listing 1 shows how a global variable is used in a
callback to save the ID of the Preferences dialog.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1414580.0x150db00"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>

requested,
and the widget ID is saved in a global variable.</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">
void
XRPreferences    (GtkButton       *button,
                  gpointer         user_data)
{

   /* If it hasn't been opened before, create
    * the dialog.
    */

   if ( XR_Preferences_Window == NULL )
   {
      XR_Preferences_Window = create_preferences();
      gtk_widget_realize(XR_Preferences_Window);
   }
   ...
}
</pre></div><p>
Keeping track of individual widgets became necessary for multiple reasons.
First, some icons change dynamically depending on varying states of
the program. Second, many windows are displayed only temporarily
and creating and destroying them is overkill. It's far easier to create
them once and then simply hide and display them as needed. Finally,
Glade-generated CLists need to be updated at runtime. The variables
that hold the widget IDs are scoped only within the interface.c file,
which means functions outside this Glade-generated file can't
make changes easily to those widgets.
</p><p>
To solve this problem I set a realize signal for every widget I need access
to at runtime. Glade lets you specify the name of the variable
to be defined in interface.c. The callback associated with the realize signal
is passed that variable value as the object parameter. In the callback,
the value is saved in a global variable defined in xr.h, the single header
file I created for this project. All globals are scoped using #ifdefs, with #defines specified at the top of the C module, as shown in the two
code snippets of Listings 2 and 3.

#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include "xr.h"
...

</pre></div><p>
One problem with this methodology is defining at what point a widget ID
becomes available. The callback for the realize signal is called
only right before the widget actually becomes visible. Sometimes you need
access to that widget ID before this happens. Fortunately, this is
solved easily. The widget is created in interface.c before the signal handlers are
set up. A signal handler is a function that associates a callback with
some event.
</p><p>
Because of this, the locally named variables all have valid values
by the time a realize signal is configured. It therefore becomes possible to
set multiple callbacks for a single widget, all of which are set to the
realize signal for that widget, which saves the widget IDs of other widgets.
For example, the main window widget for Ximba Radio has realize callbacks
set for it that save the widget IDs of all the predefined CList widgets in
the Channel Listing window; there are four such widgets. This is required
because, initially, those CLists are not visible even after the main window
is made visible, and I need to start updating the lists right away. If I
didn't use the main window to save the widget IDs of the CLists, I
wouldn't be able to start updating them with channel information until
those lists were displayed at least once.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7487f9.large.jpg"><img src="7487f9.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 9. Right before the main window is displayed, the widget IDs of its
CList subwindows are saved in global variables by multiple callbacks.
</p></div></div><p>
Dynamic changes to widgets also require saving the widget ID. One example of
this is the state icon for Ximba Radio. To change the state icon I
needed to use only GTK+ stock icons and save the widget ID of the
Glade-generated GtkImage widget. When the user changes the program
state&mdash;either by disconnecting from the d&aelig;mon or enabling or
disabling the mute&mdash;the state icon is changed easily with a single GTK+ function call, as shown
in Listing 4. The complete set of GTK+ stock icons is listed in the on-line
GTK+ documentation.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1414580.0x19068a8"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>

code:
gtk_image_set_from_stock(GTK_IMAGE(XR_Status_Image),
   GTK_STOCK_APPLY,
   GTK_ICON_SIZE_BUTTON);
</pre></div><p>
The use of global variables is not the only issue experienced developers
might take with my methodology. Another is my choice of using a deprecated
GTK+ widget: the CList, also known as the columned list widget.
Deprecated implies that the widget, while still part of the current
distribution, is no longer being developed actively and may be removed from
the GTK+ distribution in the future.
</p><p>
The current replacement for the CList widget is the Tree and List widget.
Ximba Radio requires list entries to be added and removed dynamically on a
frequent basis. Neither the CList nor the Tree and List widget were
helpful with this requirement. However, because the CList was
designed specifically for handling lists and not expandable trees, I found
it the less complex of the two choices. By definition, prototypes require
getting an application up and running quickly with a standard or typical
interface. CList support in Glade makes this possible without having to
learn the complexities of the Tree and List widget. The trade-off will
come later when I have to deal with the eventual disposition of the CList.
</p><p>
Ximba Radio makes heavy use of lists. All channel, category and favorites
information is kept in columned lists. While the complete channel
listings and the favorites are static lists that never go completely away,
the category lists are dynamic. Users can enable or disable them from the
display, making it easier to find stations based on their own preferences.
To manage the dynamic nature of the category lists, I made use of GLib's doubly
linked list, the GList. Few applications of any complexity can avoid the
use of linked lists, and GLists are extremely easy to use. A
one-way link list option exists, the GSList, but it costs little to have
the two-way links in a GList, and reserving the option to travel in both
directions in a list is worth any extra weight a GList might add.

)
{

}
</pre></div><p>
One other pitfall to avoid comes with testing your application if you use
pixmaps. Ximba Radio uses a logo pixmap in several places. The pixmap
is not found if you run the application from the default src directory
unless you first do a complete build:

<pre     class="programlisting">

./configure --prefix=&lt;install directory&gt;
make
make install

</pre>
</p><p>
This process copies over pixmaps to a pixmap directory under the install
directory prefix. For example, if &lt;install directory&gt; is set to
/usr/local/ximbaradio, the pixmaps are installed in
/usr/local/ximbaradio/share/ximbaradio/pixmaps. Once installed, the
compiled program finds the pixmaps correctly. If the pixmaps are
updated, the make install step needs to be rerun. Switching to
compiled logos&mdash;that is, making them part of the binary so relocation
issues are not relevant&mdash;is possible with modifications to the support.c
file. I've done this for previous applications, but the technique is beyond
the scope of this article.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1414580.0x1906f30"></a>
Final Analysis</h2></div></div><p>
I managed to get the complete application written in approximately 30 hours
of total work. Most of that was spent on core code. UI code was completed in
perhaps ten hours of total work. The application matches the Windows UI in
all major features and the Preferences are easy to manage. The UI code is
independent of the core code, although some
dependency on the callbacks.c file still is present.
</p><p>
Development of Ximba Radio continues. Plans include adding audio
control options and a GStreamer-based reflector. The reflector,
Ximba Radio and OpenXM will combine to allow remote access to PC-based XM
Radio satellite service.
</p><p>
Glade 3 is under development, and it's expected that the code generation
feature will be removed. Because this upcoming release has been long in
development and its release does not appear to be close to the horizon, working with
generated code remains a viable option for Glade-built prototypes for
the near future. That said, prototype development does remain fast and
painless with GTK+ and Glade.
