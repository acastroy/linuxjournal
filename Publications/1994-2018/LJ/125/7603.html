My cat Toby has kept a tight lid on my productivity until recently
by demanding too much attention, but I just discovered a new way to
distract him...he is fascinated by the screensaver of the whales,
which lets me work on my other Linux workstation. Kudos to the creators
of that screensaver.

Ultimate Linux Box Wish List</h4><p>
GNU/Linux has never been about the hardware. GNU/Linux
is about FREEdom. The distro that goes on the ULB,
and what a user can do with that distro, is more
important than the hardware that makes up the box.
An effort should be made to use as much Free Software
as possible and still be able to do all the desirable
things.
</p><p>
At a minimum, the ULB should be able to do all the
i-things that a Mac will do, and do them just as
easily and well. Web video, Flash, radio, etc.,
should be as accessible as with a Mac. It should
do the basic stuff like easy hookup of scanner and
printer, icon mounting and umounting of USB removable
drives and hardware. Really good stereo, and home
theatre (including ripping DVDs and TiVo ability)
seem essential for an Ultimate Box.
</p><p>
And gosh, wouldn't it be nice to be able to handle
personal finance or small business needs, AND be able
to do federal and state taxes? Plus, since Linux is
inherently a server OS, and this box is the ultimate
hardware, it might as well serve half-a-dozen thin
clients so the whole house, or small office, can enjoy
ULB power without the expense of multiple ULB boxes.

Software patents keep free systems from supporting

ones do. But, you'll be happy to know that we used

year.  &mdash;Ed.

C++ Please</h4><p>
I am a new subscriber and I must tell you what an
extreme pleasure it is to receive your magazine. I
also subscribe to two other computer-related magazines
at the present, although <i  >LJ</i> is by far the best of them
all by light-years.
</p><p>
Unlike most publications, you do not talk down to
the readers; rather, you expect them to be beyond
hand-holding to the point where they are actually
willing to try things and experiment! From my
experience with Linux over the past 3&ndash;4 years&mdash;I
didn't know about <i  >LJ</i> until recently&mdash;it is by taking
bits of information I have read and trying things out,
modifying things, simply experimenting.
</p><p>
I went from knowing almost nothing about Linux, except
the name, to being in charge of a small LAN of about
25 computers running SuSE Linux Professional 9 and
Microsoft Windows 2000 Professional, along with a
server and backup server both running SuSE 9 as
well. I have been constantly amazed at how easy
both Linux and Windows clients work together on the
network, much better in fact, than when the network
was entirely Windows-based. Using a Linux server has
also made the network much, much more secure than
was possible using only Windows.
</p><p>
I have noticed that most of your program listings are
in languages like Python, Perl, PHP and C. Could you
do an article or two on C++, perhaps on the changes
that would need to be made to a C program you have
listed to make it compile with g++? Or an introduction
to using g++? I think many readers might be new to
programming and would enjoy a brief introduction
to C++.

Permissions on yum.conf</h4><p>
I enjoyed the article about Yum [<i  >LJ</i>, June 2004]. However, yum.conf
is a read-only file. It would have been very helpful
if Mr Bauer had told how to make the file writable.
I am a newbie to Linux and I need all of the input I
can get on the fine points of any process. Yours is
the first Linux magazine I have purchased.

<br><br>&mdash;<br>  Steve Starr  <br><br>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Mick Bauer replies:</b></span>
I'm sorry you experienced difficulty configuring Yum.
On my Fedora system, /etc/yum.conf has its permissions
set to <tt  >-rw-r--r--</tt>. In other words, it IS writable,
but only by root. Nobody but root has any business
editing much of anything in /etc to begin with,
because it contains system-wide configuration files.
Having said all that, maybe I'm overdue to write an
introductory article on filesystem security. Thanks
for putting the idea into my head!

Thank You for Promoting SPF</h4><p>
This is a brief note of thanks for the amazing
quality of <i  >Linux Journal</i>! I must relate to you
that when the <i  >LJ</i> magazine shows up at my house, all
else stops while I browse and read the first article
of interest. It seems there is always at least one
amazing piece!
</p><p>
I must add that the recent piece on SPF [<i  >LJ</i>, May
2004] is a huge
contribution to the industry at large. I am sure it
will have a major influence for the better on all
of us who are nearly totally dependent on e-mail. I
found it especially helpful in communicating with the
poor souls charged with keeping our network alive.

I love Marcel Gagn&eacute;s articles and I love <i  >Linux Journal</i> and I love the care you take in editing the

It is with a reluctant keyboard, therefore, that I
beg you to fix the French tag in Marcel's column.
It should be <span   class="emphasis"><em>A v&ocirc;tre sant&eacute;</em></span>,
not <span   class="emphasis"><em>A v&ocirc;tre sant&eacute;</em></span>.
<span   class="emphasis"><em>V&ocirc;tre</em></span> is the adjective form;
<span   class="emphasis"><em>v&ocirc;tre</em></span> the pronoun.
As <span   class="emphasis"><em>v&ocirc;tre</em></span> here is modifying <span   class="emphasis"><em>sant&eacute;</em></span>,
it is an adjective. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Mille remerciements</em></span>!

Arkeia User Report</h4><p>
I was a little disappointed with the Arkeia review in the July
2004 issue. Although the perspective of a user new to the product is
certainly valuable, a lot of us are herding systems that will stress
the software a lot harder.
</p><p>
The number one issue for me right now is that if one scheduled backup
job runs long, and the next scheduled job starts, both hang. The
support response is that jobs should be scheduled further apart, but
this fails to address the issue. In any serious system, there will
be occasional overlaps, and the software should cope in some sensible
fashion. Either canceling the second job or holding it until the
hardware resources were available would be better than a hang. Also,
some indication of a problem is not too much to ask.
</p><p>
A related problem is that the software is licensed per server, per
client and per simultaneous data stream. If one has eight machines to
be backed up, and four streams, the software will back up four machines
at a time until all eight are completed. However, a backup job must have
at least one stream assigned to it to stay in queue. Thus, when a
second job starts, even if it cannot run, it steals a stream from
the running backup. If the hang problem ever gets addressed, this
is still potentially troubling.
</p><p>
The database structure used by the server to track files and tapes
is stored in a filesystem directory tree that mirrors the
backed-up data. The software seems to take a significant performance
hit in dealing with large numbers of small directories.
</p><p>
Arkeia strongly recommends that non-ark methods be used to back up
the root filesystem of the backup server and the Arkeia installation
itself.
</p><p>
There are a number of issues with the GUI as well. Mr Wilder
covered some of them, and his comments are well taken. Others nits
include inconsistent placement of buttons with similar actions in
different functions of the GUI, and the fact that the &ldquo;go
back&rdquo;
button is sometimes missing from the function bar (or that in one or
two places, the function bar is missing altogether).
</p><p>
The log browser functionality has two frustrating quirks: in viewing
the full system log, one sees a calendar month at a time. It's not
at first obvious how to change months, which is accomplished by
clicking on the text above the log text box naming the displayed month.
Said text bears no indication that it's <span   class="emphasis"><em>hot</em></span>. It's also practically
guaranteed that one backup per month will be split across two displays.
Perhaps displaying the most recent 30 days or so would be more useful.
</p><p>
It seems that users would be better served by a GUI that wasted less
programming effort on flash, in favor of solid function.

<span   class="bold"><b>Dan Wilder replies:</b></span>
I am curious as to whether you've looked into Amanda, an
open-source backup system we use at <i  >Linux Journal</i>.
I believe it might address some of the difficulties
you mention (<a href="http://www.amanda.org" target="_self">www.amanda.org</a>).
</p><p>
There's no GUI, but as I might have implied in the article,
my personal opinion is that although a GUI might be useful for
selling a backup software package, it is apt to be mostly
a distraction for the accomplished user. Amanda configuration
is performed entirely by editing text files, and backups
are managed from the command line or from cron jobs.
</p><p>
Amanda acts as a scheduler and indexer for dump or tar, so
it'll back up nearly anything UNIX-y in nature. Backups are
centrally managed from a backup server. Amanda will handle
any reasonable number of clients. Environments with
many different processor architectures and OSes are not
a problem.
</p><p>
There is no native client support for Windows operating
systems. SMB shares exported from Windows systems can be
backed up, but some attributes may be lost and backups of
some files can fail due to share violations.
</p><p>
Amanda has a somewhat novel way of managing backups.
You specify the volumes (hosts and their partitions or
directories) to be backed up, along with some other constraints,
and Amanda schedules the backup levels. Total dumped data
volume is balanced from backup run to backup run by mixing
levels for different volumes within a run. You wind up making
much better use of scarce tape space and runtime, than you
could likely do with a fixed schedule of backup levels. When
possible, Amanda advances lower-level volume backups to
exceed your constraints.
</p><p>
Support is provided by a low-traffic mailing list. Although
this support does not offer the almost immediate turnaround
I found with Arkeia, most installation questions raised on
it get addressed, so long as they're really installation
problems and not arguments about the fundamental design
or demands for features nobody is likely to implement.
</p><p>
An FTP-like command-line browser is available for doing
restorations. As with some other backup software, you're
vulnerable if you happen to lose the on-line tape directory.
At this point I am not aware of any reasonable way to rebuild
the index from tapes. On the other hand, it's easy to locate
the index and to make provisions outside of Amanda to keep copies.
Indexes are kept in flat files mirroring the host/volume structure
of the backup schedule, having one line per dumped file
or directory. It is possible this scales better than
the directory-mirroring structure you describe.
</p><p>
Some soft failover provision is made by Amanda's use of
a holding disk for backups, from which they are streamed
to tape. If you provide enough disk storage, an entire
backup run can proceed on schedule even when a tape drive
fails or when somebody neglects to load the expected tapes.
The backup is then flushed to tape after the problem is corrected.
</p><p>
Support for stackers may require some scripting skills,
there's almost no support for backing up to anything except
tapes, and your first Amanda installation can be painful, as
there are lots of ducks that have to be lined up precisely,
so to speak. Multiple drives cannot be configured in sequence,
so that when a drive is full, the backup simply moves on
to the next. Multiple backup runs cannot be written to
a single tape. If two runs to the same tape drive overlap,
the second simply aborts. On the other hand, there are no
license limitations to fret about. Once set up correctly,
about the only thing you'll ever do to Amanda is change tapes,
restore files and sometimes flush a failed dump to fresh tape.

BSD-Influenced Distro: Gentoo</h4><p>
This e-mail is in regards to the letter &ldquo;BSD, Please&rdquo;
in <i  >Linux Journal</i>, July 2004. The reader loves BSD for its ports. I thought that I
would bring up Gentoo Linux (<a href="http://gentoo.org" target="_self">gentoo.org</a>), one of the fastest-growing
distros, whose package management system, Portage, is based largely on
BSD's ports. It is a great source-based distro.
