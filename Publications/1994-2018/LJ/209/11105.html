CoffeeScript is a better way to write JavaScript, but it integrates just
fine with libraries like jQuery.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc74580.0xd6c300"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Last month, I wrote about CoffeeScript, a new, small language that
compiles into JavaScript. CoffeeScript has generated a great deal of
buzz and excitement among Web developers, including no less than
Brendan Eich, Mozilla's CTO and the inventor of JavaScript. Ruby on
Rails 3.1, which presumably will be released by the time this column
sees print, includes CoffeeScript, and other frameworks might follow
suit in the future.
</p><p>
Even if you're not interested in the future of JavaScript or in Ruby
on Rails, you owe it to yourself to look at CoffeeScript. First,
it's a new and interesting language, and I'm definitely a believer in
learning new languages as part of my professional development.
Second, CoffeeScript's syntax makes it easier to do many things that
previously were difficult, long-winded or just plain ugly in
JavaScript. Just as a number of languages have emerged that compile
to the JVM, but that are easier to use in various ways, so too is
CoffeeScript functionality equivalent at the end of the day to
JavaScript, but with an easier syntax that's more appropriate for many
modern applications.
</p><p>
But, perhaps the most interesting part of CoffeeScript is the fact that,
ultimately, it's just another way of writing JavaScript,
which means anything you can do in JavaScript, you also can do in
CoffeeScript. CoffeeScript programs can run on the server, in such
environments as node.js, but they also can run in the browser, working
in conjunction with Web applications. Things become even more
interesting if you use a JavaScript framework, such as jQuery, for
developing Web applications&mdash;you can benefit from the best of both
worlds, enjoying the power and expressiveness of jQuery, along with
the terse and readable syntax of CoffeeScript.
</p><p>
This month, I describe some ways that CoffeeScript and jQuery
can interact in a browser-based program. Even if you don't decide to
adopt CoffeeScript in your own programs, it's worth playing with the
language to get the hang of things.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc74580.0xd6c618"></a>
Starting Off</h2></div></div><p>
I'm going to assume you already have installed CoffeeScript, as
well as any support files, such as a mode for your editor. Create a
bare-bones HTML file, as shown in Listing 1, and a stylesheet
(coffeescript.css), in the same directory, similar to what's shown in
Listing 2. Notice how in the HTML file, I include two JavaScript
files:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;script
src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/
&#8618;1.4.2/jquery.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src="app.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>
</p><p>
The first probably is recognizable as the Google-hosted version of a
minified version of jQuery. But the second file, app.js, is the
target of the CoffeeScript compilation&mdash;that is, you're not going to
write app.js directly. Rather, you're going to write CoffeeScript that
compiles into JavaScript.

Listing 1. coffeescript.html</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;meta http-equiv="content-type" 
 &#8618;content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /&gt;
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" 
 &#8618;href="coffeescript.css" /&gt;
&lt;title&gt;CoffeeScript&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/
&#8618;1.4.2/jquery.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src="app.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Headline&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paragraph 1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paragraph 2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paragraph 3&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc74580.0xd6ca38"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Listing 2. coffeescript.css</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">
p.large {
   font-size: 30px;
}

p.medium {
   font-size: 20px;
}

p.small {
   font-size: 10px;
}
</pre></div><p>
You do this by creating (in the same directory as the HTML file, unless
you want to change the paths in the &lt;script&gt; tag) a CoffeeScript
program, named app.coffee. Just to test things, I created a very
simple CoffeeScript program that uses the standard (and annoying!)
alert dialog to say &ldquo;hello&rdquo;:

<pre     class="programlisting">
alert "hello"
</pre>
</p><p>
Save this file as app.coffee. On the command line, you then want
to tell CoffeeScript to compile app.coffee into app.js. (Otherwise,
it'll try to execute your program, which not only will mean that the
resulting JavaScript isn't available for your Web page, but it also will 
result in an error if you try to access the DOM, which isn't available
outside a browser context.) You can do this with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
coffee --compile app.coffee
</pre>
</p><p>
The problem with this approach is that you need to recompile your
CoffeeScript program every time you change it. A better solution 
probably is to tell CoffeeScript to watch the file and compile it every
time a change is detected:

<pre     class="programlisting">
coffee --compile --watch app.coffee
</pre>
</p><p>
Just after running this, the compiler will run over app.coffee,
producing app.js. When you load your Web page, app.js will run, and
you should have an alert saying &ldquo;hello&rdquo;.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc74580.0xd6cf60"></a>
Functions and Objects</h2></div></div><p>
It's important to remember that although CoffeeScript certainly is a
different syntax from JavaScript, it is fundamentally the same
language. This means any function or object that you can access
from JavaScript can be accessed from CoffeeScript, with the same
name. True, CoffeeScript does offer some shortcuts and syntactic
sugar; those basic JavaScript objects are still around and kicking.
That's why you could invoke the &ldquo;alert&rdquo; function in
app.coffee&mdash;it's not that CoffeeScript has defined a new function, but
rather that
you're using the same built-in JavaScript function.
</p><p>
This means if you load jQuery in the same document as a program
written in CoffeeScript, you can use jQuery from within CoffeeScript.
What does that mean? Well, it means you can access the
jQuery object directly, often abbreviated as $. For example, let's change
app.coffee so that it tells you what version of jQuery you're using,
normally available via <tt  >$().jquery</tt>. You also can do this in
CoffeeScript:

<pre     class="programlisting">
alert $().jquery
</pre>
</p><p>
Let's do something a bit more exciting now, using jQuery's
capabilities for easily changing elements in the DOM based on events
that take place. For example, you can add the &ldquo;large&rdquo; class to all of
the paragraph elements in your document. In JavaScript, you would do
this with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$("p").addClass("large");
</pre>
</p><p>
In CoffeeScript, you can use the same code as above. But, because
CoffeeScript allows you (like in Ruby) to remove most of the
parentheses, you end up with this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$("p").addClass "large"
</pre>
</p><p>
Notice how the original jQuery selector has remained the same, as has
the method you're calling on each of the selected DOM elements. What
has changed is the way you invoke the method; you no longer need to
put parentheses around it.
</p><p>
There is a problem with this though. It will execute
immediately upon being loaded. The problem is that just
because the JavaScript is executing, it doesn't mean the HTML all
has been loaded or rendered onto the screen. Now, you can get around this in
traditional jQuery by putting all of your code inside a call to
<tt  >$(document).ready()</tt>, as in:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$(document).ready(
    function () {

    // Event handlers go here

    }
);
</pre>
</p><p>
You can do the same thing, but in less space (of course) using
CoffeeScript:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$(document).ready -&gt;
  ($ "p").addClass "large"
</pre>
</p><p>
As you can see, CoffeeScript's syntax is cleaner and trimmer, without
nearly as many curly braces and parentheses. You start off with the
same invocation of $ with the &ldquo;document&rdquo; parameter, and then invoke
the &ldquo;ready&rdquo; method on that object. You then need to pass a function to
&ldquo;ready&rdquo;, which you do, by defining a new, anonymous method with
CoffeeScript's <tt  >-&gt;</tt> symbol, cleverly dubbed
&ldquo;dashrocket&rdquo; in the PeepCode
screencast about CoffeeScript.
</p><p>
In other words, you've wrapped your original invocation of
&ldquo;addClass&rdquo;
and friends inside a function that's invoked when the document is
ready. But, you've cut the number of lines of code in half, without
sacrificing readability. Now, let's do something a bit more exciting,
namely change the size each time you click on a paragraph. In order to
do that, you'll need to use one of jQuery's event
handlers&mdash;specifically, you'll use the &ldquo;click&rdquo; handler,
which you set by invoking
a selector, the &ldquo;click&rdquo; method, and then passing the name of a
function. For example, if all you want to do is display an alert
dialog when a paragraph is clicked, you can do it with the following
CoffeeScript:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$(document).ready -&gt;

  changeSize = -&gt;
    alert("changing size!")

  $("p").addClass "large"

  $("p").click changeSize
</pre>
</p><p>
Note how I've defined two functions here: an anonymous function for
<tt  >$(document).ready</tt> and another function to which I give the name
<tt  >changeSize</tt>. But, of course, you want to do something a bit more complex
than display an alert dialog; you want to change the size. When
changeSize is fired, you want to know which paragraph to change. An
event handler always is passed &ldquo;this&rdquo;, an all-too-common word in
JavaScript that confuses many people.
</p><p>
One way to get the sizes to rotate is shown in Listing 3, app.coffee.
Basically, your callback function starts off by assigning a local
variable, &ldquo;text&rdquo;. If this were JavaScript,
&ldquo;text&rdquo; would not be a
local variable, but rather a global one, because you used neither the
&ldquo;var&rdquo; keyword nor another object (for example, myObject.text). In
CoffeeScript, variables are local, which means you cannot
pollute the global namespace accidentally.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc74580.0xd6dcc8"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Listing 3. app.coffee</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">
$(document).ready -&gt;

   changeSize = -&gt;
       text = $(this)

       if text.hasClass "small"
           text.removeClass "small"
           text.addClass "medium"

       else if text.hasClass "medium"
           text.removeClass "medium"
           text.addClass "large"

       else if text.hasClass "large"
           text.removeClass "large"
           text.addClass "small"

       else
           text.addClass "large"

       true

   ($ "p").addClass "large"
   ($ "p").live 'click', changeSize
</pre></div><p>
Listing 3 shows a basic use of if/then/else blocks. Notice there
isn't any need for braces, begin/end statements or other markers.
Python programmers will see this (rightly) as a vindication of
semantically significant whitespace. I just like the fact that
well-indented code is easy to read, and that CoffeeScript enforces
this on me.
</p><p>
You also can see that with rare exception, you've managed to get rid of
the parentheses that JavaScript would require, in favor of terse,
clean syntax. You're still using the same jQuery methods, but you're
doing so in a way that I find easier to read.
</p><p>
You then take the changeSize function and attach it to an event:

<pre     class="programlisting">
($ "p").click changeSize
</pre>
</p><p>
It might look a bit strange to have the parentheses around the call to
<tt  >$ "p"</tt>, which in standard jQuery would look like:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$("p")
</pre>
</p><p>
CoffeeScript tries to get rid of as many parentheses as possible, but
there are times when the ambiguity would makes things too difficult
for its parser. In such circumstances, you can use parentheses to make
things easier.
</p><p>
As you can see from the above example, CoffeeScript makes all of
jQuery's functions available. No matter what you might want to do to
the text or HTML of your document, you can use CoffeeScript to do it&mdash;adding and removing (and querying) nodes, adding and removing (and
querying) attributes, changing text, invoking menus or anything else
you can do in JavaScript. Having jQuery around means you
can make use of its syntax and abstractions, a potentially killer
combination. Indeed, a number of blog postings (including several
mentioned in the Resources section for this article) indicate that the
combination of CoffeeScript and jQuery is a popular and effective one.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
jQuery is a popular framework for client-side Web development,
providing a large number of abstractions and convenience functions for
querying and modifying the DOM. CoffeeScript is a language that makes
it easier to write in JavaScript, by simplifying the syntax, removing
some of the most common problems that people have with the language,
and providing easier ways to work with strings, arrays and hashes.
But at the end of the day, both jQuery and CoffeeScript are tools for
working with JavaScript, which means there's full
interoperability between them. Although the examples in this column are
simple, they demonstrate that it's easy to get started with
CoffeeScript and even to integrate it into an existing application.
My guess is that CoffeeScript has a very bright future and, I
should add, deservedly so.

Resources</b></p><p>
The home page for CoffeeScript, including documentation, quick
references, FAQs and annotated source code, is at
<a href="http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script" target="_self">jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script</a>. There is an active and
growing community of CoffeeScript users, with an IRC channel
(#coffeescript) and Wiki at GitHub.
</p><p>
A good introduction to CoffeeScript is this presentation written by
Jacques Crocker:
<a href="http://coffeescript-seattlejs.heroku.com" target="_self">coffeescript-seattlejs.heroku.com</a>.
</p><p>
PeepCode (<a href="http://peepcode.com" target="_self">peepcode.com</a>), which makes excellent screencasts on
a variety of subjects, has one about CoffeeScript that I
learned from and enjoyed.
</p><p>
There are many blog postings about CoffeeScript and jQuery. Stefan
Buhrmester wrote a nice description of using jQuery with
CoffeeScript:
<a href="http://buhrmi.tumblr.com/post/5371876452/how-coffeescript-makes-jquery-more-fun-than-ever" target="_self">buhrmi.tumblr.com/post/5371876452/how-coffeescript-makes-jquery-more-fun-than-ever</a>.
And, Aaron Russell describes his experience combining CoffeeScript with
jQuery:
<a href="http://aaronrussell.co.uk/articles/using-coffeescript-with-jquery" target="_self">aaronrussell.co.uk/articles/using-coffeescript-with-jquery</a>.
</p><p>
Finally, the Pragmatic Programmers have released (at the time of this writing)
an excellent pre-release &ldquo;beta book&rdquo;, written by active CoffeeScript
user Trevor Burnham. If you're interested in learning more about this
interesting little language, I highly recommend this book. It's
aimed mostly at beginners, but given the limited number of advanced
CoffeeScript programmers out there, that shouldn't bother you.
