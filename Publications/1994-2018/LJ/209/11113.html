What's new and nifty in gawk 4.0, with
a little history and background along the way.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2217580.0x230f250"></a></h2></div></div><p>
GNU Awk (gawk) is one of those programs that has been available &ldquo;since
forever&rdquo;, which many people never think about. But, it's a standard and
important part of just about every GNU/Linux distribution. In fact,
it has been available since even before GCC!
</p><p>
During the past year and a half or so, gawk has undergone a quiet
revolution, culminating in the release of gawk 4.0. Although not yet
released at the time of this writing, work is in progress and moving
forward. By the time you read this article, gawk 4.0 will
be a fact and not just a promising code base in the Git repository.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2217580.0x230f4b8"></a>
A Little History</h2></div></div><p>
The awk language was developed by Al Aho, Peter J. Weinberger and
Brian Kernighan, then at Bell Labs (hence the name A.W.K.). It 
first was released in 1978 with V7 UNIX. It offered the pattern-action
programming paradigm, powerful regular expression matching, associative
arrays, conventional operators and control structures, and a modest
array of built-in numeric and string functions. It was only minimally
documented. (So minimally, in fact, that I remember being terribly
confused after reading the short paper on awk, and deciding to avoid it!)
Nonetheless, the UNIX world accepted it and used it; true UNIX wizards
were comfortable writing even large scripts in it.
</p><p>
Circa 1985, the authors started beefing up the language, adding
user-defined functions, C-compatible operator precedence, more built-in
functions, dynamic regular expressions and a few other minor features.
More important though, they then proceeded to write a book about the
new version of awk (<span   class="emphasis"><em>The AWK Programming Language</em></span>), which was published
in late 1987. This version became available to the world with the UNIX
System V Release 3.2.
</p><p>
I bought the book, figuring that now was my chance to learn awk. It was
(and remains) a great book. Having an interest in programming languages
and an interest in contributing to the world at large, I decided to see
whether the GNU project had a version of awk. Indeed, it did, but it 
implemented only old awk (and poorly, at that). Being single at the time, I
decided to get involved and see if I could work to make gawk compatible
with new awk. (And, thus, the course of history changed, forever.)
</p><p>
As early as 1988, the GNU developers were corresponding with Brian
Kernighan and other awk implementers to make sure that the awk semantics
were consistent across implementations. System V Release 4, in 1989,
brought a few new features for new awk (the <tt  >-v</tt>
option, the <tt  >ENVIRON</tt> array,
the <tt  >tolower()</tt> and <tt  >toupper()</tt> built-in functions) and the first POSIX
standard
(circa 1992) introduced the CONVFMT variable.
</p><p>
Starting in December 1993, Brian Kernighan was able to release the
code to new awk; it continues to be available (see Resources) and sees
minor bug fixes from time to time.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2217580.0x230f8d8"></a>
GNU Awk</h2></div></div><p>
GNU Awk was first written around 1986 by Jay Rubin and Paul Finlason,
with some help from Richard Stallman. It barely implemented the original
awk language, was buggy and not particularly fast. It worked by
building a parse tree representation of the program and then
recursively evaluating the parse tree for each input record.
</p><p>
When I got involved in late 1987, David Trueman already had volunteered
to upgrade it to new awk, and I joined the effort, contributing
code fixes and doing serious work on the documentation. We worked
together until around 1994, when I became the sole maintainer.
</p><p>
Along the way, gawk acquired full compliance with new awk, including
POSIX, and it improved in code quality, speed and new features. Throughout
the course of more than 20 years though, the basic design remained the
same: build the parse tree and recursively evaluate it for each input
record.
</p><p>
In 2003, out of the blue, a gentleman named John Haque contacted me.
He had rewritten the gawk internals to use a byte-code interpreter
and provided an awk-level debugger for awk programs. This was a startling
innovation. I worked with him to get his version to the point where it
was stable and passed the test suite, but I did not integrate his changes,
because they were major, and I wanted to understand them better.
</p><p>
Bad move: John disappeared in early 2004, and the code languished, unused.
Finally, in fall 2009, I got a volunteer (Stephen Davies) to start
bringing the last version of the byte-code gawk that I had into the
present.
He and I had things working, pretty much, and I even announced a test
release
to the world.
</p><p>
Again, out of the blue, John resurfaced in early 2010 and joined
the effort to make the byte-code gawk viable. This moved things into
high gear, and we made a lot of progress. As I write this, the byte-code
version has been merged with my &ldquo;new features&rdquo; branch of the code.
This is the basis for gawk 4.0.
</p><p>
If you don't yet have gawk 4.0, see Resources for information
on where to download the source and how to build it; building from source
is very easy.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2217580.0x230fc48"></a>
New Stuff in gawk 4.0</h2></div></div><p>
With all the background out of the way, let's look at the
cool stuff. Due to space considerations, this is just a quick
tour; see the documentation (listed in Resources) for details.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2217580.0x230fd50"></a>
New Internals</h2></div></div><p>
The most significant new feature is that the gawk internals have been
completely redone. The parser now builds a linked list of
&ldquo;instructions&rdquo;.
Each instruction contains a code indicating what it is and a few members
with
needed information, such as the next instruction and which instruction to
jump to if a jump is needed. This list then is interpreted for each record
by a big switch statement running inside a for loop that traverses the
list.
Data for operations are pushed and popped off a runtime stack.
</p><p>
This implementation performs no worse than the original recursive
evaluator,
and in many cases, it performs better. But what's really cool is that John
added
an awk-level <span   class="emphasis"><em>debugger</em></span>!
</p><p>
Since 1978 when awk was first introduced into the world, the only
debugging tool was the <tt  >print</tt> statement. Now,
gawk has a full debugger, with breakpoints, watchpoints, stepping by
statement or instruction, the ability to step into and out of functions,
and many other features.
</p><p>
The debugger is a separately compiled program named dgawk. It is a
line-oriented debugger modeled after GDB (the GNU Debugger). If you're
familiar with GDB, it will be very easy to learn the gawk debugger. In
addition, the debugger is fully documented in the gawk.texi file in the
gawk distribution.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2217580.0x2310068"></a>
New Language-Level Features</h2></div></div><p>
At the language level, there are several new features.
</p><p>
1. gawk now provides a built-in file inclusion mechanism. Lines that
begin with <tt  >@include</tt> and have a filename in double
quotes cause gawk to include that file, using the same path searching
mechanism as the <tt  >-f</tt> option. Nested includes are supported, and gawk
will not include the same file twice. This effectively obsoletes the
<tt  >igawk</tt> script that has come with gawk for many years.
</p><p>
2. New patterns named <tt  >BEGINFILE</tt> and
<tt  >ENDFILE</tt> provide &ldquo;hooks&rdquo; into
gawk's automatic &ldquo;read a record and process it&rdquo; loop. The action for
<tt  >BEGINFILE</tt> is called before the first record is read from each input
file. Normally, when a file cannot be opened, gawk exits with a fatal
error (such as if you provide a directory on the command line). When a
program has a <tt  >BEGINFILE</tt> pattern, instead, gawk sets
the <tt  >ERRNO</tt> variable
to a string indicating the problem, so that you can tell if the file is
problematic. If it is, use the <tt  >nextfile</tt> keyword to
just skip it. <tt  >ENDFILE</tt>
actions let you do easy per-file cleanup actions.
</p><p>
3. You now can call a function indirectly. By setting a variable to the
name of the function you wish to call and using special syntax, gawk
will &ldquo;indirect&rdquo; through the variable and call the desired function:

<pre     class="programlisting">
function f1(a, b) { .... }
function f2(c, d) { .... }

{ fun = "f1";    @fun(2, 3)    # calls f1()
  fun = "f2";    @fun(4, 5) }  # calls f2()
</pre>
</p><p>
4. gawk now sports true multidimensional arrays! Regular awk simulates
multidimensional arrays (a[x, y]) using string concatenation of the index
values. gawk now provides multidimensional arrays (a[x][y]) but does not
require that arrays be rectangular (as in C or other compiled languages).
Code like this is valid:

<pre     class="programlisting">
a[1] = 1
a[2][1] = 21
</pre>
</p><p>
It is up to the programmer to track the type stored at any given index:
scalar or array. Subarrays can be passed to functions, as long as the
function knows what to expect.
</p><p>
5. The <tt  >switch</tt>/<tt  >case</tt> statement is enabled by default. gawk has had
<tt  >switch</tt>/<tt  >case</tt> for a long time, but it had to be enabled at build time, and
the default was not to do so; now it's enabled automatically.
</p><p>
6. gawk now supports defining fields based on field content, instead
of based on the separators between fields. A new variable,
<tt  >FPAT</tt>, is used.
When you assign a string containing a regular expression to
<tt  >FPAT</tt>, gawk
begins splitting fields such that each field is the text that matched
<tt  >FPAT</tt>. 
(Normal field splitting is based on the text in between fields matching
the regular expression in <tt  >FS</tt>.) This is useful for many kinds of data
where <tt  >FS</tt>-based matching just doesn't work.
</p><p>
The new <tt  >patsplit()</tt> built-in function provides access to this functionality
for strings besides the input record. It is the analogue of awk's regular
<tt  >split()</tt> function. Additionally,
<tt  >patsplit()</tt> lets you capture the text
of the separators between fields.
</p><p>
7. Standard awk provides only one-way pipelines, either to or from another
process. gawk provides a notation for opening a two-way pipeline to a
co-process. gawk uses the same notation with special, internally
recognized
filenames, to provide TCP/IP communication over sockets. This feature has
been available for a long time.
</p><p>
gawk 4.0 enhances the networking by providing explicit filenames to
indicate IPv4 or IPv6 connections. Filenames are of the form
/inet4/<span   class="emphasis"><em>protocol</em></span>/<span   class="emphasis"><em>local-port</em></span>t/<span   class="emphasis"><em>remote-host</em></span>/<span   class="emphasis"><em>remote-port</em></span> or
/inet6/<span   class="emphasis"><em>protocol</em></span>/<span   class="emphasis"><em>local-port</em></span>/<span   class="emphasis"><em>remote-host</em></span>/<span   class="emphasis"><em>remote-port</em></span>. Plain
/inet/<span   class="emphasis"><em>protocol</em></span>/<span   class="emphasis"><em>local-port</em></span>/<span   class="emphasis"><em>remote-host</em></span>/<span   class="emphasis"><em>remote-port</em></span>
is what gawk supplied up to now and continues to be supported: it now
means &ldquo;use the system default&rdquo;. Most likely, this will continue to be
IPv4 for many years.
</p><p>
8. gawk now provides a short (single-letter) option for every long
option that it has. This finally makes it possible to use almost every
feature from a !# script. It does somewhat bloat the manual page. (gawk
has too many options, but that's a different problem; nonetheless, I did
remove a few redundant long options.)
</p><p>
9. Interval expressions now are available by default. An interval
expression is an enhanced regular expression syntax, such as
<tt  >(foo|bar){2,4}</tt>,
which matches anywhere from two to four occurrences of either foo or bar.
The part between the curly braces is the interval expression. POSIX
added them to awk many years ago for compatibility with
<tt  >egrep</tt>'s regular
expressions. But most awks didn't implement them. For historical
compatibility, gawk's default was to disable them, unless running in
POSIX mode. Today, compatibility with POSIX has gained enough importance
for enough users that interval expressions now are available by default.
</p><p>
10. Finally, for this release, the code has been reviewed and cleaned up.
gawk now requires a full C 89 environment to compile and run. It will not
work with K&amp;R compilers or if __STDC__ is defined but less than 1. The
code
for many obsolete and unsupported systems has been removed completely. This
slightly decreases the size of the distribution, but mainly it reduces
useless clutter in the source. The documentation also has been reviewed
and cleaned up.

Source Code Management</h2></div></div><p>
For many years, I was the only one with access to gawk source while
it was being worked on. Circa 2006, I made both the stable and
development versions available via CVS from savannah.gnu.org. This was
a good move; it gave the user community access to all my bug fixes
and to my development code base.
</p><p>
In late 2010, I moved to git. I am expecting greater productivity
from using git and better ease of use for the user community. And,
it's nice to be using 21st-century tools.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2217580.0x2307e48"></a>
Future Work</h2></div></div><p>
Some further interesting development remains to be done.
</p><p>
1. The XMLGawk Project (see Resources) is a fork of gawk based on 3.1.6
that provides better facilities for loading dynamic extensions and
several very interesting extensions to go with those features. These
should be merged into the main gawk code base and distribution,
respectively.
</p><p>
2. Although gawk has had the ability to load extensions dynamically for
many years, the API has not been stable or easy to use. I have designed
an API for C functions that can be called from an awk program that is
considerably better, but I have not implemented it yet. This should be done.
</p><p>
3. Currently, the gawk distribution builds three separate executables:
regular gawk, pgawk (for profiling awk programs) and dgawk for debugging
them. The new internals enable the possibility of making just one
executable that could perform all three functions (based on command-line
options). This should simplify the build process and definitely
will reduce
the total installation &ldquo;footprint&rdquo;.
</p><p>
4. The documentation could use further cleanup. Some of the examples
cause the documentation to show its age. (Who uses dial-up BBS systems
anymore?)
