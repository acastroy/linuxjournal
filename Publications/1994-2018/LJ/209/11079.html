Database stuck in Windows? Take RADical action and try WaveMaker Community
edition.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1035580.0x112d1f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Rapid application development (RAD) is a trendy data-processing idea to
shorten application software development time. In the truest sense, RAD
should include user-friendly development tools and seamless access between
end users and actual development software. Small-business users lust for
software applications that fit this description. Commercial tools, like
Microsoft Access and AlphaSoftware, share great success in the business
community. 
</p><p>
Both of these applications give small-business users and IT departments a
simple way to develop applications for internal use quickly, with little
effort. Usually, a small Web-based application can be created in only a day
or two. Rapid application development combined with a treasure trove of
professionally presented training videos and other learning resources keep
these products in the forefront of technology and embedded in the business
world.
</p><p>
Thus, a product like AlphaSoftware frequently is the cornerstone tool for
small-business users to deploy Web tools for on-the-fly needs. Although some of
these homespun software applications are downright ugly (from an aesthetic
and design standpoint), nonetheless, they are critical business tools. In
fact, their importance is so profound that some small businesses will not
even consider a Linux environment because few tools exist that closely match
the feature set of AlphaSoftware or similar commercial products. 
</p><p>
Certainly, good arguments exist for the robust programming tools Linux
offers. Ruby gains much attention as a powerhouse tool, although Ruby is a
&ldquo;foreign language&rdquo; to most small-business owners. So,
traditional open-source
tools seem to lack the absolute simplicity necessary for acceptance by many
business users. Further, Linux coding tools are largely unfamiliar, which
reduces the pool of people who are able to assist businesses develop new
applications. Alternatively, consider how easy it is to find a local IT guy
who can create an Access database with full form control in only a few days!
</p><p>
Now, WaveMaker provides a strong Linux contender, properly positioned
to battle for the interest of the business user. WaveMaker clearly targets a
user audience with quick Web application development with a minimal learning
curve. The product is available in both a community edition and an enhanced
beta version poised for more commercial situations (<a href="http://wavemaker.com/downloads" target="_self">wavemaker.com/downloads</a>).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1035580.0x112d618"></a>
Meet WaveMaker</h2></div></div><p>
From a marketing perspective, WaveMaker is a robust tool for rapid
application development of Web-based applications. You can peruse the
WaveMaker site (<a href="http://www.wavemaker.com" target="_self">www.wavemaker.com</a>) for complete details
of its
promotional position. From a small-business viewpoint, WaveMaker meets the
needs and requirements for rapid application development, ease of use and the
ability to work across multiple platforms&mdash;including Linux.
</p><p>
The two editions of WaveMaker appear separated by the need to integrate with
mainline applications. WaveMaker's community edition is limited to
single-instance use, while the full edition enables unlimited users and interaction
with commercial databases like Oracle, IBM DB2 or Microsoft SQL Server.
Conversely, the community version supports the use of MySQL, PostgreSQL or
HSQLDB. These two alternatives give small business users enough options
for unique operating environments.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1035580.0x112d7d0"></a>
The Challenge</h2></div></div><p>
WaveMaker seems well suited to compete for Linux business-user interest. A
tough sell, most business owners need a real-life example before they
consider open-source systems. Thus, this article intends to
demonstrate how WaveMaker could migrate a legacy database from the
proprietary software world into the community edition of WaveMaker. This
simple test is only a baseline, but it depicts WaveMaker's potential. In
short, I show how WaveMaker can measure up to the tall demands of the
business world and also re-affirm Linux as a viable choice for daily
operations.
</p><p>
The example test here includes a sample business database originally developed with
AlphaSoftware. The parameters of this test limit the environment to a small
local Web application with only one table. It also demonstrates data export
in a common format (comma-separated or Excel) file and MySQL data import.
Plus, MySQL becomes the platform for the new application development. This
process looks for potential issues that may arise when users cull data from
a commercial application.
</p><p>
In summary, the test steps are as follows:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Prepare the data in a common format.
</p></li><li><p>
Install WaveMaker community edition.
</p></li><li><p>
Use WaveMaker to auto-create a Web form for data entry and update.
</p></li></ol></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1035580.0x112dbf0"></a>
Server and WaveMaker Preparation</h2></div></div><p>
For novice users, WaveMaker's Web site fully describes how to prepare your
operating environment to support the tool. The one key decision point is
whether to use the default HSQLDB database. As part of installation,
WaveMaker includes the components necessary to use HSQLDB. In this test,
let's
use the popular MySQL as the database engine for the application. 
</p><p>
First, let's use a Debian distribution to install MySQL. Let's also use phpMyAdmin
to assist with database creation and data manipulation. If you want to follow
along, check your distribution's instructions to install MySQL and
phpMyAdmin,
and make sure they are running before you continue. Next, download WaveMaker
community edition and follow the installation instructions
here: <a href="http://dev.wavemaker.com/wiki/bin/wmdoc_6.3/Install" target="_self">dev.wavemaker.com/wiki/bin/wmdoc_6.3/Install</a>.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1035580.0x112dda8"></a>
Preparation for the Test</h2></div></div><p>
After installation, let's plan a simple data export process to move into the
new environment. My research discovered that AlphaSoftware includes a nifty
export routine to send the data from its own database to other formats. I
tested the export process with both text and Microsoft Excel formats
successfully. To assist WaveMaker with field generation, I included field
names during export. With the sample data in Excel format, use phpMyAdmin
through the browser at http://localhost/phpmyadmin (or similar) to manage the
MySQL experience.
</p><p>
To minimize errors with data import, a database and table were created
<span   class="emphasis"><em>in advance</em></span>. In Figure 1, a new database
called &ldquo;linuxjournal&rdquo; with a table named &ldquo;sheet&rdquo;
already is in place. Next,
let's use the import tool to populate the new &ldquo;linuxjournal&rdquo; database.
Afterward, examine the database's structure to make sure the
primary key value and index are appropriate for the test environment 
(Figure 2). In this example, I avoided foreign keys to minimize opportunities
for errors. WaveMaker includes functions for database creation; however,
the interface is not as familiar as phpMyAdmin. Further, using WaveMaker to
build your data structure is an advanced topic. Therefore, the simpler
approach is to stay with phpMyAdmin.

WaveMaker Live</h2></div></div><p>
I used Linux Mint (a Debian distribution) for this test. After installing
WaveMaker, the icon for startup did not appear on the desktop or in the
application menu. To work around this problem, navigate to /opt/{wavemaker
sub-directory}/bin/. Then, execute <tt  >./wavemaker.sh</tt>, and observe the new
WaveMaker application presented on your desktop as shown in Figure 3. From here,
press Start to begin the process, and the default browser opens to the
application's home screen (Figure 4).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11079f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. To the point, WaveMaker responds with a minimal window allowing you
to start or stop the application.
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11079f4.large.jpg"><img src="11079f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. At first, WaveMaker gives you the opportunity to create projects,
open existing ones or just work through a tutorial.
</p></div></div><p>
From this point, click Create a New Project, give it a name, and then
WaveMaker drafts the workspace for the application within the browser (Figure
5). This is the primary control center for development.
While the look and feel may seem unfamiliar, WaveMaker reduces training time
through intuitive command labels and software component tree
organization.

</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1035580.0x112ec18"></a>
Establishing Database Connection</h2></div></div><p>
Once WaveMaker is up and running, it must establish database connectivity to
continue. Next, select Services and then Database Services to define
the connection to &ldquo;linuxjournal&rdquo;. Now, WaveMaker needs the right
information to connect to the database (Figure 6). With MySQL, the first step is to
change the initial drop-down list from the default HSQLDB to MySQL. Next, 
input the database userid, password and exact database name in the fields
provided. Click Test Connection at the bottom of the window to ensure
connection. Once successful, select Import to continue the data import
process, and WaveMaker responds with the elements of the MySQL database in a
new window (Figure 7). Stop here and evaluate your structure. It's
important to validate keys and indexes. Also note the field names of your
data to ensure they are listed properly.

</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1035580.0x1527338"></a>
Application Design</h2></div></div><p>
With a predominantly GUI interface, WaveMaker now is ready to create a
Web-based application. A pivotal benefit for the small-business user, this
interface relies on simple drag and drop for many operations. Automatic
processes assist with form creation, data placement and manipulation. Plus,
error correction is quite simple and capitalizes on the familiar Edit and
Undo routine whenever you change your mind!
</p><p>
First, click on Canvas and Palette as shown in Figure 8. The link to the
&ldquo;linuxjournal&rdquo; database previously created now is available in
WaveMaker's tree view.
Now, let's create a simple entry and update application&mdash;in
one step. With the mouse, drag the database onto the blank area of the working
screen. WaveMaker automagically populates the working area of the Canvas
with the sample data from &ldquo;linuxjournal&rdquo;. It's remarkable to watch WaveMaker
create editable (bold) fields for the data on the bottom of the Canvas.
Figure 9 shows the results.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11079f8.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

&ldquo;Sheet&rdquo;)

Figure 9. After drag and drop, WaveMaker creates the list of data on the top
of the screen, and the editable fields are listed below. Red text was added by
the author.
</p></div></div><p>
In essence, data from the MySQL table is displayed on top, and a detail
section (with editable fields) is created below. At the same instant,
WaveMaker creates three buttons for data manipulation: New, Update and Delete
(Figure 10).
The current view displays the skeleton of the application,
complete and test-ready. Select Test from the top window, and a new browser
window with the application displays in test mode. Choose Run, and
WaveMaker saves and then runs the application in a new browser window, as
shown in Figure 11.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11079f10.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

Figure 11. Live Operation of the Sample Data Migration in Less Than 20
Minutes
</p></div></div><p>
Now, work with this mini-program to verify the success of the transition, exit
the application and then re-visit phpMyAdmin to see the elements properly
added, changed and deleted.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1035580.0x1527d30"></a>
Pinch Yourself</h2></div></div><p>
WaveMaker just completed this test migration in approximately 15&ndash;20
minutes! Certainly more complex data migrations will require a concerted
effort to ensure proper foreign keys and precise index setup. Yet, the
viability of this principle is proven for a small application migration. 
</p><p>
In this test, WaveMaker performs quite well. Building the application and
running it on the same machine is a bit sluggish, but this will change
substantially with respect to hardware specifications and overall
configuration.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1035580.0x1527e90"></a>
No Parking!</h2></div></div><p>
This test purposely excluded necessary elements to make many applications
really suitable for business. Nevertheless, adding buttons, screens and tabs
is very straightforward. For example, user login logos and multiple tabbed
displays often are staples of even the most rudimentary business
applications. WaveMaker includes many nicely packaged tools that enable 
users to drag and drop additional features immediately into the live
Palette.
</p><p>
WaveMaker builds these other essential elements with a host of
&ldquo;widgets&rdquo;
along the application's left panel (Figure 12). Users take advantage
of this noncode environment and simply drag and drop new features into the
Palette. For example, a handy calendar (Figure 13) or simple page navigation
(Figure 14) require no direct code. Plus, login security and roles are
handled efficiently in the Services and Security tabs of the
application&mdash;once again, a simple user interface.

The Takeaway</h2></div></div><p>
For business users, WaveMaker excites the potential of open-source
possibilities. In recent years, the strongholds of proprietary operating
systems usually included finance and point of sale. Because few comparable
business-class applications exist, the impetus to move into the open-source
world is sometimes difficult. It's also clear that mainstream business users
may consider Linux when the core applications of their business can be
migrated with ease.
</p><p>
Often overlooked, small database development served as a type of commercial
software lynchpin. Thus, business operators are often locked in the
proprietary realm. As a former AlphaSoftware user, I too see the
impediments to change. Plus, applications like AlphaSoftware give developers
a standardized tool to develop and deploy executable software in addition to
Web applications. This is a market segment not directly marketed by
WaveMaker. As with most software, familiarity of interface and technical
support are all weighty factors in the decision. 
</p><p>
WaveMaker seems like a bold step and immediately gathers the attention of business
users. It is a true competitor to the commercial Web application development
world and deserves attention by the business community. VMware's recently
announced acquisition of WaveMaker (<a href="http://dev.wavemaker.com/blog/2011/03/08/wavemaker-springs-to-vmware" target="_self">dev.wavemaker.com/blog/2011/03/08/wavemaker-springs-to-vmware</a>) gives this application a boost in
recognition and in business users' confidence in its future stability. Go give
WaveMaker a try!
