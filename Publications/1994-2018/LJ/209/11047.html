Introducing Gauger, a lightweight tool for
visualizing performance changes that occur as software evolves.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ee2580.0x1fda408"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Regression testing is a well-established technique to detect both the
introduction of new bugs and the re-introduction of old bugs.
However, most regression tests focus exclusively on correctness while
ignoring performance. For applications with performance requirements,
developers run benchmarks to profile their code in order to determine and
resolve bottlenecks. However, unlike regression tests, benchmarks 
typically are not executed and re-validated for every revision. As a
result, performance regressions sometimes are not detected quickly
enough.
</p><p>
Compared to correctness issues, performance regressions can be harder
to spot. An individual absolute performance score rarely
is meaningful; detecting a performance regression requires relating
measurements to previous results on the same platform. Furthermore,
small changes in external circumstances (for example, other processes
running at the same time) can cause fluctuations in measurements that
then should not be flagged as problematic; this makes it difficult to
set hard thresholds for performance scores. Also, good measurements
often take significantly longer than correctness tests. Performance
improvements in one area may cause regressions in others, causing
system architects sometimes to consider multiple metrics at the same
time. Finally, performance can be platform-specific. This can make
it necessary to perform performance evaluations on a range of systems.
</p><p>
The Gauger package described in this article provides developers with
a simple, free software tool to track system performance over time.
Gauger is lightweight, language-independent and portable. Gauger
collects any number of performance values from multiple hosts and
visualizes their development over time (Figure 1). In
order to use Gauger, developers need to add the necessary
instrumentation to their code to obtain a performance measurement and
then submit it to Gauger with the <tt  >gauger</tt> function call. The
<tt  >gauger</tt> function arguments are the description of the value, a
category, the value itself and a unit of measurement. Gauger's
Web interface then allows visitors to group metrics by category or by
execution host and adjust the visualized revision range or the size
of the plot. Gauger is ready to be used with many programming
languages and revision control systems, and it is easily expandable to
accommodate new ones.

</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11047f1.large.jpg"><img src="11047f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Gauger in action: this screenshot shows performance measurements
obtained and visualized by Gauger for the GNUnet Project over the course of
a few revisions.
</p></div></div><p>
Gauger's Web interface can be used to analyze the collected
performance data in various ways. It can combine different metrics in
a single plot and offers a color-coded guide to help visitors select
only unit-wise compatible metrics. Gauger also allows users to normalize
the data in order to mask differences in absolute performance between
different execution hosts. If multiple measurements were taken for
the same revision, Gauger will show the average and standard deviation
as long as only a single metric is plotted. For larger projects with
many metrics or execution hosts, Gauger offers a search feature to
locate the desired plots. An additional instant search keeps the
menus free of irrelevant items.
</p><p>
Finally, should further fine-tuning be needed (for example, for use in
presentations), Gauger can be used to retrieve the
gnuplot
source of any plot. The generated gnuplot source includes the
plotted data.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ee2580.0x1fdaa38"></a>
Gauger's Architecture</h2></div></div><p>
Gauger uses a traditional client-server architecture, where the
clients report performance measurements to a central server. This
architecture allows machines behind NAT or with otherwise restricted 
Internet access to provide performance measurements to Gauger.
</p><p>
All of the performance-monitoring machines to be used with Gauger should install
the Gauger client, and the software to be tested should be integrated with the
appropriate language bindings. Language bindings are designed to be
transparent and (except for a few extra system calls) have
no negative effects in case the Gauger client is not installed on the machine.
Thus, it is safe to commit the language bindings to a project repository. As
long as the (tiny) language bindings are included, integrating Gauger will not
disrupt operations on systems where the Gauger client is not installed.
</p><p>
The Gauger server runs the data collection and visualization part.
Data is logged through a RESTful API and saved in human-readable
plain-text files. The primary job of the server is to provide a dynamic Web interface
to visualize and analyze the collected data. All the communication
between Gauger clients and the Gauger server is done in standard
HTTP(S) requests so that only port 80 (or 443) needs to be open
(Figure 2).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11047f2.large.jpg"><img src="11047f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Gauger architecture: the Gauger server is responsible for
authentication and receives performance data from the clients.
The results are stored in a simple text format in a local
directory. PHP is used to generate the Web site.
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ee2580.0x1fdae00"></a>
Installation</h2></div></div><p>
Each Gauger client installation requires a local Python (&gt; or = than 2.6)
interpreter. For the Gauger server, a Web server installation with
PHP and gnuplot is required.
</p><p>
The provided install.sh script can be used to install the
client, install the server code into an appropriate location and
generate an updated Apache configuration. The script prompts for key
configuration options, such as the installation path and the desired
URL at which the Gauger server should run. Installations that
do not use Apache currently require manually configuring the Web server. 
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ee2580.0x1fdaf60"></a>
Configuration</h2></div></div><p>
Each part of Gauger uses a simple configuration file. The Gauger
client configuration file contains the remote server URL, followed by
the user name and password. Here's a sample configuration:

<pre     class="programlisting">
https://gnunet.org/gauger/ username password
</pre>
</p><p>
The Gauger server configuration file
contains the directory where data and authentication
information are stored. Listing 1 shows a sample server configuration.
When the auto-add feature is enabled,
new hosts can be added by logging in to the Web site using a fresh 
hostname and password.

Integrating Gauger</h2></div></div><p>
Adding a single simple call at the places where performance
measurements are obtained typically is all that's required to
integrate Gauger with existing projects. This call then starts the
Gauger client process, which, if installed and configured correctly,
submits the performance measurement to the server. On systems where
the Gauger client is not installed, the call fails silently so as not to
disrupt normal operations in any way. The syntax of the Gauger
client command-line tool is as follows:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ gauger [-i ID] -c CATEGORY -n NAME \
 -u UNIT -d DATA
</pre>
</p><p>
Here, <tt  >NAME</tt> is the name of the metric, and
<tt  >DATA</tt>
is any floating-point value that represents the performance measurement.
<tt  >UNIT</tt> is a string that describes the unit of the value, for
example, ms/request. <tt  >CATEGORY</tt> is a string used to group multiple
performance metrics by subsystem. We recommend using the name of
the subsystem or module here, especially for larger projects.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ee2580.0x1fdb698"></a>
Revision Numbers</h2></div></div><p>
Gauger can autodetect the current revision of the project if the
benchmark is executed in a directory that was checked out from a
supported Version Control System (VCS). The supported VCSes are Subversion,
Git, hg, bazaar, monotone and
GNU arch. For distributed VCSes that do not provide an ascending
revision numbering system (like Git), Gauger uses the number of
commits to the repository. In this case, all execution hosts used for
benchmarking should use the same origin to keep the data
consistent. If the project uses an unsupported VCS or if the benchmark
is executed outside the tree, Gauger needs to know which (revision)
number to use for the <span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span>-axis. The <tt  >--id
ID</tt> option is used to
supply the revision number in this case. Some projects may want to
use an internal version number or a timestamp instead of a revision
number generated by their VCS. The only restriction imposed on the
numbers used is that Gauger's regression monitoring assumes a linear
progression of development. For projects with multiple branches under
active development, different Gauger servers should be set up for each
branch.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ee2580.0x1fdb850"></a>
Language Bindings</h2></div></div><p>
Gauger ships with bindings for various languages (see, for example,
Listings 2, 3, 4 and 5) to make integration easy. The resulting
binaries do <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> depend on a Gauger client installation on the target
system. The bindings should be integrated with the main project
and, as mentioned before, simply do nothing when invoked if the Gauger
client is not installed or not configured properly.

The JavaScript binding is unusual. Because JavaScript cannot access the
local filesystem to read the configuration file, the login data must
be stored in a cookie in advance. The login page on the Gauger
Web site, which usually is used to set up new accounts for execution
hosts, can be used to set the respective login cookie in the
browser. Access to the source code's repository also is not possible
from JavaScript, so the revision number must be supplied explicitly to
the <tt  >GAUGER</tt> call. Typically, the current revision number is
obtained on the server side. For example, PHP code can be used to
obtain the number from the VCS, or on-commit trigger functions provided
by the VCS could be used to insert the number into the source code.

Selecting Proper Units</h2></div></div><p>
Gauger provides developers complete freedom with respect to the
names, values and units of the performance metrics to be
monitored.
So, how do you choose a good unit? Naturally, part of the unit 
always is dictated by the kind of performance characteristic you are
interested in&mdash;for example, execution time (seconds) or space
consumption (bytes). However, generally it's a good idea always
to relate this basic unit to the amount of work performed as part of the
unit given to Gauger.
</p><p>
For example, suppose a benchmark measures the execution time for 100
GET requests. In this case, it is better to choose a name &ldquo;GET
request performance&rdquo; with unit &ldquo;requests/second&rdquo; (and log the
execution time divided by 100) instead of the name &ldquo;Time for 100 GET
requests&rdquo; with unit &ldquo;seconds&rdquo;. The reason for this is
it's quite
possible the benchmark will be adjusted in the future&mdash;for example, to run
1,000 GET requests. If performance is logged as
&ldquo;requests/second&rdquo;,
such a change would then not require any changes to the name of the
tracked metric. As a result, the performance regression analysis
can continue to track the metric in the same curve.
</p><p>
Additionally, Gauger allows different results to be compared by adding new
metrics to existing plots. If the new metric uses the same unit as the
old one, they will use the same <span   class="emphasis"><em>y</em></span>-axis; otherwise, the new one will be
plotted against a second <span   class="emphasis"><em>y</em></span>-axis on the right side of the plot. This
limits the number of units per plot to two. We recommend using 
the same units where applicable (for example, no mixing of
&ldquo;seconds&rdquo;
and &ldquo;milliseconds&rdquo;) to make comparative analysis easier.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ee2580.0x1fd30b0"></a>
Related Projects</h2></div></div><p>
Gauger does not include for support for actually automatically running
the benchmarks on various systems. However, this is not a drawback,
because an excellent tool for that purpose exists in the form of
Buildbot. Buildbot typically is used for regression testing and, hence, is
by itself not suitable for identifying performance
regressions. Nevertheless, Buildbot requires a similar network
setup&mdash;that is, clients that run the tests connect to a public server. This makes
it trivial to combine a Buildbot setup with Gauger. Buildbot is used
to execute regression and performance tests, and Gauger visualizes
the development of performance metrics over time.
</p><p>
Another tool for monitoring performance is Munin. Like Gauger, Munin
allows users to specify which performance measurements should be
created. In contrast to Gauger where execution hosts push data to the
server, the Munin server periodically pulls all participating systems
for a performance score. As a result, NATed systems are not easily
supported. Also, because Munin stores the data indexed by time and not
revision number, and given that software performance may differ widely
between different platforms, not all systems may have performance
scores ready at fixed time intervals. Although Munin is not a good fit
for performance regression analysis for developers, it likely is a
better fit for system administrators who need to monitor system
performance.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Gauger offers a lightweight and language-independent approach for
integrating performance regression testing with existing development
processes for projects using a wide range of version control
systems. With Gauger, performance regressions are detected
early, providing users with software that finally is 
improving consistently in both correctness and performance.
