    When we were first kicking around the idea of <i  >Linux Journal</i>,
    we decided that a survey posted to the comp.os.linux news
    group on Usenet would be the best way to find areas of
    interest. In April, 1993 we posted that survey to the
    Internet and tabulated the answers.

same survey to Ascent in December, 1993. The letters column comes
from answers to question two of the survey, &ldquo;Are there any other
topics you would like to see covered?&rdquo; The table below shows
average responses to question one of the survey.</p><p>Survey question 1 answers:</p><p>Rate your interest in the following features:</p><p>(1=not interested, 2=possible interest, 3=interested, 4=very
interested, 5=that's my subject!)</p><p>Based on the results of this survey, we have tailored the
content of <i  >LJ</i> and will continue to tailor it based on reader
feedback.</p><p>With regard to advertising (question 3), about 90% of those
who responded supported the policy. People who felt we should let
anyone advertise outnumbered those who felt that having advertising
was a mistake. Many of the readers felt that advertising would help
them locate new products and saw that as an advantage.</p><p>Virtually everyone who returned the survey said they would
like to subscribe and about 10% offered to write articles. Interest
in advertising was lower (about 3%), but that was to be expected.
We thank you all for your support.</p><p>When we first started getting subscribers, about 85% were
from the United States. Survey results were running more like 65%
from the US. We then made an offer of free copies of <i  >LJ</i> for user
groups to give out to their members and, the response was about 50%
non-US.</p><p>Our conclusion was that our higher non-US subscription rate
was the problem. So, we negotiated with international distributors
and now offer the same subscription rate ($19/year) anywhere on the
planet. We expect this change will get our subscriber base more in
line with the survey results.</p><p><a href="2752l1.html" target="_self"><i  >Linux Journal</i> Survey
