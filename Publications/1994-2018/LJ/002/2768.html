    Despite all evidence to the contrary, people just happen to
    love rules. They love being told what to do&mdash;&ldquo;leadership&rdquo;
    is seen as a virtue. Whatever happened to personal liberty?
    How can we reconcile freedom with control?
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb7f580.0xc771e8"></a></h2></div></div><p>All right, maybe this isn't the best way
to expound my crackpot political views, but this ethical question
is a good way to present the specific case of Linux.
</p><p>I'm no political scientist, but it seems fairly obvious that
almost any group of people working together needs leadership of
some kind. More often than not, that leadership comes from a single
person&mdash;that person makes the &ldquo;final&rdquo; decisions, no matter how
intertwined the chain of command appears to be. Sometimes you have
organizations that are relatively flat, where everyone is on equal
ground&mdash;yet, invariably, there is a leader somewhere in the pack.
More frequently you find conglomerates that are arranged in a thick
mesh of hierarchy, more complex than any ISO standard. In such
cases there are many leaders, each at different levels of the
proverbial ladder. (Those readers who tuned in last month will
remember this being discussed in some detail.)</p><p>But let's not repeat ourselves. Compared to most other
organizations, the Linux community is as flat as a cracker (or
nuttier than a fruitcake, depending on how you look at it). How
could a system as complex, muddled, and technically fragile as a
Unix kernel emerge from this hoi polloi? Good question.</p><p>The funny thing is, a Unix kernel did emerge, like it or not.
Unfortunately, more and more people are starting to realize that
Linux got where it is today without a central organization, without
any kind of development hierarchy, without any rules or defined
structure --without any thousand-page-long standards documents. And
-this is the kicker&mdash;without a single penny of profit to back it
all up. It's enough to gray a capitalist's hair.</p><p>Am I contradicting myself? Didn't I say that Linux did have
some kind of organizational hierarchy? Well, that point is still in
dispute. There are certainly no rules or defining factors which
force the community to organize in any way. The software is freely
distributable. If John Doe wanted, John Doe could start his own
development effort, completely detached from, but based on, Linux.
What's stopping people from doing just this?</p><p>The fact is that the Linux development hierarchy, if there is
one, is a contribution-based organization, as discussed last month.
A technocracy, if you will. But the primary drive is not control,
or fame, and it sure isn't money. The thrust behind the whole thing
is the desire to hack. Yes, there are many people in the &ldquo;Linux
community&rdquo; who don't share these motivations&mdash;specifically, those
who are aiding the project by selling the software commercially.
But that has its place as well&mdash;would Linux be where it is today
without some kind of commercial support? Probably not.</p><p>Of course, that statement depends on how you define &ldquo;where
Linux is today&rdquo;. Many members of the development community would
not consider commercial success to be one of the goals of Linux.
Although it has the nice side-effect of increasing the distribution
and the installed user base, that's not what Linux is about,
fundamentally. Creating a free Unix system shouldn't require
commercial success in order to be widely distributed; that's a kind
of oxymoron.</p><p>Nevertheless, people are beginning to observe that Linux is
successful (however you define the term) without any kind of
conventional development structure. So, they think, &ldquo;Shouldn't
Linux development be organized centrally?&rdquo; The lack of central
support is seen as some kind of misfeature of the system: something
that Linux should have, but doesn't. It is automatically assumed
that applying a robust and well-tested hierarchy&mdash;beefing up the
chain of command, as it were&mdash;will make things work better. Hey, it
works for Microsoft, why can't it work for us?</p><p>In recent months, a number of proposals have come forward in
an attempt to centralize the Linux development community. In fact,
I supported one of these proposals&mdash;it does seem that Linux would
benefit from the formation of an organization, somewhat similar to
the Free Software Foundation, that would act as an entity to take
credit for the software. This organization could own the
copyrights, sell the T-shirts, and take the blame&mdash;making the legal
issues surrounding the marketing and development of the system
slightly less messy.</p><p>However, it has become quite clear that this kind of
structure would be completely foreign to the concept of Linux, as
it stands today, as well as to the developers who have brought it
this far. Linus and others don't want to deal with logistics&mdash;they
just want to hack. It takes enough time and energy to program and
debug Linux as it is; the last thing that they need to deal with is
more administrivia. Some fear that the avoidance of hierarchy may
limit Linux in some way&mdash;that in order to really hit a home run in
the software world, we will need to pay more attention to meta
development. If that's the case, so be it. Linux doesn't need to
debunk Microsoft or IBM in order to win with hackers. We're not
here to obsolesce Windows NT. Although it is a fun thing to think
about.</p><p>If nothing else, Linux is about doing things in a new way.
(All right, so why are we implementing Unix? Another good
question.) Capitalism and commercialism are alive and well, and
honestly don't need any help from the Linux community. The approach
that the Linux development is taking is a new&mdash;or perhaps a very
old-fashioned&mdash;one, in which technical excellence is valued over
market return. Now, everyone admits that Linux has various
technical problems, but who says that Linux should berated by the
same standards as commercial Unix implementations? I'd rather work
with a system that is constantly undergoing development than a
large commercial Unix package that I don't even have the source
code for. The point of Linux is to develop it&mdash;there is no specific
&ldquo;final goal&rdquo; where development will come to a standstill.</p><p>Linux is hard proof that there are alternatives to the
corporate and economic systems that make the world go `round. Even
so, who's to say? In five years, or maybe a month, the Linux
community could fall apart, providing a textbook example of &ldquo;what
not to do&rdquo; for future generations of software developers to
heed.</p><p>Many of the primary Linux developers aren't very interested
in regrouping themselves into a more structured clan.
Unfortunately, this leaves open the possibility of some third party
stepping in, forming such a group, and claiming to be the official
sponsor of Linux. &ldquo;Official&rdquo; by whose mandate? I claim that the
only group with the power to claim any kind of officialdom when it
comes to Linux is the developers themselves -the ones responsible
for bringing us the software in the first place. Happily, nothing
of the sort has happened so far. Yet, the clock ticks ever onward:
because the developers have been too shy to step forward and claim
their title as the official arbiters of operating-systems heraldry,
some impostor may attempt to seize the prize instead.</p><p>The bottom line is that the Linux development cabal should do
what's necessary to protect their own right to the software which
they have produced. The GNU General Public License does this by
requiring the software to be explicitly copyrighted by the author.
However, it seems that much of the credit for Linux has been
implicitly defined&mdash;it's not immediately clear who's responsible
for what. (When asked, I imagine, most of the developers would
point in either direction and say, &ldquo;It's their fault!&rdquo;) In order to
clear up the copyright fog, a compendium of credits for the
development effort is currently being produced. Another way of
achieving the same goal would be to form some kind of abstract
entity calling itself &ldquo;The Linux Development Organization&rdquo;.</p><p>This organization may not do anything differently than what
is done today. In fact, it could be virtually substance-free: &ldquo;The
set of all Linux hackers&rdquo; without a rigid definition of the set's
members (excepting, of course, the man who started it all&mdash;for
Linus Torvalds, there's no backing out now.) Either that, or
someone could sell inexpensive memberships to the foundation which
would go to support Linux and free software in general.</p><p>Such a group would give the Linux development effort the
appearance of congelation&mdash;as if it really had its act together.
Such a group would give the rest of the world someone to point
to&mdash;either in admiration or in scorn.</p><p>But some of us just like the sound of &ldquo;The Linux
Foundation&rdquo;.</p></div></div>
