    In part 1, Brokken and Kubat explained where the ideas for
    icmake came from, the basics of the program and where you can
    get a copy. In Part 2 we cover the grammar of icmake source
    files. The final part of this article will appear next month
    and will show examples of the use of icmake.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e8a580.0x1f82450"></a>4. The grammar of icmake source files</h2></div></div><p>Icmake source files are written according to a well-defined
syntax, closely resembling the syntax of the C programming
language. This is no coincidence. Since the C programming language
is so central in the Unix operating system, we assumed that many
people using the Unix operating system are familiar with this
language. Providing a new tool which is founded on this familiar
programming language relieves everybody of the burden of learning
yet another dialect, thus simplifying the use of the new system and
allowing its new users to concentrate on its possibilities rather
than on its grammatical form.</p><p>Considering icmake's specific function, we have incorporated
a lot of familiar constructs from C into icmake: most C operators
were implemented in icmake, as were some of the standard C runtime
functions. In this respect icmake's grammar is a subset of the C
programming language. However, we have taken the liberty of
defining two datatypes not normally found in C. There is a datatype
`string' (yes, its variables contain strings) and a datatype
`list', containing lists of strings. We believe these extensions to
the C programming language are so minor that just this paragraph
would probably suffice for their definition. However, they will be
described in somewhat greater detail in the following sections.
Also, some elements of C++ are found in icmake's grammar: some
icmake-functions have been overloaded; they do different but
comparable tasks depending on the types of arguments they are
called with. Again, we believe this to be a minor departure from
the `pure C' grammar, and think this practice is very much in line
with C++'s philosophy.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e8a580.0x1f825b0"></a>4.1. Comment and preprocessor
directives.</h2></div></div><p>One of the tasks of the preprocessor is to strip the makefile
of comment. Icmake recognizes two types of comment: standard C-like
comment and end-of-line comment, which is also recognized by the
Gnu C compiler and by Microsoft's C compiler.</p><p>Standard comment must be preceded by /* and must be closed by
*/. This type of comment may stretch over more than one line.
End-of-line comment is preceded by // and ends when a new line
starts.</p><p>Lines which start with #! are skipped by the preprocessor.
This feature is included to allow the use of executable makefiles.
Apart from the #! directive, icmake recognizes two more
preprocessor directives: #include and #define. All preprocessor
directives start with a `#'-character which must be located at the
first column of a line in the makefile.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e8a580.0x1f82768"></a>4.1.1 The <b  >#include</b>
directive.</h2></div></div><p>The <b  >#include</b> directive must obey the
following syntax:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#include "filename"
</pre><p>or:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#include &lt;filename&gt;
</pre><p>When the preprocessor icm-pp encounters this directive,
`filename' is read. The filename may include a path specification.
When the filename is surrounded by double quotes, icm-pp attempts
to access this file exactly as stated. When the filename is
enclosed by &lt; and &gt;, icm-pp attempts to access this file
relative to the directory pointed to by the environment variable
IM. Using the <b  >#include</b> directive, large icmake
scripts may be modularized, or a set of standard icmake source
scripts may be used to realize a particular icmake script.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e8a580.0x1f82ad8"></a>4.1.2. The <b  >#define</b>
directive.</h2></div></div><p>The <b  >#define</b> directive is a means of
incorporating constants in a makefile. The directive follows the
following syntax:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#define identifier redefinition-of-identifier
</pre><p>The defined name (the name of the defined constant) must be
an identifier according to the C programming language: the first
character must be an underscore or a character of the alphabet;
subsequent characters may be underscores or alphanumerics.</p><p>The redefinition part of the <span   class="emphasis"><em>#define</em></span>
directive consists of spaces, numbers, or whatever is appropriate.
The preprocessor simply replaces all occurrences of the defined
constant following the <span   class="emphasis"><em>#define</em></span> directive by
the redefinition part. Note that redefinition's are not further
expanded; an already defined name which occurs in the redefinition
part is not processed but is left as-is.</p><p>Also note that icm-pp considers the redefinition part to be
all characters found on a line beyond the defined constant. This
would also include comment, if found on the line. Consequently, it
is normally not a good idea to use comment-to-end-of-line on lines
containing #define directives.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e8a580.0x1f82ea0"></a>4.2. Constants, types and variables</h2></div></div><p>Constants may be used in the makefile to indicate a number or
a string. Int constants are denoted by numeric characters; e.g., 13
is an int constant. A second way to denote an int constant is by
enclosing a character in single quotes. The numeric value of the
constant is then the ascii number of the character, e.g., the
constant `A' has the value 65. The character between quotes may not
be `escaped', such as `\n'. Only single characters are allowed in
this notation of integer constants.</p><p>String constants are denoted by text between double quote
marks, e.g., &ldquo;a string&rdquo; is a piece of text.</p><p>Icmake recognizes four types: int, string, list and void. The
types serve the following purposes:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>int: The type `int' is used to represent numerical
16-bit signed values.</p></li><li><p>string: The type `string' is used to represent
strings, like the strings used in C.</p></li><li><p>list: The type `list' is used for variables and
return values of functions consisting of lists of strings. There
are no list-constants. Instead, lists always have to be built
run-time.</p></li><li><p>void: The type `void' is used only with functions,
to indicate that these functions do not return values.</p></li></ul></div><p>The types int, string and list are also used for defining
variables and arguments. Icmake allows global variables and local
variables. The declaration of a variable or an argument must state
the type of the variable; a counter variable would be an int, while
a variable containing the names of all files having extension `.c'
would be a list.</p><p>Some of the built-in functions of icmake (see the section
about icmake's functions) return a value of one of the types int,
string or list. The returned value may be assigned to a variable of
the same type or may be passed to another function.</p><p>Similarly to built-in functions, user-defined functions are
assumed to return a value which is either int, string or list. The
int type is the default. Functions may be defined as not returning
a value. Such functions have the `void' returntype.</p><p>The definition of variables follows a C-like syntax.
Arguments are defined as in ansi-C. An illustration of the use of
types is found in the following listing. Note the use of the
constants 55 and &ldquo;main.c&rdquo; (a string constant).</p><pre     class="programlisting">
string myfun (int x, string y, list z)  // a
user-defined function
{       // of type string, having 3
      int       // parameters
          counter,      // local variables: 2 ints, i;    // 1 string
          and 1 list
      string
          name;
      list
          cfiles;
      counter = 55;     // counter is set to 55 name = "main.c";  //
      name is set to string main.c return (name);    // a string is
      returned to the
  }     // caller
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e8a580.0x1f83528"></a>4.3. Strings and escape sequences</h2></div></div><p>Strings in makefiles are used to represent both filenames and
displayed text. Icmake allows a number of special formatting
sequences in strings to facilitate the display of text. These
sequences are called, in analogy to the C programming language,
escape sequences. Icmake recognizes the following escape sequences:
Escape sequence Action</p><pre     class="programlisting">
\a      alert (bell)
\b      backspace character
\f      formfeed character
\n      newline
\r      carriage return character
                tab
\v      vertical tab
\-other-        literal -other-, e.g., \\
</pre><p>Escape sequences in strings are identified by a backslash
character \ followed by a character which identifies the escape
sequence. Like C, Icmake allows string-concatenation. Long strings,
extending over several lines of text, can be built by separating
string constants by white-space characters (blanks, tabs,
newlines).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e8a580.0x1f836e0"></a>4.4. The code of a makefile</h2></div></div><p>This section discusses the user-defined functions which may
appear in a makefile and also defines other syntactical
constructs.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e8a580.0x1f837e8"></a>4.4.1. Flow control statements</h2></div></div><p>Icmake recognizes six control statements:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><b  >if</b> statements, including
<b  >if-else</b></p></li><li><p><b  >while</b> statements</p></li><li><p><b  >for</b> statements</p></li><li><p><b  >return</b> statements</p></li><li><p><b  >break</b> statements</p></li><li><p><b  >exit</b> statements</p></li></ul></div><p>The <b  >exit()</b> statement, though a function in
C, is part of the icmake language. The exit statement may be given
an expression yielding an int. If an int expression follows, its
value is returned as an int to the operating system. Otherwise, the
returned value is undefined. The other flow control statements are
analogous to the corresponding ones in the C programming
language.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e8a580.0x1f7a910"></a>4.4.2. User-defined functions.</h2></div></div><p>Icmake allows the construction of user-defined functions in a
makefile. The definition of a function must follow an ansi-C-like
syntax, however, minor differences exist between an icmake function
and a C function. These differences are highlighted in this
section.</p><p>The definition of a function must follow the syntax:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Optionally, the return type of the function is
specified. The type is void, int, string or list. The default
return type is int.
</p><p>When a function explicitly returns using a return statement,
the returned value must match the return type. If a function does
not use a returns statement, an undefined value is returned.
Functions which are defined as void can also use the return
statement, albeit without an expression.</p></li><li><p>Following the optional return type, the function
name must follow. The name must be an identifier, i.e., the first
character must be an underscore or a character of the alphabet, and
optional following characters may be underscores or
alphanumerics.</p></li><li><p>Following the function name, a ( is
expected.</p></li><li><p>A parameter list may follow, consisting of
parameter specifications separated by , (this is referred to as an
ansi-C parameter list). Parameter specifications consist of the
parameter type (int, string or list) and the parameter name (an
identifier).
</p><p>In contrast to C, icmake does not allow user-defined
functions to have a variable number of parameters.</p></li><li><p>Following the optional parameter list, a ) is
expected.</p></li><li><p>Next, the code of the function is expected:
statements enclosed by { and }.</p></li><li><p>Following the first { of the code block, local
variables may be defined. The definition of local variables
consists of the variable type, one or more variable names separated
by commas, and a semicolon.</p></li></ol></div><p>In contrast to C, local variables can only be defined
immediately after the outer curly brace of the function code block.
Variables cannot be defined within a block of statements.</p><p>In contrast to C, icmake initializes all local variables to
zero.</p><p>Icmake does not allow forward references. This means that a
function may be called only after it has been defined. Recursive
function calls are accepted. Furthermore, the statement which calls
a function must supply the exact number of required arguments and
each argument type must match the parameter list of the function.
The built-in functions are predefined and may therefore be used
anywhere within functions.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e8a580.0x1f7b150"></a>4.4.3. The user-defined function
<b  >main()</b></h2></div></div><p>The code section of a makefile must contain at least one
user-defined function, called <b  >main()</b>. The
execution of a makefile starts at this function. The run-time
support system of icmake provides three arguments which the
function <b  >main()</b> may use. The arguments are used
to hold the command line parameters of the icmake invocation and
the environment setting.</p><p>The three arguments are most commonly referred to as argc,
argv and envp. Argc is an int argument, holding the number of
command line parameters. Argv is a list, holding the command line
parameters themselves. Envp is a list holding the environment
setting. A definition of the main() function which uses all
arguments argc, argv and envp is given below:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
int main(int argc, list argv, list envp)
        {
            // statement(s)
        }
</pre><p>Users may wish to define the <b  >main()</b>
function without arguments when the command line parameters need
not be examined. In this case, the <b  >main()</b>
function can be defined as:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
int main
{
//statements(s)
}
</pre><p>It is also possible to define the <b  >main()</b>
function to use only the first or the first two arguments (argc and
argv). A sample makefile which prints its command line arguments is
given below. The functions <b  >printf()</b> and
<b  >element()</b> used in this example are discussed in
the function-section below:</p><p>The arguments passed to <b  >main()</b> functions
as the list argv are:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
void main (int argc, list argv)
   {
       int
           i;
       for (i = 0; i &lt; argc; i++)
           printf ("Argument ", i, " is ", element (i, argv), "\n");
   }
</pre><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>The name of the binary makefile which is
interpreted by icm-exec. This is always the first argument.</p></li><li><p>Remaining arguments are those arguments which were
explicitly supplied on the command line.</p></li></ol></div><p>For example, to supply the arguments one, two and three to a
makefile called try.im, one of the following invocations can be
used:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
        icmake test - one two three
                or:
        icmake -i test.im one two three
</pre><p>In both cases, the first int argument of the function
<b  >main()</b> will have the value four. The first
element of the list argv holds the name of the binary makefile
(test.bim); the remaining elements of argv hold the arguments one,
two and three.</p><p>The third argument of <b  >main()</b>, envp, is a
list holding the setting of the environment (the environment
variables). An example of such a variable is PATH, specifying where
the operating system searches for executable files. The envp list
consists of pairs of elements, where each first element of the pair
holds the variable name (e.g., the string PATH) and where the
second element of each pair holds the value of the variable (e.g.,
a list of directories where executable files may be found).</p><p>An example of a makefile which prints the settings of
environment variables is given below:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
void main (int argc, list argv, list envp)
        {
            int
                i;
            for (i = 0; i &lt; sizeof (envp); i += 2)
                printf ("variable ", element (i, envp), " has value ",
                       element (i + 1, envp));
        }
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e8a580.0x1f7bc50"></a>4.4.4. Expressions and operators</h2></div></div><p>Icmake allows a large number of operators to form or combine
expressions. Binary operators may be used with the following
operand-types:</p><p><a href="2767f1.jpg" target="_self">operand-types</a></p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Each binary operator must be used with two
variables or constants of the same type, e.g., the addition of an
int and a string is not allowed; icmake performs no default type
casting.</p></li><li><p>Some operators may not be used with some types,
e.g., string subtraction is not allowed, but string addition
is.</p></li><li><p>The operators have a certain priority; some
operators are evaluated before others. The priority of operators is
identical to the priority used by C.</p></li></ol></div><p>The binary operators recognized by icmake are summarized in
the following table:</p><p><a href="2767f2.jpg" target="_self">binary operators</a></p><p>All binary operators with the exception of the assignment
operators are left-associative. The assignment operators are
right-associative. The operators at the top of the table have the
lowest priority; those at the bottom have the highest priority.
Operators with different priority are separated by lines.</p><p>The unary operators are summarized in the following table.
The unary operators have higher priority than binary operators and
are right-associative. The exception is the expression-nesting
operator, which surrounds an expression and does not
associate.</p><p><a href="2767f3.jpg" target="_self">unary operators</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e8a580.0x1f7c2d8"></a>4.4.4.1. Logical operators</h2></div></div><p>Icmake recognizes three logical operators: the logical and
(&amp;&amp;), the logical or (||) and the logical not (!). These
operators can be used to combine or reverse logical
expressions.</p><p>The logical not operator reverses the logical outcome of an
expression. The logical and operator and the logical or operator
group conditions. Icmake evaluates a combined condition using these
operators until the outcome of the condition is determined, in
analogy to C:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>In the condition (c1 &amp;&amp; c2), c2 is not
evaluated if c1 yields zero, since when c1 yields zero the combined
condition can only fail. Therefore, c2 is evaluated only if c1
yields not zero.</p></li><li><p>In the condition (c1 || c2), c2 is not evaluated if
c1 yields not zero, since when c1 yields not zero the combined
condition can only succeed. Therefore, c2 is only evaluated if c1
yields zero.</p></li></ol></div><p>Logical operators may be used with any type of expression. An
int constant or variable yields its integer representation. A
string constant or variable yields not zero when the length of the
string is non-zero; e.g., string &ldquo;a&rdquo; yields not zero.</p><p>A list or variable yields not zero when the number of strings
in the list is not zero, e.g., in the following code fragment the
making process is stopped when no files with extension &ldquo;.c&rdquo; are
found:</p><p><a href="2767f4.jpg" target="_self">list</a></p><p>to be continued...</p><p>Look for part 3 of 4 of the IC Make Article in the next issue
