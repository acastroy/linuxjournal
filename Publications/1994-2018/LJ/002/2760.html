developing GUI applications and hypermedia documents on Unix/X11
workstations. Rather than expensive and complex applications
development environments which require extensive programming with a
third generation language, MetaCard offers the ability to create
and modify applications using interactive tools and a simple
scripting language.</p><p>MetaCard can also be used to prepare on-line help and
training packages. The multiple-card metaphor and hypertext-linking
capability makes it a natural for producing on-line reference
manuals. As an example, the complete documentation for the MetaCard
environment itself is available on-line in MetaCard stacks.</p><p>MetaCard 1.3 is available on 14 different platforms including
Linux. Single user licenses (for any platform) are $495 and come
with unlimited e-mail technical support. To receive a free
save-disabled but licensable copy of MetaCard, e-mail to
<a href="mailto:info@metacard.com">info@metacard.com</a> or
call (303) 447-3936. You can also download the current engines,
documentation and an unlicensed Home stack from ftp.metacard.com,
directory MetaCard or from ftp.uu.net, directory vendor/MetaCard on
the Internet.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1203580.0x12fb710"></a>Book: Linux: From PC to Workstation</h2></div></div><p>by Stefan Strobel and Thomas Uhl</p><p>Linux, a relatively new free Unix system for PCs, has emerged
as a viable alternative to commercial Unix systems. It turns a
386/486-PC into a Unix workstation with performance characteristics
comparable to a RISC workstation. The book by Thomas Uhl and Stefan
Strobel introduces the concepts and features of Linux. Moreover, it
describes the features and services of the Internet which have been
instrumental in the rapid development and wide distribution of
Linux. Finally, the book gives an overview of the wide range of
applications that are available for Linux.</p><p>With Linux, a system has become available to the computing
community that stands in the tradition and spirit of Unix (from the
forward by J. Gulbins).</p><p>ISBN 3-540-57383-6 Springer Heidelberg</p><p>Note that this book is written in German. Anyone want to

of FinSim for the Linux platform.</p><p>FinSim: A high performance, compiled and interpreted
simulation environment that supports both UDL/I and Verilog HDL.
The FinSim UDL/I simulator features full language implementation.
The FinSim Verilog simulator features full Verilog HDL
implementation including gate, switch-level, user defined
primitives, behavior, specify blocks, path delays, system tasks and
functions, PLI, and VCD. SDF capabilities will be released March 1,
1994.</p><p>FinSim is part of Intergraph's recently announced Veribest
Design System. The FinSim simulator is tightly integrated with Data
I/O's ECS schematic capture system, allowing fast schematic
simulation and back annotation of simulation results. The FinSim
Verilog simulator is compatible with all VCD-based waveform
displays including Veritools' Undertow IV, Design Acceleration's
Signalscan and Systems Science's Magellan.</p><p>With the FinSim Verilog simulator, behavior level designs
currently run up to 50 times faster than Verilog-XL v1.6. FinSim's
performance at gate and switch level is fast and runs existing
benchmarks.</p><p>Currently FinSim runs on Sun Sparc, Digital MIPS, IBM RS/6000
and SGI MIPS workstations. It is also available on Intel x86
platforms running Windows NT, SVR4.2, interactive Unix 3.2 or
Linux. It will soon be available on Digital Alpha, Pentium and
Hewlett-Packard platforms.</p><p>FinSim prices for a Unix workstation range from $15,000 to
$25,000, including free upgrades to SDF. FinSim's list price for a
PC platform is two thirds of the price of FinSim for a Unix
workstation.</p><p>Fintronic USA, Inc., 1360 Willow Rd., Suite 205, Menlo Park,
