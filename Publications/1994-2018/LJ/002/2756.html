    The recent release of the Linux FSSTND (short for
    &ldquo;filesystem standard&rdquo;) promises to bring Linux developers
    together into a more cohesive group.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24a0580.0x25983a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>The purpose of this standard is to
document an improved and consistent filesystem (directory and file)
structure for Linux systems.
</p><p>The first round of discussion on creating a filesystem
standard started in August 1993 on the Linux Mail-Net (based at
niksula.hut.fi), and from that we were gifted with &ldquo;FSSTND&rdquo; (an odd
attempt at an acronym), the Mail-Net channel where most of our
early discussion took place. From that period came a mountain of
debate, many unanswered questions, and uncertainty about how a
standard could have any meaning or effect in the loose-knit Linux
community.</p><p>By the summer of 1993, it was clear that the Linux community
was lagging behind the rest of the UNIX world in its organization
of directories and files. Not only that, but every developer in the
Linux community had implemented the filesystem differently. Finding
any kind of concordance between the various Linux distributions was
a sobering task. The task of assembling the parts of a system from
various sources that would work together was difficult.</p><p>FSSTND is based on ideas from SVR4, 4.3BSD, 4.4BSD, SunOS 4,
HP-UX, and many other UNIX systems, some of which had been used by
various Linux developers. However, it does not follow any single
operating system layout in entirety. Instead the filesystem
standard attempts to take the best of each filesystem layout and
combine them into a homogeneous whole that is well suited to the
needs of Linux users everywhere.</p><p>After a preliminary draft had been written, many of our
uncertainties were dispelled. It turned that some Linux developers
were starting to become aware of issues we were trying to solve. In
September, the Debian distribution's developers began to wonder
about the same things which we had wondered about months before. We
offered them our solution and they began to implement our results.
Other distributions soon followed suit (although perhaps not so
quickly). Today, Debian, Slackware, TAMU, Linux/PRO, LILO, Rik
Faith's util-linux package, and future versions of other major
distributions are all trying to follow the first version of the
FSSTND.</p><p>What does this mean to you as a Linux user? Nobody expects or
even wants you to recompile every binary on your system just to
conform to FSSTND. The brunt of any changeover work is already
being done by Linux developers. This standard should benefit users
by making conforming distributions more similar where they need to
be: files. Simple as it sounds, remember that UNIX systems are
primarily based on files. When the entire hierarchy of files does
not work together, the entire system can suffer.</p><p>If you are a developer and you want to know what the FSSTND
means for you, get a copy of the current draft. The only way we can
hope to gain momentum in this cooperative Linux effort is through
developers. Besides the benefits I have already outlines, others
include making general documentation less difficult, system
administration more consistent on different systems, and the
development of second and third party packages easier. If
distribution A and distribution B both closely follow FSSTND and
your package also conforms, it is a good bet that your application
will integrate easily into a system based on either
distribution.</p><p>Look for a major update to the first version sometime in
March or April. Some important issues have only been resolved in
the days since the public release. The draft is available through
anonymous FTP at tsx-11.mit.edu in the
directory/pub/linux/docs/linux-standards/fsstnd.</p></div></div>
