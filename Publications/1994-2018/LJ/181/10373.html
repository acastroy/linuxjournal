Got lots of 8mm film but no projector? Would you like to see those 30-year-old home movies your parents made when you were a kid one more
time? Here's how a Linux system can be used to convert 8mm film to
DVD movies.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xfe3580.0x10db358"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Media Conversions, my business, converts videotape and slides to DVD.
My customers often ask if I also can convert 8mm film. This is
the story of my adventure into converting film to DVD. There are a
number of ways to make a conversion. You can run the film through a projector
and use a video camera to capture the images. Although, finding a working projector
is difficult. Belts and rubber drive components dry up. Worse,
30-year-old rolls of film, some with splices, may no longer stand up to
the stress of being projected at 18 frames/second (f/s). Plus, most
video cameras run at 30f/s and will not synchronize with the projector.
</p><p>
Telecines have been used since the early days of broadcast TV
to convert film to video. A number of Web sites describe
DIY Telecine projects (see Resources). Generally, they either rebuild
a projector and use a still camera, or they utilize a flatbed scanner
and a custom film transport. Based on my research, I decided to build a
Telecine using a flatbed scanner. The cost of entry is low, and scanners
running at 3,000dpi or above are a commodity item. You can get started
on the conversion software without the film transport, and you don't need
custom optics. The downside, if you're not a programmer, is that you
have to write all of your own software.
</p><p>
I decided early in the project that I wanted to use only open-source
software tools. I hosted it on an Ubuntu Linux desktop system. I knew I
would need a programming language with support for scanning, serial (or
parallel) port communication, a math library and an image library. A
plotting and drawing library also would be helpful during program
development. I also wanted a language that offered ease of programming
in higher-level constructs. I was familiar with C, but did not want to
use it for this project, so instead, I decided to use Python. Python is
easy to learn, it's well supported by the Linux community in both
on-line forums and with numerous examples of code, and error handling and
type checking/conversion are part of the language.
Plus, the Python Imaging Library includes an interface to SANE for
scanner support.
</p><p>
I acquired an Epson Perfection 3490 photo scanner for the project.
It has SANE drivers, a built-in backlight for film scanning and offers
3,200dpi resolution.
</p><p>
There are four steps to converting a roll of film: scan the film in segments,
find the image frames in the segments, remove duplicate frames where
the segments overlap and make a movie from the frames. I wrote three
separate Python programs for the first three steps and used FFmpeg for
the fourth. The software relies on cheap disk space. Frame files are
copied from segment scans. Overlap removal makes a second, renumbered,
copy of all of the frame files. This strategy allows each of those
programs to be rerun with the same segment scans for debugging and
program development. 
</p><p>
The cost, for a 50-foot roll of film, is approximately
8GB of space for the segment scans and similar amounts of space for the
log file (if debug is turned on) and each of the frame file sets. Files
are written into subdirectories of the current directory and numbered
sequentially. A root filename, given as a command-line argument, is
used as a prefix. Scan data is written into the scans directory, and frame
files are written to the frames directory. If logging is turned on, log
files are written to the logs. If debug is left on (default setting),
marked up copies of the scan files also are written to the logs. The
markings show where the edges of the sprocket holes were found and the
outline of the frame extracted. Finally, overlap-removed, renumbered
frames are written to the movie directory.
</p><p>
The program for scanning film simply calls the SANE scanner interface,
saves the scan data, advances the film and repeats for a count given as
an argument on the command line. See the Film Transport sidebar for a description. You can do a project like this without a film transport,
but it's tedious. Each scan takes about 80 seconds. Limits on the size
of the backlight meant that I could use only about 7.7 inches out of
the approximately 8.5 inches of scanner width. Allowing for overlap between the
scans, a 50-foot roll of film will have about 90 scan segments and takes
roughly two hours to scan. 
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xfe3580.0x10db778"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Film Transport</b></p><p>
There are two parts to this project. One involves the software that
processes the scanned film and makes a movie. The other part is the design
of a film transport. The film transport is the harder part of the project,
because it involves creating one-of-a-kind hardware. My transport design is
based on reel-to-reel tape recorders popular in the 1960s (Figure a).
It feeds film from a supply reel, across the scanner and winds it up on
a take-up reel. A pair of spring-loaded idlers maintains film tension. A
sprocket drive advances the film.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10373fI.large.jpg"><img src="10373fI.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure a. 8mm Film Transport&mdash;Photo by Frank Pirz
</p></div></div><p>
The film transport is controlled by an embedded microprocessor. It takes
commands from the Linux system over a serial port, and controls supply and
take-up reel rotation and a sprocket motor for advancing the film. I was
able to find both a program development and device programming environment
as well as a C compiler for the Microchip PIC series of microprocessors
all running under Linux. See Resources for the list of software
tools used in this project.
</p></div><p>
To simplify the software, I made a film guide
out of 10mm thick clear plastic film. I first aligned a steel ruler
with the scanner axis, and I used GIMP to examine scans of the ruler edge. I
moved it between scans until it was aligned to within approximately 50
pixels with the grid in GIMP. At 3,200dpi, 50 pixels is about 0.015
inches and more than adequate for this application. Then, I placed a
piece of plastic against the ruler and glued it down with CyanoAcrylate
glue. Once the glue was dry, I removed the ruler and used a piece of 8mm
leader as a spacer to glue down a second guide. A sheet of glass placed
over the guides keeps the film being scanned in alignment. With the film
aligned with the scanner, no corrections for skewed images are necessary.
</p><p>
The program for finding frames actually is looking for sprocket
holes. It's substituting software registration for mechanical registration
of the film. Figure 1 shows a short piece of scanned film. The left-hand
side is the original scan, and the right-hand side is the same scan
converted to black and white (B&amp;W). 
</p><p>
Before we look for sprocket holes, we
first find the top edge of the film. Given the alignment of the film
in the guides, we could skip this step, but at this point, I'd rather
not. The location of the top edge and knowing whether it's Regular8 or
Super8 film (see the A Short History of 8mm Film sidebar), tells us approximately where
the centerline of the sprocket holes will be. 
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xfe3580.0x10dbca0"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
A Short History of 8mm Film</b></p><p>
The 8mm film format was developed by Eastman Kodak and released on the
market in 1932 to create a home movie format that was less expensive
than 16mm. The film spools actually contained 16mm film, which was
exposed only along half its width. When the film reached its end, the
camera
was opened, and the spools in the camera were flipped. The same film was
exposed along the side of the film left unexposed on the first loading.
During processing, the film was split down the middle. This fit four times
as many frames in the same amount of 16mm film. In 1965, Super8 film was
released. It featured a bigger image area, resulting in a better quality
image. It also moved the location of the sprocket hole and
changed the hole size. Naturally, having two standards (see Resources)
complicates both the software and hardware for an 8mm Telecine.
</p></div><p>
The next step is to find
the first sprocket hole. Because we are searching in a B&amp;W image, we use a
simplified correlation method. The search is done on a vertical line that
spans the centerline we just found. If we find a white line, we add
its value in to the correlation for that point. Black lines add zero. We
have to look only at points inside the correlation window. Outside the
window, the correlation value is zero. The process is sometimes called
xor correlation, because addition replaces multiplication. The peak of
the correlation function marks the edge of the sprocket hole. 
</p><p>
With the
edges of the first sprocket hole located, we know approximately where the
centerline of the next sprocket hole should be. Simple line searches
left and right from that centerline are used to find the next set of
sprocket hole edges. The search ends at the last sprocket hole in the
segment. Once we have found the left and right edges, we search up and
down to locate the top and bottom edges. The film in Figure 1 shows the
sprocket hole and frame markup after scanning.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10373f1.large.jpg"><img src="10373f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div><p>
If everything were that simple, we would be done. Naturally, it's not. The
film segment in Figure 2 illustrates two problems. First, Kodak
edge-marks its film. It says &ldquo;safety film&rdquo;. Second, the image is not
restricted to the frame area and has overlapped into the sprocket hole.
Parts of the top and bottom edges of the sprocket hole have vanished in the
B&amp;W image. This will cause an edge-detection failure. There is a variety
of heuristic methods to treat edge-detection failures. For left or right
edge failures, I substitute the expected location based on the approximate
sprocket center and the standard for the sprocket hole width. For top or
bottom failures, my choice is to post-process the table of edges. When I
find a missing edge or a run of missing edges, I average the edge values
on either side of the gap and use the average as the location of the
missing edge. It's important not to have abrupt changes in the sprocket
hole locations, as this leads to visible jitter in the movie
image.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10373f2.large.jpg"><img src="10373f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div><p>
Once all of the sprocket holes are found, the image frames are written
to separate files in the frames subdirectory. The sprocket hole edge
locations are written out to the log file. Although I have not yet needed to
do so, at some point, I expect to encounter a film segment where I cannot
locate all the sprocket hole edges. Heuristic methods will take you
only so far. It will be easier to use GIMP to find the elusive sprocket
hole edges and edit the log file table with the correct coordinates. A
modified version of the frame finding program could read in the corrected
log file table and use that data to generate the image frames.
</p><p>
The images in the first movie I converted would get brighter and then get
dimmer with a cycle of about 2&ndash;3 seconds. It was very visible and made
the movie unusable. I'm scanning 45&ndash;46 image frames in each segment
of film. At 18f/s, that's about 2.5 seconds of film. I'm using the film
backlight removed from the cover of the scanner. It's a cold cathode
fluorescent lamp with a white plastic diffuser in front of it. It was
intended to backlight 35mm slides. It turns out that its light output is
not uniform from end to end. Like most fluorescent lamps, it's slightly
dimmer at the ends. Projector manufacturers go to significant lengths
to make sure that the film is uniformly illuminated. See the link in
Resources
on K&ouml;hler
Illuminators for more details. Replacing the lamp with a longer one
didn't fix the problem. 
</p><p>
An e-mail conversation with Richard J. Kinch led
me to put illumination compensation into the software. I scanned a piece
of neutral density film. Don't have any available? I didn't either. I
cheated. I cut up a gray anti-static storage bag into strips. Two layers
of the plastic film brought the resulting image into the middle of the
gray scale. Then, I divided the scan into segments and sampled the image
at the center of each segment. Not surprisingly, there was about a 30%
variation from each end to the center. As the individual frame files
are written out, a location-dependent compensation value is applied.
This eliminated the illumination variation from the movie.
</p><p>
The final step is to remove the duplicate images where the scan segments
overlap. The amount of overlap depends on how far you advance the film
between scans. For this Telecine design, we have traded frame-accurate
mechanical registration for software registration. We are not trying
to be precise with the film advance. Typical scan segments overlap by
two or more frames. The method for detecting a match between frames is
called correlation. If two image files are identical, their correlation
will be 1.0. If they differ, it will be less than 1.0. In practice,
image frames of the same image scanned at either end of the scanner
do not match precisely. The program for removing duplicates copies and
renumbers frames to the end of the current segment. It matches the
next-to-last frame of the current segment with the first five frames of the
next segment. The frame with the highest correlation is the matching
frame. The next segment becomes the current segment, and frame copying
and renumbering begins with the frame after the best match. The process
ends when there is no next segment.
</p><p>
At this point, we have converted the movie. It's just not in a format that
is very usable. Some video editing software is capable of importing
a sequence of image files and then writing out a movie file. Many do
not. However, we are not really interested in editing the movie. We
want to convert it and give it back to the customer. Using an editing
program would be cumbersome. Instead, we use FFmpeg to read in the
image frames and create a movie file in a format that's ready to burn
on a DVD. A sample command line looks like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ffmpeg -r 18 -i movie/sam.%4d.tiff \
            -target ntsc-dvd -aspect 4:3 sam.mpg
</pre>
</p><p>
Briefly:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
<tt  >-r 18</tt> tells FFmpeg that the input file is at 18
frames/second.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >-i movie/sam.%4d.tiff</tt> implies the input files are
named sam.0001.tiff, sam.002.tiff and so on.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >-target ntsc-dvd -aspect 4:3</tt> uses FFmpeg presets to create
an .mpg movie file suitable for burning to DVD.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >sam.mpg</tt> is the generated movie file.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Consult the on-line documentation and the
reference cited in the Resources section for more information. At this
point, our job is done. A variety of Linux tools is available for
authoring DVDs and burning DVD disks. Both are beyond the scope of
this article.
</p><p>
This project demonstrates that customized, relatively sophisticated,
image processing can be handled easily with Linux-based tools. It also
describes embedded hardware development in a Linux environment. This
project is continuing to evolve. Sprocket hole edges can be checked for
abrupt changes. Once the frame files are extracted, there are opportunities
for additional improvements. I have experimented with the ImageMagick
toolset to sharpen the images and remove dust specks. The Python programs
for image processing as well as the C code and other engineering documents
for the film transport are both available from the <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>
