gipfel&mdash;Mountain Viewer/Locater
(<a href="http://www.ecademix.com/JohannesHofmann/gipfel.html" target="_self">www.ecademix.com/JohannesHofmann/gipfel.html</a>)</h2></div></div><p>
This is definitely one of the most original and niche projects I've come
across&mdash;and those two qualities are almost bound to get projects
included
in this section! gipfel has a unique application for mountain images
and plotting. According to the Web site:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
gipfel helps to find the names of mountains or points of interest on
a picture. It uses a database containing names and GPS data. With the
given viewpoint (the point from which the picture was taken) and two
known mountains on the picture, gipfel can compute all parameters needed
to compute the positions of other mountains on the picture. gipfel can
also generate (stitch) panorama images.
</p></blockquote></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10420f1.large.jpg"><img src="10420f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
gipfel provides some amazing
geological information when you
position just two mountains.
</p></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Installation</b></span>
</p><p>
A source tarball is available on the Web site, and trawling around the
Net, I found a package from the ancient wonderland of Debian. But, the
package is just as old and beardy as its parent OS. Installing gipfel's
source is a pretty basic process, so I went with the tarball. Once the
contents are extracted and you have a terminal open in the new directory,
it needs only the usual:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ./configure
$ make
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2381580.0x24797d0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
And, as sudo or root:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# make install
</pre>
</p><p>
However, like most niche projects, it does have a number of slightly
obscure requirements that probably aren't installed on your system
(the configure script will inform you). The Web site gives the
following requirements:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
UNIX-like system (for example, Linux, *BSD)
</p></li><li><p>
fltk-1.1
</p></li><li><p>
gsl (GNU Scientific Library)
</p></li><li><p>
libtiff
</p></li></ul></div><p>
I found I needed to install fltk-1.1-dev and libgsl0-dev to get past
<tt  >./configure</tt> (you probably need the -dev package for libtiff installed
too, but I already had that installed from a previous project). Once
compilation has finished and the install script has done its thing,
you can start the program with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ gipfel
</pre>
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Usage</b></span>
</p><p>
Once you're inside, the first thing you'll need to do is load a picture
of mountains (and a word of warning, it only accepts .jpg files, so
convert whatever you have if it isn't already a .jpg). Once the image
is loaded, you either can choose a viewpoint from a predefined set of
locations, such as Everest Base Camp and so on, or enter the coordinates
manually. However, I couldn't wrap my head around the interface for
manual entry, and as Johannes Hofmann says on his own page:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
...gipfel also can be used to play around with the parameters
manually. But be warned: it is pretty difficult to find the right
parameters for a given picture manually. You can think of gipfel as a
georeferencing software for arbitrary images (not only satellite images
or maps).
</p></blockquote></div><p>
As a result, Johannes recommends the Web site
<a href="http://www.alpin-koordinaten.de" target="_self">www.alpin-koordinaten.de</a> as a great place for getting GPS
locations, but bear in mind that the site is in German, <span   class="emphasis"><em>und mein Deutsch
ist nicht so gut</em></span>, so you may need to run a Web translator.
</p><p>
If you're lucky enough to get a range of reference points appearing on
your image, you can start to manipulate where they land on your
picture according to perspective, as overwhelming chance dictates that
the other mountain peaks won't line up immediately and, therefore, will
require tweaking.
</p><p>
If you look at the controls, such as the compass bearing, focal length,
tilt and so on, these will start to move the reference points around
while still connecting them as a body of points. Provided you have the
right coordinates for your point of view, the reference points should
line up, along with information on all the other peaks with it (which
is really what the project is for in the first place).
</p><p>
gipfel also has an image stitching mode, which allows you to
generate panoramic images from multiple images that have been referenced
with gipfel. As my attempts with gipfel didn't turn out so well,
I include a shot of Johannes' stunning results achieved from Lempersberg to
Zugspitze in the Bavarian Alps, as well as one of the epic panoramic shots
as shown on the Web site. Although this project is still a bit unwieldy,
it is still in development, and you have to hand it to gipfel, it is
certainly original.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10420f2.large.jpg"><img src="10420f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Also included in gipfel is the ability to stitch several images together
for amazing panoramic shots like this.

<span   class="emphasis"><em>Widelands</em></span>&mdash;Real-Time Strategy
(<a href="http://xoops.widelands.org" target="_self">xoops.widelands.org</a>)</h2></div></div><p>
I covered this game only briefly in the Projects
at a Glance section in last month's issue, so I'm taking a closer look at it this
month. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Widelands</em></span> is a real-time strategy (RTS) game
built on the SDL
libraries and is inspired by <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Settlers</em></span> games from
the early and mid-1990s. <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Settlers I</em></span> and
<span   class="emphasis"><em>II</em></span> games were made in a time when the RTS genre
was still in its relative infancy, so they had different gameplay ideals
from their hyperspeed cousins, where a single map could take up to 50
hours of gameplay.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10420f3.large.jpg"><img src="10420f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
<span  class="emphasis"><em>Widelands'</em></span> main emphasis is on base building and how you build it.
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10420f4.large.jpg"><img src="10420f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
<span  class="emphasis"><em>Widelands</em></span> also has a lot of different settings and stories available to
keep things interesting.
</p></div></div><p>
Thankfully, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Widelands</em></span> has retained this ideal, where
frantic &ldquo;tank-rush&rdquo;
tactics do not apply. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Widelands</em></span> takes a much slower pace, with an emphasis
not on combat, but on building your home base. And, although the interface
is initially hard to penetrate, it does lend itself to more advanced
elements of base building, with gameplay mechanics that seem to hinge
on not necessarily what is constructed, but <span   class="emphasis"><em>how</em></span> it is
constructed.
</p><p>
For instance, the ground is often angled. So, when you build roads, you
have to take into account where they head in order for builders to
be able to transport their goods quickly and easily. Elements such as
flow are just about everything in this game&mdash;you almost could call it
feng shui.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Installation</b></span>
</p><p>
If you head to the Web site's Downloads section, there's an i386 Linux
binary available in a tarball that's around 100MB, which I'll be running
with here. For masochists (or non-Intel machines), the game's
source is available farther down the page.
</p><p>
Download the package and extract it to a new folder (which you'll need to
make yourself). Open a terminal in the new folder, and enter the command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ./widelands
</pre>
</p><p>
If you're very lucky, it'll work right off the bat. Chances are, you'll
get an error like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
./widelands: error while loading 
  shared libraries: libSDL_ttf-2.0.so.0:
cannot open shared object file: No such 
  file or directory
</pre>
</p><p>
I installed libSDL_ttf-2.0-dev, which fixed that, but then I got
several other errors before I could get it to start. I had to install
libSDL_gfx.so.4 and libsdl-gfx1.2-4 before it worked, but
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Widelands</em></span>
relies heavily on SDL (as do many other games), so you might as well
install all of the SDL libraries while you're there.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Usage</b></span>
</p><p>
Once you're in the game, the first thing you should do is head to the
Single Player mode, and choose Campaign to start, as there's a
good tutorial, which you <span   class="emphasis"><em>will</em></span> need. While the levels
are loading, hints are given to you for when you get in the game,
speeding up the learning process.
</p><p>
Controls are with the mouse and keyboard. The mouse
is used for choosing various actions on-screen, and the keyboard's
arrow keys let you move the camera around the world. Left-clicking on
an insignificant piece of map brings up a menu for all of the basic
in-game options. Right-clicking on something usually gets rid of it.
</p><p>
From here on, the game is far too complex to explain in this amount
of space, but it's well worth checking out the documentation and help
screens for further information. Once you've finished the intro campaign, check
out the game's large collection of single- and multiplayer maps. You get a
choice of multiple races, including Barbarians, Empire and Atlanteans,
coupled with the ability to play against the computer or against other
humans (or a close approximation). It also comes with a background story to 
the game, and if you spend your Saturday nights playing <span   class="emphasis"><em>World of
Warcraft</em></span>
instead of going to the pub, I'm sure you'll find it very interesting.
</p><p>
Delve into this game, and there's much that lies beneath the surface. It
has simple things that please, like how the in-game menus are very
sophisticated and solid, with none of the bugginess you get in many
amateur games. But, it's the complete reversal of hyperspeed in its
gameplay that I really love. I always want to get back to building my
base when playing most RTS games, but I'm constantly drawn away by fire
fights. This game lets you keep building, and places serious emphasis on how
you do it.
</p><p>
The Web site also has add-ons, such as maps, music and other tribes,
along with an editor, artwork and more, so check it out. Ultimately,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Widelands</em></span> is a breath of fresh air in an extremely stale genre, whose
roots ironically stem from way back in the past in RTS history. Whether
you're chasing a fix of that original <span   class="emphasis"><em>Settlers</em></span> feel or just want a
different direction in RTS, this game is well worth a look.

Moonlight|3D&mdash;3-D Image Modeling
(<a href="http://www.moonlight3d.eu" target="_self">www.moonlight3d.eu</a>)</h2></div></div><p>
This last project looks really cool and impressed me, but I'm afraid
documentation is nonexistent, so hopefully some of you folks at home
can help these guys out. According to the Freshmeat page:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Moonlight|3D is a modeling and animation tool for three-dimensional
art. It currently supports mesh-based modeling. It's a redesign of
Moonlight Atelier, formed after Moonlight Atelier/Creator died in
1999/2000. Rendering is done through pluggable back ends. It currently
supports Sunflow, with support for RenderMan and others in planning.
</p></blockquote></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10420f5.large.jpg"><img src="10420f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Some great results from someone who actually knows how to use Moonlight|3D.
</p></div></div><p>
The Web site sheds further light on the project, which states one of its
goals as: &ldquo;In order to speed up the progress of our development
efforts, we open
up the project to the general public, and we hope to attract the support
of many developers and users, bringing the project forward faster.&rdquo;
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Installation</b></span>
</p><p>
In terms of requirements, the only thing I needed to install to get
Moonlight running was Java, so thankfully, the dependencies are fairly
minimal. As for choices of packages at the Web site, there's a nightly
build available as a binary or the latest source code (I ran with
the binary). Grab the latest, extract it to a local folder, and open a
terminal in the new folder. Then, enter the command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ./moonlight.sh
</pre>
</p><p>
Provided you have everything installed, it now should start. Once you're
inside, I'm sorry, I really can't be of much help. There are the
usual windows in a 3-D editor for height, width, depth and a 3-D view,
and on the left are quick selection panes for objects, such as boxes,
cones, spheres and so on (actually, the pane on the left has access
to just about everything you need&mdash;it's pretty cool). Scouting about,
a number of cool functions really jumped out at me, like
multiple preview modes; changeable light, camera sources and positions;
and most important, the ability to make your own animations. If only
I could find a way to use them.
</p><p>
This project really does look pretty cool, and it seems to be a decent
alternative to programs like Blender, but there honestly is no
documentation. All links to documentation lead to a page saying the
documentation doesn't exist yet and provides a link to the on-line forums. The
forums also happen to have very little that's of use to someone without
any prior knowledge of the interface, and I assume all those already
on the forum are users of the original Moonlight Atelier. Nevertheless,
the project does look interesting and seems to be quite stable. I look
forward to seeing what happens with this project once some documentation
is in place.
