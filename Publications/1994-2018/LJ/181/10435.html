Meaning, its context is relationship&mdash;or the absence of one.

Years ago, I worked with PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) when it was a
startup company and not what Phil Zimmerman created in the first place: a
pretty good way to keep communications private. In the course of that work,
I developed a belief that privacy was one of those topics that was too
important to ignore, yet too complex for most people to understand,
especially if it involved technology more complex than a key and a hole. So
I've mostly avoided the topic, leaving the worrying up to people who are
required to wrestle with it&mdash;meaning, developers.
</p><p>
But now, I'm running a development project, and not a day goes by that
privacy doesn't come up&mdash;or worse, require consequential thinking about
nitty-gritties: code, protocols, policies and (worst of all) legal stuff.
So I've been trying to think in new ways about privacy&mdash;what it means and
how to put that meaning to work.
</p><p>
Let's start with celebrities. These creatures can play a helpful role in
studies of privacy, because they have less of it than the rest of us.
Celebrity is a kind of albinism. It robs its victims of the pigment we call
anonymity, even as they are dressed in fame. So they stand out. Worse, they
attract the attention of paparazzi, whose purpose in life is to maximize
celebrity exposure.
</p><p>
Mass media (the natural environment of celebrity) reduce and confine the
degree to which celebrities can enjoy simple one-to-one, or one-to-any,
relationships. So celebrities hide. Or give up. Or both.
</p><p>
Scott McNealy famously said, &ldquo;You have no privacy. Get over
it.&rdquo; Asked by a
gaggle of <span   class="emphasis"><em>San Francisco Chronicle</em></span> reporters to expand on that, he replied,
&ldquo;The point I was making was someone already has your medical records.
Someone has my dental records. Someone has my financial records. Someone
knows just about everything about me. Gang, do you want to refute my
statement? Visa knows what you bought. You have no privacy. Get over it.
That's what I said.&rdquo;
</p><p>
For years I thought, &ldquo;Well, that's true for him.&rdquo; Because he's a celebrity.
But lately, I've thought more about the rest of what he said, which was
about data. The fact is, your medical, financial and dental records are not
yours. They might be about you, but they don't belong to you. They belong
to your credit-card company, your broker, your dentist.
</p><p>
We go to those professionals because we can't or won't perform their work
by ourselves. So, because they're the ones producing data about us, it only
makes sense for the data to be &ldquo;theirs&rdquo;&mdash;at least in the locational
sense. After that, the distinction between control and possession 
comes up only when somebody else needs the data. If that's you, all you need to
do in most cases is authenticate yourself. Then you can have it.
</p><p>
In the physical world, that's fairly easy. We just show up looking like
ourselves. If we have a familiar working relationship with our dentists,
bankers or brokers, they won't bother asking for our drivers' licenses.
They'll just shake our hands, tell us to have a seat and ask us how we're
doing.
</p><p>
This illustrates how there are essentially two forms of privacy. One is the
kind where you hide out. You minimize exposure by confining it to yourself.
The other is where you trust somebody with your information.
</p><p>
In order to trust somebody, you need a relationship with them. You're their
spouse, friend, client or patient.
</p><p>
This isn't so easy if you're just a customer, or worse, a
&ldquo;consumer&rdquo;. There
the obligation is minimized, usually through call centers and other
customer-avoidance mechanisms that get only worse as technology improves.
Today, the call center wants to scrape you off onto a Web site or a chat
system.
</p><p>
Minimizing human contact isolates your private information inside machines
that have little interest in relating to you as a human being or in
putting you in contact with a human being inside the company. Hence, your
data is indeed safe&mdash;from you. It's also safe from the assumption that
this data might in any way also belong to you&mdash;meaning, under your
control. It's still private, but only on the company's terms. Not on yours.
</p><p>
This mess can't be fixed just by humanizing call centers. It can be
fixed only by humanizing companies. This has to be done from both inside and
out.
</p><p>
Recent changes in the sounds coming from the CRM community are highly
encouraging. So is the growth of free and open-source CRM systems and the interest of CRM
giants such as Oracle in VRM (vendor relationship management), which is the
development movement I'm involved in.
</p><p>
Paul Trevithick, the main developer behind Higgins
(<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/higgins" target="_self">www.eclipse.org/higgins</a>), makes an interesting
point: both the Net and the Web were born without the concept of an
individual. There are endpoints on the Net and files on the Web&mdash;and the
presumption that somebody will do browsing or viewing. But here is no
instantiation of the individual himself or herself, except inside company
silos.
</p><p>
Keith Hopper says, &ldquo;The customer should be his own silo.&rdquo; Building those
won't be easy, but it will be necessary if we want privacy that's more than
pretty good. Those silos will have two effects. One is to contain our data
and put it under our control. The other is to position us as an equal: a
free and independent entity rather than a captive and dependent one.
