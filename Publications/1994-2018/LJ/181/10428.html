Can the <tt  >rm -rf /</tt> command ever be tamed? Learn how to pick up
the pieces when rm runs rampant on your filesystem.

The following is the continuation of a series of
columns on Linux disasters and how to recover from them,
inspired in part by a Halloween <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> Live episode
titled &ldquo;Horror Stories&rdquo;. You can watch the original episode at
<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/video/linux-journal-live-horror-stories" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/video/linux-journal-live-horror-stories</a>.
</p><p>
Some commands on the command line are so blunt, so potentially
devastating, that every time I use them, I pause for a moment before I
press Enter. In my last column, I discussed one of my all-time favorites:
dd (which could possibly stand for Destroy Data). Of course, as useful
as dd is, I don't use it every single day, so even though I approach
the command with reverence, you might argue it doesn't compare to the
true master of data destruction: rm. Yes, dd can wipe out your hard
drive in a few short keystrokes, but nothing really matches the compact
destructive power of <tt  >rm -rf /</tt>.
</p><p>
True, most people aren't bitten by that version of the command. Usually,
it's its more sinister brother, <tt  >rm -rf ./</tt> run from the wrong
directory. The scene plays out something like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
rm -rf ./
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1fb4580.0x20ac880"></a></h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Clicking noises from the hard drive...</em></span>
&ldquo;Hmm, that's taking longer than I tho...HEY!&rdquo;
Ctrl-C Ctrl-C Ctrl-C.
</p><p>
It's too late. By the time you noticed you ran that command in the wrong
terminal, half of your home directory is gone. Now when I started out
with Linux, I always was told in true UNIX form that when you rm a file,
it is gone, and there is no way you can get it back. Undelete commands
were for DOS users anyway&mdash;we Linux users knew better, right? Well, it
turns out, we don't. Most Linux users I know have deleted the wrong files
at least once in their lives. Now, the best protection against this is a
backup (noticing a common thread in this series?), but if you don't have
a backup, you aren't completely without hope. Everything you might have
been told about the rm command isn't entirely true, and by the end of
this article, you'll find that Linux does have an undelete of
sorts.

Free Space Isn't Free</h2></div></div><p>
To understand how to recover a deleted file, it's important to understand
what rm does. When rm deletes a file, it essentially adds those blocks
to the available free space on that filesystem. Unless you use a tool
like shred, the data in those blocks stays intact until another file
overwrites them. Blocks aren't reused in any date order, so some freed
blocks might stay on the system for days, weeks or even years before
they are reallocated to a new file, while others could be reused almost
immediately.
</p><p>
Because a Linux system writes files constantly, time is against you when you
accidentally delete a file. The first thing you should do if you delete
important files is unmount that filesystem. If you can't easily
unmount the filesystem, shut down the system. Or, if the files are
extra important, you might even pull the plug to ensure no other files
are written to disk.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1fb4580.0x20acca0"></a>
Forensics to the Rescue</h2></div></div><p>
It turns out that accident-prone Linux users aren't the only ones who want
to recover deleted files. In fact, deleted file recovery is particularly
useful for forensics, as attackers might try to delete files to cover
their tracks. Forensics tools work with the filesystem on a low level as
it is, because they try to gather data traditional tools might miss.
</p><p>
To recover deleted files, you need to install sleuthkit. Most
distributions these days offer it as a package; otherwise, you can
download the source from the project's Web site. It may go without
saying, but <span   class="emphasis"><em>don't install sleuthkit on the filesystem you are
recovering!</em></span> If you need to recover files from the root
filesystem, this may mean you have to take the hard drive to a second system
or use a rescue disk like Knoppix that includes sleuthkit.
</p><p>
Once you have sleuthkit installed, you need to get a second disk
that is large enough to store any files you want to recover. Unlike some
other recovery methods, with sleuthkit, you don't have to create a complete
image of the free space, so you won't need nearly as much storage. You
can use the df tool to see how much free space you have:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ df -h
Filesystem    Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/sda1     9.4G  7.0G  2.0G  79% /
/dev/sda3      20G   17G  3.6G  83% /home
</pre>
</p><p>
In this case, I have around 2GB of space on my / partition and 3.6GB
in /home to which to restore files. For this example, let's assume I have
connected the recovery filesystem to this machine, and it has shown up
as /dev/sda1. Be sure not to mount this filesystem. Or, if your machine
automatically mounted it, be sure to unmount it before you continue, so
you won't write to it accidentally. Because /home has more free space, I
will recover to it, so I create a directory to store the recovered files
and then use the sleuthkit fls (forensic ls) command to create a list
of all the deleted files it can find on /dev/sda1:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ mkdir ~/recovery
$ sudo fls -f ext -d -r -p /dev/sdb1 \
            &gt; ~/recovery/deleted_files.txt
</pre>
</p><p>
This command might take some time, depending on how much free space
it has to pore through. In the meantime, we can discuss what these
different arguments mean. The fls man page goes into more detail, but
the -f argument specifies what filesystem fls is scanning (ext is used
for ext2 and ext3). If you are unsure what value to use, type <tt  >fls -f
list</tt> to see a complete list of filesystems. By default, fls can list
all the files on a particular filesystem, but when you specify -d,
it lists only deleted ones. The -r option turns on recursion, so it
traverses all directories it finds, and the -p option outputs
the full path to each file. Without -p, if multiple files have the same
name, it might be difficult to tell them apart. Finally, you list the
partition you want fls to scan.
</p><p>
Once fls completes, you can open ~/recovery/deleted_files.txt to see a
complete list of all the deleted files on the filesystem. It will
look something like the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
d/d * 944680:   home/kyle/.mutt
r/r * 943542:   home/kyle/.muttrc
r/r * 910452:   home/kyle/may_lj_article.txt
</pre>
</p><p>
The first field tells you whether the file is a directory (d/d) or a
regular file (r/r). Next is an inode number for the file, and then finally,
you see the path to the file. Let's say, for this example, I want
to recover the /home/kyle/may_lj_article.txt file. I then would use the
sleuthkit icat tool to recover it. The icat program is a special version
of cat that takes inodes as arguments. In this case, I would specify the
inode 910452:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo icat -f ext -r -s /dev/sdb1 910452 \
             &gt;~/recovery/may_lj_article.txt
</pre>
</p><p>
As with fls, this might take some time to complete. You can read about
all of its arguments in the icat man page, but here I use -f to specify
the filesystem type like with fls. The -r option tells icat to go into a
special recovery mode it uses for deleted files. The -s option causes
icat to output the full contents of any sparse files it finds. Finally,
I specify the partition to recover from and the inode to recover. Once
the command completes, I can open ~/recovery/may_lj_article.txt and see
whether it was able to restore it.
</p><p>
This method works fine when you need to recover only a few files, but
what if you need to recover hundreds? Well, if you search on-line, you
will find a number of different shell scripts people have written to
recover all deleted files from fls output automatically. Below is one
I originally found at <a href="http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-365703.html" target="_self">forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-365703.html</a>
and then improved a bit:


<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/bash

DISK=/dev/sdb1 # disk to scan
RESTOREDIR=/home/kyle/recovery # directory to restore to

mkdir -p "$RESTOREDIR"
cat $1 |
    while read line; do
        filetype=`echo "$line" | awk {'print $1'}`
        filenode=`echo "$line" | awk {'print $3'}`
        filenode=${filenode%:}
        filenode=${filenode%(*}
        filename=`echo "$line" | cut -f 2`

        echo "$filename"

        if [ $filetype == "d/d" ]; then
    	mkdir -p "$RESTOREDIR/$filename"
        else
	    mkdir -p "$RESTOREDIR/`dirname $filename`"
	    icat -f ext -r -s "$DISK" "$filenode" \
	         &gt; "$RESTOREDIR/$filename"
        fi
    done
</pre>
</p><p>
Save this script under /usr/local/bin/restore. To use this script, replace
the DISK and RESTOREDIR variables at the top of the script so they match
your environment, give it executable permissions, and then run it with the fls
output you created before as an argument. All of your recovered files will
be wherever you set RESTOREDIR nested within their parent directories:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/restore
$ sudo /usr/local/bin/restore ~/recovery/deleted_files.txt
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, don't let this make you too comfortable with rm&mdash;there's no guarantee
a particular file will be complete or even recovered at all. I still
say the best policy is to have backups followed by a thoughtful pause
before you press Enter on any recursive rm command.
