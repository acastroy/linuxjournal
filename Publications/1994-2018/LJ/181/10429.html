Use bash's more powerful variable substitution
forms to simplify your scripts.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13c1580.0x14b9358"></a></h2></div></div><p>
I realize this might throw a spanner into the editorial works here at
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span>, but after a two-month sidetrack on how to analyze letter usage in
English to give you an edge in <span   class="emphasis"><em>Hangman</em></span> (yeah, I can't believe I write about
this stuff either), it's time to get back to our tour of basic shell
variable referencing capabilities.
</p><p>
In previous columns, we talked about ${var:-alt value}, ${var:=alt value},
${var:?no value} and even ${var:start:length} as a way to extract specific
ranges of characters from a variable.
</p><p>
This month, I want to look at what are perhaps some of the more arcane
variable references you can do&mdash;calls that are definitely helpful if
you're deep in the zone with your scripting. I imagine they won't be things
you need for those quick five-line scripts, but when your little project
has expanded to a dozen screens and you have seven functions and a dozen
arrays, well, these will be of great value to you.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13c1580.0x14b96c8"></a>
Expanding and Matching</h2></div></div><p>
In a previous column, I showed how to do substring expansion with shell variables in the
form of ${var:start:length}, but it's also useful to know the length of a
variable's value. This can be done with ${#var}, like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ test="the rain in Spain"
$ echo ${#test}
17
</pre>
</p><p>
One situation I've encountered in scripts is the need to set an arbitrary
number of variables in the form value1, value2, value3 and so on.
Later, I need to determine the names of the ones that I've set.
My lazy solution is typically another variable, valuecount, which
counts the number of variables I've set, but, of course, that doesn't
directly give me the names.
A smarter way to do this is with the ${!pattern*} notation, as shown here:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ echo ${!t*}
test
$ thimble="full"
$ tart="pop"
$ echo ${!t*}
tart test thimble
</pre>
</p><p>
As you can see, it lets you get a list of defined variables that match the
specified pattern. I'm using t* in the example, but it just as easily
could be value* to match the situation outlined earlier.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13c1580.0x14b9930"></a>
Pattern Substitution</h2></div></div><p>
Here's a cool thing you can do with the bash shell that I'm betting you
didn't realize: pattern substitution. When I have a situation where this is
required, I almost always use the clunky and CPU-expensive form of:

<pre     class="programlisting">
var=$(echo $var | sed 's/old/new')
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13c1580.0x14b9ae8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
which actually can be neatly accomplished with the shell itself by using
the form ${var/old/new}. I kid you not!
Check out this example:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ test="The Rain in Spain"
$ echo ${test/ain/ixn}
The Rixn in Spain
</pre>
</p><p>
If you're like me, your fingers are itching to add a /g suffix to the
substitution. It turns out that's done a bit differently within a shell
variable: you need to have the pattern start with a /, which looks a bit
weird, but it does work:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ echo ${test//ain/ixn}
The Rixn in Spixn
</pre>
</p><p>
The general case here is ${var//pat/global subst}.
There's more you can do with this notation too&mdash;notably, use the equivalent
of the ^ and $ special characters you might use in sed regular
expressions to root the pattern to the beginning or end of the variable's
value:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ echo ${test/#ain/ixn}
The Rain in Spain
$ echo ${test/%ain/ixn}
The Rain in Spixn
</pre>
</p><p>
In the first situation, the pattern didn't match the first few letters of
the variable value (the pattern would need to have been
&ldquo;The&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;ain&rdquo;), so
nothing changed. In the second situation, however, it did match the last
few characters, so the substitution took place.
</p><p>
To be fair, using sed does give you quite a bit more power and
capability, but if you're just doing something simple like removing
an extension and appending a PID to a variable to make a quick temp file,
you can indeed just use shell pattern replacement:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ test="The Rain in Spain.txt"
$ echo ${test/%.*/}.$$
The Rain in Spain.10126
</pre>
</p><p>
Personally, I think this is very cool!

Command Substitutions</h2></div></div><p>
We've explored just about everything you can do with variables other than
delving into arrays, which we'll do next month, so I thought I'd take a bit
of space to show you a few slick command substitution tricks.
First off, us old-timers are used to using backticks to have a command
embedded within another, as in the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
echo the date is `date`
</pre>
</p><p>
This is pretty commonly used, but, in fact, a better and certainly more
readable notational convention is to use $() instead, as I showed earlier.
This is functionally identical:

<pre     class="programlisting">
echo the date is $(date)
</pre>
</p><p>
Using this notation gives you some interesting capabilities. For example,
instead of <tt  >$(cat file)</tt>, you simply can use
<tt  >$(&lt; file)</tt> to make the contents of
the file appear.
</p><p>
As is always the case with the shell, when and where fields are parsed is
important too. Check out the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ echo the date is $(date)
the date is Wed Feb 4 08:08:35 MST 2009
$ echo the date is "$(date)"
the date is Wed Feb  4 08:08:43 MST 2009
</pre>
</p><p>
By adding the double quotes around the second invocation of $(date), you can
see that the returning values weren't parsed by the shell and normalized:
notice the two spaces between Feb and 4 in the second output
compared to one space in the first output.
</p><p>
I hope I don't need to tell you what happens if you use single quotes
instead of double quotes&mdash;oh, what the heck:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ echo the date is '$(date)'
the date is $(date)
</pre>
</p><p>
No surprise there&mdash;single quotes disable shell expansion, just as it does in this
case:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ echo The '$HOSTNAME' is $HOSTNAME
The $HOSTNAME is soyvah33
</pre>
</p><p>
This leads to the classic question of what if you actually do want those
quotes to be part of the output? It's a bit convoluted, but this works:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ echo The '$HOSTNAME' is \'$HOSTNAME\'
The $HOSTNAME is 'soyvah33'
</pre>
</p><p>
Let's wrap things up here, and next month, we'll dig into the oft-confusing
world of shell script arrays.
