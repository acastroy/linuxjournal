Joe Born talks about his company's Neuros Technology
and how open devices are upending the consumer electronics
industry like never before.

The consumer electronics (CE) industry is in an upheaval as devices become
more open and a rift emerges between hardware manufacturing and the
software that steers them. On the cutting edge of this development is
Neuros Technology, which has brought the Linux and open-source model to
CE devices for TV-Internet convergence. I recently spoke
with Joe Born, Neuros Technology CEO and founder, to learn more about
Neuros Technology and where this exciting trend toward open CE devices
is headed.

Joe Born, CEO of Neuros Technology
</p></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>JG:</b></span> First, thanks for joining us in this conversation,
Joe Born. The open devices from your company, Neuros Technology, make
perfect sense to us Linux and open-source geeks but are quite disruptive
in the world of electronics. Can you start us off by giving us a quick
rundown of your products and how they are different from your typical
set-top box?
</p><p>
JB: Well, they are open. Now, normally that's associated with open
source, but actually electronics devices today are vastly more closed
than any Windows PC dreamed of being. If you look at pretty much
<span   class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span>
the electronics devices that power the TV, it's not just that they don't
allow modification, they don't even allow you to browse outside the
walled garden that they have set up. Compared to a PC, they are closed
at every level.
</p><p>
So in the Neuros LINK [device], that means it can browse to any site,
and you get access to all the content you can find, compared to just
about any other set-top device you can imagine&mdash;from the operator
boxes to the AppleTV to TiVo and so on.
</p><p>
Basically, Neuros is looking to create a device that fills the gap between
the typical electronics that connect the Net and TV (of varying shapes and
sizes) and the wide-open HTPC. We want to provide navigation and ease
of use like a CE device, but with the openness
of the PC. Enabling that functionality is a host of free software.
Under the hood, the LINK is really a diskless, quiet PC, and with all
the power and expansion of the PC, but over time, we're adding all the
seamless navigation of a nice electronics device.
</p><p>
As to our other products, Neuros TV is what a TVPC should be: an
open device that can stream virtually any Internet content to your TV.
Building on the lessons learned from the closed, proprietary solutions,
Neuros has built a device that's quiet, component-sized and sets
up easily with all the peripherals you need and none that you don't.
It's different from your typical set-top box solution, because it allows
you to access any content of your choosing easily, not just the one your
provider or manufacturer decides you should have.
</p><p>
Then, there is the Neuros OSD, a standalone device for archiving all
your DVDs, VHS tapes and TV shows into unlocked digital recordings.
It's particularly good for making recordings that play on your handhelds
(iPhone, Android and so on) with no hassle or conversion.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>JG:</b></span> In a nutshell, what is the story
behind your company, and where did
the inspiration come from to create open devices?
</p><p>
Born: Like most manufacturers, Neuros didn't pay a lot of attention to
the Open Source movement initially, viewing the various activities on
Linux, Web servers and browsers as an interesting but distant phenomenon with
little obvious connection to our business. It was almost by happenstance
that we realized what a profound impact on our business the open-source
phenomenon could have.
</p><p>
Our first surprise came even before we released any source code. We had
simply released the communication protocol between our device and the PC.
Based on that small release of information, brand-new synchronization
managers sprang up, as if from thin air. They typically were developed
by engineers who often had no contact with the company. The software
was innovative and took entirely different approaches, and in many cases,
it was preferred by many users to the software we had spent literally
millions on developing in house. Equally amazing were the tools 
they were using. These independent, open-source developers had complete
toolkits of free software, that were, in many cases, vastly superior to
the proprietary ones we had been using.
</p><p>
I can remember the first time I saw the bug-tracking software called
Bugzilla that many of the open-source developers were using. Like most
companies, we had purchased proprietary software to track our software
bugs and enhancements and communicate updates throughout the company.
I remember being amazed when I first saw Bugzilla. Not only was it
free, but it had all kinds of features we'd long been looking for.
Not only that, but its open-source license meant we could put it on
a public server that anyone could access. Suddenly, we had the ability
to tap directly into our most sophisticated and enthusiastic users
for finding bugs and, even better, making suggestions and enhancements.
Not only that, but Bugzilla had a voting function that meant the public
could chime in on its priorities. Overnight, our consumer intimacy
would jump five-fold with this ability, I thought. When I asked our
internal team, no one could think of a single reason we should
stick with our old proprietary closed system.
</p><p>
Although everyone agreed that Bugzilla was a superior system for tracking
bugs, there were, however, plenty of concerns about exposing our internal
bug-tracking system to the public, particularly from the marketing
department. Would users be turned off by being able to see our list of
bugs? Would we be able to control a system where hundreds of unscreened
users have access to input and comment on all the bugs? Would users be
offended when we decided not to make an enhancement they had suggested?
</p><p>
In the end, we decided it was worth the risks, and that as Bugzilla
was capable of supporting a public-based system, why not use that
functionality? In the years since we made the system public, none of
our fears have come true. In fact, there has been substantially less
complaining by users, perhaps because we have given them a constructive
outlet to report their issues. Further, our connection with our customers
has increased dramatically, and we now have a systematic way to include
their input into our internal plans. This level of consumer input could
never be duplicated with conventional market research. To date, the
concerns about an open system spiraling out of control have turned out
to be unfounded as well. As quickly as duplicate or irrelevant bugs are
entered, they are corrected, as the community effectively polices itself.
</p><p>
Perhaps not surprising to those experienced in open-source development,
our introduction to open source as users of the software quickly led
to our embrace of open source as a development method&mdash;a method that,
with heavy doses of experimentation, mis-steps and modifications, we
could apply to hardware development as well as software.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>JG:</b></span> Does &ldquo;the industry&rdquo;
understand what you guys are up to, or is it too
myopic to really get it?
</p><p>
Born: This is an incredibly rich area for discussion, and it really
depends on what you mean by &ldquo;industry&rdquo; and &ldquo;get
it&rdquo;.
</p><p>
From our viewpoint, it's plain to see that the electronics industry is
undergoing a change that very much mirrors the PC industry 25+ years
ago. Devices are undergoing a transformation from being dedicated,
closed devices to more open ones, mirroring what happened going from
what were essentially word processors to the IBM PC in the early 1980s.
Today, the silicon behind electronics has become powerful enough that
it has outstripped the ability of the folks manufacturing it to create
the software for it, and a natural separation between hardware and
software has emerged. This is further splitting into operating systems,
applications and services, and we can see some of this already happening
on the iPhone, for example.
</p><p>
Nowadays, much of not just the manufacturing but the design work also
is being done in Asia. Certainly these &ldquo;design manufacturers&rdquo; or ODMs,
get this separation very well. They know that software teams have to
be close to the customers, and they recognize that they have neither the
resources nor the expertise to develop the applications that are necessary
to make devices successful today. One interesting area is really in
the operating system, actually. The free nature of Linux is leaving the
operating system a bit &ldquo;up for grabs&rdquo;, so to speak. There are vendors,
like MontaVista that do a nice job with this, but their business models
can't be the same as Microsoft's (or Apple's for that matter). My personal
gut feeling is that branded distributions will emerge here, and things
like mobile Ubuntu, Android and maybe something coming from Nokia will
emerge. The silicon manufacturers have a strong role to play here in
providing turnkey solutions for their customers. TI is leading the way
with some of its efforts (both on its own and supporting our efforts),
and lately we've begun working with ATI in improving support for Linux.
</p><p>
I see a lot of activity on the supply chain per the above, so I would
generally say they get it. Downstream on the brand side, there's a bit
more resistance. The branded manufacturers are a bit more of a mixed bag.
There are reasonable reasons for this.
</p><p>
First, consumer expectations are different for an electronics device
than a computer. Consumers are not used to an open system, so their
expectations are for more of a controlled experience.
</p><p>
Second, there's still a bit of old-fashioned thinking and fear about
opening a system and losing control.
</p><p>
Third, there are impediments given the DRM and encryption issues.
</p><p>
And fourth, the &ldquo;customers&rdquo;&mdash;that is, cable and wireless
operators&mdash;often
don't want open systems, because they want to control their networks and
devices (for a variety of reasons).
</p><p>
So, on the branding end, there's more resistance, but that's where Neuros
comes in. I believe we can pioneer this area and demonstrate enough
consumer demand that it will overcome the above.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>JG:</b></span> You've used the term &ldquo;super
ODM&rdquo; to describe Neuros. What does
that mean?
</p><p>
JB: An ODM is a Original Design Manufacturer&mdash;basically a factory that
adds design capability and initiates development of products, providing
a more turnkey solution to its customers. Neuros considers itself a
&ldquo;super ODM&rdquo;, meaning we not only take responsibility for design,
but also launch our products directly to involved users, get immediate
feedback from those customers and evolve the product. This means that,
to our customers (the larger electronics brands), we have not only done
design work, but also evolved the products in direct response to users' needs,
proven the early market for the devices and taken a lot of the risk out
of the process for our customers.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>JG:</b></span> How are you collaborating with other companies committed to open
devices and open source?
</p><p>
JB: &ldquo;Supply chains&rdquo; of both software and hardware are long and segmented
today. There are so many different contributors and pieces to any piece
of electronics equipment you buy today, it's just inherent that
you are borrowing from the contributions of many, many levels. One of
the things that makes open source so compelling is that it forms this
giant ecosystem. Without a single business development meeting, without
a single nickel in legal fees, we have a mature agreement in place
(typically the GPL) with a huge ecosystem of projects and companies;
these are crucial building blocks for getting out products quickly.
The addition of more and more commercial entities to that ecosystem is a
huge boon. We're in discussions [for example] with Boxee as we speak,
figuring out how best to deliver a product that incorporates their
software and services.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>JG:</b></span> I bet it's really fun to have such a dynamic group of contributors
outside the walls of your office.
</p><p>
JB: It's incredibly gratifying, and I've come to realize what a special
thing it really is. It's much more than a bunch of smart folks working
together in a community.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>JG:</b></span> In a separate conversation, you told me the fascinating story one
of your most prolific contributors. Could you share his story with
our readers?
</p><p>
JB: Pablo Grande was the most prolific and talented hacker in the
Neuros community. He contributed at every level&mdash;from low-level assembly
language hacking all the way to setting up the community Web sites.
But amazingly, his greatest contributions were made after he had a
severe stroke in 2005. After the stroke, Pablo's heroic recovery and
participation not only inspired but demonstrated to the Neuros community
the power of open development. We all came to realize that what we had
considered a nice little on-line community was really something more&mdash;open communities were creating a place that, as melodramatic as it
sounds, was really unlocking the power of human potential. Here was
Pablo, without the use of one hand and, at the time, unable to speak,
still able to bring his exhaustive knowledge and insight to bear on the
problems facing Neuros. Where else could he contribute at that level?
Where else could he prove what he was really capable of, that probably
only he could see? What other type of institution would be able to
accept contributions solely limited by the contributor's own ability?
We realized watching Pablo's example that at various levels it was
true for all of us. Unlike typical, top-down corporate development,
we were all contributing in a way that really was limited only by our
own energy and ability. Since that realization, I know I personally
have felt a passion for open development and what it can do, not just
for the projects themselves but for the contributors as individuals.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>JG:</b></span> What are some of the most innovative contributions you've
received from contributors to the Neuros OSD?
</p><p>
JB: Well, our YouTube browser was one open-source contribution,
then an audio player, and then a third contribution was
a mashup that stitched those two together allowing you to
browse MP3s, and then with a single click, &ldquo;find the music
video&rdquo;
for the song. I thought it was a neat project, but what I really
liked was the cooperation between community members.
</p><p>
Recently, we really had a lot of fun with &ldquo;crowd narration&rdquo;, a technology
that superimposes two lines of chat text over a video broadcast,
effectively allowing individuals to provide commentary in real time to
live events or shows. It's a kind of closed captioning for crowds.
</p><p>
[For a video illustrating crowd narration, see
<a href="http://open.neurostechnology.com/content/crowd-narration-future-tv" target="_self">open.neurostechnology.com/content/crowd-narration-future-tv</a>.]
</p><p>
Honestly though, I think the fun has just begun. We've seen more
interesting experimentation since we've launched the LINK than in all
the previous history combined, and the reason is simple. The product
is further along. By using an x86 processor and Ubuntu, we made
experimentation and enhancements more accessible. Now, unlike in the
past, the first 95% is already done. Basic functionality already works,
and now it's about the really interesting stuff of presentation, sharing,
discovery of good content, interactivity and so on.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>JG:</b></span> Do you see a conflict between the needs of users of your devices
and the developers who contribute to them? If so, how do you mitigate
this conflict?
</p><p>
JB: Sometimes, there's a conflict. Ease of use and
&ldquo;intuitive&rdquo;
is certainly defined differently for developers and mainstream users.
The wisdom of the crowds isn't, and never will be, a substitute for
individual judgment and leadership. We still ultimately have to make
the call on things like those conflicts.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>JG:</b></span> Your development team holds its developer meetings on public IRC.
How has this experience been, and is the goal of transparency well served
in this way?
</p><p>
JB: It has worked well. As you probably know, a community isn't a
monolithic block; there are folks who are very close to the core
and their &ldquo;influence&rdquo; radiates outward to the less-involved users
and customers. By keeping the most involved contributors in the fold,
they can spread the word in their own ways and make sure it gets out
to everyone. If you look at our forums for example, many of the folks
answering questions are not internal staff. Having open meetings is
a good mechanism for making sure that those folks, as an example,
understand well what's going on and can articulate it to others.
Without transparency, this would be impossible.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>JG:</b></span> What do you think will be the significance of Neuros LINK and Neuros
TV in the marketplace?
</p><p>
JB: Well, see above. But, in broad terms, I think opening up the TV
will have more impact on worldwide freedom of communication than the
creation of the PC. There are vastly more TVs in the world than PCs, and
you'll find them in some of the areas where freedom of communication
is most limited. Once cheap hardware connecting those devices in a
decentralized way penetrates those areas, the implications are hard to
fully imagine at this point.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>JG:</b></span> Does Neuros Technology have plans on the horizon for other devices,
products or services?
</p><p>
JB: Well, we do, but I believe we'll be in this category for a while.
I expect there will be integration with PVR functionality and perhaps
other types of functionality, and of course, continuous improvement within
this category. There's lots to do.
</p><p>
