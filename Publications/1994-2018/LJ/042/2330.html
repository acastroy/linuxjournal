multi-titled, multi-talented kind of guys. He is the Co-Founder,
President and Chief Technology Officer of Xi Graphics. Mr. Roell
developed the original source code for X display servers on Intel
PCs for the MIT X Consortium. I interviewed him by e-mail on June
18, 1997.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: Let's start off
with some personal information: country of birth, education, fun
things, etc.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Thomas</b></span>: I was born in
Bavaria, Germany and lived most of my life in a small town there.
There was nothing fancy in my formal education&mdash;I took the standard
route to a degree in computer science. I have to admit that, back
then, I thought the activities outside of school were more
important than the knowledge I got in the classroom. College and
the emerging Internet certainly opened up an incredible playground.
Remember, we're talking about 1989 where the uVAX II was thought to
be state-of-the-art.</p><p>I do try to maintain a balance between work and fun. Moving
to Colorado really transformed me into a sports-nerd. Colorado is
actually an outdoor paradise, offering scuba diving, hiking,
biking, paragliding, roller blading and skiing. It's said around
the company that, after Christmas, I missed only one possible ski
weekend on the slopes!</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: When and why did
you move to the U.S.? How does Colorado compare to Bavaria?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Thomas</b></span>: I moved to the U.S.
in May of last year&mdash;quite a change for me. However, Colorado
compares very well with Bavaria. There are lots of mountains around
here with an incredible number of peaks waiting to be
climbed.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: I understand that
your original X server code is the basis for XFree86. Can you tell
us something about the transition from non-commercial to commercial
product? Why you made the decision to go this route?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Thomas</b></span>: This is a very
interesting question. I made the decision to go commercial in 1992.
The computer world back then was totally different from today.
There was essentially no high-end graphics hardware available,
except in a very few niche markets. Writing good software on
PC-type hardware to compete with the workstations was always a
challenge to me. The only way for me to finance development (which
involved buying the board, for example) was to go
commercial.</p><p>Also, remember that there was no Linux or FreeBSD movement,
so the phenomenon that other people would contribute as we
currently see with Linux was simply unheard of at that time. The
transition itself was fairly easy&mdash;suddenly the limitations on how
to get hardware were gone. The original X Server quickly moved
forward during this time, both in technology and in driver
support.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: Did your X server
code always support Linux? Why did you choose to port to
Linux?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Thomas</b></span>: Initially, Linux was
not supported, since all of that predates Linux by quite some time.
We had an experimental Linux port running in late 1994. Keep in
mind that an X Server is, to a large extent, really independent of
the underlying operating system. To be honest, back then we did not
expect the &ldquo;Linux Phenomenon&rdquo; at all.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: Do you intend to
stay with Linux as a platform of choice?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Thomas</b></span>: Linux today
addresses all the issues which the commercial Unix systems in the
early 90s did not address. Systems such as SCO and UnixWare
attempted to become players in the desktop arena, but were not too
successful. Linux, however, definitively succeeded in the desktop
arena and now is a viable alternative to the Microsoft-based
systems. Our move to support CDE under Linux clearly shows that we
do view Linux as one of the key cross-platform operating systems of
today and tomorrow.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: Tell us something
to the origins of Xi Graphics. How you met Jeremy Chatfield and how
you reached the decision to found a company together?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Thomas</b></span>: I have known Jeremy
for quite a while. He actually gave me my first job in the U.S., a
short three-month stint during a summer break from college. Our
paths crossed quite frequently after that, so he was the obvious
choice when it came time to found this venture. He was living in
Denver at the time, which was the reason the company was
headquartered here. It turned out to be one of our best
choices.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: Why did you change
your company name from X Inside to Xi Graphics? How has the name
change affected business?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Thomas</b></span>: I've been so
involved in working on our new product release for this Fall, I
haven't given much thought to the name change, which was designed
to distance ourselves from X-rated Internet hits. But, I do know
that as Xi Graphics we're certainly keeping busy!</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: Tell us about the
design decisions for AcceleratedX, in particular, why you chose a
design that features client, server and window manager as separate
entities. Would you change it, if you were designing it
today?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Thomas</b></span>: Actually this is not
a decision we made. This is inherently built into the X Windows
system. The separation of clients, server and window-manager makes
a lot of sense. In order to make them interact, you need to have
very well-defined and understood interfaces. The X Windows system
has a network protocol with an exact specification of the
operations and semantics. If you compare this to Windows 95 where
the interface is only loosely defined, if at all, you'll see a big
advantage since you don't have to guess. It is true that this
separation initially caused problems. The separation meant that
there were many different window-managers available, and there were
two major GUI toolkits&mdash;OpenLook and Motif&mdash;out there. This
competition, on the other hand, helped move the whole system
forward in a short time. Those issues are now resolved and the
Motif GUI style is the de facto standard.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: Just how fast is
AcceleratedX? How does it compare to XFree86?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Thomas</b></span>: This actually comes
down to the question of &ldquo;what is speed?&rdquo; We at Xi Graphics are
always faced with a two-fold challenge. First, to make our product
as stable as possible and comply with the X-Protocol specification,
which is quite strict about what should and should not appear on
the screen. Speed comes in second. If there is a trade-off between
speed and correctness, we do sacrifice speed. This does not mean
our drivers are slower. It just means they could be even faster if
we would ignore some hardware problems of the graphics
devices.</p><p>Now to the tricky point&mdash;how do you compare speed?
Obviously, we want to have a fair benchmark that represents a real
world scenario, rather than a meaningless number. With new and
faster hardware, older benchmarks that gave meaningful results in
1989 are not appropriate anymore. The X Performance
Characterization group (XPC) observed this dilemma a few years ago
and came up with a new benchmark that exercises a lot of different
operations in a real world scenario. This is one of the reasons why
we are not especially focusing on measurements such as stones or
engine, but rather those real world numbers which give real
results.</p><p>The other key question is&mdash;how to compare performance if one
X Server performs the correct way and the other one doesn't? For
example, what if one X Server draws lines using software because
the hardware does not comply with the X-Protocol specs, and the
other X Server uses the hardware, but produces incorrect results?
Putting all those issues aside, AcceleratedX usually is more than
two times faster than competing products.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: What improvements
have been added in the latest release? Exactly what is &ldquo;overlay
technology&rdquo;?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Thomas</b></span>: We are constantly
improving our products in many areas that traditionally do not
appear on a feature list. In the latest release, we've focused on
getting memory usage down, which is prompted by certain
applications such as Netscape being down significantly. Issues like
inter-activity have been addressed by making the X Server virtually
multi-threaded. Color correctness, which is especially well
supported within the X Windows system by the Xcms API, has been
significantly enhanced. We now offer hardware gamma corrected
visuals, along with the software that is required for programmers
to take advantage of this feature, so that one application
displaying the same image on two different monitors will look
identical.</p><p>The most important new feature, however, is the introduction
of overlays or &ldquo;multiple visuals&rdquo; as I prefer to call it.
Everyone using applications similar to Netscape will at some time
experience those nasty pop-up messages stating that the application
could not get enough colors and is not willing to run. On the other
hand, if a configuration with more than 256 colors is selected,
other applications won't run at all. With our new release we do
address this problem by allowing both application classes to run at
the same time. Basically, an application can choose whether it
wants to run within a 256 color PseudoColor scenario or a 16
million TrueColor mode. Because most color-intensive applications
will choose the 16 million color visual, all the &ldquo;Technicolor&rdquo;
effects are gone as well. Everyone in our office started using this
special mode (which only Xi Graphics has on Intel UNIX) after
seeing it the first time.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: Give us your
thoughts on the evolution of hardware from &ldquo;slow and expensive&rdquo;
to &ldquo;fast and cheap&rdquo;.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Thomas</b></span>: It's the traditional
story in the PC market. A couple of years ago there was no market
for high-end graphics solutions, except maybe in the CAD sector.
So, quite naturally, there were only a few highly specialized and
expensive solutions. GUIs around 1992 were mostly text-based (if
you want to call that GUI), so there was really no need for more
and faster graphics hardware.</p><p>The turning point was really the original IBM 8514/A graphics
accelerator. This was the first fixed-function graphics accelerator
for the IBM PC. Fixed-function means here that there is not an
extra general purpose CPU on a huge printed circuit board with a
lot of additional logic. Almost all the hardware today has its
roots in this design. The real revolution came in late 1992 when
&ldquo;S3&rdquo;, a then-unknown company, created a single chip solution that
combined the VGA standard with an 8514/A clone graphics
accelerator. Similar developments then made the MS-Windows desktop
system usable. This in turn started the whole rush of making
graphics subsystems faster, and fostered the attitude, &ldquo;if you
can't beat your competition with performance, make it
cheaper.&rdquo;</p><p>When I look back to the first graphics system for which I
wrote an X Server (which, of course, was top of the line then) and
what is now available for about $300, there is an increased
performance factor of 250.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: What about your
other product, CDE, Common Desktop Environment? Exactly, what kind
of environment are you providing the user? Which platforms does it
support?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Thomas</b></span>: As outlined above,
the X Windows system actually consists of a number of different
components. CDE provides a robust standard for both programmers and
end users that utilize the different components. The normal user
sees a desktop manager and a number of essential productivity
utilities&mdash;such as calendar manager, note pad, file manager and
help system, to name a few. So it's way more than the fancy window
manager to which it is compared.</p><p>Even the brief description I gave does not address the key
potential, which is that CDE is completely network-oriented. The
calendar manager, for example, can contact other machines and
coordinate appointments with other people. Technologies such as
ToolTalk and remote execution are integral parts of CDE, and CDE is
not available just for Linux and FreeBSD. Basically, every major
workstation vendor picked up CDE as the standard Unix desktop
interface. It does not matter whether you use a Sun SPARCStation,
an IBM RS/6000 or your Linux system at home, CDE will work for you.
Much emphasis has been placed on the aspect of
internationalization. CDE is the first Desktop Environment that
allows application developers to develop truly internationalized
applications. A single program is able to support Japanese as well
as German or English. Of course, the desktop itself comes with
support for a wide variety of out-of-the-box supported
languages.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: What does the
future hold for Xi Graphics? for Linux? for yourself?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Thomas</b></span>: We continue to focus
on being the prime supplier of networked graphics solutions. This
will not be limited just to the core X Server and the Desktop. We
are positioning ourselves to provide a Desktop solution that is a
valuable alternative in the Microsoft dominated PC market. Linux is
certainly the operating system of choice to do that on a
cross-platform level. As for myself, there are a lot of things I
haven't tried yet. Currently, my team at Xi Graphics is trying to
convince me that base jumping* is not the thing to try out next
weekend.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: Any thoughts you'd
like to leave us with?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Thomas</b></span>: Live long and
prosper!</p><p>*Mr. Roell seems to like danger. Base jumping is parachuting
off buildings, mountains and other things with only a few hundred
feet for the parachute to open fully.*</p></div></div>
