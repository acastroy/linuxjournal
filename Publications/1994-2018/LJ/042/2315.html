    DDD provides a graphical user interface for the Unix
    debuggers, gdb and dbx. This article gives a good
    introduction to its many features.
    </p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2315f3.jpg"></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2434580.0x252c450"></a></h2></div></div><p> One of the most common uses for Linux
today is as a platform for program development. The rich suite of
GNU software that comprises this platform is one of the most
comprehensive development environments in existence. However, one
universal quality of these tools has been both the reason for their
success and their weakness when competing with other products&mdash;the
character or command-line based interfaces.
</p><p>On the other hand, a character-based interface requires that
the user be familiar with its intricacies. New users are usually
baffled because they don't know the magic commands and keystrokes.
For this reason, many commercial programming suites provide an
integrated windows-based environment. This almost always severely
limits the programmer' use of tools&mdash;For instance, it may be
impossible to use the tool in a script. Vendors consider these
limitations a small sacrifice to make when the gain or loss of a
new user is at stake.</p><p>The Unix environment has long lacked freely available,
graphical, easy-to-use programming tools. The
<span   class="bold"><b>ddd</b></span> command addresses this lack of
graphical tools by providing a graphical user interface for the
Unix debuggers <span   class="bold"><b>gdb</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>dbx</b></span>.</p><p>The debugger is an essential part of any programming
environment, providing two basic capabilities:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Running a program interactively in order to observe
the code execute and test for bugs</p></li><li><p>Examining the core dump of a crashed process</p></li></ol></div><p>The standard Linux debugger is gdb, the GNU debugger. gdb
provides an interactive text-base method for accomplishing those
two tasks, including step-by-step execution, breakpoints, variable
watch and other options that are expected in a full-fledged
debugger. However, gdb is not easy to run&mdash;lots of experience is
needed to fully operate gdb, and even then it tends to be somewhat
awkward. To the rescue comes ddd&mdash;an X Windows front end to both
the gdb debugger and the dbx debugger.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2434580.0x252c978"></a>Installation</h2></div></div><p>The ddd homepage is at http://www.cs.tu-bs.de/softech/ddd/,
and the latest version (as of writing) is ddd 2.1.1.
<span   class="bold"><b>ddd</b></span> requires Motif to execute;
however, the latest versions apparently compile and run fine with
the free Motif clone, Lesstif. Also, a statically-linked version of
Motif is provided, although it is a very large binary that will hog
memory. After compiling ddd (or downloading the binary), place the
binary in a convenient location (/usr/local/bin, for
example).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2434580.0x252cad8"></a>Outline</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>ddd</b></span> is a front end&mdash;it
doesn't do any debugging. Instead, it sends all user commands to an
actively running gdb (or dbx) process. The ddd environment consists
of four important windows:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>The &ldquo;Debugger Window&rdquo; contains the actual
communication between gdb and ddd. This window always displays the
standard I/O of the debugged program.</p></li><li><p>The &ldquo;Source Window&rdquo; contains the program source
and the basic source debugging actions.</p></li><li><p>The &ldquo;Command Tool Window&rdquo; contains buttons for
most of the actions you'll need; stepping up and down stack,
setting breakpoints, etc.</p></li><li><p>The &ldquo;Data Window&rdquo; contains all data-related
information, such as variable and function watching.</p></li></ol></div><p>To use ddd, write a program and compile it, using the
<span   class="bold"><b>gcc</b></span> command with the
<b  >-g</b> switch set so that debugging information is
included.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
gcc hello.c -g -o hello
</pre><p>Then run ddd. Upon startup, only the debugger console opens.
You must open the executable (or core dump) via the
<b  >File</b> menu; then, open the Command Tool Window
and the Source Window. If you wish to manipulate data as well, open
the Data Window via the <b  >Window</b> menu.
</p><p>At this point you can start running the program and
diagnosing any problems. First, set a breakpoint, a line of code at
which the debugger should stop running the program and wait for
instructions. Click on a code line and then set the breakpoint by
clicking the <b  >Break at()</b> button; a &ldquo;red stop
sign&rdquo; appears next to the line to mark the breakpoint. You can
clear it at any time by clicking on the line and pressing the
<b  >Clear at()</b> button.</p><p>Start running the program by clicking the
<b  >Run</b> button in the Command Tool Window. The
program executes, just as if you had started it at the prompt, but
stops immediately on reaching the first breakpoint. Now you can
continue program execution line-by-line in one of two
ways&mdash;<b  >Step</b> and <b  >Next</b>.
<b  >Step</b> executes the line of code, and if that line
is a function for which the code exists, <b  >Step</b>
enters the function code and steps through it.
<b  >Next</b> executes the function and proceeds to the
next line. Note that a &ldquo;green arrow&rdquo; marks the line that is to be
executed. After moving through the program code using
<b  >Step</b> and <b  >Next</b> for a while,
you can press the <b  >Continue</b> button to continue
running the program until the next breakpoint is reached or until
program end, if no more breakpoints are set.</p><p>Executing portions of code and playing around with
breakpoints can be nice, but there's substantially more to
debugging. A vital part of debugging is observing how the program
manipulates data. Since ddd is a graphical application, it can
contribute most where data visualization is used.</p><p>Begin debugging a program that manipulates variables by
opening the Data Window. During the debugging process, select a
variable by clicking the left mouse button on it and then press the
<b  >Display()</b> button; the variable and its value
will appear in the Data Window. Executing any line of code that
modifies that particular variable changes the representation in the
Data Window. You can, of course, create more than one variable
&ldquo;watch&rdquo; and even position them in the window as you like. You can
create a function watch by clicking the right mouse button in the
Data Window and then choosing <b  >New Display</b>. With
this option you can enter any valid C expression and have it
evaluated.</p><p>Variable and function visualization is not unfamiliar to gdb
users. However, one of the most amazing things in ddd is
visualizing pointers; for example, create an integer pointer and
have it point to an integer. Create a watch on the pointer. In the
content section of the watch, you will see the memory address of
the integer pointed at. Click on the content and then click the
<b  >Dereference()</b> button. At this point a new cell
is created, containing the integer variable, with an arrow
extending from the pointer to the integer. Taking this concept a
little further means that you can graphically visualize complex
data structures, structures, arrays and almost anything you wish.
For example, Figure 1 displays the source code for a linked list,
while Figure 2 displays the ddd visualization of it.</p><p><a href="2315f1.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 1.
Source Window</b></span></a></p><p><a href="2315f2.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 2. Data
Window</b></span></a></p><p>Another worthy feature of ddd is its help system&mdash;a very
useful context-sensitive mechanism, help can be tapped by pressing
f1 and then clicking anything in ddd. Additionally, a more complete
and methodical manual can be opened from the Help menu, offering
menu-based text pages with examples.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2434580.0x252daa8"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>ddd</b></span> has more features than I
have covered here; however, this article should give you a good
start. It is refreshing to see Unix enter the modern era with
graphical front ends which do not limit the user. When I first
found ddd, I was quite impressed at its potential for novice Unix
programmers. However, I also find myself firing it up quite often,
even though I am a fully &ldquo;qualified&rdquo; Unix hacker with many gdb
scars. The simplicity and elegance of ddd will make even the most
die-hard shell fanatic roll over and accept it in many
situations.</p></div></div>
