book to teach Python programming to intermediate and advanced
programmers.</p><p>Authors Watters, van Rossum and Ahlstrom are well qualified
to write about their subject: van Rossum is the primary author of
the Python language; Watters works for AT&amp;T Laboratories on
exploratory Internet applications; Ahlstrom is the original author
of the WPY/Python GUI package. All three authors can be found
actively contributing to the Python mailing list and the
comp.lang.python newsgroup.</p><p>Chapter One briefly describes the strengths and weaknesses of
Python. As Python is a dynamically typed, object oriented, general
purpose language built from a small number of constructs, it is
both powerful and easy to learn and use. Because it is interpreted,
it is suitable for rapid prototyping and program development.
Because it easily incorporates modules written in other languages,
it is an excellent glue language for the overall structure of large
programming projects. Python is not suitable for programming
algorithms which require very rapid or time critical execution such
as data compression, device drivers, complex floating point
calculations or complex database operations.</p><p>Chapter Two gives a birds-eye view of Python and Chapter
Three is a fun and humorous hands-on tutorial which gives the
reader some experience working with actual Python constructs and
code.</p><p>Chapters Four, Five and Six present the Python language in a
more formal and systematic way. The authors recommend these
chapters for later reference rather than for detailed reading.
Although these chapters are quite complete, they are not intended
to replace the reference manual that comes with the Python
distribution.</p><p>To illustrate the virtues of programming in Python, Chapters
Seven, Eight and Nine introduce three of the most abstruse
applications of Internet programming&mdash;the dynamic generation of
HTML documents, CGI programming, and programming Internet
protocols&mdash;and show how Python easily and elegantly deals with the
programming issues involved.</p><p>The authors are teachers at heart and take pains to briefly
and lucidly explain each of these applications before delving into
their Python solutions&mdash;solutions which illustrate and justify some
of Python's most powerful features: multiple inheritance, dynamic
attribute access, dynamic keyword arguments and use of the
extensive Python tools, libraries, modules and demos that come with
the Python distribution.</p><p>Python's object-oriented features make it a convenient
language for implementing a graphical user interface. Chapter Ten
introduces Tkinter and WPY, two class libraries developed for that
purpose, and goes on to use WPY to develop a very interesting HTML
viewer application that could very easily be enhanced to become a
simple web browser.</p><p>Chapter Eleven is an introduction to writing C language
extensions which can be used to add new basic functionality to
Python. According to the authors, &ldquo;Extending Python is easy, so
easy in fact that playing with Python extensions might be an
excellent way to learn the C programming language...&rdquo; They
illustrate extending Python with an example called BStream that has
the practical application of conveniently manipulating large
images.</p><p>Python can be embedded as a component of another main
program. As an example, Chapter Twelve shows how to embed Python
under any Netscape HTTP Server product that supports the NSAPI
server component API. This might be useful to provide dynamic CGI
server functionality to a web server without the overhead of
running separate CGI processes for each request.</p><p>Appendices give a brief guide to the Python standard
libraries and a very useful tutorial on regular expressions.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Internet Programming with Python</em></span> comes
with a handy CD-ROM which includes the complete 1.3 and 1.4b2
versions of Python as well as source code for all the Python
examples given in the book. Executable versions are included for
DOS, Windows 3.1, 95 and NT, Macintosh and all of the popular Unix
platforms, including Linux.</p><p>Overall, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Internet Programming with
Python</em></span> is an outstanding read. The discursive portions
of the book alone, in sections such as &ldquo;How CGI Works,&rdquo; are well
worth the effort.</p><p>Authors Watters, van Rossum and Ahlstrom write with wit and
wisdom. They demonstrate a genuine knack for making complex
subjects easy. They gently introduce the reader to the nuts and
bolts of the Python language. At the same time, they consistently
stay with their secondary theme by drawing all of their examples
from Internet programming. And they clearly explain the application
of Internet programming as they go.</p><p>The single negative is that there are a disturbingly large
number of errors in the text and examples. Corrections to these
have been published on the Python web site at
http://www.python.org/. I strongly urge any reader who is not an
experienced programmer to get and apply these corrections before
reading the book.</p><p>With that single caveat, anyone interested in programming
should read <span   class="emphasis"><em>Internet Programming with
Python.</em></span></p><p>As <span   class="emphasis"><em>Internet Programming with Python</em></span>
amply proves, Python is a general purpose programming language
which, because of its advanced features, easy extensibility and
ability to incorporate modules from other programming languages, is
an ideal first programming language that will greatly simplify and
accelerate the development of many applications of arbitrary
complexity.</p><p>After reading only the first three chapters, the reader will
begin to understand why Python is rapidly becoming the language of
choice for many programmers.</p><p>As Python is included in most Linux distributions, and some,
such as Red Hat, make extensive use of Python in the systems
administration tools they provide, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Internet Programming
with Python</em></span> should be on the bookshelf of every Linux
user.</p></div></div>
