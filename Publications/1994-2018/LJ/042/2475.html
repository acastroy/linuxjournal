column, he said that Corel's license to Caldera for WordPerfect
allows its use only on Caldera's version of Linux.</p><p>Corel's web page (http://www.corel.com/) has links which lead
to a page on http://www.sdcorp.com/ for WordPerfect 7, showing it
as certified for Red Hat, Slackware and OpenLinux, without
mentioning any restrictions on using other versions of Linux. The
current Corel port is WP 6, which is getting fairly old now. The
Corel/SDCORP web pages say that WordPerfect 7 for Linux will be
available in June (until a few days ago, it said May).</p><p>&mdash;Bob Nielsen nielsen@primenet.com</p><p>I was referring to the use of WordPerfect 6, the only one
available at the time. All new Caldera licensing will allow use on
other Linux platforms.</p><p>&mdash;Phil Hughes info@linuxjournal.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2238580.0x2330348"></a>Bliss</h2></div></div><p>&ldquo;The first virus able to infect a Linux system has been

advertising dollars simply obligate you to propagate untruths which
the marketing-driven McAffe Associates has spread about this

discovered some errors in the published article &ldquo;Porting
Scientific and Engineering Programs to Linux&rdquo;, which I wrote with
Charles Kelsey.</p><p>In the first line of the fifth paragraph, there is a
reference to NCBO code. I don't know what NCBO means. In the
manuscript that I submitted this line read &ldquo;One thing that makes
porting this code to a new platform somewhat challenging is that it
is a safety related, pedigreed code.&rdquo; Perhaps you intended for the
final product to read, &ldquo;One thing that makes porting the MCNP4a
code to a new platform somewhat challenging is that it is a safety
related, pedigreed code.&rdquo;</p><p>Also, in Listing 1. FORTRAN Patch File, whoever retyped the
patch file typed less than symbols (&lt;) where there should have
been commas (,). Humorous and quite understandable, since they're
on the same key. Fortunately, the files offered for download at URL
ftp://ftp.linuxjournal.com/pub/lj/listings/issue39/2177.tgz appear to be
correct.</p><p>Thank you for your attention and for the opportunity to share
with the Linux community.</p><p>&mdash;Gary Masters gmasters@devcg.denver.co.us</p><p>Please accept my apologies for these inadvertent changes in
your text.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2238580.0x2330920"></a>Correction to Correction</h2></div></div><p>Regarding the Correction in the July issue, page 93, I would
have thought that most Unix C programmers would know that the
<span   class="bold"><b>main()</b></span> function in C is required
to return an integer result. Thus, the correct first code line for
Richard Sevenich's main() is:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
int main()
</pre><p>not <b  >void&nbsp;main()</b>. See Steve Summit's
excellent comp.lang.c FAQ for a more in-depth explanation. There
seems to be more than enough confusion about this point propagated
by the DOS/Windows crowd without <i  >LJ</i>
contributing to it as well.

[July 1997], the authors [Charles Kelsey and Gary Masters]
write:</p><p>&ldquo;The <span   class="bold"><b>f2c</b></span> has inherent
limitations, leaving <span   class="bold"><b>g77</b></span> as the
only viable alternative for compiling large, complex applications
written in FORTRAN 77 under Linux.&rdquo;</p><p>I was amazed to read such a blanket dismissal of f2c. At
Berger Financial Research, we've been using f2c to compile FORTRAN
since kernel .99pl8. We write volumes of FORTRAN and use standard
libraries such as SLATEC, LAPACK, MINPACK and various routines from
TOMS. The last time we had a problem with f2c was a couple of years
ago, and the maintainer fixed it within a week of reporting
it.</p><p>What exactly are the &ldquo;inherent limitations&rdquo; of f2c that the
authors refer to?</p><p>&mdash;Dr. Harvey J. Stein abel@netvision.net.il</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2238580.0x2330f50"></a>Java Articles?</h2></div></div><p>Why don't you ever have articles on Java in the WWWsmith
section? It seems all you ever cover is Perl and CGI. Is WWWsmith
supposed to be about web programming or web mastering? If it's
supposed to be about web programming, I think Java topics are very
important (probably more than Perl, CGI and SQL). I mean, which
gets more press coverage?</p><p>&mdash;Jeff Warren jwarren@sun.science.wayne.edu</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Perl and CGI seem to predominate because Reuven
Lerner, the author of the &ldquo;At the Forge&rdquo; columns, likes to write
about them. We have four Java articles promised to us by various
authors that have not yet come in. We also have an article about
Java and the kernel that will be published soon, and Java was the
focus of the October, 1996 issue of</em></span> <i  >LJ</i>, so it is not a
subject we have ignored.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2238580.0x23311b8"></a>Possible Improvement to Magazine</h2></div></div><p>I was trying to find a local store that sells Linux
distribution CD-ROMS. I ended up buying a book with Red Hat 4.1,
Slackware and Caldera's Lite version from Barnes &amp; Noble
($59.99 US&mdash;good deal, comparatively speaking). Many popular
computer magazines package shareware or demo CD-ROMs with their
magazines, so why couldn't <i  >Linux Journal</i> print
a special edition for newbies that would include a CD with a
working distribution of Linux? If you released a quarterly edition
for $10-$15 US, I would buy it just because I hate downloading
updates. If you use my idea, send me a free subscription or
something (assuming I'm not the 10,000th person to suggest
this).</p><p>&mdash;Joshua Neal tinara@null.net</p><p>Well, you're certainly not the first to suggest it. It's on
our list of &ldquo;things we'd like to do sometime&rdquo;.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2238580.0x23313c8"></a>XForms Article</h2></div></div><p>I really appreciated the article &ldquo;Programming with the
XForms Library&rdquo; [Thor Sigvaldason, July 1997]. I am looking
forward to the next two segments of that series.</p><p>I am a Software Engineer with a day job developing
exclusively for Windows 95 and NT. I am in the process of
developing a large application in Java that will run on the NC, but
that is the first project that I have worked on outside the realm
of Microsoft platforms.</p><p>I have a personal interest in pursuing development in Linux.
As far as I am concerned, you could dedicate 90% of the Journal to
development and the other 10% to configuring the system. I realize
that this probably doesn't line up with most of your readers'
interests (and I am probably exaggerating a bit anyway), but I
think there are a lot of Linux users, novice as well as
experienced, who would appreciate seeing a little more space
dedicated to development.</p><p>&mdash;Jeff Brown jbrown@fastrans.net</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2238580.0x23315d8"></a>XForms Article</h2></div></div><p>This is a response to an article by Thor Sigvaldason in Issue
39 of <i  >LJ</i>, titled &ldquo;Programming with the XForms
Library&rdquo;:</p><p>How can you encourage people to write programs using the
XForms library? Since the sources aren't free, only a selected
range of platforms are supported.</p><p>Furthermore, the most recent version of this library is
(v0.81) available for Linux only in ELF format. What will those
people do, who are using the a.out binary format for good reasons?
Well, nothing, because the latest a.out library is v0.80j, which is
incompatible with v0.81. And the authors of the XForms library
aren't going to support the a.out format in the future.</p><p>In my opinion, this is contrary to the spirit of those who
developed Linux initially. It was meant to be a free Unix system
based on free tools and a free kernel. (With maybe one exception,
Motif, which is an established standard for nearly every available
platform.) XForms doesn't fulfill this criterion.</p><p>&mdash;Thomas Ott Labalutsch@aol.com</p></div></div>
