I wish I could say it was an exercise in TCP/IP wizardry, but
thanks to the program's careful engineering, it was really nothing
of notice. At work, I noticed a little-used Sun SPARCstation 4 not
connected to the outside world. Since I had wanted to experiment
with <span   class="bold"><b>http</b></span> and the Web for a long
time, I downloaded a Solaris binary of Apache from the canonical
ftp site, uncommented a couple of lines in the configuration files,
started the <span   class="bold"><b>http</b></span> daemon and went
to look for coffee. I added a script for starting and stopping
Apache on system boot and shutdown and haven't touched it since. As
far as I know, &ldquo;Little Sparky&rdquo; is still happily serving HTML to
all interested parties.</p><p>After over a year of faithful service, I felt it was time to
add some whizbang to Little Sparky. Being a big fan both of &ldquo;In a
Nutshell&rdquo; books and the Apache http server, I jumped at the chance
to read and review <span   class="emphasis"><em>Apache, The Definitive
Guide</em></span>. I was not disappointed. The book actually lives
up to its bold claim, as it contains everything you will ever want
to know about the world's most popular web server, although
sometimes the information provided is quite terse.</p><p>Weighing in at a little over 250 pages, the book can be
roughly divided into three sections, each more advanced than the
previous. The authors warn that unless stated otherwise, all
information is applicable to Apache version 1.1.1, and they admit
that Apache is a moving target. Keeping the book current with the
latest code development has not been an easy task.</p><p>The first part of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Apache, The Definitive
Guide</em></span> covers, among other things, basic server
operations, CGI scripting and user authentication.</p><p>The second part addresses more specialized needs such as
language arbitration (i.e., delivering specialized content in
response to the browser's preferred language setting), server-side
includes and the use of Apache as a proxy server.</p><p>Finally, the third part caters to the more adventurous
palates. Intrepid webmasters wishing to extend and modify Apache's
standard behavior are treated to three chapters on the Apache API
and on writing custom Apache modules. Not surprisingly, one of the
authors is a member of the core Apache programming team.
Alternatively, if you like to search the web for ready-made
features not included in the base distribution, you can read about
the most popular contributed modules, such as FastCGI, a server
module designed to improve the execution of CGI scripts.</p><p>The book travels at a fast pace throughout&mdash;sometimes a
little too fast, given the richness and complexity of the
information available on Apache. Take virtual hosting, for example.
Virtual hosts are a popular means for Internet service providers to
offer rented web space to different domains using the same
machine.</p><p>Virtual hosts are introduced as early as Chapter 3, and the
topic is immediately exhausted by handling
<span   class="bold"><b>httpd</b></span> and Unix configuration in a
scant three pages. Another case in point is cookies, a clever
device invented by Netscape to counter the Web's inherent
<span   class="emphasis"><em>statelessness</em></span>. Cookies are given only cursory
coverage while describing the server configuration directive
<b  >CookieTracking</b>. Personally, I would have wished
for a more extensive discussion.</p><p>The authors give plenty of examples whenever they introduce a
new concept or topic. All of the code, HTML documents and
configuration files are neatly organized on the companion CD-ROM,
so that you can exactly reproduce the sample sites simply by
copying the appropriate directory tree to your hard disk.</p><p>A word of warning&mdash;while the authors briefly summarize the
workings of Unix and TCP/IP, you <span   class="emphasis"><em>really</em></span> need
to be competent in both before you pick up this book. Also, it
helps if you have a correctly configured system before you start
playing with the examples provided.</p><p>If you have a slow link to the Internet, you will appreciate
the added convenience of two Apache distributions on the
accompanying CD-ROM. You get both a stable 1.1.1 and a more
advanced, but potentially misbehaving, 1.2b4. The distributions are
all source code, as the book is not geared specifically to Linux.
However, compilation and installation is straightforward and
complete directions are given at the beginning of the book.</p><p>I liked <span   class="emphasis"><em>Apache, The Definitive Guide</em></span> for
a number of reasons. In short, the book has everything you need to
get started with the Apache web server, and to help you progress
from there to more complex operations. I believe it complements
nicely the skimpy &ldquo;official&rdquo; documentation available on Apache's
web site. Thanks to its broad coverage of topics, the book should
appeal to both beginners and experienced webmasters.</p></div></div>
