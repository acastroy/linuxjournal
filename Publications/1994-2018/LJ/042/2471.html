    It was recently (meaning a few hours ago) called to my attention
    that
    there is an organization called the I2O Special Interest Group that is
    addressing this problem.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x194f580.0x1a47298"></a></h2></div></div><p>If you have been around the PC industry
for a while, you most likely remember that the ISA architecture (AT
bus as it was initially called) was recognized as not the best
answer for high performance I/O, because of speed limitations and
rather poor interrupt structure. Enter IBM with its MicroChannel
architecture. All you had to do was pay IBM money, and you could
use the design. Some manufacturers bought in, but it soon flopped
because what the industry really wanted was an open standard. In
fact, AT bus became ISA (Industry Standard Architecture) because of
IBM's proprietary approach.
</p><p>However, ISA still wasn't the answer. The first issue, bus
speed, was addressed with the PCI bus which, being wider and
faster, has satisfied the bandwidth requirements of I/O hungry
systems. But, as the speed of everything has increased, so has the
number of interrupts that must be dealt with.</p><p>The best solution is to have intelligent peripherals that
don't have to interrupt the CPU as often in order to carry out
their tasks. The most common example today is the buffered serial
card UARTs (universal asynchronous receiver/transmitter). Another
is intelligent serial cards that enable the transfer hundreds or
thousands of characters in a single DMA (direct memory access)
transfer and the take care of the character-by-character transfer
themselves.</p><p>Each intelligent I/O card requires a driver for system
communications. More accurately, a driver is needed for each
operating system that wishes to talk to the card; thus,
manufacturers must invest in support of each system. This
investment means that most vendors tend to support only the most
popular operating systems.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x194f580.0x1a474a8"></a>Enter A Solution?</h2></div></div><p>It was recently (meaning a few hours ago) called to my
attention that there is an organization called the I2O Special
Interest Group that is addressing this problem. Here are a few
quotes from their web page:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The objective is to provide an open,
standards-based approach ... and provide a framework for the rapid
development of a new generation of portable, intelligent I/O
solutions.</p></li><li><p>The I2O model provides an ideal environment for
creating drivers that are portable across multiple operating
systems and host platforms.</p></li><li><p>The I2O model is intended to provide a unifying
approach to device driver design...</p></li></ul></div><p>They also pose the question, &ldquo;Do you see the Unix vendors
supporting I2O in their future releases?&rdquo; and answer it by
stating, &ldquo;SCO is a SIG member and has indicated it will support
I2O in future releases of its OS. The SIG welcomes all other Unix
vendors to join as well.&rdquo;</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x194f580.0x1a47870"></a>Is Everything Cool?</h2></div></div><p>All of this rhetoric sounds like we are all friends, and we
will all interoperate happily ever after. However, there does seem
to be a catch.</p><p>In one of those <span   class="bold"><b>nice</b></span> answers
about compatibility, we see our first clue that there is a
potential problem: &ldquo;The SIG is set up so that only members and
their licensees can design with the specification,....&rdquo; Even more
to the point: &ldquo;The I2O Specification...is an
<span   class="emphasis"><em>agreement</em></span> about the intellectual content and
the terms and conditions for how the Specification can be used.
Therefore, to make the Specification available to non-members a
non-disclosure agreement must be executed.&rdquo;</p><p>I have attempted to contact them for clarification but, so
far, they have not returned either my phone call or e-mail.</p><p>I'm sure all Linux folks are familiar with the non-disclosure
problem. Non-disclosure is why Diamond video boards weren't
supported until Diamond changed their mind, and why Linux for the
Mac didn't exist for years. To put it another way, you can't comply
with both the GPL and a non-disclosure agreement.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x194f580.0x1a47b30"></a>What Can We Do?</h2></div></div><p>Fight&mdash;not let someone who claims they are making an open
standard get away with an &ldquo;open to anyone except free software&rdquo;
standard. The first organization to take action is Software in the
Public Interest, the same folks who bring us Debian Linux. I have
just received a draft of a proposal for an Open Hardware
Certification Program. In this program, vendors will make a set of
promises about the availability of documentation for programming
the device-driver interface of the specific hardware device.</p><p>The idea here is that while the program will not guarantee a
device driver is available for a specific device and operating
system, it does guarantee that anyone who wants to write one can
get the information necessary to do so.</p><p>I am sure there will be more on this topic on the Usenet
newsgroups, on the web and in the press. If you are a vendor,
contact SPI (http://www.debian.org/ will point you in the right
direction) for more information on their certification program. If
you are a potentially unhappy consumer, check out
http://www.io2sig.com/ and let the SIG members know what you think
about the exclusion of free software from their
<span   class="bold"><b>open</b></span> standard and about SPI's
effort for real open hardware. Finally, watch the
<i  >LJ</i> web pages for news on what is happening in
this important battle.</p></div></div>
