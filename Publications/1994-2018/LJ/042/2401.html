    This article describes some of the design goals of F, a new
    programming language, and introduces most of the language specifics.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25fd580.0x26f5920"></a></h2></div></div><p>With the F programming language, the
authors combine over forty years of language-design committee
experience to create the world's most portable, yet efficient,
powerful, yet simple programming language. The recent attention
commanded by the portability and power of Java is well-timed, as we
show in F that efficiency and readability need not be made victims
of cross-platform development.
</p><p>Before diving into the F programming language definition,
this article begins with some biased-but-almost-factual opinions of
the authors. We admit it&mdash;we are not fans of C and C++.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25fd580.0x26f5a80"></a>Some Driving Opinions</h2></div></div><p>Listing a few facts and myths about programming languages
will help set the stage for the discussion of F. These opinions may
communicate some of the ideas behind the F programming language
design, allowing one to better understand the motivations of the
authors and thus the language.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Fact 1:</b></span> Programs are read
more often than written. From your first programming assignment
throughout your professional career, characters are entered
<span   class="emphasis"><em>once</em></span>, following some sort of syntax and logic,
and read and reread anywhere from twice to hundreds to thousands of
times. Programs that cannot be read are simply poor
programs.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Myth 1:</b></span> Abbrev.R++
abbreviations are good. A programming language with the overall
design of abbrev.R++ are quite popular among
thinking/creating/coding/debugging speedsters. Afterall, most
programmers learned how to program before learning how to type.
Abbreviations, however, ranging from a &ldquo;}&rdquo; instead of the word
&ldquo;end&rdquo;, &ldquo;int&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;integer&rdquo; and <b  >i++</b>
or <b  >++i</b> instead of <b  >i=i+1</b> only
add pieces to an already complicated puzzle. As with a piece of
abstract art, one day someone may look at your code and ask,
&ldquo;That's nice, but what is it?&rdquo;</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Fact 2:</b></span> Educational
languages are dead or dying. As some instructors around the world
are searching for a suitable replacement for Pascal, the majority
are going-with-the-professional-flow and switching from Pascal to
C, C++ or Java for introductory programming courses. There is no
telling where computer science would be today if a whole generation
of programmers who were brought up on Pascal in the '70s and '80s
were presented with the sink-or-swim situation of C++ or Java as a
beginning programming language. If Pascal did not exist, the odds
are that there would be fewer of us reading this article (if it or
the magazine even existed). Surely, a major factor in the rapid
evolution of computer science was the once nurturing environment
presented by Pascal.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Myth 2:</b></span> A modern educational
replacement for Pascal offers no advantages to the potential
professional programmer. Many professionals, particularly those
working on large projects, benefit from the advantages of the
strict style enforcement that a small programming language offers.
A small language can also offer reliable tools (compilers,
debuggers, profilers), reliable customer support, reliable error
messages and reliable references (textbooks and on-line
documentation). As F is a language based on existing practice,
professionals can make use of the large amount of existing debugged
code.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Fact 3:</b></span> Choosing the wrong
implementation programming language affects the overall design,
portability and maintainability of large projects. Many companies
have been dealt an expensive blow attempting to keep up with a
fast-moving multi-platformed industry with slow-moving software.
Whether the software is being enhanced with efficiency and new
features or being ported to the latest hardware, a poor choice for
the original programming language can result in a serious loss of
company resources. Until feeling the headache, it appeared that C
was an appropriate, powerful and portable choice. In the early
'90s, C++ promised more power and possibly safer features. Today,
Java proves safer and portable, but sacrifices efficiency.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Myth 3:</b></span> The software crisis
has been solved. With no solution to the software crisis in sight,
focus has been shifted towards &ldquo;market-driven&rdquo; distractions like
the <span   class="emphasis"><em>hot,new programming language</em></span> filled with
more promises than an election-year politician. Meanwhile, most
large software projects are still written in C and continue to be
delivered late, under-functioned or unstable. As long as a smaller
and simpler language does not sacrifice power, it is time for
programmers and their management to wake up to the possibility of
shipping stable, complete software on schedule. This starts with
the decision of an appropriate programming language. An appropriate
choice does not emphasize the potential salary of the programmer
leading the project, but rather:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>C</b></span>: Do we need to
access system information, trading off portability?</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>C++</b></span>: Do we need
objects and run time binding as well as accessing system
information, trading off readability and portability?</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>Java</b></span>: Do we need
objects, run time binding and portability, trading off
efficiency?</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>F</b></span>: Do we need
portability, efficiency and maintainability trading off access to
system information (unless calling C from F) and run time binding?
<span   class="bold"><b>Fact 4:</b></span> Most statements in most
programming languages fit on one line. In the average program, a
minority of the statements are split across many lines. Requiring a
semicolon at the end of every statement means requiring a semicolon
at the end of almost every line. <span   class="bold"><b>Myth
4:</b></span> Semicolons are a fact of life. Given that the end of
a line is most often the end of a statement, the trivial
programming language design decision is to use a special character
in the rarer case of needing more than one line for a statement.
Requiring a semicolon at the end of a statement is tedious and
error prone. Languages requiring a semicolon ought to be required
to present a nice error message when the semicolon is forgotten. In
F, the end of line is the end of statement. If a statement requires
more than one line, an ampersand (&ldquo;&amp;&rdquo;) is used at the end of
a line.</p></li></ol></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25fd580.0x26f6688"></a>The F Programming Language</h2></div></div><p>Starting with an internationally standardized programming
language as a base, we set out to create the world's best
programming language. Any lesser goal would result in an
interesting but not a challenging exercise.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25fd580.0x26f6790"></a>A Language Design</h2></div></div><p>Designing a programming language involves thousands of ideas
and decisions. Tradeoffs are constantly weighed between efficiency
(both compile time and run time), readability, flexibility,
familiarity, brevity, redundancy, implementation (compilers and
tools), style, elegance, completeness, internationalization,
standardization, marketability and target audience, to name just a
few. The above facts and myths and the principles listed below
helped us to avoid personality conflicts (mostly) and reach
decisions based on these goals:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Readability</p></li><li><p>Learnability without loss of professional
power</p></li><li><p>Portability and maintenance of large
programs</p></li><li><p>Minimizing unimportant syntax</p></li><li><p>Requiring words instead of relying on
defaults</p></li><li><p>Eliminating redundancy</p></li></ul></div><p>A pleasant surprise to the biased authors is the pure
elegance of F.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25fd580.0x2aeefb8"></a>F Statements</h2></div></div><p>Except for assignment (=) and pointer assignment (=&gt;), the
first word of every F statement identifies the statement. All
keywords are reserved words, allowing for specific error messages
for incorrect syntax or misspelled keywords.
<a href="2401s1.html" target="_self">Table 1</a> categorizes all the F
statements. The diagram shows that every F procedure, either a
subroutine or a function, is contained in a module.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25fd580.0x2aef118"></a>Functions Are Not Subroutines</h2></div></div><p>In F, a distinction is made between functions and
subroutines. Functions are not allowed to have &ldquo;side effects&rdquo;
such as modifying global data. All function arguments must be
intent(in); subroutine arguments can be intent(in), intent(out) or
intent(inout). The intent is required on all procedure arguments,
allowing the compiler to check for misuse and forcing both the
beginner and professional to document the intentions.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25fd580.0x2aef220"></a>Intrinsic and User Defined Types</h2></div></div><p>The intrinsic types in F are integer, real, complex,
character and logical. User-defined types can be constructed from
the intrinsic types and user-defined types. For example, a
<span   class="emphasis"><em>person</em></span> can be constructed to have a name,
height, phone number and pointer to the next person. Users can
define operators which operate on intrinsic and user-defined
types.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25fd580.0x2aef380"></a>Entity Attributes</h2></div></div><p>The attributes of an intrinsic or user-defined type in F are
shown in <a href="2401s2.html" target="_self">Table 2</a>. Pointers are
strongly typed. That is, pointers can point only to objects that
are targets. Although this idea makes solid pedagogical sense, the
words pointer and target originated for the purpose of better
compiler optimization.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25fd580.0x2aef4e0"></a>Array Language</h2></div></div><p>A sophisticated array language facilitates operations on
whole arrays, contiguous and noncontiguous sections and slices of
arrays. For example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
arr(5:1:-2, 3, 6:)
</pre><p>is a reference to the two-dimensional array created by taking
the elements 5, 3 and 1 in the first dimension of
<b  >arr</b> and elements from 6 to the upper bound of
the third dimension of <b  >arr</b>, all in the third
plan of the array. If <b  >arr</b> is a 5 by 6 by 7
array, the referenced elements would be (5,3,6), (3,3,6), (1,3,6),
(5,3,7), (3,3,7), (1,3,7).
</p><p>A simpler example that calculates the sum inner product of a
row and a column is shown here:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
A(i,j) = sum(B(i,:)*C(:,j))g
</pre><p><span   class="bold"><b>sum</b></span> is one of the more than
one hundred intrinsic procedures found in F.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25fd580.0x2aef900"></a>Modules</h2></div></div><p>Modules are at the core of all F code. Modules are a data
encapsulation mechanism that allows data to be grouped with the
procedures that operate on that data. Modules can use other
modules. As well, programs and procedures can use modules. Using a
module makes the public entities of that module available. Examples
of modules are found in <a href="2401s3.html" target="_self">Table
3</a>.</p><p>One does not instantiate an instance of a module as one does
with a class in C++ or Java. Instead, the concept of an object is
best viewed as a module that defines a public, user-defined type
together with the public procedures that operate on that type. The
user of such a module can then declare a scalar or array of the
defined type and have access to its procedures.</p><p>A public, user-defined type can be defined to have private
components, so that the type and its procedures can be referenced;
however, the parts that make up the type are private to the
defining module.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25fd580.0x2aefb10"></a>Module Oriented Programming</h2></div></div><p>Programming in F can be called module-oriented programming.
Much like Java's requirement that all procedures appear in classes,
all F procedures appear in modules. An F program that does not use
any modules cannot call any subroutines or reference any functions.
Modules can use other modules to access their public entities. A
module, however, is not allowed to use another module for the
purpose of exporting the public entities in the used module unless
the sole purpose is to collect a group of modules and make all
their public entities available from one module.</p><p>This simple yet powerful method of module inheritance allows
for an involved hierarchy of modules without complicating the
investigation required to understand somebody else's code. Any
reference to the function <span   class="bold"><b>foo</b></span> is
known at compile time to be specifically a reference to a public
function named foo in a specific module. Even without the aid of
compiler tools, F is designed so a quick search (with the aid of
<span   class="bold"><b>grep</b></span>) for the words &ldquo;function
foo&rdquo; will most likely show function foo's definition line on your
screen.</p><p>A nice educational feature of F is that every procedure must
be declared as either public or private. The result is that a
student writing a program that calls a subroutine must learn (or at
least enter) the words program, use, call, module, subroutine and
public. The public and private list also aids the professional as
the first occurrence of a procedure name in a module will tell you
if it is private and thus isolated to this module.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25fd580.0x2aefd78"></a>Overloading Procedures and Operators</h2></div></div><p>F allows overloading procedure names as well as overloading
operators. Every reference, however, is resolved at compile time.
Thus, the statement</p><pre     class="programlisting">
left = swap(int1, real2) * "hello"
</pre><p>displays an overloaded multiplication operator operating on
the result of the int1/real2 swap and the character string
&ldquo;hello&rdquo;. Also, swap can be a generic name, but it is also
resolved to a specific function at compile time. Finally, the
assignment operator (=) may also be overloaded; a mouse click on
the = could conceivably direct you to the specific subroutine that
would be called if this was not an intrinsic assignment statement.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25fd580.0x2aeff30"></a>More About F ... A Surprise?</h2></div></div><p>Before reading this section, you may want to view the example
F program found in Listing 1,1 the Sieve of Eratosthenes. to see if
you can guess what once-popular programming language F is based on.
The name of the base language is often deceiving as the little
known 1995 standard of this language is far more modern than the
popular 1977 version. As the standards team is working on making
the 2000 version even more object oriented, compilers for the 1990
version have become available from most vendors only in the last
few years. If you have not guessed yet, you may be surprised to
find out that today's best structured programming language is based
on the the world's first structured programming
language&mdash;FORTRAN.</p><p><a href="2401l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1. Sample F
Program</a></p><p>Now over 40 years old, more programmer energy has gone into
the evolving definition of FORTRAN than any other programming
language. Every F program is a FORTRAN program. With stronger
object-oriented features scheduled for the year 2000 and continued
support for the numerically intensive programmer, this recently
forgotten programming language is poised for a strong comeback
during the next decade.</p><p>A strength of FORTRAN is that the standard is constantly
being updated with new features. Vendors are relying on the
standards efforts and announcing new compilers after the
specifications have been accepted. This is a strong portability
statement when compared to languages that are attempting to
standardize after various compilers are already in the market.
Another push for portability is being made with the addition of
Part 3 of the FORTRAN standard regarding conditional compilation
expected within a year.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25fd580.0x2af0198"></a>Free For You</h2></div></div><p>The Linux educational version of F is freely downloadable.
