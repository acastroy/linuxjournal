    A thorough introduction to RPC for programmers of distributed systems.

are a vital software development technique. They provide the
leverage necessary for the implementation of all but the most
trivial of programs. Remote procedure calls (RPC) extend the
capabilities of conventional procedure calls across a network and
are essential in the development of distributed systems. They can
be used both for data exchange in distributed file and database
systems and for harnessing the power of multiple processors. Linux
distributions provide an RPC version derived from the RPC facility
developed by the Open Network Computing (ONC) group at Sun
Microsystems.

we will define them here since they will be important in later
discussion:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>Caller</b></span>: a program
which calls a subroutine</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>Callee</b></span>: a
subroutine or procedure which is called by the caller</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>Client</b></span>: a program
which requests a connection to and service from a network
server</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>Server</b></span>: a program
which accepts connections from and provides services to a
client</p></li></ul></div><p>There is a direct parallel between the caller/callee
relationship and the client/server relationship. With ONC RPC (and
with every other form of RPC that I know), the caller always
executes as a client process, and the callee always executes as a
server process.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x274f580.0x2847c38"></a>The Remote Procedure Call Mechanism</h2></div></div><p>In order for an RPC to execute successfully, several steps
must take place:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>The caller program must prepare any input
parameters to be passed to the RPC. Note that the caller and the
callee may be running completely different hardware, and that
certain data types may be represented differently from one machine
architecture to the next. Because of this, the caller cannot simply
feed <span   class="emphasis"><em>raw</em></span> data to the remote procedure.</p></li><li><p>The calling program must somehow pass its data to
the remote host which will execute the RPC. In local procedure
calls, the target address is simply a machine address on the local
processor. With RPC, the target procedure has a machine address
combined with a network address.</p></li><li><p>The RPC receives and operates on any input
parameters and passes the result back to the caller.</p></li><li><p>The calling program receives the RPC result and
continues execution.</p></li></ol></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x274f580.0x28480b0"></a>External Data Representation</h2></div></div><p>As was pointed out earlier, an RPC can be executed between
two hosts that run completely different processor hardware. Data
types, such as integer and floating-point numbers, can have
different physical representations on different machines. For
example, some machines store integers (C ints) with the low order
byte first while some machines place the low order byte last.
Similar problems occur with floating-point numeric data. The
solution to this problem involves the adoption of a standard for
data interchange.</p><p>One such standard is the ONC external data representation
(XDR). XDR is essentially a collection of C functions and macros
that enable conversion from machine specific data representations
to the corresponding standard representations and vice versa. It
contains primitives for simple data types such as int, float and
string and provides the capability to define and transport more
complex ones such as records, arrays of arbitrary element type and
pointer bound structures such as linked lists.</p><p>Most of the XDR functions require the passing of a pointer to
a structure of &ldquo;XDR&rdquo; type. One of the elements of this structure
is an enumerated field called <b  >x_op</b>. It's
possible values are <b  >XDR_ENCODE</b>,
<b  >XDR_DECODE</b>, or <b  >XDR_FREE</b>. The
<b  >XDR_ENCODE</b> operation instructs the XDR routine
to convert the passed data to XDR format. The
<b  >XDR_DECODE</b> operation indicates the conversion of
XDR represented data back to its local representation.
<b  >XDR_FREE</b> provides a means to deallocate memory
that was dynamically allocated for use by a variable that is no
longer needed. For more information on XDR, see the information
sources listed in the References section of this article.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x274f580.0x28484d0"></a>RPC Data Flow</h2></div></div><p>The flow of data from caller to callee and back again is
illustrated in Figure 1. The calling program executes as a client
process and the RPC runs on a remote server. All data movement
between the client and the network and between the server and the
network pass through XDR filter routines. In principle, any type of
network transport can be used, but our discussion of implementation
specifics centers on ONC RPC which typically uses either
Transmission Control Protocol routed by Internet Protocol (the
familiar TCP/IP) or User Datagram Protocol also routed by Internet
Protocol (the possibly not so familiar UDP/IP). Similarly, any type
of data representation could be used, but our discussion focuses on
XDR since it is the method used by ONC RPC.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="2204f1.large.jpg"><img src="2204f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

need to review some network programming theory.</p><p>In order for two processes running on separate computers to
exchange data, an <span   class="bold"><b>association</b></span>
needs to be formed on each host. An association is defined as the
following 5-tuple: <span   class="emphasis"><em>{protocol, local-address,
local-process, foreign-address, foreign-process}</em></span></p><p>The <span   class="emphasis"><em>protocol</em></span> is the transport mechanism
(typically TCP or UDP) which is used to move the data between
hosts. This, of course, is the part that needs to be common to both
host computers. For either host computer, the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>local-address/process</em></span> pair defines the
endpoint on the host computer running that process. The
<span   class="emphasis"><em>foreign-address/process</em></span> pair refers to the
endpoint at the opposite end of the connection.</p><p>Breaking this down further, the term
<span   class="emphasis"><em>address</em></span> refers to the network address assigned
to the host. This would typically be an Internet Protocol (IP)
address. The term <span   class="emphasis"><em>process</em></span> refers not to an
actual process identifier (such as a Unix PID) but to some integer
identifier required to transport the data to the correct process
once it has arrived at the correct host computer. This is generally
referred to as a <span   class="bold"><b>port</b></span>. The reason
port numbers are used is that it is not practical for a process
running on a remote host to know the PID of a particular server.
Standard port numbers are assigned to well known services such as
TELNET (port 23) and FTP (port 21).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x274f580.0x2848c60"></a>RPC Call Binding</h2></div></div><p>Now we have the necessary theory to complete our picture of
the RPC binding process. An RPC application is formally packaged
into a <span   class="emphasis"><em>program</em></span> with one or more
<span   class="emphasis"><em>procedure</em></span> calls. In a manner similar to the
port assignments described above, the RPC program is assigned an
integer identifier known to the programs which will call its
procedures. Each procedure is also assigned a number that is also
known by its caller. ONC RPC uses a program called
<span   class="bold"><b>portmap</b></span> to allocate port numbers
for RPC programs. It's operation is illustrated in Figure 2. When
an RPC <span   class="bold"><b>program</b></span> is started, it
registers itself with the portmap process running on the same host.
The portmap process then assigns the TCP and/or UDP port numbers to
be used by that application.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="2204f2.large.jpg"><img src="2204f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Portmap Operation
</p></div></div><p>The RPC application then waits for and accepts connections at
that port number. Prior to calling the remote procedure, the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>caller</em></span> also contacts portmap in order to
obtain the corresponding port number being used by the application
whose procedures it needs to call. The network connection provides
the means for the caller to reach the correct program on the remote
host. The correct procedure is reached through the use of a
dispatch table in the RPC program. The same registration process
that establishes the port number also creates the dispatch table.
The dispatch table is indexed by procedure number and contains the
addresses of all the XDR filter routines as well as the addresses
of the actual procedures.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x274f580.0x2c41380"></a>RPCGEN: The Protocol Compiler</h2></div></div><p><a href="2204l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1. Source for
avg.x</a></p><p>If the discussion of the mechanisms supporting RPC sounds
complex, that's because it is. Fortunately, the development of RPC
applications can be greatly simplified through the use of
<span   class="bold"><b>rpcgen</b></span>, the protocol compiler.
rpcgen has its own input language which is used to declare
programs, their procedures and the data types for the procedures'
parameters and return values. This is best illustrated by an
example. The source code for an average procedure is shown in
Listing 1. If we store this source code in a file called avg.x and
invoke rpcgen with the following command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
rpcgen avg.x
</pre><p>Obtain the header file avg.h shown in Listing 2. This file
contains all of the function prototypes and data declarations
needed for the development of our application. It will also
generate three other source files:
<div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>avg_clnt.c</b></span>: the
stub program for our client (caller) process</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>avg_svc.c</b></span>: the
main program for our server (callee) process</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>avg_xdr.c</b></span>: the XDR
routines used by both the client and the server</p></li></ol></div>

These sources are to be used &ldquo;as is&rdquo; and must not be edited.
</p><p><a href="2204l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2. Header File
avg.h</a></p><p>To complete the application at the server end, we need code
to provide the actual &ldquo;smarts&rdquo; required to correctly process the
input data. This must be created manually. The code for the sample
application presented here is shown in Listing 3. This code takes
the XDR decoded array from the client and separates and averages
the values. It returns the result which is then XDR encoded for
transmission back to the client.</p><p><a href="2204l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3. Server Code for Average
Application</a></p><p>To complete the application at the client end, the input data
must be packed into XDR format, so that it can be sent to the
server. The client program is also generated manually and is shown
in Listing 4. The Makefile shown in Listing 5 can be used to build
the application.</p><p><a href="2204l4.html" target="_self">Listing 4. Client Code for Average
Application</a></p><p><a href="2204l5.html" target="_self">Listing 5. Makefile</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x274f580.0x2c41d20"></a>Testing and Debugging the Application</h2></div></div><p>The best way to test the RPC application is to run both the
client and the server (the caller and callee) on the the same
machine. Assuming that you are in the directory where both the
client and the server reside, start the server by entering the
command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
avg_svc &amp;
</pre><p>The <span   class="bold"><b>rpcinfo</b></span> utility can be
used to verify that the server is running. Typing the command:
<pre     class="programlisting">
$ rpcinfo -p localhost
</pre>


gives the following output:
<pre     class="programlisting">
program vers proto   port
 100000    2   tcp    111  portmapper
 100000    2   udp    111  portmapper
  22855    1   udp   1221
  22855    1   tcp   1223
</pre>


Note that 22855 is the program number of our application from avg.x
and 1 is shown as the version number. Since 22855 is not a
registered RPC application, the rightmost column is blank. If we
add the following line to the /etc/rpc file:
<pre     class="programlisting">
avg        22855
</pre>


rpcinfo then gives the following output:
<pre     class="programlisting">
program vers proto   port
 100000    2   tcp    111  portmapper
 100000    2   udp    111  portmapper
  22855    1   udp   1221  avg
  22855    1   tcp   1223  avg
</pre>


To test the application, use the command:
<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ravg localhost $RANDOM $RANDOM $RANDOM
</pre>


and the following values are returned:
<pre     class="programlisting">
value   = 9.196000e+03
value   = 2.871200e+04
value   = 3.198900e+04
average = 2.329900e+04
</pre>


Since the first argument to the command is the DNS name for the
host running the server, localhost is used. If you have access to a
remote host that allows RPC connections (ask the system
administrator before you try), the server can be uploaded and run
on the remote host, and the client can be run as before, replacing
localhost with the DNS name or IP address of the host. If your
remote host doesn't allow RPC connections, you may be able to run
your client from there, replacing localhost with the DNS name or IP
address of your local system.

The Open Software Foundation has developed a suite of tools called
the Distributed Computing Environment (DCE) which enables
programmers to develop distributed applications. One of these tools
is DCE RPC which forms the basis for all of the other services that
DCE provides. Its operation is quite similar to ONC RPC in that it
uses components that closely parallel those of ONC RPC.</p><p>Application interfaces are defined through an Interface
Definition Language (IDL) which is similar to the language used by
ONC RPC to define XDR filters. Network Data Representation (NDR) is
used to provide hardware independent data representation. Instead
of using programmer-defined integer program numbers to identify
servers as does ONC RPC, DCE RPC uses a character string called a
universal unique identifier (UUID) generated by a program called
<span   class="bold"><b>uuidgen</b></span>. A program called
<span   class="bold"><b>rpcd</b></span> (the RPC daemon) takes the
place of portmap. An IDL compiler can be used to generate C headers
and client/server stubs in a manner similar to rpcgen.</p><p>Although the entire DCE suite is commercially sold and
licensed, the RPC component (which is the basis for all the other
services) is available as freeware. See the references section for
more information on DCE RPC.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x274f580.0x2c423a8"></a>Further Study</h2></div></div><p>The sample application presented here is certainly a naive
one, but it serves well in presenting the basic principles of RPCs.
A more interesting set of applications can be found in the Network
Information System (NIS) package for Linux (see the references
section). Also, the Linux kernel sources contain an implementation
of Sun's Network File System (NFS), an excellent example of the use
of RPC applied to the problem of distributed file access.</p><p>In addition to distributed data access, RPC can also be used
to harness the unused processing power present on most networks.
The book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Power Programming with RPC</em></span>, listed in
the references section, presents an image processing application
that uses RPC to distribute CPU intensive tasks over multiple
processors. With RPC, you have the capability to boost the
performance of your applications without spending a dime on
additional hardware.</p><p><a href="2204s1.html" target="_self">References</a></p></div></div>
