a message-of-the-day browser that runs under the X Window System.
It was written to ease the burden of the local systems
administrator in making day-to-day announcements of general
interest to students and faculty using the computer network in the
Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at Ryerson
Polytechnic University, Toronto, Canada. This is a chronicle of my
experiences developing a program that started as a trivial, single
purpose tool and evolved into one with numerous features suggested
by its users.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf0e580.0x10068c8"></a>Development</h2></div></div><p>It was a late August afternoon in 1993 when Nick Colonello,
the department's system administrator, and I were discussing the
past school year and how it would have been nice to be able to let
students logging in to the system know important information. With
the following school year less than a month away, I boasted that I
could write a simple message browser in about 10 minutes that could
be run automatically by <span   class="bold"><b>xdm</b></span> (the X
display manager) when students logged in. He agreed that it was a
good idea and I proceeded to complete version 0.1 in under 30
minutes; it was called <span   class="bold"><b>xbanner</b></span>.(1)
Visually, it consisted of a text widget where the message would be
displayed, and a &ldquo;dismiss&rdquo; button, in the top-left corner of the
window, used to close the window. For a brief moment, it looked
supremely functional. But I was not satisfied&mdash;it looked
utilitarian and ugly. (See Figure 1.)</p><p><a href="2244f1.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 1. xmotd
0.1 Screen Dump</b></span></a></p><p>In another half hour, version 0.2 was completed with an
aesthetic re-fit consisting of a label widget that displayed a
title, a separator widget (purely decorative) to separate the title
from the text and another label widget to display a bitmap (a logo
of our computer network). This was the version that was first
installed on our system.</p><p>A few weeks later, Luis Lopes, the systems administrator in
the Computer Science department dropped by for a visit and
expressed interest in installing xbanner on his system. I was duly
impressed that someone I knew would actually find something I wrote
useful.</p><p>In March of the following year I read a post in
comp.windows.x asking how a message of the day could be displayed
when running X and xdm. Not knowing where it would be taking me, I
innocently followed up saying that I had hacked together such a
program and was willing to share it. Within a few hours I received
two e-mail messages, and the next morning had another asking for a
copy of xbanner. Now I was truly impressed.</p><p>Its popularity was never anticipated. It was as if no one had
thought the world needed such a program. Indeed, a cursory
investigation, prior to beginning work on xbanner, would have
revealed the existence of a similar tool that, with minor
modifications, could easily fit whatever new specifications were
demanded. However, at this time the Web was in its infancy and
<span   class="bold"><b>archie</b></span> was the <span   class="emphasis"><em>de
facto</em></span>, parochially-minded, search tool of choice.
Obscurity and ignorance condemned useful software to languish on
ftp sites around the world.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf0e580.0x1006d98"></a>Re-inventing the Wheel</h2></div></div><p>I first learned of
<span   class="bold"><b>xmessage</b></span>'s existence when Vivek
Khera e-mailed me a shell-script that used xmessage, in conjunction
with other Unix programs, as a message-of-the-day browser.
<span   class="bold"><b>xmessage</b></span>, written by Stephen
Glidea of the eX Consortium (2), is a generic tool that can be used
to browse a text file or display a message. It consists of a widget
in which the text is displayed and an &ldquo;okay&rdquo; button in the bottom
left corner of the window. (See Figure 2.)</p><p><a href="2244f2.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 2.
Xmessage Screen Dump</b></span></a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf0e580.0x1007058"></a>Criteria for Useful Software</h2></div></div><p>Notice the remarkable aesthetic similarities between xmotd
0.1 and xmessage. In a market with several similar, feature-rich
tools, aesthetics are often the deciding factor for a user. In a
recent interview, the late Seymour Cray noted the importance of
aesthetics: &ldquo;I've enjoyed the aesthetics part of building
computers because it's any extra little thing you add that is
clearly your own personality being projected in the
product.&rdquo;</p><p>In addition to aesthetics, flexibility also plays a major
role in selection. Experience has shown that users have a
preference for application software that allows them to solve their
problems, rather than overpowers by solving the programmer's
problems. Usually, a programmer writes a program to solve a
particular problem, then gives it away with the hope that others
will benefit from it. Typical end-users do not find much use for
this kind of software because it was written &ldquo;by programmers, for
programmers&rdquo;. It performs a single job&mdash;nothing more, nothing
less. Common shortcomings of this type of software include:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>idiosyncratic interfaces, with little thought put
into design (the principle of least astonishment does not
apply)</p></li><li><p>poorly chosen default configurations giving the
software an ugly appearance</p></li><li><p>a lack of customization (an aspect that emphasizes
the idiosyncrasies even further because the user cannot replace the
settings with something more suitable)</p></li></ul></div><p>Software that allows infinite customization (3) endears
itself to users dedicated enough to read the documentation because
it gives them complete power&mdash;the same sense of creative power the
developer felt when designing the software.</p><p>For example, xmotd's customizable bitmap was a relatively
minor coding burden (an additional 10 lines of code to read in and
validate a bitmap file) that affords the end-user a personal touch
to what would otherwise be very bland software. The EE department's
logo was originally hard-coded as the default image in the internal
version of xmotd (now suitably renamed). When I uploaded xmotd to
the eX Consortium's archive, I hard-coded in the X logo. One of the
first requests I received was for the ability to change the logo. A
less-than -optimal (and therefore temporary) solution I implemented
was to amend the README with instructions on modifying the source
code so a different bitmap could be compiled in. However, I found
that people were very reluctant to modify code; they preferred
something simpler. It then occurred to me to use the X logo as the
default image and add a <b  >-bitmap</b> option to allow
the user to override the logo with one of his choice.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf0e580.0x1007528"></a>Evolution</h2></div></div><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>&ldquo;Every program in development at MIT expands
until it can read mail.&rdquo; --Unknown</p></blockquote></div><p>Users invariably suggest enhancements, because the developer
cannot anticipate all the uses for the software. A good rule of
thumb is that for each person who asks for an enhancement, assume
ten do not. My decision to implement the suggested enhancements was
based on coding time versus how many users I thought would benefit
from the feature. For example, I would guess that the
<b  >-usedomainnames</b> (4) option is rarely used other
than at the site of the user who suggested it. I added it only
because the overhead was one extra line of code in the function
that generated the timestamp.</p><p>Another example: the <b  >-wakeup</b> option
initially specified an hourly period using an integer argument.
When someone requested finer granularity (15 minutes sleep time)
the argument was changed to a floating-point number with the
fractional portion used to represent minutes.</p><p>The change was simple and didn't break backwards
compatibility with <b  >-wakeup</b> operation in the
previous version. Users tend to be frustrated (to the point of not
bothering to upgrade) when successive versions introduce
incompatibilities with previous versions.</p><p>If a particular feature is implemented, it is wise to add an
option to disable that feature because it is very likely that
someone else may not like it. I added <b  >-timestamp</b>
to allow the default timestamp name &ldquo;.xmotd&rdquo; to be overridden
after a user request. Put simply&mdash;provide lots of options.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf0e580.0x1007948"></a>Feedback</h2></div></div><p>There is a certain amount of personal gratification in
writing software, but developers are happier when people actually
<span   class="emphasis"><em>use</em></span> the software. Many features now
incorporated into xmotd were suggested by users (systems
administrators) at other sites. Unsolicited e-mail from users is a
good indicator of popularity and is very inspiring to developers.
If you enjoyed using some software (regardless of whether it's
free) and know the author's address, I would urge you to write him
a brief note. The euphoria from reading a note of thanks is
ineffable. As a benchmark, I have received 107 e-mail messages
regarding xmotd, versus 10 messages for
<span   class="bold"><b>xabacus</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>xsecure</b></span> combined (a pair of X
applications I had authored prior to xmotd).</p><p>The e-mail I have received about xmotd can be categorized as
follows (ordered from least encouraging to most encouraging; too
many from the beginning of the list may make you want to give up
writing free software):</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Your program didn't compile. Do you know
why?</p></li><li><p>I didn't read the README file, how do I install
your software?</p></li><li><p>I'm too lazy to read the documentation, how do I
use this feature?</p></li><li><p>The documentation for using this feature is
unclear.</p></li><li><p>Can you add this feature?</p></li><li><p>Your program doesn't work.</p></li><li><p>Thanks for writing this cool software.</p></li><li><p>The documentation for using this feature is
unclear, here is a fix.</p></li><li><p>There's a bug in your cool software, and here's the
patch.</p></li><li><p>Here's some code that implements a new feature and
makes your software even cooler.</p></li></ol></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf0e580.0x1400538"></a>Motivations</h2></div></div><p>Wasteful duplication is common in the free software world.
Given that Unix has been around for more than a quarter century, it
is very likely that a solution to a problem has already been
developed and you need to find it. On the other hand, commercial
software has a colossal advertising budget and therefore mediocre
software is often guaranteed commercial success. The ubiquitous and
global nature of the Web is altering the balance. (When digital
cash becomes a common transaction medium, it will become easy to
charge for software.)</p><p>The Web allows software to have its own home page, providing
inexpensive, world-wide advertising that precludes a marketing
department. (5) New versions can be announced with varying amounts
of fanfare. In some cases, major undertakings like the GIMP paint
program or the Gnus newsreader for Emacs evolve around a mailing
list subscribed to by a dedicated following interested in
discussing and implementing enhancements. A catalog of free
software would be a great benefit to both the developers and the
users of free software. [The Linux Software Map on Sunsite is
easily searched and functions as a catalog; however, it is not
always up to date&mdash;Editor]</p><p>The rewards for commercial software are money and, often,
fame. The rewards for writing famous, free software are
recognition, a reputation and, at best, fanatic adoration. Many
developers of free software share the sentiment illustrated in the
opening epigraph. We write software because it's fun; it's more fun
when people actually use it. Making it freely available guarantees
that the greatest number of people will use it. Very often, free
tools are the only alternative for those administrators who
administer vast networks with minimal resources.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf0e580.0x14006f0"></a>Conclusions</h2></div></div><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>&ldquo;A work of art is never complete; the artist
merely abandons it.&rdquo; --Unknown</p></blockquote></div><p>Three years (and 14 releases) later, I thought xmotd was
approaching completion; i.e., every option that could possibly have
been added had been. Since December 1996, however, more suggestions
(which will be incorporated into version 1.15 of xmotd) were
submitted, including one for running the HTML version within an
Intranet and having it spawn a web browser when an URL was clicked.
I should note that xmotd gained popularity when it began supporting
HTML. (See Figure 3.)</p><p><a href="2244f3.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 3. HTML
Version of xmotd</b></span></a></p><p>My advice to eager developers is, first, not to begin writing
software without ascertaining whether a similar package exists (web
space can be effortlessly searched these days); if it exists,
consider extending it rather than starting from scratch. Second,
write the software with full intent of incorporating user
suggestions (don't ignore your users) and bug fixes following the
first release (version 1.0 is never the last release). Finally,
write software that keeps pace with advances in technology (e.g.,
Java) or face obsolescence. People will begin to use software only
if it satisfies their needs and will continue using it only if it
evolves to accommodate their changing needs. Persevere until the
day you write software that receives the world-wide acclaim we all
dream about.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf0e580.0x1400a08"></a>Acknowledgements</h2></div></div><p>Per Abrahamsen, Derek Fedak and Lars Magne Ingebrigtsen
