&ldquo;real world&rdquo; applications of Linux, as well as those on how some of
the software works (e.g., majordomo, Tcl/Tk, RCS) and on how to do
things (connect to the Internet).</p><p>I don't actually have Linux yet. Truth is, I don't have a
computer yet, but I am putting a plan for getting one before the
Household Steering Committee soon. Wish me luck.</p><p>I do have a major question about Linux. I know that, with
Unix, and unlike DOS, you just don't unplug your computer or switch
it off. I believe the procedure is to do a &ldquo;sync&rdquo; before shutting
it down. I presume Linux is the same. What happens when we have a
power out(r)age? What kind of a mess will I have to clean up, what
data could I lose, and how can I protect myself? Is tape backup the
only way? How about a power-failure detection system? A daemon to
do periodic syncs? Perhaps <i  >LJ</i> could run an
article on cost- and time-effective ways to ensure maximum up-time
and minimum disaster potential.</p><p>&mdash;Charles L. Hethcoat III</p><p>We do wish you luck in your hearings before the Household
Steering Committee.</p><p>What is missing from your question is what happens to MS-DOS
machines if they are in the middle of disk access during a power
outage. It turns out that the standard &ldquo;ext2fs&rdquo; filesystem under
Linux is more stable in the face of disaster than the DOS
filesystem. Given the same usage patterns, a Linux machine is much
less likely to loose files and data than a DOS machine.</p><p>If properly configured, a Linux machine automatically checks
when it boots to see if it was cleanly shut down. If it was not, it
automatically checks the filesystems to make sure that they are not
damaged, and fixes them if they are damaged.</p><p>Those who use DOS's SMARTDRV write-caching also have to do
the equivalent of a sync before shutting off their
computers.</p><p>Unix has always had a daemon, called
<span   class="bold"><b>update</b></span>, to do periodic syncs.
Linux also has it.</p><p>The one thing (besides backing up, which is always the first
point of defense) that will almost entirely prevent any filesystem
damage is a quality uninteruptable power supply (UPS). In the 9
months that I have had my computer connected to a UPS, I have not
lost a single file due to any of the frequent power failures in my
area. To be fair to the Linux filesystem, I had only ever lost one
file to a power loss&mdash;and even that may have been user
error.</p><p>UPSs range in price from around US$100 to US$1000 for
reasonable choices for home and small business use, and will save
you from almost anything save a direct lightning strike, from which
only off-site backups will protect you. Most UPSs have a connector
(usually at extra cost; some connectors you can make yourself if
you are technically inclined) that can report power loss to a
program running on the computer. We do intend to have an article on
that, written by someone who has significantly enhanced the Linux
<span   class="bold"><b>powerd</b></span> daemon.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20cf580.0x21c76b8"></a>Where Credit is Due</h2></div></div><p>I wish to thank you for the coverage you gave to our Linux
sessions in DECUS at Washington D.C.</p><p>About the only change that I would make to the article is to
publicly recognize the efforts of Kurt Reisler, Chairman of the
Unix Special Interest Group of the U.S. Chapter of DECUS.</p><p>Kurt first pointed out the interest in Linux to me and
suggested that Linus come to New Orleans DECUS. Kurt's efforts
&ldquo;inspired&rdquo; me to fund Linus' first trip to DECUS, which
consequently drove the funding of the Alpha system for Linus to
start his port. Kurt directed the schedule for DECUS in D.C. as
well as hosting most of the Linux activities. Kurt has been a
tireless advocate of Unix for as long as I have known him, which is
over ten years.</p><p>I ask that you print this letter, as I believe very strongly
in credit where credit is due.</p><p>Jon &ldquo;maddog&rdquo; Hall, Senior LeaderUNIX Software Group, Digital
Equipment Corporation</p><p>Mea Culpa! Kurt's efforts certainly deserve recognition and
respect, and I was amazed to re-read my article and find that I had
left out any mention of him. Thank you very much for bring this
mistake to my attention. I apologize profusely.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20cf580.0x21c7978"></a>Three Dimensions</h2></div></div><p>I just received the July issue of <i  >LJ</i>. My
only complaint is that it's so good, I rip through it as fast as I
can! The reviews of X servers are well-timed. Also, (I work in a
virtual reality lab) I think you need some reviews of the OpenGL
ports available. Perhaps an explanation of them, and some of the
other (free) 3-D renderers out there (Mesa, etc). Maybe even an
article on writing 3-D applications under one of the
packages...</p><p>Also, Greg's article on X setup is beneficial to say the
least! Every time I help set up someone's X windows, they ask me
how I learned all that; I reply, &ldquo;The hard way!&rdquo; The interview with
Mr. Zborowski is good; not too many people know the roots and
beginnings of the software packages they're using.</p><p>Good work!</p><p>Trent Tuggle,
<a href="mailto:tuggle@vsl.ist.ucf.edu">tuggle@vsl.ist.ucf.edu</a></p><p>I'm glad you find <i  >LJ</i> useful. We do plan to have reviews of
the OpenGL ports, and we have a standing request for a Mesa
developer to write an article on Mesa, which already looks very
good and shows a lot of potential for further development.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20cf580.0x21c7ce8"></a>You Say Potato, I Say Potahto</h2></div></div><p>I just do not understand what your magazine is all about.
Perhaps it's me, but I have good knowledge of Unix and some of its
derivatives, and Linux is still a mystery to me. I'm not even sure
of the name; is it pronounced &ldquo;Lynux&rdquo; or &ldquo;Linux&rdquo;? Anyone I've asked
is not sure, but I have received both pronunciations.</p><p>Then there's the content of your magazine. Someone must be
interested in the esoteric content since there does not seem to be
a shortage of these articles in your publication, especially those
using acronyms that I suppose make sense to someone.</p><p>I hoped some articles would cater to the &ldquo;uninformed&rdquo; like me
who are just getting into Linux and would prefer not to decipher
every article just to find it does not matter.</p><p>I want system administration tips and tricks; comparisons to
Unix functions; commercial applications that have been tried and
found useful; and evaluations of the various flavors of Linux. What
about an article about Caldera? Speak in regular English using
terms that are recognizable to us Unix aficionados.</p><p>Irwin Luchs, San Diego, CA</p><p>Everyone who's been confused about the pronunciation of Linux
will be happy to know that there is a sound file of Linus
pronouncing Linux, in English and Swedish,
<a href="http://uranus.it.swin.edu.au/~jn/linux/saylinux.htm" target="_self">uranus.it.swin.edu.au/~jn/linux/saylinux.htm</a>.
We pronounce it with a
short i, as in &ldquo;lint&rdquo; and a u as in &ldquo;under&rdquo;. As with most things
related to Unix and Linux, there's more than one right way.</p><p>We strive to include articles that appeal to our diverse
readership, but we realize that not every reader will be interested
in every article in every issue. We try to not leave acronyms
unexplained, but we don't catch every one.</p><p>We do have a semi-regular column on system administration, as
well as reviews of products and Linux distributions. An article
about Caldera is in the works. We always welcome article ideas, and
many of our articles result from reader suggestions.</p></div></div>
