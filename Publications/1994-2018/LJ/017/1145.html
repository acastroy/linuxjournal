    Functions in the Linux kernel can be called by user
    programs. Howerver, it takes a bit of preparation. In this
    column, Michael guides you through the process step by step,
    explaining why as well as what.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29cd580.0x2ac5450"></a></h2></div></div><p>Code in the Linux kernel can be executed
in two basic ways. One is to be called by an interrupt, and the
other is to be called from a user program (that's my required
&ldquo;white lie&rdquo; for this column). User programs call code in the kernel
through a system call, which is essentially an unusual type of
function call.
</p><p>Of course, when user code calls privileged kernel code, the
kernel has to very carefully check the validity of its arguments in
order to avoid accidentally doing harm of any sort. If the code is
not safe for anyone but the superuser to execute, there are
routines for checking that, too.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29cd580.0x2ac55b0"></a>In the Kernel</h2></div></div><p>Creating a system call is more difficult than creating a
normal C language function, but not too difficult. There is
certainly more to it than declaring a function in a header
file&mdash;and for system calls, the only change that is needed to a
header file is <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> a function
declaration.</p><p>The first thing that you need to do is either modify an
existing file in the kernel, or create a new file to be compiled.
If you create a new file, we will assume that you are able to add
it to the appropriate Makefile and use the proper
<b  >#include</b> statements for the code you are
writing. You <span   class="emphasis"><em>will</em></span> want to make sure that
<b  >&lt;linux/errno.h&gt;</b> is included, because
system calls need to be able to return error codes, and those error
codes are all defined in errno.h.</p><p>You will need to create a function called
<b  >sys_<i><tt>name</tt></i></b>, where
<b  ><i><tt>name</tt></i></b> is the name of
the system call you are creating. The function must have the return
specification <b  >asmlinkage int</b>, and it may have
any number of arguments between 0 and 5, inclusive. The arguments
must all be the same size as a <b  >long</b>; they may
not be structures. (Or, at least, not structures larger than a
<b  >long</b>. It would not be wise to make structures
the same size as a long because integer arithmetic is done on them.
What is a &ldquo;signed&rdquo; structure? If you don't want to think about that
question, do not use small structures. In truth, don't use them at
all.)</p><p>The function will return errors as
<b  >-E<i><tt>NAME</tt></i></b>. Negative
numbers are treated as error values on return (we will see how
later) and positive numbers are considered normal return values.
This means that on systems with 32-bit <b  >long</b>
values, only 31 bits are available for passing back return values.
On 64-bit systems like Linux/Alpha, only 63 bits are available.
This makes it difficult to pass addresses in the high half of the
range back to user programs.</p><p>There are two ways around this. One is to make one of the
function's arguments be the address of a user-space variable in
which to place the return value. The other is to find some other
way of returning an error and making a special way of handling the
return value. The first way is, to the best of my knowledge, always
preferable, so I will not explain the second way.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29cd580.0x2ac5ce8"></a>Possible Errors</h2></div></div><p>Before reading or writing any area in a user program from the
kernel, the <b  >verify_area()</b> function must be
called. In normal use on a 486 or Pentium, it is less important for
kernel stability than on the 386 (although it helps detect errors
much more cleanly and avoids having processes die in kernel mode),
but on the 386 it is absolutely essential to system stability,
because the 386 does not honor memory protection when it is in
&ldquo;supervisor&rdquo; mode, which is the mode the kernel runs in. This
means, for instance, that the CPU will happily write to read-only
user-space memory from the kernel.</p><p>The <b  >verify_area()</b> function takes three
variables. First is one of <b  >VERIFY_READ</b> or
<b  >VERIFY_WRITE</b>. Second is the address in the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>current user program</em></span> that is to be verified.
Third is the length of the memory area you wish to read or write.
It returns 0 if the memory area is valid, and
<b  >-EFAULT</b> if the memory is not valid. A common
phrase is something like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
int error;
error = verify_area(VERIFY_WRITE, buf, len);
if (error)
        return error;
...
</pre><p>Please note that <b  >verify_area</b> only verifies
addresses in user memory space, not kernel memory space. Memory in
kernel space is never swapped out, and is always readable and
writable. On the i86 family, the fs segment register is used in the
kernel to select the user-space memory of the current process.
Other architectures do this differently. This functionality is
abstracted out into a few useful functions, explained below.</p><p>Your work when writing your system call will be much easier
if you do as much testing as possible before committing any
resources to the task at hand. As a general rule, tests are done in
this order:</p><p>Run all necessary <b  >verify_area</b>
tests.</p><p>Do (almost) all other tests in an appropriate order,
including normal permission testing.</p><p>Do <b  >suser()</b> or
<b  >fsuser()</b> tests if appropriate. These should only
be called after other tests have succeeded, because BSD-style
root-privilege accounting may be added to the kernel at some point.
See the comments in include/linux/kernel.h.</p><p>The <b  >suser()</b> function is used to determine
if the process has root permissions for most activities. However,
the <b  >fsuser()</b> function must be used for all
filesystem-related permissions. This difference allows servers to
assume the file permissions of a user without &ldquo;becoming&rdquo; the user,
even briefly. This is important because if the server exchanges
uid's such that it &ldquo;becomes&rdquo; the user for even a moment, the user
can disturb the process in various ways, potentially breaching
security in many ways. By simply using the fsuid and fsgid
functions instead, the server avoids this security nightmare. For
this to work, all kernel filesystem permissions testing must use
the <b  >fsuser()</b> function to test for superuser
status, and must look at <b  >current-&gt;fsuid</b> and
<b  >current-&gt;fsgid</b> for normal permissions on
filesystem objects. (For more details on the
<b  >current</b> pointer, see the definition of
<b  >task_struct</b> in include/linux/sched.h.)</p><p>A good example of a program that needs this ability is the
nfs server. Early versions of the nfs server were not able to use
this functionality (because it didn't yet exist), and there were
several security holes. The most common nuisance was users noticing
that they could kill the server.</p><p>After you check permissions and any other possible error
conditions, you probably want to actually get something done.
Unless you simply want to return a value that can fit in a 31-bit
(or 63-bit for Linux/Alpha) return value, you will need to write to
the user memory that you checked with the
<b  >verify_area</b> function at the beginning of
function. You can't just use the pointer to user-space memory as a
normal pointer. Instead, you have to use a set of special functions
to access it. And if you want to read any user-space memory in
order to do your system call, you will need to use a similar set of
functions to do so.</p><p>In older versions of Linux (through 1.2.x), you had to
specify what kind of memory access you were making. There were 6
functions for single memory access: <b  >get_fs_byte</b>,
<b  >get_fs_word</b>, <b  >get_fs_long</b>,
<b  >put_fs_byte</b>, <b  >put_fs_word</b>, and
<b  >put_fs_long</b>. These names (and names with the
<b  >fs</b> replaced with <b  >user</b>) are
still supported in newer kernels, but starting with Linux 1.3, they
are deprecated. The <b  >get_user</b> and
<b  >put_user</b> functions are to be used instead. They
are easier to read and for the most part easier to use, but because
they depend on the type of the pointer being passed to them, they
are not tolerant of sloppy pointer use. (This is probably a good
thing, since Linux now runs both on little- and big-endian
computers, and big-endian computers are not tolerant of sloppy
pointer use either.)</p><p>The memory block access routines have stayed the same since
the earliest versions, even though their names still contain the
letters &ldquo;fs&rdquo;; <b  >memcpy_tofs</b> is used to copy a
block of memory to user space, and <b  >memcpy_fromfs</b>
is used to copy a block of user memory to memory in kernel
space.</p><p>All of the memory access routines are defined in
include/asm/segment.h&mdash;even on architectures without segmentation.
On all of the non-Intel architectures, these functions are
essentially null functions, since they do not implement
segmentation.</p><p>Up to this point, you have simply implemented a new function
in the kernel. Simply prepending the name with
<b  >sys_</b> will not make it possible to call the
function from user code.</p><p>You need to make two additions within the kernel. The first
is in include/linux/unistd.h, right near the end. You need to look
for the last line that starts with <b  >#define __NR</b>
and add your own:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#define __NR_<span   class="emphasis"><em>name</em></span>     <span   class="emphasis"><em>###</em></span>
</pre><p>where <b  ><i><tt>###</tt></i></b> is
the number one greater than the previous last system call number.
In version 1.2.9, that would be 141.</p><p>The second change will have to be made in multiple files, one
for each architecture that Linux runs on. Each file
arch/*/kernel/entry.S will need an additional entry in its system
call table. The system call table is kept at the end of the file,
and you will simply need to add an entry at the end of the table
before the <b  >.space</b> line and change the
<b  >.space</b> formula at the very end to reflect the
new number of system calls.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29cd580.0x2abd9c0"></a>Invoking Your System Call</h2></div></div><p>Now you <span   class="emphasis"><em>can</em></span> call your new function from
user code, but how? You can't simply declare <b  >extern int
sys_<i><tt>name</tt></i>(int arg);</b> and link.
Instead, you have to <b  >#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</b>
and use the appropriate
<b  >syscall<i><tt>X</tt></i>()</b> macro,
where <b  ><i><tt>X</tt></i></b> is the number
of arguments the system call takes. The
<b  >syscall<i><tt>X</tt></i>()</b> macros are
actually defined in include/asm/unistd.h, which gets included by
<b  >&lt;unistd.h&gt;</b> automatically.</p><p>If your system call is declared as</p><pre     class="programlisting">
asmlinkage int sys_<span   class="emphasis"><em>name</em></span>(void);
</pre><p>the <b  >syscall0()</b> invocation is quite
easy:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
_syscall0(int, <span   class="emphasis"><em>name</em></span>)
</pre><p>(notice the leading underscore). This gets converted by the C
preprocessor into</p><pre     class="programlisting">
int <span   class="emphasis"><em>name</em></span>(void)
{
long __res;
__asm__ volatile ("int $0x80"
        : "=a" (__res)
        : "0" (__NR_<span   class="emphasis"><em>name</em></span>));
if (__res &gt;= 0)
        return (int) __res;
errno = -__res;
return -1;
}
</pre><p>on Linux/i86. Because it uses assembly, it will be different
on other architectures. Fortunately, it doesn't really matter. The
important point is that it creates a function called
<b  ><i><tt>name</tt></i></b> which generates
an interrupt (remember the &ldquo;white lie&rdquo; about interrupts? System
calls are interrupts, too) which calls the system call, and then
returns the result if the answer is positive, and returns -1 if the
answer is negative (has the high-order bit set), setting
<b  >errno</b> to the non-negative error number.</p><p>If your function has two arguments:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
asmlinkage int sys_<span   class="emphasis"><em>name</em></span>(int num, struct foo *bar);
</pre><p>you would instead use this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
_syscall2(int, <span   class="emphasis"><em>name</em></span>, int, num, struct foo *, bar)
</pre><p>which would expand to:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
int name(int num, struct foo * bar)
{
long __res;
__asm__ volatile ("int $0x80"
        : "=a" (__res)
        : "0" (__NR_<span   class="emphasis"><em>name</em></span>),
          "b" ((long)(num)), "c" ((long)(bar)));
if (__res &gt;= 0)
        return (int) __res;
errno = -__res;
return -1;
}
</pre><p>Notice the unusual way of specifying the arguments to the
macro, where the return type and the name of the function are
followed by separate arguments for the type and name of each of the
system call's arguments. Figuring out how to specify system calls
with 1, 3, 4, or 5 arguments is left as an exercise for the
reader.</p><p>For the curious: there is one other way that system calls may
be called on Linux/i86. iBCS2-based programs call system calls with
an <b  >lcall 7,0</b> instruction instead of an
<b  >int $0x80</b> instruction. The
<b  >lcall</b> instruction takes slightly longer than the
<b  >int</b> instruction, which is why it is the default
system call mechanism on Linux, but both are supported. The
<b  >lcall</b> instruction isn't exactly an interrupt,
although it acts much like one; technically it is a &ldquo;call gate&rdquo;. So
my &ldquo;white lie&rdquo; isn't really a lie after all.</p></div></div>
