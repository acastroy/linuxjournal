<a href="mailto:info@linuxjournal.com">info@linuxjournal.com</a></p></li></ul></div><p>I was first drawn to this book by the title and by the
following in the introduction: &ldquo;The creators of the Unix operating
system started with a radical concept: They assumed that the users
of their software would be computer literate from the start.&rdquo; Of
course, it is just this assumption that helped keep Unix from being
used very much outside the technical, university, computer-literate
environment for many years. This book satisfactorily explains how
and why the Unix operating system developed as it has; compelling
arguments explain why the Unix philosophy allows for good software
design and why, in the author's opinion, Unix will become the
world's operating system.</p><p>The book is geared mostly toward readers who haven't yet used
Unix, but the author also intended that experienced Unix
programmers would reread it several times so as not to forget the
nine main tenets of the Unix Philosophy, as well as the less
stringently &ldquo;enforced&rdquo; minor tenets. (I think enforcement is
accomplished by &ldquo;true&rdquo; Unix programmers looking down their noses at
those who go astray from the true Unix philosophy.)</p><p>The book credits Stephen Bourne, William Joy, Brian
Kernighan, and Dennis Ritchie, among the many people who
contributed to the Unix Philosophy, each by giving some major
contribution to Unix in the early days. For example, William Joy
brought text editing and C-like command language (he developed vi
and the C-shell); Dennis Ritchie brought us the C programming
language.</p><p>The main tenets (each of which have sub-tenets) of the Unix
philosophy are as follows:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Small is beautiful.</p></li><li><p>Make each program do one thing well.</p></li><li><p>Build a prototype as soon as possible.</p></li><li><p>Choose portability over efficiency.</p></li><li><p>Store numerical data in flat ASCII files.</p></li><li><p>Use software leverage to your advantage.</p></li><li><p>Use shell scripts to increase leverage and
portability.</p></li><li><p>Avoid captive user interfaces.</p></li><li><p>Make every program a filter.</p></li></ol></div><p>The author introduces each tenet with a simple, real-world
example (or &ldquo;case study&rdquo;) , then further explains why the tenet is
important by including non-technical computer-world
examples.</p><p>Tenet 1. Small is beautiful.The book offers an example of how
Volkswagen ran an ad campaign with the phrase &ldquo;small is beautiful&rdquo;
in the US to promote the VW bug, but the idea was generally ignored
in the US until the price of oil went up and Americans learned the
advantages of small cars. The author draws an analogy to these
nouveau small-car-appreciators to programmers at AT&amp;T Bell Labs
discovering that small programs were also easier to handle,
maintain, and adapt than large programs.</p><p>In a non-Unix environment, a program to copy one file to
another file might include, as in an example given in the book,
twelve steps which do more than perform a file copy. The twelve
steps perform extra tasks, some of which are considered &ldquo;safety
features&rdquo; by some. The steps might include checking to see if the
file exists, if the output files are empty, and prompting users to
see if they know what they're doing (for example, &ldquo;Are you really
really sure you want to do this, and does your mother know you're
doing this?&rdquo;), etc. Just one step of the sequence might be the
actual copy command. A Unix program (or command) would only include
the one copy command step. Other small programs would each do the
other 11 steps and could be used together if the Unix user wanted
to use these extra steps. Although the author purposefully steers
away from giving Unix examples until near the end of the book, I
would have liked to see several Unix commands strung together to
accomplish all the tasks described by the twelve steps.</p><p>Tenet 4. Choose portability over efficiency.The example given
here is of the Atari 2600 which was the first successful home video
game. Most of the code for the game cartridges was very efficient
but nonportable. With the advent of new hardware (the &ldquo;5200&rdquo;), the
code had to be rewritten to run on the 5200 which took time and
money. The author proposes that Atari would have been the largest
supplier of software in the world if its code had been
portable.</p><p>There is a three-page analogy of selling Tupperware to the
&ldquo;use software leverage to your advantage&rdquo; tenet. Who would have
realized a multilevel marketing scheme is a good way to write
software?</p><p>A sub-tenet of the leverage tenet is allow other people to
use your code to leverage their own work. Many programmers hoard
their source code. The author states that &ldquo;Unix owes much of its
success to the fact that its developers saw no particular need to
retain strong control of its source code.&rdquo; Unix source code was
originally fairly inexpensive compared to the cost of developing a
new operating system, and companies started choosing Unix as the
platform to build their software on. Companies who chose Unix spent
their effort and money on developing their applications, rather
than on maintaining and developing an operating system.</p><p>There were a few too many pages in this book attempting to
reach the stubborn Unix-haters, for example trying to soothe the
ego of the programmer who measures him/herself by the number of
pages to their large programs. I was slightly put off the book by
the psychological explanations of how programmers might behave
until I realized these were gentle nudges&mdash;and Unix-aficionados
are not known for gentleness in talking about other operating
systems&mdash;that might actually get through to even a lifetime-Brand
X operating system user.</p><p>I'd strongly recommend this book for people from all
operating system environments.</p></div></div>
