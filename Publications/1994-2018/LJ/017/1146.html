    This month Dean gives us a tour of databases available for
    Linux, from the novice perspective.

mini-expedition of sorts through the abundance of offerings found
in Linux. Last month I gave a rough accounting of spreadsheets and
text editors available. The listing was nowhere near complete and
was almost certainly out-of-date by printing time. The same caveat
will apply here as well.
</p><p>My new fountain for material is Infomagic's four-CD Linux
Developer's Resource&mdash;Live Slackware, mirrors of Tsx-11, Sunsite,
GNU archives, and a variety of other topics.</p><p>It's easy to get lost in the CD maze of Linux programs and my
glasses are already thick from too many hours in front of a
computer. The following is not meant to be a definitive listing,
just a gentle survey of some of what is available.</p><p>As I did in last month's column, I want to stress that the
following products are not commercial, although be commercial
versions may be available. Also, let me state my expectations to
make you are aware of my viewpoint. As a DOS database enthusiast, I
expect many of the Linux database offerings to be on par with, say,
a dBase II or dBase III, and perhaps compatible with them. Kind of
like what I found with the spreadsheets being on par with early
versions of Lotus-123 or Excel. Also, I hope for an interface nicer
than the infamous dBase dot-prompt.</p><p>The term &ldquo;relational databases&rdquo; refers to a way of &ldquo;joining&rdquo;
databases based on common (and usually indexed) fields. For
example, a physician database might link to a patient database with
the common field of physician ID appearing in both. When you choose
a physician (thereby also setting an ID) all of the patients with
the same physician ID will be also be selected. Not the best
example, but it conveys the idea.</p><p>Take a deep breath, and onward.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>mbase</b></span> (v5.0) is a relational
database system originally written for the Amiga and ported to
other platforms. It uses a C-like format to do the database
programming and, unfortunately, that's as far as I could go with
it. To compile required <span   class="bold"><b>ncurses</b></span>
which I installed but apparently not into the directories expected
by the mbase Makefile. Editing the Makefile didn't help much
either. mbase is beyond this novice, at least setting it up is. I
don't think mbase will meet my expectation for a friendly interface
if it uses a C format. As a final punch, when I removed ncurses
Linux started to behave weirdly. Strange, since I used the
installpkg and removepkg utilities included in Slackware and
they're pretty reliable (assuming they are the problem). I
reinstalled ncurses and now Linux is happy. [ncurses is becoming
the standard for Linux, which should make some of these problems go
away. For more information on ncurses, see page [??]--Ed]</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>lincks</b></span> (v2.2 pl 1) is an
OODBMS or object oriented database management system. It's covered
in the March, 1995 issue of <i  >Linux Journal</i>, but
I made the mistake of <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> reading the article
before installing. Consequently I gave up in frustration after a
very short time, confused over trying to get the RPC portmapper to
portmap. I'll stop here and refer people interested in lincks to
the afore-mentioned article. However a thought flashed through my
head: I'm looking for a single-user type database system and many
of these are multi-user, client-server Leviathans. I have an
inkling that many more won't work because they expect some sort of
network.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>onyx</b></span> (v2.24), a database
prototyping program, is also based on C-like language. It was
reviewed by the program author, Michael Kraeh, in the very first
issue of <i  >Linux Journal</i>, March, 1994. Single
users can use it as a database program, I guess, but I wasn't able
to use it. The documentation didn't explicitly say how to compile
or how to get started, quite an annoyance for this novice. I did
figure out that <b  >make config</b> would start the
process, and a nice structured series of questions popped up. These
questions would configure onyx but nowhere is there help as to what
they refer to. I wasn't surprised when it bombed. With the swap
file active I tried a <b  >make all install</b> which
ground for awhile but accomplished nothing. I took a final glance
through the various files using <span   class="bold"><b>mc</b></span>
as my snooping instrument but discovered nothing to help. Since
onyx is still a work in progress like many Linux programs, I
continued on to the next offering.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>postgres</b></span> (v4.0.1a) and
<span   class="bold"><b>Ingres</b></span> (v8.9) I'm lumping
together. Both are apparently high-end, multi-user, client-server
systems. Both have installations that stumped me because I'm a
single user and didn't install any network programs. Ingres, to
make things tough, recommends looking in setup.doc for installing
instructions. Guess which file didn't exist? While neither of these
of packages will meet my xBase expectations for ease (I'm guessing
on this), I do hope that an expert with some free minutes will
write a couple of in-depth articles on how to use both of these
programs. I heard of postgres and Ingres even before fiddling with
Unix so I'm curious about them. [There is a relatively new project
to create &ldquo;Postgres 95&rdquo;, which is intended to be a more modern,
bug-fixed version of postgres. It should also be easier to build
than the old &ldquo;University postgres&rdquo;&mdash;Ed]</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>pfl</b></span> (0.2 alpha) untars
nicely but the doinst.sh script didn't work for me. According to
the documentation, pfl is similar to Lisp which tells me that this
may not be suitable for impressionable novices and certainly not
what I'm looking for in an easy to use program. That is, I doubt
it's xBase compatible.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>qddb</b></span> (1.41.3 beta) stands
for &ldquo;Quick and Dirty Database&rdquo;. It's a database development system
that uses but doesn't require Tcl. However it does require bison
1.22 and flex 2.4.1 to compile. After so many packages my heart is
beginning to fade. I admit I looked at what it takes to configure
this package and didn't even give it a try. It looks
<span   class="emphasis"><em>that</em></span> scary and something tells me qddb won't
be what I have been expecting anyway. Yes, I'm being an outright
wimp.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>DBF</b></span> (1.5) calls itself the
x-base manipulation package and surprisingly (after so many novice
failures) it actually worked for me. It's a small collection of
programs that manipulate dbf files. For example, dbfadd adds a
record or layer of information to a database. dbflst lists the
records in a database. dbftst lists the structure. And there are
other such utilities. I wouldn't want to manage a complicated
database system with this package but for quick and easy fiddling
with a dbf file, it works, and the programs don't take up much hard
drive space.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>typhoon</b></span> (1.06) is another
relational database system. One of the text files states that it
was a rush job meaning incomplete documentation to make poor
novices sweat. I liked the honesty and hated the reality. Like many
of the previous database packages, it just wouldn't compile
correctly. The process takes two steps. The first,
<b  >configure</b>, runs cleanly. The second,
<b  >make</b>, crashes with some sort of menu. I tried
<b  >make all</b> and <b  >make install</b>,
both under /usr and /usr/local, but to no avail. I may go back for
another try after fiddling with some of the other packages because
typhoon was inspired by Raima's db_VISTA, a system I'd like to try.
I assume the one major difference between this and db_VISTA is the
C structure for all processes. typhoon, according to its
literature, can handle a variety of unions, relation keys, and
variable types. Referential integrity is also part of a good list
of features. The author is currently working on, among other
things, import and export functions. It all
<span   class="emphasis"><em>sounds</em></span> impressive! If it would only compile
for me.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>FlagShip</b></span> is a
good-for-10-days demo and reading some of the docs gave me great
hopes and familiar ground to explore. It offered CA/Clipper and
dBase compatibility, an ability to include C code and with included
utilities can even access FoxPro programs and databases! Could this
be my Grail achieved? It started out easy enough. Copy the
multi-meg fs4lix.gz1 and .gz2 to /tmp/FS and concatenate them
together with:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cat fs4lix.gz* &gt; fsdemo.tar.gz
</pre><p>After that I ran FSinstall which walked me through a menu.
And then my luck failed. The program did something to my screen so
that I couldn't see what I was typing; rebooting cleared the
problem. Going to /usr/FSsrc, I compiled a sample program
successfully but the result was a file called a.out which again
killed my screen when I tried to run it. Fine, maybe FlagShip is
expecting to run under X-Windows. Delete a.out, set the swapfile
active, into X-Windows, compile another test program and, yup!,
another a.out which weirds up the system. Luckily, exiting
X-Windows restored things. Perhaps it may be the ncurses that I
previously installed for mbase. FlagShip seems to want a different
version of curses and unfortunately I don't have the know-how to
test this idea.</p><p>Farewell to FlagShip. At least the package includes a useful
though tedious FSuninstall. It asks you for every single
FlagShip-related file whether you want to delete it. 2.9 billion
prompts for deletion or it felt that way after awhile. But of all
the programs I looked at, FlagShip held the most interest for me as
a visitor from DOS and probably would be what I would purchase if I
needed a Unix database system. Of course, I would have someone else
install it.</p><p>My expectations for something familiar weren't met. None of
the packages looked like a dBase clone except for FlagShip which I
never got to any sort of visual state. Yet where I was expecting an
immature field it looks or <span   class="emphasis"><em>sounds</em></span> like these
programs are fairly sophisticated (although quite a chore to
compile and install).</p><p>But unmet expectations weren't the frustration. It was the
general lack of success. I make an effort for this column to end
with some sort of achievement. Sure, I may end up re-installing
Linux twelve times, but always I've ended positively as a sort of
morale boost for us intrepid novices. Not this time. Except for the
DBF set of xbase utilities, this Casey struck out, overwhelmed by
intense installation instructions.</p><p>What also bothered me is that many of the packages&mdash;and I am
not just referring to databases&mdash;lack decent documentation. For a
novice, two crucial items of information are
<span   class="emphasis"><em>where</em></span> to unzip, uncompress, or untar the
packages and <span   class="emphasis"><em>how</em></span> to compile, particularly if
the Makefile requires or expects things in a certain way. I applaud
the &ldquo;.lsm&rdquo; files which accompany many zipped and compressed files
on the CDs and on the Net. They give some help in figuring out what
goes where before you actually unzip.</p><p>I can hear some of the software authors saying &ldquo;So what? The
hackers, the experts can figure things out,&rdquo; and this may be true.
But Linux has been getting great reviews and mentions in many
popular and diverse magazines, and with that you're going to get
people other than experts snooping around and wondering, &ldquo;Why the
uproar?&rdquo; These people represent the future audience of Linux and
like it or not, these Linux novices will have to be attended to in
terms of easier installation routines and clearer documentation.
It's part of the price of success!</p><p>Next month: more mischief and a happy ending.</p></div></div>
