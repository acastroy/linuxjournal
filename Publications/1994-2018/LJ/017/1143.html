explored the history of Unix; in <span   class="emphasis"><em>Casting the
Net</em></span> he turns to the history of the Internet. After a
brief look at the &ldquo;prehistory&rdquo; of networking, he covers the
development of the ARPANET in some detail. He then discusses a
variety of material, organised thematically and roughly
chronologically: early networks in Europe and Japan (but nothing
about Australia); the development of new protocols (particularly
for mail); the switch to TCP/IP; the OSI protocol wars; UUCP and
Usenet; BITNET and Fidonet (and a bit on IBM's VNET); the NSFnet;
the NREN and the NII; the most recent commercialisation and
explosion of the Internet; and so forth. Information is current up
to December 1994, so <span   class="emphasis"><em>Casting the Net</em></span> is not
<span   class="bold"><b>too</b></span> badly out of date.</p><p>In a couple of places Salus pretends he's writing a book for
the masses---at one point he devotes a couple of pages to
explaining the difference between datagram- and circuit-based
networks, for example---but this pretence is not maintained---while
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Casting the Net</em></span> doesn't assume a great deal of
technical knowledge, it is still very much a technical history,
written for those who work with networks and networking protocols.
For example, the book includes all the April Fools' Day RFCs,
material that can hardly be appreciated by anyone who's never read
an RFC or tried to understand a networking protocol.</p><p>Whereas <span   class="emphasis"><em>A Quarter Century of Unix</em></span> was
built out of quotes, more of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Casting the Net</em></span>
is taken up by diagrams, time lines, and digressions. Most of these
are reprinted from easily accessible sources (like the digressions,
many of the quotes are from RFCs), so there is a lot less original
material than in the earlier book, and I don't think it is as
impressive an achievement. It includes a lot of good material,
however, and it's a good read; once again, I finished it within a
day of receiving my copy. As a compact technical history of the
Net, it doesn't have much competition.</p></div></div>
