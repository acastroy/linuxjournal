    Find out how SSC uses Linux to produce all of their
    products, including this magazine.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x167c580.0x17743f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>When I came to SSC (publishers of
<i  >Linux Journal</i>), I was told the first thing I
had to do was learn the computer system. Having never been exposed
to Unix, I set out to discover as much as I could. Coming from an
MS-Windows environment, I had a lot to learn. The more I learned
about the system we use, the more questions I asked. Here is what I
found out.
</p><p>The first thing I noticed was the multi-tasking capabilities
of Linux (I'm not even going to get into Win95). Everyone at SSC
has a Linux system (workstation) at their desk, which they log into
every morning. In addition, there are two non-Linux systems in the
office: a Windows for Workgroups system used for graphics and
magazine layout and a Unix System V, Release 4.2 system used to run
the Progress database, which has not yet been ported to
Linux.</p><p>Once logged onto their local system, users can perform tasks
locally (such as reading electronic mail) or access the other
computers via rlogin, telnet, ftp, and so on.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x167c580.0x1774608"></a>Our Network</h2></div></div><p>All of the workstations are linked via a thin Ethernet
backbone, except for a few which are connected via twisted pair
Ethernet to a twisted pair hub, which is then connected to the
thinnet backbone.</p><p>The main backbone ends at the Orion Firewall System that sits
between the internal network and a second, externally visible
network that connects to the Internet through a Xyplex router and a
CSU/DSU (also known as a &ldquo;digital modem&rdquo;) over a T1 Frame Relay
connection to our Internet Service Provider, Alternate Access, Inc.
Our Web server, www.ssc.com, is also on this externally visible
network, outside our firewall.</p><p>There is a third network in the office. The Windows for
Workgroups (WfW) machine is on this network with one Linux system
also connected to the regular internal network. This setup keeps
the large amount of traffic between the WfW system and the Linux
system (which drives the Imagesetter) from bogging down the main
network.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x167c580.0x17747c0"></a>Network Management</h2></div></div><p>Often, in a multi-user environment like ours, every computer
has a unique password file, local to that system. If someone wants
to change their password, they have to log into every system
individually to make the change office-wide. All of our systems
instead use NIS (Network Information Service) to centrally manage
all password and group files, access permissions, host address
information, and data on a single server. NIS distributes a single
master password file to all the systems transparently. Since the
network is running NFS (the Network File System), files can be
accessed between systems easily. This is easier for both the user
and the administrator.</p><p>SSC uses sendmail as its mail daemon to monitor and manage
the delivery of all electronic mail messages. Sendmail is the de
facto standard Mail Transfer Agent (MTA) for most complicated
networks. Although it is not easy to configure, it is the most
configurable and most flexible of all the mail daemons available.
It determines whether each e-mail address is local or remote,
delivers local e-mail locally, and sends remote e-mail to remote
systems via the Internet (using SMTP, the Simple Mail Transfer
Protocol) or UUCP (described later).</p><p>All outgoing mail at SSC is routed through a single
workstation for delivery via sendmail. This centralizes the e-mail
system so there is only one log file, one daemon, one thing to
break and be fixed. Incoming mail is queued on the Web server
outside the Orion firewall system with smap, a
<span   class="emphasis"><em>secure</em></span> mail queue program. Smap acts like a
normal mail daemon and queues mail. Then smap calls sendmail to
process the queued mail, sending it to the real internal hub for
local delivery. The smap client implements a minimal version of
SMTP, accepting messages from over the network and writing them to
the disk for future delivery by smapd. Like anonymous ftp, smap is
designed to run under chroot, except it also runs as a
non-privileged process to overcome potential security risks
presented by privileged mailers running where they can be accessed
over a network. Sendmail still runs, but only when it's told to,
instead of all the time.</p><p>UUCP
(<span   class="bold"><b>U</b></span>nix-to-<span   class="bold"><b>U</b></span>nix
<span   class="bold"><b>c</b></span>o<span   class="bold"><b>p</b></span>y)
delivered mail is also forwarded to the sendmail hub via smap.
Sendmail then sorts the <span   class="emphasis"><em>regular</em></span> SMTP mail from
the UUCP delivered mail. The SMTP mail is delivered locally and the
UUCP delivered mail is spooled in directories where the UUCP system
can find them. Since the modems which deliver the spooled UUCP
delivered mail to local recipients are on the Web server, which is
on the externally-visible network, these files are transfered from
the internal system to the Web server with tar and scp, a secure
version of the rcp (remote copy) command.</p><p>tar (<span   class="bold"><b>t</b></span>ape
<span   class="bold"><b>ar</b></span>chive) and scp
(<span   class="bold"><b>s</b></span>ecure
<span   class="bold"><b>c</b></span>o<span   class="bold"><b>p</b></span>y)
are used every three hours to transfer the mail automatically to
the Web server. The mail is then deleted from the local workstation
to avoid duplication.</p><p>By handling mail this way, only one machine, the Web server,
needs to have a modem and access/exposure to the outside world, and
the line doesn't need to remain open.</p><p>PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol) service allows employees remote
dial-in access outside the firewall by the Web server. Users then
access the internal network (and their own desktop workstations, if
they wish) using <span   class="bold"><b>ssh</b></span>, a
<span   class="bold"><b>s</b></span>ecure
<span   class="bold"><b>sh</b></span>ell that encrypts all the data
sent between the internal workstation being accessed and the Web
server. Employees can also use ssh to get from their home computers
to the Web server ensuring a completely secure line, or telnet if
they don't have ssh on their home machines.we</p><p>All the user home directories at SSC, as well as the local
binaries directory, are shared via NFS (Network File System)
between all workstations. With the current system, every time users
want to read files in their home directory, the files must be
transferred across the network to their computers. Soon we will be
moving all the user directories from the office file server to each
user's own workstation for the following reasons:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Transferring file across the network is much slower
than transfering them from the local hard drives, making file
access slower.</p></li><li><p>Also the network has a limited amount of bandwidth
(amount of information it can carry at one time), and eliminating
unnecessary use will speed up the network.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x167c580.0x17751b8"></a>The Web Server</h2></div></div><p>SSC's Web server is an AMD 486DX4/100 machine running Linux
and the Apache server software. The server contains SSC's catalog
and product information, as well as information on <i  >Linux Journal</i>, including covers and tables of contents from
all issues, selected articles from some issues, and advertiser
indices. We also offer space for sale to <i  >Linux Journal</i> and <span   class="emphasis"><em>WEBsmith</em></span> advertisers if
they need a home for their Web pages.</p><p>One of the big advantages of Apache is that it can appear to
be different servers with different domain names and IP
addresses&mdash;that is, it is &ldquo;multi-homed&rdquo;. This makes it possible
for our single computer running one Web server to serve as the Web
server for Zebu Systems, L.L.C. (http://www.zebu.com/) and Cucumber
Information Systems
(<a href="http://www.cucumber.com" target="_self">http://www.cucumber.com/</a>)
as well.</p><p>The server has been in operation since May and accesses
continue to increase. We are currently receiving around 35,000 hits
per day. Apache is very efficient and reliable. Even with only 16MB
of RAM on the machine, we seldom see a load average of over 0.2.
This means there is an average of one process waiting to run 20% of
the time, and the rest of the time the machine is idle.</p><p>Keeping the Web server outside of the Orion Firewall System
keeps the internal network safe in the event the Web server is
compromised. The Web server is mirrored from the internal network
so that if it is compromised, it can be restored easily.</p><p><a href="0086f1.html" target="_self">SSC Computer

PostScript:</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>PostScript is a Page Description Language (PDL)
developed by Adobe Systems, Inc. PostScript tells any printer which
has PostScript built in, how to print a page that consists of text
and/or graphics. The page must be generated by software that
includes a driver which converts the page into PostScript code; the
code, in turn, is translated by the printer. PostScript is the de
facto PDL standard for high-end desktop publishing because, among
other reasons, it can operate across a range of platforms, is very
precise, and has color capabilities.</em></span> Holt and
Morgan&mdash;UNIX: An Open Systems Dictionary.</p><p>Text files, such as invoices, that we need to print out are
done in ASCII. They are sent to one of the dot matrix printers, or
the one laser printer reserved for printing plain text.</p><p>We have seven printers on the network, shared via lpd. Users
can select their default printer by setting their
<b  >PRINTER</b> environment variable.</p><p>Many of the printers are selected based on their location
relative to the person using them. Others may be selected because
of their speed. One special printer, a Tektronix Phaser III PXi is
a wax-transfer color PostScript printer. This is used for producing
color proofs of SSC products, magazine covers and pages, and other
graphics such as Web pages.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x167c580.0x17758f0"></a>Database</h2></div></div><p>The database we use, Progress, isn't available for Linux.
Therefore, the database is run on a Unix System V, release 4.2
system. Progress is run in character mode, and users access the
database via rlogin or telnet from their Linux workstations.</p><p>This database is used to store all customer and
vendor-related information. This includes customer contacts,
subscription information, sales transactions, reader service leads,
the Linux consultants directory and a whole lot more. We are in the
process of moving advertising booking to this database as well.
Other <span   class="emphasis"><em>small</em></span> databases (article tracking, for
example) are written in Perl and run on Linux systems.</p><p>We have used Progress for years. (We used to run the whole
office on a Xenix system.) If we had it to do all over again, we
would select a database methodology that would make it possible to
run everything on Linux and not have a <span   class="emphasis"><em>foreign</em></span>
Unix system in the network. While it is not a reliability problem,
it does mean we have to support another operating system.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x167c580.0x1775b58"></a>Magazine Production</h2></div></div><p>When I tell people I work for a publishing company, many ask,
&ldquo;Are you using a Macintosh for your layout?&rdquo; The answer is &ldquo;no&rdquo;. We
use Quark Express and Corel Draw! on Windows for Workgroups and tie
the process directly into our Linux network. In order to explain
this, let's examine the magazine production process from start to
finish.</p><p>First, Michael K. Johnson, the editor, finds people to write
articles for <i  >Linux Journal</i> on various topics.
Note that Michael is located in North Carolina, while the remainder
of SSC's staff is located in Seattle. This means that Michael uses
his local Linux systems to do much of his work and uses his
Internet connection to access machines in Seattle. When the
articles are sent in (via e-mail), Michael edits them and sends
them to our production editor in Seattle. At this point the
articles that he sends are in Quark Tag Format&mdash;ASCII text with
various <span   class="emphasis"><em>escape sequences</em></span> added to them to
indicate paragraph types, font changes, and other formatting. We
are currently developing a new language closely related to HTML
(HyperText Markup Language), the language of the World Wide Web.
Once this language is complete, we will be able to automatically
translate articles into Quark Tag Format for layout and into HTML
for addition to our Web site.</p><p>The production editor files the articles, runs some basic
checks [like spelling; yours truly can't be trusted to spell
anything right&mdash;ED] and prints them out in preparation for our
copy editors. The print process is done using a shell script that
uses sed and awk to translate the Quark tagged file into troff
source and pipes the result through groff to produce a reasonable
approximation of what the article will look like when it is
imported into Quark and printed.</p><p>Articles returned from copy editors are then reviewed by the
production editor and changes are made as needed. This step
sometimes involves contacting the author for clarification&mdash;a step
that is generally carried out via e-mail.</p><p>The final version of the articles are slightly modified by
another shell script which like the first, uses sed and awk to do
its work. This is necessary because Quark requires that paragraphs
be one continuous line. Also there are some particularly awful
Quark escape sequences that we have aliased to simpler escape
sequences which need to be converted to the real sequences in order
to be interpreted correctly by Quark. These modified files are
written to a location on the Linux filesystem that can be accessed
directly by the WfW system.</p><p>Our layout is done using Quark Express on our WfW system.
Once the ads are placed, the articles are put in. The result of the
first layout process is a semi-complete magazine. A copy is printed
locally on the Tektronix printer for review, and a PostScript image
is written to a Linux filesystem so Michael can download it and
print it in North Carolina. The locally-printed copy is printed
from the WfW machine on a Linux-connected printer; this is much
faster than directly connecting the printer to the WfW system, as
was originally done.</p><p>The production editor merges the changes from Michael and the
other reviewers and sends them back to layout for final changes. If
the changes are extensive, the article may be re-edited as text
using vi or emacs on a Linux system and re-submitted to
layout.</p><p>After the second layout step, a paper copy of the magazine is
printed for review by our proofreader. Changes from this cycle are
made, and the layout system outputs a PostScript image of the
magazine (in 2 to 8-page chunks) to a Linux filesystem connected to
the imagesetter.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x167c580.0x176c808"></a>Samba</h2></div></div><p>Although the layout system is running WfW and typesetting is
running Linux, the file transfer is completely transparent to both
departments, just like printing. This is made possible by
Samba.</p><p>In the most basic sense, everything in the office uses TCP/IP
as the underlying protocol. Windows for Workgroups speaks SMB
(Session Message Block protocol), a protocol which uses TCP/IP. In
order for Linux to speak SMB, we run Samba. Samba is a free
implementation of the SMB protocol for Unix. It was developed by
Andrew Tridgell in 1992 in an attempt to mount disk space from a
Sun to a PC running Pathworks. [See <i  >Linux Journal</i> Issue 7 for an account of Samba's
development&mdash;ED] The Linux filesystem appears as network drives to
WfW.</p><p>So Samba is used to seamlessly transfer the PostScript files
from the WfW system to the Linux machine that drives the AGFA
imagesetter. This is essentially a camera with a laser instead of a
lens; it uses the laser to expose a large sheet of photographic
film. There is one sheet of film for each black and white page and
four sheets of film for each color page. This film is what is
mailed to the printing company.</p><p>Once a magazine is finished, the files are archived on an
Iomega Zip drive via Samba. The Zip drive is a removable 100 MB
magnetic disk drive, much like a monster floppy, which is connected
through a SCSI interface to the same Linux workstation that
connects to the imagesetter. It connects to any SCSI-2 controller
and acts like any other SCSI device. It is slightly slower than a
typical hard drive but faster than some old MFM/RLL drives.</p><p>The ZIP disks are mounted on the Linux system like any other
Linux filesystem. Linux views the new drive as a mounted partition
of an existing drive. It can then be added to the Windows for
Workgroups system, where the ZIP drive is seen as another network
drive.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x167c580.0x176cac8"></a>Other SSC Products</h2></div></div><p>Besides <i  >Linux Journal</i>, SSC publishes a
series of books and references, primarily on Linux and Unix. Most
of these products are done using troff and/or groff. The exceptions
are the LDP (Linux Documentation Project) books, which are done in
LaTeX, and the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Internet Public Access Guide</em></span>,
which was done in Quark Express.</p><p>Again, we produce film directly at SSC to ship to the
printer. One of the more interesting recent innovations was the
ability to produce <span   class="emphasis"><em>spot color</em></span> separations
using groff. This came about when we were updating the Korn Shell
Reference. This card is in four colors. Besides the additional cost
of having the printer produce the separations it was going to be
very hard to proof a multi-color card if only black and white
output was available.</p><p>Work on the part of Arnold Robbins and SSC staff produced an
easy way to write the color changes directly in the groff source.
With two targets in the Makefile, one for printing the color output
and one for producing the color-separated film, we were able to
accomplish the desired task. These changes require groff and won't
work with troff, since they are done by including raw PostScript
commands in the groff source.</p><p>Many people may be asking why we continue to produce products
using what many consider outdated tools. For those who really use
the Unix environment, groff offers some advantages. For example,
many of our recent products have been written by authors located
far away from our Seattle offices. By using groff, we can send
small ASCII files and use tools like diff to only send changes
between locations. It also means we don't need multiple copies of
expensive layout programs to accomplish the task.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x167c580.0x176cde0"></a>Yes, We Use DOS Too</h2></div></div><p>Our office manager uses QuickBooks to do our accounting. Why?
Because it was available and inexpensive. She uses DOSemu on her
Linux workstation for this task, allowing her to quickly switch
back and forth between QuickBooks and, for example, her e-mail. In
the future we hope to convert this task over to some software that
runs on Linux, but for the moment, this offers a reasonable
solution.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x167c580.0x176cee8"></a>What's Next?</h2></div></div><p>We have much planned for Linux in the future. For example, we
currently do credit card verification off-line. We hope to write
the necessary software to do this directly from a Linux system. We
also hope that Progress will be ported to Linux. If this doesn't
happen we will probably re-write our database system using a
database that runs on Linux.</p><p>In conclusion, no, we don't use Linux for everything. But we
come pretty close. Linux has proven inexpensive, easily expandable
and reliable. For those who thought we didn't use Linux to produce
the magazine, now you know. With all but one of our employees
sitting at a Linux console every day, I think we practice what we
preach rather well.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x167c580.0x176d048"></a>Resources</h2></div></div><p>Some of the tools mentioned in this article may not have been
