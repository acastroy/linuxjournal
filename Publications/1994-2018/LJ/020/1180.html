    All about the find command.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1aed580.0x1be5450"></a></h2></div></div><p>Not long after getting their first Linux
system, new users usually need to locate a file somewhere on their
system. So they learn the following command from a friend, or maybe
a book or magazine:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ find / -name <span   class="emphasis"><em>filename</em></span> -print
</pre><p>Now while this command does work perfectly fine, the syntax
does seem awkward to people unfamiliar with the
<span   class="bold"><b>find</b></span> command. Why should we have
to specify <b  >print</b>? [Note: On Linux systems, and
other systems that use GNU find, we don't. But standard Unix find
insists on it, so you might as well get used to it if you use Unix
as well as Linux.]</p><p>For that matter, why should we have to specify
<b  >name</b>? Why not just <b  >find
<i><tt>filename</tt></i></b>? It's this seemingly
cryptic structure that makes find one of the most under used
commands in the Unix toolbox.</p><p>A look at the find man page (on any system, not just Linux)
completes the confusing picture. For someone not familiar with
Unix, <span   class="bold"><b>find</b></span>'s &ldquo;operators&rdquo; and
&ldquo;expressions&rdquo; make it an awfully complicated program just for
locating files.</p><p>If all you want to do is locate a file, there is a better way
to do that:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
locate <span   class="emphasis"><em>filename</em></span>
</pre><p>This will work on a properly set-up Linux system with GNU
find. Why have a complicated command like
<span   class="bold"><b>find</b></span> when we already have a simple
command like <span   class="bold"><b>locate</b></span>? Because find
is good for much more than just finding files. (Good Linux
distributions some with update properly set up. If yours isn't, you
can run <span   class="bold"><b>updatedb</b></span> as root to update
the database it uses, or simply use find as shown above).</p><p>The Caldera/Redhat system that I use at home has several
entries in the crontab that run this command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
find /tmp/* -atime +10 -exec rm -f {} \;
</pre><p>This command deletes any files in /tmp that haven't been
accessed in the past ten days. The fact that find only deletes
files that haven't been <span   class="bold"><b>accessed</b></span>
in the past ten days rather than files that were
<span   class="bold"><b>created</b></span> that long ago is a subtle,
but very important point. Find gives us access to the very valuable
set of information stored about files and directories in Unix
filesystems.</p><p>Like most Unix filesystems, the second extended filesystem
(&ldquo;ext2&rdquo;) that is used on most Linux systems stores a more
extensive set of data about files than just their name, size and
last-change-date the way systems such as DOS do. It also stores an
owner and group, access mode, the dates that the file was last
modified and accessed, the date that the file last changed status,
and the type. (Don't worry, we'll explain these as we go).</p><p>With the exception of the names, all this information is
stored for each file and directory in a structure called an inode.
In Unix filesystems, directories are simply
<span   class="emphasis"><em>files</em></span> that contain a list of filenames with
inode numbers.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="1180t1.jpg"></div><p>Table 1 has a list of inode entry fields and how they are
&ldquo;translated&rdquo; for the different filesystem types supported by
Linux. While this table may not mean much to you yet, it should be
self-explanatory by the time you finish reading this
article.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1aed580.0x1be5fa8"></a>The Command Line</h2></div></div><p>Let's analyze the find command line:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
find <span   class="emphasis"><em>starting-point</em></span> <span   class="emphasis"><em>options</em></span> <span   class="emphasis"><em>criteria</em></span> <span   class="emphasis"><em>action</em></span>
</pre><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><b  ><i><tt>starting-point</tt></i></b>
One or more directories from which to start searching. The default
is the current directory.</p></li><li><p><b  ><i><tt>options</tt></i></b>
Modify the methods used for searching in several ways.</p></li><li><p><b  ><i><tt>criteria</tt></i></b>
Specify which files are chosen, and which are ignored. All files
found are chosen by default.</p></li><li><p><b  ><i><tt>action</tt></i></b>
What to do with the files that are chosen. GNU find has a default
action of <b  >-print</b>, but standard Unix find has no
default action, and will abort and complain unless an action is
explicitly provided.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1aed580.0x1be6898"></a>The Starting Point</h2></div></div><p>The <span   class="emphasis"><em>starting-point</em></span> parameter has two
effects on find's actions. The most obvious is that it specifies in
which directory (or directories; there can be more than one
starting point) to start looking for files. The other effect is on
how the chosen filenames are treated, as this example shows:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ cd /usr/X11/man
$ find man5 -print
man5
man5/XF86Config.5x
man5/pbm.5
man5/pgm.5
man5/pnm.5
man5/ppm.5
$ find /usr/X11/man/man5 -print
/usr/X11/man/man5
/usr/X11/man/man5/XF86Config.5x
/usr/X11/man/man5/pbm.5
/usr/X11/man/man5/pgm.5
/usr/X11/man/man5/pnm.5
/usr/X11/man/man5/ppm.5
</pre><p>When a user is simply looking for a file, this difference in
behavior does not matter very much. But when you want to use the
output from find to drive another program, it can be very
important, depending on the program being driven.</p><p>In addition to the starting point, we have control over some
other aspects of find's behavior, such as how it should handle soft
links, how to evaluate file timestamps and how deep to follow
directory structures. These are controlled by
<span   class="emphasis"><em>options</em></span>.</p><p>The <b  >-follow</b> option tells find to follow
soft (or symbolic) links to the actual file. A soft link is a file
that &ldquo;points&rdquo; to another file. To demonstrate this option, create
(as a normal user, not as root) a soft link with
<span   class="bold"><b>ln</b></span> in your home directory that
points to file that belongs to root.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ cd
$ ln -s /vmlinuz ./kernel
</pre><p>Now use ls to produce a long listing for the file.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ ls -l kernel
lrwxrwxrwx ... kernel -&gt; /vmlinuz
</pre><p>The first column of the mode, <b  >l</b>, tells us
it is a soft link. We also are told what file the link &ldquo;points&rdquo;
to.</p><p>Now let's demonstrate the effect of find's
<b  >-follow</b> option by searching through the
directory for files belonging to root, using it. (uid 0 is root;
we'll cover the -uid option in more detail later.)</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ find . -uid 0 -print
<span   class="emphasis"><em>nothing is printed</em></span>
$ find . -follow -uid 0 -print
./kernel
</pre><p>You created the link to the kernel, so you own the link,
called ./kernel. But the file /vmlinuz is owned by root.</p><p>The <b  >-daystart</b> option modifies the behavior
of find when it comes to evaluating time. When
<b  >-daystart</b> is specified, find will measure days
from the beginning of the day instead of from 24 hours ago. (We
will cover the parameters related to time later.)</p><p>Frequently a user will need to find a file that he or she
knows is somewhere on local hard disk, and not on a mounted cdrom
or network volume. An easy way to keep find from straying to these
other disks is with the <b  >-xdev</b> option.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ find / -name document -print
</pre><p>will cause find to search for the file &ldquo;document&rdquo; in every
directory under /, which can be very slow with a CDROM or network
filesystem mounted.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ find / -xdev -name document -print
</pre><p>will instead cause find to limit its search to the device that / is
mounted on. (An alias for <b  >-xdev</b> is
<b  >-mount</b>) Of course, if you have more than one
local filesystem, you will need to execute a different search for
it. Perhaps</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ find / /usr -xdev -name document -print
</pre><p>if you have two partitions, one for / and one for /usr.
   Alternately, you can say</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ find / -fstype ext2 -name document -print
</pre><p>if all your local partitions are ext2 filesystems.</p><p>Another way to save time on searches is to use the options
related to directory depth.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ find /usr -maxdepth 4 -name document -print
</pre><p>will limit find's search for document to directories four
level deep or less &ldquo;under&rdquo; /usr.</p><p>Another option related to directory depth is
<b  >-depth</b>, which causes the directories to be
selected before any files in them. We'll see later why this is
useful.</p><p>The <b  >-noleaf</b> option is used for searching
filesystems that aren't Unix-like. Table 1 tells for which
filesystems specifying <b  >-noleaf</b> may speed up your
search.</p><p>We already had an example of finding a file by name. Other
mechanisms for matching filenames are <b  >-path</b>,
which matches by directory name, <b  >-iname</b>, which
is similar to <b  >-name</b> but case insensitive, and
<b  >-ipath</b>, which is also case insensitive.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1aed580.0x1fdfbc0"></a>Pick and Choose</h2></div></div><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Criteria</em></span> allow you to select
files.</p><p>Each file has access, status, and modification times, and
find provides three time-based criteria, one for each of these
values. They can be checked in increments of days or minutes, and
files can be compared based on these times.</p><p>The modification time is set every time the file's contents
are changed.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ find . -mtime +10 -print
</pre><p>will print out files that have not been modified in the past
ten days, similar to our second example.</p><p>In the previous example we used the plus sign to signify
&ldquo;more than.&rdquo; In addition to this, find also supports the minus
sign to indicate less than.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ find / -mtime -5 -print
</pre><p>will print out files that were accessed less than 5 days ago.
The absence of these operators will cause find to choose
<span   class="bold"><b>exact</b></span> matches. As mentioned
before, the <b  >-daystart</b> option will modify the
search so that the dates are based on the most recent midnight
instead of 24 hours before now.</p><p>To use minutes instead of days, use the
<b  >-mmin</b> criterion.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ find . -mmin +10 -print
</pre><p>will output files that have been modified more than ten
minutes ago.</p><p>The <b  >-newer</b> criterion</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ find . -newer document -print
</pre><p>will output files that have been modified more recently than
document.</p><p>The command sets both the <span   class="emphasis"><em>access</em></span> and
<span   class="emphasis"><em>modification</em></span> times on files. If the file does
not exist, it will be created. We can use it for an example.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ touch foo
</pre><p>will create a file named &ldquo;foo&rdquo; in the current directory, if
   there isn't already one there. Now,</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ find -mmin 1 -print
</pre><p>should output <b  >foo</b>, but</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ find -mmin 2 -print
</pre><p>should not.</p><p>For access time, which indicates the last time the files were
opened, find has similar options. For days there is
<b  >-atime</b>, for minutes <b  >-amin</b> and
for comparisons <b  >-anewer</b>.</p><p>Status time initially indicates creation time, and then
follows any modifications to the file or its
<span   class="emphasis"><em>inode</em></span>. It can be used with
<b  >-ctime</b>, <b  >-cmin</b>, and
<b  >-cnewer</b>. These criteria match files based on the
last time a file's ownership, access mode, or other characteristics
have been changed.</p><p>Find also has a <b  >-used</b> option. It will
match files that have been accessed since their status was last
changed:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
find -used +2
</pre><p>will find files that have been used more than two days since
their status was last changed.</p><p>I've mentioned file modes a few time throughout this article.
File modes express which users may perform certain operations on a
file, what type of file it is and also some other information about
the file. find allows us to match files based on their mode.</p><p>Before I go over these options, I will explain file modes and
how they are displayed and set.</p><p>Users most commonly come in contact with file modes when they
concern file ownership and access. A file belongs to an owner and a
group, therefore it follows that access is controlled with respect
to three entities: owner, group and world. (&ldquo;World&rdquo; is made up of
users that are not the owner and do not belong to the affiliated
group.)</p><p>Access is controlled with respect to three actions: Reading,
writing (which includes deletion) and execution. Let's look at the
output of a long listing with ls.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ ls -l foo
-rw-rw-r-- 1 eric staff  0 Sep  6 22:55 foo
</pre><p>(I've deleted some of the spaces ls normally creates in order
to fit the entire output.) The leftmost column of the output has
ten characters that show use foo's mode and file type. From the
left, the first is used by ls to show us the type of file. For
example, if it were a link or directory we would see an
<b  >l</b> or <b  >d</b> there.</p><p>The remaining nine characters show us the access mode. In
groups of three, the show us the rights for owner, group, and
world, in that order. Each triplet has a field for read
<b  >r</b>, write <b  >w</b> and execute
<b  >x</b>.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ chmod 777 foo
$ ls -l foo
-rwxrwxrwx 1 eric staff  0 Sep  6 22:55 foo
</pre><p>We have turned on all permissions for all users on the file
&ldquo;foo&rdquo;.</p><p>The <span   class="bold"><b>chmod</b></span> command can use
two different kinds of notation, symbolic and octal. While symbolic
notation is easier to remember for most people, I used octal
notation, because it is the format for modes that find expects.
With this notation each number represents the octal permissions for
each user class.</p><p>The permissions are calculated by adding the
following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>4 Read</p></li><li><p>2 Write</p></li><li><p>1 Execute</p></li></ul></div><p>So if you want to give the owner of a file full permissions
and group and world only read and execute permissions, you want to
&ldquo;set&rdquo; all bits for owner, and the read and execute bits for the
others:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Owner = 4 + 2 + 1 = 7
Group = 4 + 1     = 5
World = 4 + 1     = 5
</pre><p>So the command would be:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ chmod 755 program
$ ls -l program
-rwxr-xr-x 1 eric  staff 106410 Sep  6 22:55 program
</pre><p>The listing shows the mode we expected.</p><p>Back to find: the <b  >-perm</b> criterion accepts
this type of notation.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ find . -perm 777 -print
</pre><p>would find all of the files in and under the current
directory that have read, write and execute permissions set for all
users.</p><p>The <b  >-perm</b> option also supports the
<b  >+</b> and <b  >-</b> operators.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ find . -perm +600 -print
</pre><p>would output any files that are readable
<span   class="bold"><b>or</b></span> writable by their owner.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ find . -perm -600 -print
</pre><p>would output any files that are readable
<span   class="bold"><b>and</b></span> writable by their owner.</p><p>Therefore the <b  >+</b> acts as a boolean &ldquo;or&rdquo;
and the <b  >-</b> acts as a boolean &ldquo;and&rdquo;.</p><p>The ability to find files based on their permissions is an
important security tool. Later, I will cover some important special
file modes, and how find can help protect a system from attacks
that use them.</p><p>File size is another option offered by find. File sizes may
be specified in 512 byte blocks, two byte words, kilobytes or just
bytes. Since size is a numeric option + and - are also
supported.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ find . -size +4096k -print
</pre><p>will print the names of any files larger than four megabytes.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ find . -size -1c -print
</pre><p>will print the names of any files smaller than one byte. The
<b  >-empty</b> option also matches empty files.</p><p>For 512 byte blocks the number should be followed by a &ldquo;b&rdquo;,
for 2 byte words a &ldquo;w&rdquo;.</p><p>There is one caveat when searching for files by size. Some
files, such as /var/adm/lastlog, have more space allocated than
they actually use. These files are known as &ldquo;sparse&rdquo; or &ldquo;holey&rdquo;
files. Like ls, find will report these files by the space they have
allocated, not the space they are actually using. If you have any
doubt about how much space a file is using, use the du
command.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ ls -l /var/adm/lastlog
</pre><p>reports a size of 16032 (15k) on my system;</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ du -k /var/adm/lastlog
</pre><p>reports only 3k.</p><p>Our first example showed us how to find a file when we know
the exact name. Find will also accept the <b  >*</b>
wildcard, but the file name must then be quoted in order to prevent
the shell from expanding the file name before passing it to
find.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ find / -name "*gif" -print
</pre><p>will output all of the files ending in &ldquo;gif&rdquo; on the entire
system.</p><p>In addition to simple wildcards, find also supports regular
expressions with the <b  >-regex</b> option.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ find . -regex './[0-9].*' -print
</pre><p>will locate any files in the current directory that begin
with a number. Note that the regular expression is applied to the
entire path, which makes the expression rather difficult to write.
For more information about regular expressions see the man pages
for grep or the article in the October issue of <i  >Linux Journal</i>.</p><p>Another search criterion is file type.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ find / -type d -print
</pre><p>will list all of the directories. Here is a list of the file
   types and the appropriate letter to use to search for them.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><b  >b</b> block special files such as a
disk device.</p></li><li><p><b  >c</b> character special files such
as a terminal device.</p></li><li><p><b  >d</b> directory</p></li><li><p><b  >p</b> named pipe</p></li><li><p><b  >f</b> regular file</p></li><li><p><b  >l</b> symbolic (soft) link</p></li><li><p><b  >s</b> socket</p></li></ul></div><p>If you are unfamiliar with any of these file types, don't worry.
You can learn as you go.</p><p>Files can also be matched by user of group id. As
demonstrated earlier,</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ find . -uid 0 -print
</pre><p>will output all files belonging to root.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ find . -uid 120 -print
</pre><p>will output all files belonging to the user with UID 120.</p><p>To make things easier,</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ find -user eric -print
</pre><p>will output all files belonging to eric.</p><p>Find also has similar options for groups:
<b  >-gid</b> and <b  >-group</b>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1aed580.0x1ef4ad8"></a>More than printing!</h2></div></div><p>Now that you know how to locate just about any file, what can
you do with them besides print their names?</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ find . -fprint foo
</pre><p>sends a list of the files in the current directory to a file
&ldquo;foo&rdquo;. If the file does not exist it is created. If it does, its
contents are replace.</p><p>Find also offers the <b  >-printf</b> action. This
allows output to be formatted.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ find . -printf 'Name: %f Owner: %u %s bytes\n'
</pre><p>produces a table of files with their name, owner, and size in
bytes.</p><p>The <b  >-printf</b> action has many predefined
fields that cover all of the information available for a file. See
Table 2 for an incomplete list of options. Find also has a
<b  >-fprintf</b> switch which will send the output to a
file, like <b  >-fprint</b>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1aed580.0x1ef4f50"></a>Table 2. printf Options</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>Escape

option produces a listing of files that is the equivalent of the
output from <b  >ls -idls</b>. The
<b  >-fls</b> option will send this to a file.</p><p>Of course, simply producing formatted lists of files is not
the limit to find's usefulness. Find also allows us to execute
commands on them with <b  >-exec</b> and
<b  >-ok</b>. <b  >-exec</b> executes a command
for each file that matches.</p><p>Our earlier example demonstrates a common use for the
<b  >-exec</b> option: deleting old and unused
files.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ find /tmp/* -atime +10 -exec rm -f {} \;
</pre><p>After the <b  >-exec</b> switch itself, we specify
the command, any options (such as the <b  >-f</b>), and
then <b  >{}</b>, which represents the matched files. The
command line must then be terminated with <b  >;</b> (the
<b  >\</b> is to prevent shell expansion).</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ find . -type f -exec grep -l linux {} \;
</pre><p>would execute the command <b  >grep -l linux</b> on all
regular files in and under the current directory.</p><p>The <b  >-ok</b> switch operates the same way, but
will prompt the user for confirmation before executing the command
on each file.</p><pre     class="programlisting">

</pre><p>This command will descend through the current directory and
below, asking the user which files should be added to the tar
archive &ldquo;backup&rdquo;.</p><p>This leads us into some practical uses for find.</p><p>Sometimes it's necessary to duplicate a directory or
directory structure. For this purpose many users utilize the cp
command with the <b  >-r</b> option. However, this
command does not always create an exact copy!</p><p>Create a directory with a file and a link in it.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ mkdir test
$ touch test/bar
$ ln -s /vmlinuz /test/foo
$ ls -l test
-rwx--x--x eric staff 0 Sep  9 bar
lrwxrwxrwx eric staff 8 Sep  9 foo -&gt; /vmlinuz
</pre><p>Now copy it with <b  >cp -r</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ cp -r test test1
$ ls -l test1
-rwx--x--x eric staff      0 Sep  9 11:18 bar
-rw-rw-r-- eric staff 318436 Sep  9 11:18 foo
</pre><p>The cp command followed the soft link and copied the kernel into
the new directory!</p><p>Let's try a different approach:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ rm -r test1
$ cd test
$ find -depth -print | cpio -pdmv ../test1
$ ls -l ../test1
-rwx--x--x eric staff 0 Sep  9 bar
lrwxrwxrwx eric staff 8 Sep  9 foo -&gt; /vmlinuz
</pre><p>This method uses cpio to copy files to the new directory.
Find produces the file list by descending the directory structure.
Even though our example was only one directory deep, we know that
find can descend an entire directory structure. We also know that
we can also control which directories it descends and which files
it outputs.</p><p>In the above command I added the -depth option. It insures
that directory names are output before the files in them. This
allows cpio to create the directories before trying to copy files
into them.</p><p>The cpio command is another multipurpose tool in the Unix
toolbox. It can create archives in a variety of formats and also
extract from them. It also handles the output of find's
<b  >-print</b> option perfectly. Combined, these tools
could form a simple backup system. (Please note: I am presenting
this purely as an example. Systems that support many users or that
have irreplaceable data on them should use more extensive and
robust backup systems.)</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ find . -depth -print \
  | cpio -ov --format=crc &gt; /dev/fd0
</pre><p>find reads the contents of the current directory, and the
filenames are piped to cpio, which copies the files to the floppy
in the System V R4 archive format with CRC checksums. (This format
is preferred to the default since it is platform independent,
supports larger hard disks, and provides at least simple error
checking.)</p><p>When cpio reaches the end of each floppy it prompts us
with:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Found end of tape.  To continue, type device/file
name when ready.
</pre><p>In order to continue, type:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/dev/fd0 <span   class="emphasis"><em>RETURN</em></span>
</pre><p>Of course, if you are lucky enough to have a tape drive or other
storage system, you may not have to do this, though cpio can also
span tapes if the archive does not fit on one.</p><p>This system does have at least one drawback: if the data to
be stored will not fit on one unit, the backup cannot be fully
automated.</p><p>The first backup of my home directory spanned ten floppies. I
reviewed the contents and noticed two subdirectories that probably
were not worth backing up, so I altered find's arguments:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ find . \
  \( -path ./.netscape-cache -o -path ./lg \)\
  -prune -o -print | \
  cpio -ov --format=crc &gt; /dev/fd0
</pre><p>This introduces some more find options. The
<b  >\(</b> and the <b  >\)</b> are parentheses
with <b  >\</b> to prevent shell expansion. Find allows
parentheses to logically group expressions. This was necessary
since I have two expressions in the command</p><pre     class="programlisting">
\( -path ./.netscape-cache -o -path ./lg \)
</pre><p>Inside the parentheses we have two <b  >-path</b>
statements separated by <b  >-o</b>. This is a find
&ldquo;or&rdquo; statement.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
\( -path ./.netscape-cache -o -path ./lg \) -prune
</pre><p>Find's <b  >-prune</b> option causes find to not enter a
directory. Therefore, we can translate the above to &ldquo;If the path
is ./.netscape-cache or ./lg do not descend into the directory.&rdquo;</p><p>After this clause we see another <b  >-o</b>
statement. If the file does not meet the criteria for pruning, it
is printed instead.</p><p>So, my entire home directory with the exception of my
Netscape cache and lg directory is now backed up.</p><p>This is fine for an initial backup. But what about next week
when I want to backup my directory, but I've only really touched a
few files?</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ find . \
  \( -path ./.netscape-cache -o -path ./lg \) \
  -prune -o \( -mtime -7 \) -print | \
  cpio -ov --format=crc &gt; /dev/fd0
</pre><p>This adds one more clause: &ldquo;If the file is not under the
netscape cache or the lg directory, check if it has been modified
in the past 7 days. If it has, then print the name.&rdquo; The name is
then sent to cpio to archive.
</p><p>Obviously these command lines can get very complicated. It's
usually a good idea to test them by piping the output through more
before using cpio.</p><p>In addition to <b  >-o</b> find also has an &ldquo;and&rdquo;
operator, <b  >-and</b>, and a negation operator
<b  >-not</b>. When multiple match criteria are
specified, <b  >-and</b> is implied.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ find -mtime -5 -type f -print
</pre><p>prints files that have been modified during the last five
days <span   class="bold"><b>and</b></span> are regular files.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ find -mtime -5 -not -type f -print
</pre><p>prints things that have been modified during the last five days
that are <span   class="bold"><b>not</b></span> regular files:
directories, soft links, etc.</p><p>But wait, disaster has struck! Your (sister, son, daughter,
little brother, mom, spouse, whoever) has deleted a very important
file! Time to use that backup.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ cpio -t &lt; /dev/fd0
</pre><p>produces a table of contents from the archive. As it does
during backup operations, cpio prompts for the next disk while it
reads the table of contents.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ cpio -i core &lt; /dev/fd0
</pre><p>The -i switch tells cpio to extract the named file. The absence of
a file name cause cpio to restore the entire archive.</p><p>System maintenance tasks can also be simplified with find.
Our second example demonstrated using find to clean out older
files.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ find /home -name core -o -name foo \
  -exec rm -f {} \; 2&gt; /dev/null
</pre><p>This command cleans out any core dumps or files named &ldquo;foo&rdquo;
from home directories. (Although some files named &ldquo;foo&rdquo; can be
very important!)</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ find /var/adm/messages -size +32k \
  -exec Mail -s "{}" root &lt; /var/adm/messages \;
  -exec cp /dev/null {} \;
</pre><p>This is another example from the crontab on my Caldera/Red Hat
system. It uses the implicit &ldquo;and&rdquo; function to mail the system
messages file to root and then empty it.</p><p>Find also has an important security application. Two of the
file modes that I did not cover earlier are SUID and SGID. These
modes provide a user with the rights of the owner or group of a
program when the program is executed.</p><p>An example of this is the passwd program. This program allows
users to change their password. In order to do this the /etc/passwd
(or /etc/shadow) file must be modified, which is a function only
root should be able to perform. Since the passwd program belongs to
root and has the SUID mode set, it can modify the necessary file.
When passwd completes the user's rights return to normal. The
passwd program is responsible for making sure the user can't do
anything wrong while acting as root.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ ls -l /usr/bin/npasswd
-r-s--x--x 1 root /usr/bin/npasswd
</pre><p>(/usr/bin/passwd is linked to /usr/bin/npasswd on my system.)
The <b  >s</b> in the execute field for owner signifies
SUID. A SGID program would have <b  >s</b> in the execute
field for group.</p><p>This mechanism has obvious security implications. A user (or
invader) who has compromised a system could install a program (such
as a shell) with this mode set and then do whatever they wish
whenever they want by running that program.</p><p>In octal notation SUID is expressed as 4000 and SGID is 2000,
so</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ find / -perm 4000 -print
</pre><p>produces a list of SUID files on a system.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ find / -type f \( -perm 2000 -o -perm 4000 \) \
  -print
</pre><p>produces a list of regular files that have SGID or SUID mode set.</p><p>This list could be saved to a file (with
<b  >-fprint</b>) and compared each day with the output
from the previous day.</p><p>This article does not cover every option for find. This was
also only a cursory explanation of filesystems and access modes.
Hopefully, I was able to provide you with enough information to
make using Linux a little easier and a lot more rewarding.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1aed580.0x2174c70"></a>Resources</h2></div></div><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Essential System Administration</em></span> by
