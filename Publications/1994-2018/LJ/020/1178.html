    Last month, Jim described the task of porting the kernal and
    basic environment needed to get to the shell prompt. In this
    last of 3 parts, he tells us about building a real
    environment.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cb1580.0x1da9558"></a></h2></div></div><p>Achieving the shell prompt was only the
beginning of the trial, not the end. Now we had to get other
utilities working so as to allow us to debug more of the system and
to make it into a real, usable UNIX-like system.
</p><p>I set Brian Nelson to the task of porting more utilities,
starting with the &ldquo;fileutils&rdquo; and &ldquo;shellutils&rdquo; subsets of the MCC
1.0+ distribution. Meanwhile, I realized that better debugging
tools would expedite the debug process, and I started thinking
about implementing some kind of remote debugger support for gdb. My
first implementation was under the ISP CPU simulator. The reason
for this is that I could add code to ISP to examine and modify the
state of the machine and communicate with a debugger without having
to code a breakpoint handler into the kernel itself.</p><p>GDB has a remote debugging protocol built into it; all I
needed to do was to add code to ISP to respond to gdb commands and
to encode the simulated machine state for GDB's consumption.
Getting this all working was only a few days' work.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cb1580.0x1da9710"></a>Device Drivers</h2></div></div><p>While all this was happening we realized that Linux/Alpha was
turning into a serious project and that we could use some help in
the device driver space. While console callback drivers had served
admirably to get us up and running, they were not equal to the task
of supporting a production system. We recruited Jay Estabrook from
the Digital UNIX group in this capacity, and he has proved to be an
immensely valuable addition to our team. Within his first two weeks
with the group he produced a native text-mode VGA driver and a
native keyboard driver for Linux on the DEC 2000 AXP (&ldquo;Jensen&rdquo;)
series.</p><p>Porting device drivers to Linux/Alpha presents some
interesting challenges. Fortunately, many of the problems only
needed to be solved once and the results would be applicable to
many different drivers.</p><p>The Alpha CPU has no concept of I/O bus access; there is no
Alpha equivalent of the Intel inb/outb instructions for
communicating with the I/O bus. In order to implement a PCI- or
EISA-based Alpha system, some sort of &ldquo;glue&rdquo; logic is needed to
translate Alpha load/store accesses into I/O bus accesses. On
systems based on the DECchip 21064 and 21164 CPUs, this glue logic
is implemented in an external chipset (DECchip 21071 series). On
systems based on the DECchip 21066, this glue logic is built into
the CPU. This glue logic sets aside certain areas of the system
physical address space for communicating with the I/O busses. To
perform a bus access, one takes such information as the I/O port
number and the size of the transfer and encodes it into a special
memory address (This encoding is different for the different glue
logic implementations). One may then load the data from or store
the data to this address.</p><p>Interrupt handling is also different on Alpha systems. On
most Intel-based systems, the mapping between bus IRQs and
interrupt vectors is fixed and straightforward, and the hardware
dispatches directly to the interrupt vector associated with a
particular IRQ. On Alpha, all interrupts are dispatched by PALcode.
The Digital UNIX PALcode vectors all device interrupts to a single
routine. One of the arguments to this routine is a number (called
the &ldquo;SCB vector&rdquo; for reasons I don't need to go into here)
indicating which interrupt was received. Unfortunately, the mapping
between bus IRQs and SCB offsets is not the same across all
platforms. This means that we need extra code in the interrupt
handling path to map the SCB vector back to an IRQ number. In fact,
there are different versions of the mapping routine for the
different platforms.</p><p>It turns out that many Intel Linux device drivers rely on the
fact that the BIOS puts the device into a known state before the
operating system even sees it. We discovered this when we were
debugging the interrupt handling for the keyboard driver (and,
later on, the SCSI driver). Apparently the interrupt controller on
Intel boxes is initialized by the BIOS to trigger on the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>transition</em></span> of an IRQ line (edge triggering)
rather than on the <span   class="emphasis"><em>state</em></span> of an IRQ line (level
triggering). We were having no end of problems with &ldquo;spurious&rdquo;
interrupts until we added code to the CPU initialization routine to
set the interrupt controller properly.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cb1580.0x1da9a28"></a>The Miniloader</h2></div></div><p>While our early decision to use the SRM console was good to
get the project off the ground, it turns out that the SRM console
is not the best choice for Linux. First of all, the SRM console is
memory-hungry because it must implement numerous functions required
by OpenVMS and Digital UNIX. Many of these functions are not needed
by Linux. Second, and more serious, is the fact that the SRM
console is not freely redistributable. Digital charges a
substantial license fee to third parties for resale rights to the
SRM firmware, as well as a per-unit charge for each copy of the SRM
firmware sold by Digital or a third party. While the end-user
typically never sees these charges, they do serve to raise the
price of the hardware when it is sold in a Digital UNIX or OpenVMS
configuration. In addition, requiring the SRM console for
Linux/Alpha would present a significant burden to clone vendors who
wished to build and sell Alpha systems for the Linux
marketplace.</p><p>For these reasons, we decided to investigate the possibility
of developing a freeware &ldquo;miniloader&rdquo; for Linux/Alpha. The
miniloader could be much smaller than the SRM console because it
needs to implement only the functionality necessary to initialize
the system, load the PALcode, and load Linux. It could also be
freely redistributable in source and binary form.</p><p>Unfortunately, developing a replacement for the console
firmware is a non-trivial undertaking. Fortunately, however, we had
help in the person of Dave Rusling from the Digital Semiconductor
facility in Reading, England. Dave had much experience in low-level
hardware support on the evaluation boards produced by Digital
Semiconductor, and he had already done significant work for the
Linux/Alpha project in the area of PCI support. He eagerly took on
the task of developing the miniloader.</p><p>The miniloader consists of system initialization code, an
OSF-compliant PALcode library, a bootstrap loader, and console
callback routines. It presents to the bootloader and kernel an
interface similar to that seen in the SRM console, with
stripped-down functionality. The miniloader only implements those
SRM features and callbacks that are used by Linux. As of this
writing, the miniloader has succeeded in booting Linux on several
models of Digital Semiconductor evaluation boards, as well as on
the low-cost AXPpci/33 &ldquo;NoName&rdquo; motherboard and the
high-performance &ldquo;Cabriolet&rdquo; motherboard.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cb1580.0x1da9c38"></a>Cutting Over to 1.2</h2></div></div><p>While we were working on our 32-bit port, Linus was toiling
away in Helsinki on his 64-bit Alpha port. We knew that we would
want to cut over to using his code base at some point so that we
would be in sync with the rest of the Linux community. The main
question was <span   class="emphasis"><em>when</em></span> we would do the cutover. Our
port had more demonstrable functionality earlier (e.g. device
support, networking, utilities), but Linus was catching up fast. We
decided to continue working on the 32-bit port for demonstration
purposes while keeping track of Linus' progress, and we would cut
over to Linus' code base when doing so would yield a system of
roughly equivalent functionality.</p><p>This point came in March, 1995 when Linus posted a message to
the linux-alpha mailing list with the subject &ldquo;self-hosting linux
on ftp.cs.helsinki.fi&rdquo;. While one of our own major goals was to
have a self-hosting Linux/Alpha system, we had not been able to
realize it due to the immense complexity of porting the GNU
compiler suite in our cross-development environment. Linus very
neatly sidestepped the entire cross-build issue by making his
Linux/Alpha system calls compatible with their Digital UNIX
counterparts. Therefore, he could achieve self-hosting simply by
running the compilers from his Digital UNIX system on his
Linux/Alpha system.</p><p>While this self-hosting environment did not meet our
criterion of being 100% freeware, it was a useful starting point.
Instead of building the GNU tools in a cantankerous
cross-development environment and testing them on an immature
operating system, we could prototype and debug our
<span   class="emphasis"><em>entire</em></span> development environment on a Digital
UNIX system. When we were satisfied with its functionality, we
could then copy it over to a Linux/Alpha system with reasonable
assurance that it would work. This, in fact, is exactly how we put
together the self-hosting demo that we exhibited at DECUS in May,
1995 (&ldquo;Linux at DECUS&rdquo;, <i  >Linux Journal</i> issue
15, July 1995).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cb1580.0x1da9ef8"></a>Getting By With a Little Help From Our
Friends...</h2></div></div><p>An operating system is much more than just a kernel, as any
of the creators of Linux distributions could tell you. In order to
be able to provide all of Digital's Linux/Alpha contributions to
the Linux community free of charge, we necessarily had to limit the
investment we made in the project. As of this writing, Digital is
funding three full-time engineers, a part-time product manager, a
part-time technical writer, and several loaner Alpha systems
(including the Alpha systems that Linus has been using). In my
project plan outline for Linux/Alpha I pointed out that Linux was
unique in that we could do the project with such limited resources.
Given the history of Linux, I reasoned, once the Linux/Alpha code
became available, developers all over the net would add
functionality and fixes. My prediction turned out delightfully
true. Several people, both inside and outside of Digital, made
significant contributions to the project at no cost to Digital. The
result is of enormous benefit to both Digital and the Linux
community as a whole.</p><p>Linus Torvald's own contributions, of course, are legendary.
I mention him here because without his tireless work the project
would have taken a different turn and probably would not be as
successful as it is today (Linus, if you're reading this, we
<span   class="emphasis"><em>could</em></span> use a little breathing room between
releases. At least let me finish <span   class="emphasis"><em>compiling</em></span> one
release before you turn out the next!)</p><p>Another major champion and supporter of the Linux/Alpha
project is David Mosberger-Tang of the University of Arizona. He
was literally the first on his block to own an Alpha-based
AXPpci/33 motherboard, and he provided all of the initial patches
to enable both the 32-bit and 64-bit kernels to function on that
platform. He has also been a valuable resource and a second set of
eyes to assist in untangling sticky problems. In addition, he has
ported numerous system and utility packages that would have taken
us days or even weeks to do ourselves in our spare (ha!)
time.</p><p>It has been said that &ldquo;any sufficiently advanced technology
is indistinguishable from a rigged demo,&rdquo; and this could certainly
be said of the DECUS demo that we staged. While the toolset was
capable of building and linking the kernel, the 64-bit C runtime
library was not yet stable enough to build user utilities. Fixing
this was on our &ldquo;to do&rdquo; list along with a lot of other things, but
it turned out we didn't have to. Shortly after we released the
64-bit development tools to Digital's FTP area, Bob Manson of Ohio
State University released a working 64-bit library based on our
earlier 32-bit work. Bob also released several useful sets of
utilities that, again, it would have taken us weeks to get around
to porting on our own. He is also rumored to be working on
modifying gcc to generate floating-point code that is capable of
recovering from exceptions.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cb1580.0x1daa1b8"></a>The BLADE Releases</h2></div></div><p>After showing off Linux/Alpha at DECUS, it became clear that
some kind of end-user-installable distribution was needed. At that
point, Linux/Alpha resembled in some ways the early days of Intel
Linux: the &ldquo;system&rdquo; consisted of a motley collection of source and
binary archives scattered over several FTP sites on different
continents. Putting together a running system out of these pieces
was a job only a dedicated hacker would be willing to go through
with.</p><p>One difference between then and now is that now there are
high-quality commercial Linux distributions (Plug-And-Play, Red
Hat, and Slackware, to name just a few) that can serve as the basis
for equivalent Linux/Alpha distributions. We knew, though that it
would be some time before these distributions were ported and
qualified for Linux/Alpha. In oder to sustain the momentum built up
at DECUS, we needed some kind of Linux/Alpha distribution sooner
than that. That's when we decided to embark on a project designed
to become obsolete: BLADE. BLADE stands for
<span   class="bold"><b>B</b></span>asic
<span   class="bold"><b>L</b></span>inux
<span   class="bold"><b>A</b></span>lpha
<span   class="bold"><b>D</b></span>istribution
<span   class="bold"><b>E</b></span>xpletive (I picked the name by
starting with &ldquo;LAD&rdquo; for &ldquo;Linux Alpha Distribution&rdquo; and grepping
through /usr/dict/words for this combination and playing acronym
games with some of the results). BLADE is a Linux/Alpha kit that
can be installed without needing to build kernels or use a host
development system.</p><p>BLADE was designed to be deployed quickly, and it's pretty
rough around the edges. There's only one automatic installation
script, called install_subset. A lot of steps that are done
automatically by other distributions must be handled manually in
BLADE. We provide full step-by-step instructions, though, so the
user knows what steps need to be taken.</p><p>The first release of BLADE (V0.1) provided basic
functionality and a development system in character-cell mode.
There was no networking, no GUI, and a limited utility set.
However, it was self-hosting, and it came with kernel sources and
the gnu compiler suite. One could build the kernel or any utilities
one desired using BLADE. In fact, we used BLADE V0.1 as our primary
development system for BLADE V0.2. BLADE V0.1 was based on a
modified 1.2.8 kernel and supported the AXPpci/33 only.</p><p>The second release of BLADE (V0.2) added more utilities and
networking functionality. Graphics were still not available, but
one could perform development and basic networking (ftp, telnet,
rlogin) in character-cell mode. BLADE V0.2 was also the first
release to support the Linux/Alpha Miniloader (aka MILO/Alpha) on
the AXPpci/33. MILO is a drop-in system firmware replacement that
allows the user to boot and run Linux without requiring the SRM
console firmware. BLADE V0.2 also added a kernel boot disk for the
Digital Semiconductor 275-MHz EBPC/64 evaluation motherboard. This
is the fastest system to date that supports Linux. BLADE V0.2 is
also based on the modified 1.2.8 kernel.</p><p>Currently under development is BLADE V0.3. BLADE V0.3 will be
based on a 1.3 kernel and will add support for the X window system
(see below). It should also support more system types.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cb1580.0x1daa630"></a>X Marks The Spot</h2></div></div><p>Thanks to the tireless efforts of my colleague Jay Estabrook,
as of this writing X11R6 is up and running on Linux/Alpha. Most of
the standard libraries and client executables are in place. At the
present time, only the S3 server has been ported, and it has only
been qualified on a few video cards. The current plan is to let
this be a sample server and solicit other parties (e.g. the XFree86
Consortium) to port other servers.</p><p>One major problem with supporting multiple video cards has to
do with the on-board ROM BIOS that many cards have. This BIOS
typically contains code to initialize the card and to set video
modes. Unfortunately, this BIOS is nearly always written in 80x86
assembly code. To execute it on an Alpha system requires an Intel
execution engine. We are investigating several strategies to
provide this functionality as part of MILO/Alpha in source form,
and rumor has it that our old friend David Mosberger-Tang has made
good progress in this area.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cb1580.0x1daa790"></a>Surf's Up!</h2></div></div><p>As I write this, Linux/Alpha is being exhibited at UNIX Expo
in New York City in all of its X-windows glory. We have ported the
freeware web-browser <span   class="bold"><b>chimera</b></span>, and
these systems are available for surfing the web and for connecting
to remote systems on the Internet via rlogin, telnet, and ftp. In
fact, on setup day several people from non-net-connected boths came
by to use these systems to retrieve forgotten files from their home
systems. This includes yours truly, embarrassingly enough. We
needed to connect to the serial port on our PC64 system to use the
ROM debug monitor, but the version of Linux/Alpha on the other
system did not have kermit, cu, tip, or any other terminal
emulation or serial connection program. No problem: I ftp'ed over
to David Mosberger-Tang's archive at ftp.azstarnet.com and
retrieved the Linux/Alpha version of kermit. We were in business in
a few minutes.</p><p>In short, Linux/Alpha is starting to feel like a real Linux
system!</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cb1580.0x1daa948"></a>Future Directions</h2></div></div><p>Despite our great progress, much work remains to be done on
Linux/Alpha:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>As mentioned above, we need to deploy some sort of
BIOS-emulation facility so that we can execute the proprietary
initialization code on some expansion cards. While initial code
exists and works, it does not support the real-mode 32-bit
instructions that are used in the BIOSes of some cards.</p></li><li><p>We need to tackle the great unsolved problem of
floating-point exception handling. Programs that are floating-point
intensive are not likely to work until this is done.</p></li><li><p>We need to write a character-cell driver and an X
server for the TGA graphics adapter that is provided with Multia
and several other Digital Alpha systems.</p></li><li><p>We desperately need shared libraries! As of this
writing, the statically-linked executables in Linux/Alpha are
rather large (around 200Kb for a typical utility, several megabytes
for the X server). Shared libraries will decrease both disk space
requirements and virtual-memory usage.</p></li><li><p>We need to work on compiler optimizations. The
Alpha support in gcc does very good optimizations in some places,
not so good in others. In addition, the compiler does not yet take
advantage of Alpha's multiple-instruction issue feature. This
feature allows more than one instruction to be issued per clock
cycle, but only certain combinations are allowed. By carefully
rearranging the instructions in the executable, one can take
advantage of this feature and achieve significant performance
improvements.</p></li></ul></div><p>All in all, we are excited about the future. Linux/Alpha,
even in its relatively primitive state, feels like a real Linux
system. Addressing the above areas can only make it better!</p></div></div>
