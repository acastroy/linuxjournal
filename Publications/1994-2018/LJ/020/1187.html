    Hundreds of Web servers (including our own) and Internet Service
    Providers (including the one we use) are based on Linux systems.

it is today because of the Internet. Without the international
communications made possible by the Internet, such a development
effort would not have been possible.
</p><p>In addition, Linux is returning much to the Internet.
Hundreds of Web servers (including our own) and Internet Service
Providers (including the one we use) are based on Linux systems. To
their credit, many commercial vendors have jumped on the Linux
bandwagon. Some just sell hardware pieces, some sell complete Linux
systems and some sell software for Linux. Looking at the ads in
this magazine will give you a pretty good feel for which companies
have decided to jump on the Linux bandwagon.</p><p>SSC has seen the connection between Linux and the World Wide
Web and is starting a new magazine, <span   class="emphasis"><em>WEBsmith</em></span>.
If you are an <i  >LJ</i> subscriber, you will see the
premier issue of WEBsmith bound into your January, 1996 issue of
<i  >LJ</i>. While there is a lot more to the Web than
Linux, we want to promote the Linux/Internet connection.</p><p>Now, for the bad news. As I am writing this, the new version
of Netscape, the most popular Web browser, was just released.
Although a Linux version of Netscape exists, it is not supported.
Also, while Netscape has secure server software available for other
platforms, it is not available for Linux.</p><p>I don't know how you feel about this but, to me, it makes me
think we are being treated as second class citizens. It's not that
Netscape doesn't work on Linux. It's just that apparently Linux and
the Linux community is not being taken seriously.</p><p>We are a community of activists. We have made Linux go from
nothing to the operating system of choice for hundreds of thousands
of people around the world. And we have helped Linux make inroads
into the commercial world. I think it is time we do a little
activism with regard to Linux and Web browsers.</p><p>We don't have to start from scratch. Arena, available on many
Linux distributions and archives, is a work-in-progress browser for
HTML 3.0. While not complete, Arena offers some very nice features.
My favorite is that it actually verifies that your HTML is correct.
The first time I ran Arena on our Web site I found that about 90%
of our pages produced the bad HTML error message. It's not that I
am proud of this, it's just that I see having a tool that checks
your work as being valuable.</p><p>Arena is from the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), an
industry consortium run by the Laboratory of Computer Science at
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In Europe, it is a
collaboration of MIT with CERN, the originators of the Web, and
with INRIA, in France. Arena is built using the library of common
code called the <span   class="bold"><b>W3C Reference
Library</b></span>. It is currently available as a binary for most
major Unix platforms (where, in this case, major includes
Linux).</p><p>To quote the W3C on their plans for Arena</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Arena will continue to be a testbed browser for
HTML3 and style sheets. We do not have the resources nor the intent
to make Arena a full-featured web browser, but welcome initiatives
to help add functionality.</p></blockquote></div><p>I haven't talked to anyone at W3C but, if there is interest
in the Linux community, I am willing to spearhead an initiative
within the Linux community aimed at developing further functions
for Arena.</p><p>One such initiative comes from David Bonn, of Mazama Software
Labs, who suggested writing what you might call <span   class="emphasis"><em>browser
tools</em></span> that would make it possible to easily embed an
HTML browser in your application. This has the advantage that you
could build systems where browsing HTML was just a part. For
example, you might want to build a system for your office where it
would be possible for clerical people to access procedures that
were in HTML format. You could include this in the application that
they commonly ran instead of having them learn about a new program
in order to read these procedures.</p><p>I am sure there are lots of other ways to go. At this point I
am just sending the idea of a new development effort up the
flagpole to see if Linux community members are interested. Let us
know what you think. Send us mail or, better yet, e-mail us at
