Learn the fundamentals of public key encryption and how to
plug the GNU Privacy Guard in to your existing mailer.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e6c580.0x1f64348"></a></h2></div></div><p>
It really is a shame Fran&ccedil;ois, but we simply will have to make sure it is
available for next time. Everything else looks perfect, <span   class="foreignphrase"><i>mon
ami</i></span>;
all the workstations booted up to a login. Wonderful! Ah, I see
that our guests are here! Fran&ccedil;ois, head down to the east wing
of the wine cellar. There is a small cache of 1999 C&ocirc;te-R&ocirc;tie next to that
old sealed-in door. Yes, the door we never were able to open.
<span   class="foreignphrase"><i>Vite,
Fran&ccedil;ois!</i></span> I promise you there is nothing frightening down there.
</p><p>
Please sit, <span   class="foreignphrase"><i>mes amis</i></span>. We have an almost perfect menu for you today,
but sadly it's missing one item. Still, the C&ocirc;te-R&ocirc;tie Rh&ocirc;ne, red that is
both sexy and mysterious, should help take away from its absence. I had
so wanted to prepare my famous <span   class="foreignphrase"><i>Cr&egrave;me
Linuxaise</i></span> for you today, but
there were problems. You see, the Linuxaise is an old and secret
family recipe, and I could not risk it falling into the wrong hands.
Nor could I risk sending it by e-mail for fear of it being intercepted
or read by a network sniffer; otherwise, Fran&ccedil;ois could have prepared it
in advance. It is that secret!
</p><p>
Next time, however, will not be a problem. I am setting up all users
at the restaurant with GnuPG and public key encryption so that sensitive
communications can be sent without fear.
GnuPG is the GNU Privacy Guard, a program that makes it possible to
encrypt messages and data in general. It is a patent-free, open-source
replacement for PGP (Pretty Good Privacy). A number of Linux e-mail
packages allow you to send and receive encrypted e-mails using GnuPG, and
this is what I'd like to show you today. Most modern distributions
have GnuPG included, so if you don't have it on the system, check your
CD first. You also can find the latest version at <a href="http://www.gnupg.org" target="_self">www.gnupg.org</a>, but first, a little background.
</p><p>
Now, where was I? Ah, yes. Historically, all encryption methods worked
on the premise of a shared key file. You would give the person with
whom you wanted to communicate the same key by which the message was
encoded. Think secret decoder ring and you aren't far off the mark.
The catch is that anyone intercepting the key then could decipher all
your messages. With GnuPG, messages are encrypted with two keys, one
being your private key, which you guard jealously and never hand out
to anyone. When I encode a message, I do so by combining my private key with
a public key, not my public key, but one supplied to me by the person
with whom I want to communicate, Fran&ccedil;ois, for instance. Both keys are
required for the encryption/decryption process, and anyone having
one-half of the key pair has nothing, which is why you never hand out
your private key. To get in on this top-secret action, you
need to create a key pair, containing both your private and jealously
guarded key and your public key, the one you hand out to all
your friends. Here is the command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
gpg --gen-key
</pre>
</p><p>
What follows is a small question-and-answer session. The first question
has to do with the encryption algorithm, or cipher. The default is
DSA and ElGamal. Accept the default. When asked about key
length, you can choose from 768, 1,024 and 2,048 bytes. Because the
DSA standard is 1,024, choose that for now. Then, you are asked for
the expiration date of your key, the default being no expiration date.
You can, however, define days, weeks, months and even years. For now,
choose the default and confirm your choice. Finally, you
are asked to supply the name of the key user, the e-mail address and a comment.
</p><p>
It's all over but the passphrase, which is your final step. Make sure
you choose something secure but also something that you can remember.
When you have entered your phrase, the GnuPG program
generates your secure key pair. After the command completes
its work, you can verify the result by looking in the .gnupg
directory in your home directory:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ cd /home/marcel/.gnupg
$ ls
gpg.conf     pubring.gpg  random_seed
secring.gpg  trustdb.gpg
</pre>
</p><p>
The gpg.conf file contains a list of default options for the
gpg command and makes for good reading. The pubring.gpg
and secring.gpg files are particularly important. Make backups
of these files immediately and store them somewhere other than your
computer and never lose them&mdash;the secring.gpg file
contains your personal secret key. The last file, trustdb.gpg,
is your database of trust. It defines the level of trust that you assign
to the public keys you collect.
</p><p>
Users need to exchange keys in order to exchange encrypted information.
As you might guess, the option to export
a key is --export, but you may want to include the -a
option as well to confine the output to ASCII format:

<pre     class="programlisting">
gpg -a --export 3E2FCF7D &gt; marcelkey.asc
</pre>
</p><p>
The resulting file is a simple ASCII text file; how you get it
to the other person is up to you. There are key servers where you can
upload your public keys so that anyone can download them (which makes it
easier for large-scale distribution), key-signing parties where groups
get together and exchange public keys or e-mail attachments.
The recipient then could import the key like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
gpg --import marcelkey.asc
</pre>
</p><p>
At any point, you can choose to see the keys in your key ring with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
gpg --list-keys
</pre>
</p><p>
The results of that command depend on how many keys you have, but the
following should give you an idea of what to expect. In particular,
take note of the hexadecimal number following the
1024D.
That is the key ID to which you will be referring in the future:


<pre     class="programlisting">
/home/marcel/.gnupg/pubring.gpg

</pre>
</p><p>
Before you can start your friend's key to encrypt e-mail messages, you
need to sign the key to verify its authenticity. This involves doing
two things. If you are absolutely, positively sure of the key's origins,
you might skip the first step, which is to get the key's fingerprint:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ gpg --fingerprint francois
pub  1024D/EE392B87 2004-01-07 Francois
&#8618;(I am but a humble waiter) &lt;francois@salmar.com&gt;
Key fingerprint = 8C5B 775C 33F8 E97C 5ADC
&#8618;019D C6C8 4B83 EE39 2B87
sub  1024g/F4E07040 2004-01-07
</pre>
</p><p>
Notice that I used the person's name in the above command, which is part of
the key information. If you have more than one person with that name in their
key information, specify the key ID instead. To verify
this fingerprint, ask your friend to check the fingerprint of
his or her personal key in exactly the same way. The final step is to sign
the key. You do that with the --edit-key option:

<pre     class="programlisting">
gpg --edit-key francois
</pre>
</p><p>
The whole process isn't too complicated. You are asked to confirm
that you really, genuinely want to sign this public key; you
are asked to confirm again with your passphrase. You need to do this with all
the people with whom you want to exchange encrypted e-mail. Once finished,
however, let the secret messages flow.
</p><p>
Incidentally, a number of nice, graphical utilities for
GnuPG exist, essentially friendly wrappers for the command-line utility.
KDE comes with a slick utility called KGpg that integrates nicely
with the desktop and the e-mail system. For instance,
if someone sends you a public key as an attachment in KMail and
you have started KGpg (command name: kgpg), rather than
having to save the attachment to a file, drop down to the command line
and perform the above steps. You should get a friendly pop-up like
the one in Figure 1.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="7354f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. KMail confirms key imports.
</p></div></div><p>
With this tool, which docks in your panel, you can edit keys; add,
remove and change trust levels; and do all those things you can do with
command-line GnuPG but with a click of your mouse. You even can do
key server lookups over the Net and use photo IDs as well. Its integration
with other KDE tools means you can drag and drop to encrypt or access
GnuPG functions with a click from Konqueror or the clipboard. KGpg is
an add-on to KDE 3.1, but with the release of KDE 3.2, it will become part of
the standard distribution. Figure 2 shows KGpg in action.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7354f2.large.jpg"><img src="7354f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. KGpg makes key management easy.
</p></div></div><p>
Another graphical administration tool worth your time is
gpa.
This is the default GNU Privacy Assistant and the official
key ring editor of the GnuPG Project. It also is available from
<a href="http://www.gnupg.org" target="_self">www.gnupg.org</a>.
</p><p>
Now, it's time to send out those encrypted e-mails.
Open KMail, click on Settings in the menubar and choose
Configure KMail, after which the Configure KMail dialog appears.
In the sidebar to the left, find the icon labeled Security, and
click it (Figure 3).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7354f3.large.jpg"><img src="7354f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Configuring KMail to Use GnuPG Encryption
</p></div></div><p>
The new window to the right has three tabs: General,
OpenPGP and Crypto Plugins. We are interested in the
OpenPGP tab. On that tab, look at the drop-down box labeled Select
encryption tool and choose GnuPG - GNU Privacy Guard from
the list. For the time being,
don't choose to sign and encrypt all messages automatically.
You might, however, want to keep the passphrase in memory; you still are
asked the first time an encrypted message is encountered. Click Apply.
</p><p>
Next, click on the Identity tab to the left. Unless you have defined multiple e-mail identities, there should be
only one entry. Click Modify, and select the Advanced tab from the
resulting dialog. In the middle of that panel (Figure 4) is
a space for OpenPGP key. That's your personal private key.
Click Change here to open another window from which you can select
your private key information.

Figure 4. Specifying Your Public Key with KMail
</p></div></div><p>
When finished, click OK to close the Edit Identity window, and click OK
again to close the Configure KMail window. In order to reload
the keys into KMail properly, you may have to shut down KMail and restart it.
</p><p>
You now are able to send encrypted e-mails, in principle at least.
If you already have your friend's public key in your key ring and you
have signed the key, nothing is left to do but write your e-mail.
Start a new message, and write what you need to write. When you are
ready to send, click Options on the message's menubar. Notice two
interesting options here related to encryption. One says Sign Message,
and the other says Encrypt Message.
</p><p>
Signing a message makes use of your key by attaching an electronic
signature to your message but not encrypting it.
The person receiving the message then has a means of verifying that
the message did indeed come from you, should they want to verify it.
Because the message is not encrypted, anyone still can read it. This is
simply a means to confirm that the message came from
the person who claims to have sent it. Encryption goes one step further in that you are using your
friend's public key to encrypt the message. In both cases, KMail
asks you for your passphrase before sending the message.
</p><p>
Unfortunately, not all e-mail packages follow the same rules for
encryption. That would be too simple,
<span   class="foreignphrase"><i>non</i></span>? Let's use the
two gentlemen at table 17, Larry and Michael, in a hypothetical scenario.
Each needs to send the other sensitive corporate information, so the
information must be encrypted. Larry uses Evolution and Michael
uses KMail. We already have covered KMail for sending encrypted mail,
so let's spend a moment looking at the process in Ximian Evolution.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7354f5.large.jpg"><img src="7354f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. Evolution's Mail Account Editor
</p></div></div><p>
With Evolution open, click on your inbox. Now, click Tools on the menubar and select Settings. You now are looking at the Evolution Settings
window (Figure 5). If the Mail Accounts icon in the left-hand sidebar
isn't selected, click to select it now. Most people have one
main account. If you have more than one, select the one you want to use
with encryption and click the Edit button to the right. The Account
dialog appears with several tabs along the top. The one you are
interested in is labeled Security.
Look for a field labeled PGP/GPG Key ID and enter your key ID there.
Click OK to close that dialog, then OK again to get out of the
Evolution Settings window.
</p><p>
Assuming that Larry and Michael already
have exchanged public keys, Larry now is ready to send encrypted e-mail. To do
so, he composes an e-mail normally. When he is ready to send, he clicks
Security on the menubar and selects PGP Encrypt. When he clicks
Send, Larry is asked for his GPG passphrase. Once entered,
the message is sent. Before I move on, I should mention that you can
select PGP Sign from the Security menu if all you want to do is sign
the message.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="7354f6.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. Specifying Your GnuPG Key in Evolution
</p></div></div><p>
As wonderful as all this encryption and decryption stuff is, there are
some problems. For instance, many packages (including KMail) will encrypt the
message in-line, but a few others, such as Evolution, do not. Instead,
encrypted messages are MIME attachments. Consequently, reading a message
from KMail (or Eudora or Outlook) in Evolution requires that you save
the message as a text file. You then can decrypt it with this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
gpg -d message.txt
</pre>
</p><p>
To read an Evolution-encrypted message sent to KMail (and a few others)
you need to save the attachment as opposed to the message itself.
Decrypting it is the same process as above.
</p><p>
Many e-mail clients are available in the Linux world.
KMail and Evolution are popular graphical choices, but so is Mozilla.
For users of Mozilla, a plugin called Enigmail allows for
seamless encryption and signing of messages. Text-based clients also
support encryption, either on their own or through plugins;
mutt and pine are popular examples.
</p><p>
<span   class="foreignphrase"><i>Mon Dieu!</i></span> Has the time gone by so quickly?
I fear, <span   class="foreignphrase"><i>mes amis</i></span>,
that closing time is upon us once again. Fran&ccedil;ois will refill your
glasses once more before you go. As you leisurely sip that last glass,
take some time to create and exchange public keys with one another.
Perhaps I may be convinced to share the <span   class="foreignphrase"><i>Cr&egrave;me
Linuxaise</i></span>
with some of you&mdash;assuming proper security precautions, of course.
Who knows, our security may be the very reason that door in the wine
cellar remains tightly shut! Until next time, <span   class="foreignphrase"><i>mes

all drink to one another's health. <span   class="foreignphrase"><i>A v&ocirc;tre sant&eacute;! Bon
