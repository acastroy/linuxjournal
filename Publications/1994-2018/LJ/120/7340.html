<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #120, April 2004</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>

The <span   class="bold"><b>2.6.0</b></span> kernel has come out, roughly on schedule. The
arrival of a stable series at a predicted time is a first in
Linux development, and it's none too common in the rest of open-source
development either. Although most people tend to accept
<span   class="bold"><b>Linus Torvalds'</b></span> discovery that encouraging help from
arbitrary developers actually does result in better code and faster
development, the secret of predictable release cycles has remained
elusive.
</p><p>
In the case of the 2.6.0 release, Linus did insist on maintaining
feature freezes and other policies without going back on them,
but this itself could work only if the various features were made
to coalesce at roughly the same time. Clearly, no simple method
has emerged yet. In terms of maintainership of the 2.6 tree, this
job apparently has gone to <span   class="bold"><b>Andrew Morton</b></span>, in much the same way
that the 2.4 tree went to <span   class="bold"><b>Marcelo Tosatti</b></span> and the 2.2 tree
went to <span   class="bold"><b>Alan Cox</b></span>. Actually, even now it is unclear who is
the true maintainer of the 2.6 tree. Andrew certainly appears to
be making decisions with authority, but Linus is the one who puts
out actual releases. Perhaps Linus and Andrew will continue in tight
collaboration until the 2.7 fork, but for now the overall maintainership situation
is much less clear than it was for any of the previous stable
series. It will be interesting to see how these issues play out in
the 2.7&ndash;2.8 time frame.
</p><p>
Last month I said <span   class="bold"><b>XFS</b></span> might not make it into the 2.4 tree due
to Marcelo Tosatti's plans for a deep freeze following the emergence
of the 2.6 series. In fact, XFS did make it into 2.4 before the
final cutoff. This was partly due to a large developer outcry,
in which it was pointed out that XFS was the last major journaled
filesystem missing from 2.4. In addition, Marcelo
himself previously had indicated that XFS would go into his tree
when it was ready. In the end, Marcelo did insist on a thorough
analysis of the code by a third party before allowing it into 2.4.
Ultimately, however, XFS made the cut, and further XFS
work is going into 2.4 to round off the feature in spite of the deep
freeze. Undoubtedly, this will taper off quickly.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Ian Kent</b></span> has (for the moment at least) accepted the role of
<span   class="bold"><b>DevFS</b></span> maintainer. This is a sharp reversal of the previous
trend, which was to let DevFS die a quiet death and replace it
with a similar feature, such as <span   class="bold"><b>udev</b></span>. In fact, <span   class="bold"><b>Greg
Kroah-Hartman</b></span> has
been making regular udev releases, with an eye toward exactly this
possibility. However, in spite of DevFS' flaws, including some that
are apparently so severe as to be virtually unfixable,
DevFS still provides features that no other system has yet been
able to surpass. Folks like Ian have begun to advocate keeping
DevFS in the kernel and fixing whatever problems it may have,
however difficult they may turn out to be. Ian, for as long as he
lasts, has decided to accept the challenge. It will be interesting to
see how the other kernel developers, notably <span   class="bold"><b>Alexander Viro</b></span>
(a particularly vehement DevFS-hater), take to this unexpected turn
of events.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Yasunori Goto</b></span> has been working on some
code to allow <span   class="bold"><b>RAM
hot plugging</b></span>. So far he's been targeting NUMA machines, but
high on his to-do list is a port to <span   class="bold"><b>IA-64</b></span>
and <span   class="bold"><b>IA-32</b></span>
machines. Although interesting for desktop users, this feature could be
quite a boon to server administrators, who often are blamed for downtime
on company systems. It also brings us closer to truly
stackable
systems. Imagine a wearable computer that gains two additional
processors when you put on your shoes. Yasunori may not be thinking
quite along those lines, but the prospect of hot-plugging RAM chips
is enticing.

Using APG, you can get barely pronounceable passwords or totally random
passwords. It has a server-client mode so you can request passwords
over the network or generate them locally. An optional Tcl/Tk client
makes it easy for anyone to use. APG is flexible and also includes a PHP
application for your Web server to generate random passwords.
Requires: libm, libcrypt, glibc and optionally Tcl/Tk.

Need to convert from ext2 to something like ReiserFS or XFS? With
convertfs, you can do it on the fly on
any unmounted filesystem or on one you can unmount from a running system.
Don't try this at home&mdash;or anywhere else for that matter&mdash;without
a backup. However, I successfully converted several ext3 filesystems
to XFS. The included bash script even reminds you to change your
/etc/fstab entry for that partition.
Requires: glibc and kernel with loop device support.

Filelight is a graphical version of the disk usage utility
du. It shows you disk usage as a colored wheel. You can see the
overall usage in the center of the circle, then various directories and
subdirectories branching out. Moving your cursor over any area provides
more detail on that area and subordinate areas. See at a glance where your
disk space went.
Requires: libkio, libkdesu, libutil, libfam, libkdeui, libkdecore,
libDCOP, libresolv, libart_lgpl_2, libkdefx, libqt-mt, libaudio, libXt,

If you are designing or writing a Web page that requires date inputs,
this tool handles the task nicely. The author shows you exactly what code
to use to have the calendar appear as a pop-up or flat calendar
(one that's static on the Web page), how to script different date
formats for form inputs and more. Ensuring that date inputs in forms
are correct has never been easier.

liamtog is a spambot-poisoning system, whose name is &ldquo;got
mail&rdquo; spelled backwards. It creates an endless self-referencing web of
links that include bogus mail addresses so spammers' Web crawlers
harvest a bunch of bad data for their lists when they scan
your site. That much has been done by spambot-poisoning scripts
for more than three years.
</p><p>
I wanted some things in a spambot poisoner
that I didn't find in the ones available,
so I wrote my own. liamtog supports spam traps, allowing
you to configure a small number of the bogus e-mail addresses to
be in a domain or subdomain you designate as a spam-trap domain. This can
be used for capturing
spams to updating your filters automatically.
You can control such things as the length of the page it generates,
how often it pauses during the output to slow down the spambot's
progress and what mix of words, links and mail addresses it should
have. And, you can configure it differently for various virtual
Web servers on the same server.
Requires: Perl 5, cgi.pm and Apache httpd 1.3 or 2.0. mod_perl is
optional but recommended.

I've seen several local/remote backup packages, but this probably is
one of the simplest to set up and use. It also makes use of hard links
for storage, so the same file isn't stored twice but hard linked,
which saves a lot of disk space. Backups can be made as often as you
like, and
remote backups use SSH.

Standards have nothing to do with innovation; a good standard is what
happens when an industry basically has shaken the bugs out of a
technology and then, after the fact, writes it down. This is true of all
the really successful standards: grams and meters, voltage, the
calendar, octane ratings, TCP/IP, XML.

Most art forms are produced &ldquo;live&rdquo; in the same way at some point, aren't
they? If art patrons came to pay for the performance, and being involved
in the performance, rather than for the artifact itself as if it was a
bar of gold, then P2P wouldn't be the threat it's characterized as.

Definitely not for the faint of heart or for RAM/CPU-challenged systems.
User-Mode Linux (UML) allows you to build running Linux systems within
Linux systems for use as sandboxes or virtual servers. It's a poor man's
way to emulate a mainframe running Linux instances. You can bang on
your sandbox all day without affecting your host. Perfect for setting
up lab rats, honeypots or verifying that the latest updates won't
hose your other systems. If you made a copy of the file beforehand,
going back is all too simple. It's also great for hosting providers to give
clients their own servers without the additional hardware costs.
Requires: running Linux system with X (preferably with the optional
skas3 patch) and a uml-patched Linux kernel.
