AOL for Linux?</h4><p>
I have a dual-boot (GRUB) setup with Red Hat Linux 9.0 on one
partition and Windows XP Professional on another. I also am running AOL
9.0 broadband software for my ISP. Is there a driver for the AOL Broadband
Blaster modem that I can use to run Red Hat 9.0 with Internet services
through my AOL broadband connection? I want to avoid changing Internet
services and buying a new DSL modem, but I can't get Red Hat to see the
Broadxent modem, and Linux doesn't recognize my AOL broadband software.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> Natosha   <br><br><br><a href="mailto:NZimardo@aol.com">NZimardo@aol.com</a>
</p><p>
You cannot run AOL's software under Linux, so you will not be able to
access AOL services through traditional means. However, for general Internet
access, many Broadxent DSL modems have both USB and Ethernet
interfaces. If you can switch to the Ethernet interface and install an
Ethernet card in your PC, you should be able to access the Internet from
both operating systems. If your DSL modem does not have an Ethernet
interface, you need to replace it with either a USB device that
Linux supports (such as from Alcatel or ECI) or a device with an Ethernet
interface.
If you cannot get AOL to agree to allow you to do this, you should
consider an alternate service. Linux desktop deployments are becoming
more common today, especially with the efforts of Lindows and other
distribution vendors working with retailers to package their products
into inexpensive solutions.

Collecting the Ultimate Linux Box</h4><p>
I have followed Glenn Stone's &ldquo;Ultimate Linux Box&rdquo; series on the Web
and in print and decided to build my own version. I have found the
economical way is to build it piece by piece; I buy a piece every
month and put it away until I get all the pieces, then I'll put
it together.
After doing a lot of research I came to the conclusion that
1) modular
is the way to go, and 2) 64-bit is the future. I have thus elected
to build an AMD Opteron single CPU system running Mandrake Linux,
9.2/64.
I am thinking of buying the ASUS SK8N Motherboard (2GB of RAM,
twin Maxtor 120GB SATA HD, 3.5 floppy, 5.25 floppy (legacy work),
CD-RW (48x12x48x) and, with luck, a DVD player. Is this a problem
board on Linux? If it really is a problem board, can you suggest
a solid alternative board I could buy?

<br><br>&mdash;<br> S.W. Bobcat  <br><br><br><a href="mailto:swbobcat@hotmail.com">swbobcat@hotmail.com</a>
</p><p>
If you have problems with this motherboard, it is more likely to be a
driver support issue than anything else. Most board-related issues
can be resolved with simple workarounds, such as the noacpi boot
option. This motherboard in particular was used in several SPEC.org
benchmark tests in 2003, so I doubt there is an issue that cannot
be resolved in some fashion.
</p><p>
However, I would advise you to consider your 64-bit choice carefully.
Unless you are doing some serious rendering or mathematical
computation, the 64-bit platform is unlikely to provide you
significant benefit. In fact, you may find that some applications
run slightly more slowly; many benchmarks today are showing that unless a
workload is optimized for a 64-bit platform, it does not perform to
its full ability. 64-bit computing ideally is suited for a variety
of computational workloads or for things that require wider integers
for indexing facilities, such as databases. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Descent
3</em></span> won't run
any faster.
</p><p>
There is no question that many environments can
benefit from this change, as long as you recompile everything to
support it. Is yours going to be one of these? On the other hand,
the Opteron itself is a great processor, and if you are making the
choice based on HyperTransport, for instance, then kudos!

<br><br>&mdash;<br> Chad Robinson  <br><br><br><a href="mailto:crobinson@rfgonline.com">crobinson@rfgonline.com</a>
</p><p>
I'm afraid, I can't agree with your modular assertion. PCs have become so complex
that you take the risk of ending up with incompatible chipsets or a system
with subtle bugs. This doesn't mean you will, but as PCs have become more
than a thousand times faster, the mix-and-match approach is a lot more likely
to hit some subtle timing incompatibility between two components.
As for 64-bit being the future, yes, although you are not likely to
need 64 bits for what you are going to do. A wait-and-see approach for
64 bits wouldn't be unreasonable in your case (and in the meantime, you
could buy a 32-bit system).
In addition, you will not end up with a working system before you buy and
assemble the last piece, and even then, it's only if you are lucky and
everything does piece together. You will not only pay more for all the
components bought separately, but the price of the first components you
bought will have dropped by the time you buy the last one.
I really recommend that you buy a prebuilt system unless you are really
looking to do hardware tinkering and are ready to swap components
and meet potential incompatibilities.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> Marc Merlin  <br><br><br><a href="mailto:marc_bts@google.com">marc_bts@google.com</a>
</p><p>
It's better to save up for the parts and buy them all at once.
That way the warranty for the first part isn't ticking away while
you collect the rest. And, as Marc points out, PC hardware does
tend to get cheaper over time.
If you're building your own Linux system, explore the Web sites of
Linux system vendors and see what hardware they use. It's likely
to be stable and compatible.

How to Use #include</h4><p>
I am trying to access ports using check_region() . I have included
the file /linux/resource.c to do this. But when I try to compile
the program, I get the following error:

<pre     class="programlisting">
In file included /usr/include/linux/sched.h
                     /linux/resource.c
/usr/include/linux/timex.h :field "time" has incomplete type
</pre>
</p><p>
where time is of type struct timeval declared in the file timex.h.
</p><p>
Kindly tell me the possible reason and its solution.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> Ashutosh Sharma  <br><br><br><a href="mailto:catchwavesin@yahoo.com">catchwavesin@yahoo.com</a>
</p><p>
resource.c is a source code file that contains all of the function
implementations, including the one you are trying to use. I believe
you should be including &lt;linux/ioport.h&gt; instead, which contains
the definitions for these functions, not the implementations.

Big Pictures from The GIMP?</h4><p>
I use The GIMP for almost everything in picture editing, and I
have created some large pictures, say 24 &times; 24 inches. I basically use
them as first-draft examples before finally painting my subject on canvas.
I have an HP 5650 printer that obviously cannot print such large paper
sheets. So the results are that only the upper-left corner of the
picture is printed out.
What I'm looking for is the ability to print the entire picture in its
correct size but spread out on several 8 &times; 10 sheets of paper that I
then can paste together to create the correctly sized pictures.
Does any such software exist in the Linux world, or must I purchase HP's
Plotter to achieve this result at a greater cost?

<br><br>&mdash;<br> Paul Godin  <br><br><br><a href="mailto:linuxstuff@istop.com">linuxstuff@istop.com</a>
</p><p>
Perhaps I'm confused, but your problem sounds as though it has a simple
solution. You simply need to crop successive sections of the image so
you can print one tile at a time. You can do this manually
with The GIMP. You also can create a script to do this automatically,
using the ImageMagick toolkit. There is a tool called convert(1) in this
suite that not only allows you to convert images to a format more
suitable for printing (such as PostScript or PCL) but also to crop
portions from the image. See the man page for this application for details,
but I believe you probably want to use the -crop option.
<br><br>&mdash;<br> Chad Robinson  <br><br><br><a href="mailto:crobinson@rfgonline.com">crobinson@rfgonline.com</a>
</p><p>
You can print your file in PostScript and then use this program to split
it onto multiple pages: <a href="http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/support/poster" target="_self">www.ctan.org/tex-archive/support/poster</a>.
It also prints the marks you need to cut the pages and paste them
together.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> Marc Merlin  <br><br><br><a href="mailto:marc_bts@google.com">marc_bts@google.com</a>
</p><p>
What you are trying to do is called a mosaic. There are many tools to
do mosaics with The GIMP; take a look at <a href="http://registry.gimp.org" target="_self">registry.gimp.org</a>. Also, bear in mind that your
printer may have blind printing areas where it is not possible
to print, perhaps in margin areas, so take this into account when
doing the mosaic. You also may need to do some traditional cutting
on each sheet of paper.

Making Red Hat 9 into a Firewall</h4><p>
I am trying to set up a box as a firewall so routing is
enabled. I have two Ethernet cards for this box. I am running FWbuilder
1.1.1 on Red Hat 9. My question concerns the kernel route tables. The
situation is the external address is on eth0 192.168.1.2, and the internal
address is on eth1 172.10.10.252.
My default gateway on eth0 should be 192.168.1.1; however, the kernel
makes the default 192.168.1.2 and will not release this route. This
now has routed to the 192,168.1.0 side, but it stops at eth0
and cannot find a way to 192.168.1.1. The internal side works great,
though. Besides rebuilding the kernel, how can I set the default gateway to be
192.168.1.1?


<br><br>&mdash;<br> Joe Golden  <br><br><br><a href="mailto:jgolden3@csc.com">jgolden3@csc.com</a>
</p><p>
Edit the /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0 file and add a line
like
<tt  >GATEWAY='192.168.1.1'</tt>,
and then restart your network with the service network stop/service network
start commands or reboot your machine. This fixes the default gateway route of
the eth0 card to 192.168.1.1.

Switching between Running X Sessions</h4><p>
How can I have multiple X sessions running at the same time?
That is to say, if I'm logged in as root and also log in on Ctrl-Alt-F2 and
give the command <tt  >startx -- :1</tt> to fire up X, everything works fine. If I go back
to Ctrl-Alt-F7, all is fine there too. But, when I go to Ctrl-Alt-F2 again, X
has crashed there, but it still is up on F7. Is there some command that
I can give so X stays up on F2 when I'm going back and forth?

<br><br>&mdash;<br> Bjarni Valsson  <br><br><br><a href="mailto:bjarniv@hotmail.com">bjarniv@hotmail.com</a>
</p><p>
X does not run on F2 (pty 2). Each X instance you start creates its
own pty, hence the switch to pty 7. If you go back to pty 2, you
actually can put X in the background (Ctrl-Z, then type
<tt  >bg</tt>) and continue
using that console for other tasks. If you start up another copy of X,
and X already is running, it creates a new pty (now 8, in this case).
You must then press Ctrl-Alt-F8 to switch to that copy of X. Remember, X
is a user-space application. Two running X processes should not
interfere with one another unless you are doing something odd with
your hardware; certain video card driver settings might cause trouble.

DHCP under Knoppix but Not Debian</h4><p>
I recently installed a Linksys WPC11 wireless card
on an older Gateway 433 Celeron machine running
Debian Woody 3.0.
The card works fine only after I log in as root and type <tt  >pump
-i wlan0</tt>.
I followed the instructions to the letter and even modified the
specified files to read DHCP as the instructions stated.
The interesting part of this equation is that I ran Knoppix on the
same machine out of curiosity, and Knoppix correctly identifies the card,
and it automatically gets an IP address. Any idea what I can do to make
this card pull an IP automatically?

<br><br>&mdash;<br> Wes Reneau  <br><br><br><a href="mailto:wes@rose.net">wes@rose.net</a>
</p><p>
Woody 3.0 is an exceedingly old version of Debian (mid-2002), as far as
Linux distributions go. You should consider upgrading to the latest
distribution. Knoppix is based on Debian, but you are undoubtedly using
a fairly recent version. This is probably nothing more than an issue
with one of your boot scripts, but without viewing them it's difficult
to tell.

&ldquo;dump&rdquo;ing an ext3 Filesystem?</h4><p>
I regularly back up all my machines using amanda and dump. The
backup is to a dds-3 tape drive on a Red Hat 7.2 machine (servred72).
I upgraded a Debian 3.0 machine to sarge and had some problems. I wanted to
amrestore on the Debian 3.0 machine, but amrestore requires root privilege
to run. I was prevented from the restore because of security mechanisms.
The appropriate amandahosts files were modified to include root. Root access
was prevented in the LAN.
Two questions: 1) dump works on only ext2 filesystems. Is there a newer
version to support the journaling filesystems? 2) What could I do
to relax security temporarily and allow amresotre to work as root across
the LAN?

<br><br>&mdash;<br> Alan Polinsky  <br><br><br><a href="mailto:polinsky@acm.org">polinsky@acm.org</a>
</p><p>
A dump that's recent enough should work with ext3, because ext3
is ext2 with a new feature flag on the filesystem and a special
hidden inode with the journal, which you can but don't need to backup.
You do need to quiesce the journal when you take a snapshot for backup,
but dump has support for that, as hinted by the sf.net Project page,
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/dump" target="_self">sourceforge.net/projects/dump</a>, which says &ldquo;Dump/Restore ext2/ext3
filesystem backup&rdquo;.
