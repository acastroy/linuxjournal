Give your Linux box a multicolored light you can see
from across the room, and learn how to write a simple driver for
the next piece of hardware you want to hook up.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1444580.0x153c298"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Since this column began, it has discussed how a Linux driver writer
can create various types of kernel drivers, by explaining the
different kernel driver interfaces including TTY, serial, I2C
and the driver core. It is time to move on now and
focus on writing real drivers for real hardware. We start by explaining how to
determine what kind of kernel driver interface to use, tricks to
help figure out how the hardware actually works and a lot of other
real-world knowledge.
</p><p>
Let's begin with a goal of making a simple USB lamp device
work well with Linux. Editor Don Marti pointed out a neat device,
the USB Visual Signal Indicator, manufactured by Delcom Engineering and
shown in Figure 1.
I have no relationship with this company; I just think they make
nice products. This device can be ordered on-line from the Delcom Web
site, <a href="http://www.delcom-eng.com" target="_self">www.delcom-eng.com</a>. Don challenged me to get the device
working on Linux, and this article explains how I did it.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7353f1.large.jpg"><img src="7353f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1444580.0x153c608"></a>
The Hardware Protocol</h2></div></div><p>
The first goal in trying to write a driver for a device is to
determine how to control the device. Delcom Engineering
is nice enough to ship the entire USB protocol specification
their devices use with the product, and it also is available
on-line for free. This documentation shows what commands the USB
controller chip accepts and how to use them. They also provide
a Microsoft Windows DLL to help users of other operating systems
write code to control the device.
</p><p>
The documentation for this device is only the documentation for the USB
controller in the lamp. It does not explicitly say how to turn on the
different color LEDs. For this, we have to do a bit of research.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1444580.0x153c768"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
No Docs? Reverse Engineer It!</b></p><p>
If the USB protocol for this device had not been documented
or available to me, I would have had to reverse
engineer this information from the device itself. A
handy tool for this kind of work is a free program called USB Snoopy,
<a href="http://www.wingmanteam.com/usbsnoopy" target="_self">www.wingmanteam.com/usbsnoopy</a>; another version of
it is SnoopyPro, <a href="http://usbsnoop.sourceforge.net" target="_self">usbsnoop.sourceforge.net</a>.
These programs are both Windows programs that allow users to capture
the USB data that is sent to and received from any USB device on
a Windows system. All a developer needs to do is find a Windows
machine, install the Windows driver provided by the manufacturer for
the device and run the snoop program. The data is captured
to a file to be analyzed later. Perl scripts can
help filter some of the extra noise in the output of these snoop
programs into an easier format to understand.
</p><p>
Another method a few people have used to reverse engineer the
USB protocol of a device is to run a Windows instance using VMware
on top of Linux. VMware enables the Windows instance to talk to
all of the USB devices plugged in to the Linux machine by sending
data to Linux though the usbfs. A simple modification
to the usbfs causes all data flowing though it to be
logged to the kernel log. Using this, the full USB traffic stream
can be captured and later analyzed.
</p></div><p>
After opening up the lamp device, making sure not to lose the spring
that easily pops out when unscrewing the device, the circuit board
can be inspected (Figure 2). Using an ohmmeter, or any
kind of device for detecting a closed circuit, it was determined that
the three different LEDs are connected to the first three pins of
port 1 on the main controller chip.
</p><p>
In reading the documentation, the USB command to control the levels
of the port 1 pins is <tt  >Major 10, Minor 2, Length 0</tt>. The command
writes the least significant byte of the USB command packet to port
1, and port 1 is defaulted high after reset.
So, that is the USB command we need to send to the device to change
the different LEDs.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7353f2.large.jpg"><img src="7353f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. The three LEDs are connected to the first three pins of
the controller chip.
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1444580.0x153cd40"></a>
Which LED Is Which?</h2></div></div><p>
Now that we know the command to enable a port pin, we need to
determine which LED color is connected to which pin. This is easy to do
with
a simple program that runs through all possible combinations
of different values for the three port pins and then sends the value
to the device. This program enabled me to create a table of
values and LED colors (Table 1).
</p><div class="table"><a name="N0x1444580.0x153ce48"></a><p class="title"><b>
Table 1. Port Values and the Resulting LED Patterns</b></p><table     summary="&#10;Table 1. Port Values and the Resulting LED Patterns7353t1.qrk" border="1"><colgroup><col><col><col></colgroup><thead><tr><th>Port value in hex</th><th>Port value in binary</th><th>LEDs on</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>0x00</td><td>000</td><td>Red, Green, Blue</td></tr><tr><td>0x01</td><td>001</td><td>Red, Blue</td></tr><tr><td>0x02</td><td>010</td><td>Green, Blue</td></tr><tr><td>0x03</td><td>011</td><td>Blue</td></tr><tr><td>0x04</td><td>100</td><td>Red, Green</td></tr><tr><td>0x05</td><td>101</td><td>Red</td></tr><tr><td>0x06</td><td>110</td><td>Green</td></tr><tr><td>0x07</td><td>111</td><td>No LEDs on</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>
So, if all pins on the port are enabled (a value of 0x07 hex), no LEDs
are on. This matches up with the note in the data sheet that stated, &ldquo;Port 1 is defaulted high after reset.&rdquo; It would make sense
not to have any LEDs enabled when the device is first plugged in.
This means we need to turn port pins low (off) in order to
turn on the LED for that pin. Using the table, we can determine
that the blue LED is controlled by pin 2, the red LED by pin 1
and the green LED by pin 0.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1444580.0x15345f8"></a>
A Kernel Driver</h2></div></div><p>
Armed with our new-found information, we set off to whip up a quick
kernel driver. It should be a USB driver, but what kind of interface
to user space should we use? A block device does not make sense, as
this device does not need to store filesystem data, but a character
device would work. If we use a character device driver, however,
a major and minor number needs to be reserved for it. And how
many minor numbers would we need for this driver? What if someone
wanted to plug 100 different USB lamp devices in to this system?
To anticipate this, we would need to reserve at least 100 minor
numbers, which would be a total waste if all anyone ever used was
one device at a time. If we make a character driver, we also
would need to invent some way to tell the driver to turn on and off the
different colors individually. Traditionally, that could be done
using different ioctl commands on the character driver, but we know
much better than ever to create a new ioctl command in the kernel.
</p><p>
As all USB devices show up in their own directory in the sysfs
tree, so why not use sysfs and create three files in the USB
device directory, blue, red and green? This would allow any
user-space program, be it a C program or a shell script, to change
the colors on our LED device. This also would keep us from having to
write a character driver and beg for a chunk of minor numbers for
our device.
</p><p>
To start out our USB driver, we need to provide the USB subsystem with
five things:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
A pointer to the module owner of this driver: this allows the USB core
to control the module reference count of the driver properly.
</p></li><li><p>
The name of the USB driver.
</p></li><li><p>
A list of the USB IDs this driver should
provide: this table is used by the USB core to determine
which driver should be matched up to which device; the hot-plug
user-space scripts use it to load that driver automatically when a device is
plugged in to the system.
</p></li><li><p>
A probe() function called by the USB
core when a device is found that matches the USB ID table.
</p></li><li><p>
A disconnect() function called when the
device is removed from the system.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
The driver retrieves this information with the following bit of code:

<pre     class="programlisting">
static struct usb_driver led_driver = {
	.owner =	THIS_MODULE,
	.name =		"usbled",
	.probe =	led_probe,
	.disconnect =	led_disconnect,
	.id_table =	id_table,
};
</pre>
</p><p>
The id_table variable is defined as:

<pre     class="programlisting">
static struct usb_device_id id_table [] = {
	{ USB_DEVICE(VENDOR_ID, PRODUCT_ID) },
	{ },
};
MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE (usb, id_table);
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1444580.0x1534cd8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The led_probe() and led_disconnect() functions are described later.
</p><p>
When the driver module is loaded, this led_driver structure must be
registered with the USB core. This is accomplished with a single call to the
usb_register() function:

<pre     class="programlisting">

retval = usb_register(&amp;led_driver);
if (retval)
        err("usb_register failed. "
            "Error number %d", retval);

</pre>
</p><p>
Likewise, when the driver is unloaded from the system, it must
unregister itself from the USB core:

<pre     class="programlisting">

usb_deregister(&amp;led_driver);

</pre>
</p><p>
The led_probe() function is called when the USB core has found our
USB lamp device. All it needs to do is initialize the device and create
the three sysfs files, in the proper location. This is done with the
following code:

<pre     class="programlisting">

/* Initialize our local device structure */
dev = kmalloc(sizeof(struct usb_led), GFP_KERNEL);
memset (dev, 0x00, sizeof (*dev));

dev-&gt;udev = usb_get_dev(udev);
usb_set_intfdata (interface, dev);

/* Create our three sysfs files in the USB
* device directory */
device_create_file(&amp;interface-&gt;dev, &amp;dev_attr_blue);
device_create_file(&amp;interface-&gt;dev, &amp;dev_attr_red);
device_create_file(&amp;interface-&gt;dev, &amp;dev_attr_green);

dev_info(&amp;interface-&gt;dev,
    "USB LED device now attached\n");
return 0;

</pre>
</p><p>
The led_disconnect() function is equally as simple, as we need
only to free our allocated memory and remove the sysfs files:


<pre     class="programlisting">

dev = usb_get_intfdata (interface);
usb_set_intfdata (interface, NULL);

device_remove_file(&amp;interface-&gt;dev, &amp;dev_attr_blue);
device_remove_file(&amp;interface-&gt;dev, &amp;dev_attr_red);
device_remove_file(&amp;interface-&gt;dev, &amp;dev_attr_green);

usb_put_dev(dev-&gt;udev);
kfree(dev);

dev_info(&amp;interface-&gt;dev,
         "USB LED now disconnected\n");

</pre>
</p><p>
When the sysfs files are read from, we want to show the current value of
that LED; when it is written to, we want to set that specific LED.
To do this, the following macro creates two functions for each color LED
and declares a sysfs device attribute file:


<pre     class="programlisting">

#define show_set(value)	                           \
static ssize_t                                     \
show_##value(struct device *dev, char *buf)        \
{                                                  \
   struct usb_interface *intf =                    \
      to_usb_interface(dev);                       \
   struct usb_led *led = usb_get_intfdata(intf);   \
                                                   \
   return sprintf(buf, "%d\n", led-&gt;value);        \
}                                                  \
                                                   \
static ssize_t                                     \
set_##value(struct device *dev, const char *buf,   \
            size_t count)                          \
{                                                  \
   struct usb_interface *intf =                    \
      to_usb_interface(dev);                       \
   struct usb_led *led = usb_get_intfdata(intf);   \
   int temp = simple_strtoul(buf, NULL, 10);       \
                                                   \
   led-&gt;value = temp;                              \
   change_color(led);                              \
   return count;                                   \
}                                                  \

static DEVICE_ATTR(value, S_IWUGO | S_IRUGO,
                   show_##value, set_##value);
show_set(blue);
show_set(red);
show_set(green);

</pre>
</p><p>
This creates six functions, show_blue(), set_blue(), show_red(), set_red(),
show_green() and set_green(); and three attribute structures, dev_attr_blue,
dev_attr_red and dev_attr_green. Due to the simple nature of the sysfs
file callbacks and the fact that we need to do the same thing for
every different value (blue, red and green), a macro was used to reduce
typing. This is a common occurrence for sysfs file functions;
an example of this in the kernel source tree is the I2C chip drivers
in drivers/i2c/chips.
</p><p>
So, to enable the red LED, a user writes a 1 to the red file in
sysfs, which calls the set_red() function in the driver, which calls
the change_color() function. The change_color() function looks like:


<pre     class="programlisting">

#define BLUE	0x04
#define RED	0x02
#define GREEN	0x01
   buffer = kmalloc(8, GFP_KERNEL);

   color = 0x07;
   if (led-&gt;blue)
      color &amp;= ~(BLUE);
   if (led-&gt;red)
      color &amp;= ~(RED);
   if (led-&gt;green)
      color &amp;= ~(GREEN);
   retval =
      usb_control_msg(led-&gt;udev,
                      usb_sndctrlpipe(led-&gt;udev, 0),
                      0x12,
                      0xc8,
                      (0x02 * 0x100) + 0x0a,
                      (0x00 * 0x100) + color,
                      buffer,
                      8,
                      2 * HZ);
   kfree(buffer);

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1444580.0x15352b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
This function starts out by setting all bits in the variable
color to 1. Then, if any LEDs are to be enabled, it turns off only
that specific bit. We then send a USB control message to the
device to write that color value to the device.
</p><p>
It first seems odd that the tiny buffer variable, which is only
8-bytes long, is created with a call to kmalloc. Why not simply declare
it on the stack and skip the overhead of dynamically
allocating and then destroying it? This is done because some
architectures that run Linux cannot send USB data created
on the kernel stack, so all data that is to be sent to a USB
device must be created dynamically.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1444580.0x1535410"></a>
LEDs in Action</h2></div></div><p>
With this kernel driver created, built and loaded, when the USB
lamp device is plugged in, the driver is bound to it. All USB devices
bound to this driver can be found in the sysfs directory for the driver:


<pre     class="programlisting">

$ tree /sys/bus/usb/drivers/usbled/
/sys/bus/usb/drivers/usbled/
`-- 4-1.4:1.0 -&gt;
../../../../devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:0d.0/usb4/4-1/4-1.4/4-1.4:1.0

</pre>
</p><p>
The file in that directory is a symlink back to the real location in
the sysfs tree for that USB device. If we look into that directory we
can see the files the driver has created for the LEDs:

<pre     class="programlisting">

$ tree /sys/bus/usb/drivers/usbled/4-1.4:1.0/
/sys/bus/usb/drivers/usbled/4-1.4:1.0/
|-- bAlternateSetting
|-- bInterfaceClass
|-- bInterfaceNumber
|-- bInterfaceProtocol
|-- bInterfaceSubClass
|-- bNumEndpoints
|-- blue
|-- detach_state
|-- green
|-- iInterface
|-- power
|   `-- state
`-- red

</pre>
</p><p>
Then, by writing either 0 or 1 to the blue, green and red files in that
directory, the LEDs change color:

<pre     class="programlisting">

$ cd /sys/bus/usb/drivers/usbled/4-1.4:1.0/
$ cat green red blue
0
0
0
$ echo 1 &gt; red
[greg@duel 4-1.4:1.0]$ echo 1 &gt; blue
[greg@duel 4-1.4:1.0]$ cat green red blue
0
1
1

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1444580.0x1535728"></a></h2></div></div><p>
This produces the color shown in Figure 3.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7353f3.large.jpg"><img src="7353f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

Is There a Better Way?</h2></div></div><p>
Now that we have created a simple kernel driver for this device,
which can be seen in the 2.6 kernel tree at drivers/usb/misc/usbled.c
or on the <i  >Linux Journal</i> FTP site at (<a href="../listings/120/7353.tgz" target="_self">ftp.linuxjournal.com/pub/lj/listings/issue120/7353.tgz</a>), is this really the best
way to talk to the device? What about using something like
usbfs or libusb to control the device from user space without any
special device drivers? In my next column, I will show how to do this
and provide some shell scripts to control the USB lamp
devices plugged in to the system easily.
</p><p>
If you would like to see kernel drivers written for any other types of
devices, within reason&mdash;I'm not
going to try to write an NVIDIA video card driver from scratch&mdash;please let me know.
</p><p>
Thanks to Don Marti for bugging me to get this device working
on Linux. Without his prodding it would have never gotten finished.
