With these powerful add-ons for iptables you can match strings or port ranges in iptables rules or even create
a tar pit for network abusers.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1388580.0x14802f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Linux's iptables allows powerful firewalls to be
implemented at a minute fraction of the cost of many
commercial offerings. Basic iptables firewalls are
packet filters, which means they inspect the
network communications flowing through them a packet
at a time and make choices about how those packets
are handled. Simple configurations can be used
to drop certain packets and accept others. The
choice about which policy to apply to a particular
packet commonly is made on the basis of the IP
address and port number to which it has been sent
and the direction in which it is traveling.
iptables also can use state information to make more-informed choices based on the state of the
connection to which the packet relates. This is
known as connection tracking.
</p><p>
A simple and highly effective firewall
configuration blocks inbound TCP/IP connection
packets and UDP exchanges initiated from the public
Internet while allowing outbound ones over
translated addresses. This gives users free access
to the outside world while protecting them from
unwelcome intrusions. Such configurations are a
bit simplistic and may need additional filters to
be truly useful, but the basic concept is
straightforward.
</p><p>
iptables has a lot more to offer than these
simple packet-filtering criteria. Some of the extras
are fairly well known and even may make their way
into some off-the-shelf Linux distributions, but
some lesser-known features are
worthy of investigation. These are the hidden
treasures I intend to point you toward in this
article. It would take a book to describe all the
possible features and options associated with them,
so all I do here is flag their existence
and put you on the
path of exploration.

Introducing the POM</h2></div></div><p>
Netfilter has two groups of components, the kernel
and user-mode pieces. The user-mode group consists
of the iptables and related utilities, libraries,
manual pages and scripts. The kernel components are
patches to existing kernel sources and a number of
extra modules.
</p><p>
Applying patches to a system as large and complex as
the Linux kernel can be a daunting task to the
uninitiated, and the road is littered with traps and
potential blind turns. A bad or incompatible patch
readily can produce a kernel that doesn't compile, or
worse, doesn't boot. The Netfilter team has sought to
resolve these difficulties by providing us with a
robot guide, POM, or Patch-o-matic. POM is a
collection of patches and a script for applying them
to your kernel, and it's a joy even for a
relative novice to use.
</p><p>
The kernel patches included with POM are classified
into a number of groups according to their history
and quality. Some of them are base patches
needed in every iptables/Netfilter installation.
Others are optional or experimental extras that
provide interesting features, some of which I
describe in this article. These are the promised hidden
treasures, what the POM documentation describes as
&ldquo;Maybe broken, Maybe cool extensions.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Running POM is simple; download the
latest Patch-o-matic tarball from the directory
/pub/patch-o-matic on <a href="ftp://ftp.netfilter.org" target="_self">ftp.netfilter.org</a>, restore it
on your system and run the following command while
logged in as root. Make sure to give the correct
kernel source directory name as the value of the
KERNEL_DIR parameter:

<pre     class="programlisting">
KERNEL_DIR=/usr/src/linux-2.4 ./runme extra
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1388580.0x14807c0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
From there, installation is interactive and more or less self-explanatory.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1388580.0x14808c8"></a>
Bits of String</h2></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7180f1.large.jpg"><img src="7180f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"></div></div><p>
The string module probably is the most widely used
extra from the POM trove. It allows packets to be
matched against strings occurring anywhere in their
data payload. This module has all sorts of uses but needs
to be applied carefully so as not to be overzealous.
One possible use is to block the downloading of ELF
executables from the Web. We can set up a filter
that identifies Web return traffic by looking for
TCP/IP packets coming from the Internet-facing
interface with a source port of 80. If we know that
an ELF file starts with hex character 7f followed by
the letters ELF (which it does), we can use the
string match to search for this sequence. Non-ASCII
characters can be embedded in the string by using
the pipe symbol to enclose them, so we use
<tt  >|7F|ELF</tt>. Assuming that the Internet-facing network
interface is eth0, the command is:

<pre     class="programlisting">
iptables -A FORWARD -i eth0 -p tcp --sport 80 \
   -m string --string '|7F|ELF' -j DROP
</pre>
</p><p>
The syntax for embedding hex characters
into the string was introduced in iptables 1.2.8. If
you are using an earlier version, you need to resort
to trickery. For example:

<pre     class="programlisting">

--string "`dd if=/bin/ls bs=4 count=1 2&gt;/dev/null`"

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1388580.0x1480c90"></a></h2></div></div><p>
takes the first four characters of /bin/ls,
which is an ELF file that contains the string we
want.
</p><p>
We can expand this example by declaring that we
trust the content from 192.168.0.5 and, therefore, don't want
to apply the filter to that server. This is
done easily by adding an inverted match on the IP
address, like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">

iptables -A FORWARD -i eth0 -p tcp ! \
   -s 192.168.0.5 --sport 80 -m string \
   --string '|7F|ELF' -j DROP

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1388580.0x1480e48"></a></h2></div></div><p>
This example has a couple of problems that highlight
the issues with the string match module. First, the rule
matches any packet that contains this sequence
anywhere in the data, not only at the start of the
file. This means the rule could match false
positives and block packets we didn't intend.
Second, if the string we are looking for actually
is split over two adjacent packets, it isn't
matched. The module needs the entire string to
appear in a single packet.
</p><p>
So, the string module is useful but basic. It
doesn't allow for case-insensitive matches or for the
location of the string to be specified, nor does it allow
strings to be found when split over multiple packets in
the data stream. There is plenty of scope for an
extended version of this module to be written.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1388580.0x1480fa8"></a>
Fewer Rules with mport</h2></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7180f2.large.jpg"><img src="7180f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"></div></div><p>
The mport extension allows a single rule to specify
a number of port numbers and ranges using an
extended syntax. Without mport, the iptables command
can specify either a single port or a range of
adjacent ports in a single command. With mport in
place, the syntax allows more complex constructs.
For example, we could permit X terminals, Web and mail with a
single command, like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">

iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m mport \
   --dports 80,110,21,6000:6003 -j ACCEPT

</pre>
</p><p>
Without using mport, this would have to be specified
using four separate commands:

<pre     class="programlisting">

iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dports 80 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dports 110 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dports 21 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dports 6000:6003 \
      -j ACCEPT

</pre>
</p><p>
Using a single rule in place of four offers a potential
performance advantage because packets passing through
the system require less processing. It also makes
the maintenance of the rules files easier because
services requiring identical processing can
be grouped together easily.
As you probably guessed, mport is short for
multiple ports.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1388580.0x1481370"></a>
Time-Based Rules</h2></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7180f3.large.jpg"><img src="7180f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"></div></div><p>
The time module allows rules to introduce the time
of day and the day of the week into matching logic.
Example uses would be to allow access to
personal Web sites only during the lunch hour or
to divert Web traffic to a secondary server during
routine maintenance periods. The following example
renders the Web service inaccessible between the
hours of 4 and 6:30am on Fridays, presumably
for system maintenance:


<pre     class="programlisting">

iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -d 80 -m time \
   --timestart 04:00 --timestop 06:30 --days Fri \
   --syn -j REJECT

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1388580.0x1481630"></a></h2></div></div><p>
It is worth noting that the -timestart,
-timestop and -days options all must be specified.
So if you want a rule that is not day-of-week
dependent, you must specify all seven day names; you
can't omit the option.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1388580.0x1481738"></a>
Getting Bogged Down&mdash;Tar Pits</h2></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7180f4.large.jpg"><img src="7180f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"></div></div><p>
You really don't want to wander into a tar pit if
you value your life or appreciate changes of
scenery. They are nature's equivalent of fly paper;
come too close and you won't leave in a hurry. The
TARPIT component of iptables is the networking
equivalent: if you are unwise enough to establish a
TCP/IP connection to a port that is a tar pit,
you will find it hard to close the connection and
release the used system resources for future use.
</p><p>
To achieve this tar pit state, iptables accepts the incoming
TCP/IP connection and then switches to a zero-byte
window. This forces the attacker's system to stop
sending data, rather like the effect of pressing
Ctrl-S on a terminal. Any attempts by the
attacker to close the connection are ignored, so
the connection remains active and typically
times out after only 12&ndash;24 minutes. This consumes
resources on the attacker's system but not the Linux
server or firewall running the tar pit.
You could use the following iptables command to pass
packets to the pit:

<pre     class="programlisting">

iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp -dport 80 -j TARPIT

</pre>
</p><p>
You probably don't want to use conntrack
and TARPIT on the same system, particularly if you
anticipate catching a lot of flies with this
particular brand of fly paper. Each
stuck connection consumes conntrack resources.
</p><p>
One way to confuse potential attackers is to make
your Linux system look like a Microsoft Windows machine by
causing the netbios ports to respond to port scans.
Then pass any connection requests to the tar pit.
This has the effect of wasting attackers' time while
they sense a possible opening and try to gain
access. They will be frustrated by long
timeouts and an apparently buggy target. Rules such as
the following produce this result:

<pre     class="programlisting">

iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp -m mport \
   --dports 135,139,1025 -j TARPIT

</pre>
</p><p>
Another possibility is to TARPIT all ports except
the ones you genuinely want to use. This again leads
outsiders to see every port as open and waste
time attempting to gain access. Moreover, a
configuration like this prevents tcpdump from
correctly determining the operating system running
on the server. In this example, we allow Web and
e-mail traffic and bog down everything else:

<pre     class="programlisting">

iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 25 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp -j TARPIT

</pre>
</p><p>
You can find an interesting real-life story of how
TARPIT and string helped one particular system
administrator (not me) at <a href="http://www.spinics.net/lists/netfilter/msg17583.html" target="_self">www.spinics.net/lists/netfilter/msg17583.html</a>.

Randomizing</h2></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7180f5.large.jpg"><img src="7180f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"></div></div><p>
The random match module matches packets based on
nothing more than a random choice. You can tune the
logic by setting the probability that a packet is
matched anywhere between 0% and 100% of the time.
Example applications include simulating a faulty
connection or server or distributing load across
multiple mirrored Web servers. The example below
distributes Web traffic among three servers. The first
rule sends 33% of the connections to the server at
192.168.0.100. The
next 33% is sent to 192.168.0.101 and the last
third catches the remainder and passes them to
192.168.0.102:

<pre     class="programlisting">

iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i eth0 -p tcp \
   --dport 80 --syn -m random --average 33 \
   -j DNAT --to-destination 192.168.0.100:80

iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i eth0 -p tcp \
   --dport 80 --syn -m random --average 50 \
   -j DNAT --to-destination 192.168.0.101:80

iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i eth0 -p tcp \
   --dport 80 --syn -j DNAT \
   --to-destination 192.168.0.102:80

</pre>

As before, this assumes that eth0 is the
Internet-facing interface.

A Lot More Where They Came From</h2></div></div><p>
Dozens of treasures can be dug up and
enjoyed. I have described a small handful here, but
there are plenty more. Simply running the <tt  >runme</tt>
script and reading the patch descriptions as they
are displayed is one way of getting an idea of
what is available.
Here are a few more examples of what you can find:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Connection tracking for RSH, MMS (media
streaming), PPTP, Quake, RPC and Talk.
</p></li><li><p>
Extended support for configuration and status
information access through the /proc filesystem.
</p></li><li><p>
Extended support for IPv6 features.
</p></li><li><p>
Manipulation of options, TTL and more in IP
packets.
</p></li><li><p>
Finer control over NATed connections.
</p></li><li><p>
Control over limits on quota and bandwidth
usage.
</p></li><li><p>
Anti-OS fingerprinting logic and port-scan
detection.
</p></li><li><p>
Connection marking (and mark testing).
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1388580.0x14790a0"></a>
Sources of Wisdom</h2></div></div><p>
The patches added with POM don't add their
descriptions to the iptables man page, so we need to
turn elsewhere for documentation. The basic syntax
used to invoke these extensions can be displayed
using the iptables built-in help facility. For
example, <tt  >iptables -m random -help</tt>
gives the usual help message but with
the random module's parameters displayed at the
end. The same technique can be applied to the other
modules.
</p><p>
You also can refer to the module help files held in
the Patch-o-matic directory structure. The file for
random is base/random.patch.help.
Similar files can be found for the other patches.
</p><p>
Finally, make use of the Netfilter Web site, <a href="http://www.netfilter.org/patch-o-matic" target="_self">www.netfilter.org/patch-o-matic</a>,
which contains a description of each of the POM patches.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1388580.0x1479308"></a>
Installing New iptables Modules</h2></div></div><p>
The majority of iptables extensions have two parts,
a patch to the Linux kernel and a configuration
helper library for use by the iptables user-space
program. The detailed procedure for adding a POM
module to the kernel and the iptables tools is
outlined at <a href="http://www.lowth.com/howto/add-iptables-modules.php" target="_self">www.lowth.com/howto/add-iptables-modules.php</a>.
In summary, the steps we need to take are bring your system up to date;
download the latest Patch-o-matic sources;
patch the kernel using the runme script;
recompile and install the patched kernel; and
recompile and install the iptables software.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1388580.0x1479468"></a>
Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
We have seen that Linux's Netfilter provides an
excellent set of features for building effective
firewalls, but not all of these features are installed
by default on many Linux distributions. The
Patch-o-matic software allows administrators to
extend the base functionalities of their firewalls
through an automated approach to patching the Linux
kernel.
</p><p>
To finish, take this thought with you: we have
seen that iptables/Netfilter has a number of
exciting possibilities hidden away from initial
inspection. The chances are high that the same is
true for other packages. This is part of the joy of
open-source software; nothing is truly hidden.
Everything that exists is waiting there for the
skilled seeker to find.
