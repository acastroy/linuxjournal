Understanding the most common security threats to PHP applications is the
first step to securing yours.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20e6580.0x21de298"></a></h2></div></div><p>
During the past two years, the core PHP developers have done an
incredible job of providing the PHP user community with powerful
technology that has been able to perform remarkably well in many
environments.
As Web applications become more popular, Web developers must face an
increasing amount of possible security vulnerabilities that have the
potential
to compromise their work seriously. Many tutorials, books and
articles have been published as new techniques are developed.
These new emerging threats, however, have not received the focus they
deserve.
</p><p>
This article is aimed at professional and open-source PHP
developers who must provide a high level of security to their users
or clients. The intent of this article is not to provide the developer
with a question-and-answer approach but to help the developer identify possible
security issues in their own applications during the design process.
In the long run, this process enables you, the PHP developer, to
respond to new security threats accordingly.
</p><p>
Many articles have covered the subject of secure PHP development, and
the same topics usually are covered by every article. Here, I quickly
go over those basic concepts because they are important, but I assume you
are familiar with this material so I won't spend too much time on it.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20e6580.0x21de450"></a>
register_globals</h2></div></div><p>
PHP provides users with a configuration directive called
register_globals that, when enabled, places every variable in
the application in the global scope.
This means that variables passed to the Web server as POST,
GET, cookies and session all are placed in the same basket,
providing a convenient way for the developer to retrieve
those values.
</p><p>
By design, enabling this directive is likely to
affect the overall security of your application, because users
gain direct access to the content of any variable you may use in
your application. PHP now ships with register_globals turned
off by default, and I strongly recommend leaving it at that
setting for the sake of security. The exception would be if your server
also hosts legacy applications that assume this directive
is turned on.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20e6580.0x21de5b0"></a>
Cross-Site Scripting</h2></div></div><p>
Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a popular technique that allows
the user to gain control over the layout, content and overall
reliability and security of Web applications. PHP is not the
only technology vulnerable to this technique, mostly because
it is not really a flaw in the language. Instead, it is more of a concept
pertaining to the design of Web applications in general.
</p><p>
Cross-site scripting exists in many different forms, but a popular
method is to inject HTML or JavaScript code in form
fields in order to make your application display content that otherwise should
not be displayed.
This concept illustrates the importance of always filtering any kind of
input for your application, whether it comes from a user, another site
or even from the database. The PHP function htmlentities() is generally
a good way of preventing this type of attack.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20e6580.0x21de710"></a>
GET Variables</h2></div></div><p>
Having the ability to provide users with a URL they can
use to get back to where they are later on is critical for
most Web applications. But as a developer, it is important
to be able to determine what information the user should be
able to access in any possible way.
By manipulating the content of the query string, the user gains the
ability to modify the content of the variables used by your application.
</p><p>
Preventing this type of event from happening is more complex than simply
filtering the input, but this is still a step in the right direction.
What is perhaps the most reliable way to secure your applications against
this type of attack is setting up a robust data-flow scheme for your
application and a solid error-control system.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20e6580.0x21de870"></a>
SQL Injection</h2></div></div><p>
This type of malicious attack on a Web application can have
devastating consequences that go beyond the scope of most
other attacks, such as cross-site scripting,
because it has the potential to destroy
your database and its content permanently and completely.
</p><p>
The concept of SQL injection is quite simple.
Most Web applications accept parameters as input from POST
and GET variables and from cookies. This input often is used inside an
SQL query as a parameter, thus providing the user with dynamic content.
If the user has any idea of what your database looks like, they
technically should be able to alter the parameters you use to inject
SQL commands in to your query.
</p><p>
Let's look at a quick example.
Your application accepts data from a form as POST. The goal
is to display <span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> records from the database, where
users can
modify <span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> to fit their needs. Therefore, your form simply has a field
called NUM that provides your script with that value.
Listing 1 illustrates this process.
In this case, a user could forge an HTML form that would send a carefully
crafted value that in turn, would empty your table.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20e6580.0x21dead8"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Listing 1. Building an SQL Query in PHP Based on POST Variables</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;?php
$query = "SELECT id, name FROM `records` LIMIT "
         . $_POST['NUM'];
$result = $db-&gt;select($query);
?&gt;

</pre></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20e6580.0x21dece8"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Listing 2. A Malicious Form Used to Perform the SQL Injection Attack</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;form action="example.com/form.php" method="POST"&gt;
&lt;input type="text" name="NUM"
        value="5; DELETE FROM `records`"&gt;
&lt;input type="submit"&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;

</pre></div><p>
If the user decides to create a form like the one
presented in Listing 2, your end result would look like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
SELECT id, name FROM `records` LIMIT 5;
DELETE FROM `records`
</pre>
</p><p>
There obviously are simple ways to counter such attacks, but I
have noticed that a large number of applications have no facility to
protect themselves from this type of attack.
</p><p>
In our particular example, calling the intval() function to
convert NUM to an integer would have provided a decent level
of security against SQL injection. However, it is important
to understand that developers can't
think about every single parameter used in all of their SQL
queries. Therefore, what you really need to do is streamline
this process in your applications.
</p><p>
Because modern Web-based applications commonly tend to gravitate toward
a core module or some kind of centralized switchboard system, it becomes
easy to implement such a facility application-wise.
The details of the implementation of streamlined facilities for your
applications are covered later in the
article. For now, take note of the following
quick tips that will help you build your own solution:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Use regular expressions to filter SQL commands:
this method is not appropriate if you intend to accept text from users,
but it does a good job of stopping SQL injection by filtering out SQL
keywords (Listing 3).
</p></li><li><p>
Use assertions: assertions are covered in more detail in later in this
article.
</p></li><li><p>
Escape strings:
if you do not expect to be accepting binary data as input, an
important step in securing your input is the use of string escaping.
In the example above, escaping the string would not have helped,
however; many SQL injection attacks are based on exiting the SQL query
prematurely and injecting a new query inside. This is efficiently
prevented through the use of functions, such as mysql_escape_string().
</p></li></ol></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20e6580.0x21df318"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>

Encryption</h2></div></div><p>
Sensitive information often is stored on database servers and other
storage facilities for later retrieval. At this point, it is critical
to have at your disposal a facility that allows you, as a developer, to
secure that data at storage time and retrieve the information you are
looking for when you need it.
</p><p>
PHP offers an extension that allows developers to use the Mcrypt Library
(<a href="http://mcrypt.sf.net" target="_self">mcrypt.sf.net</a>) to secure data by encrypting it and
later decrypting
it. The documentation of the Mcrypt extension for PHP is
located at <a href="http://www.php.net/mcrypt" target="_self">www.php.net/mcrypt</a>, and it should be studied
carefully before implementation.
</p><p>
The Mcrypt extension supports an impressive array of algorithms, including
triple-DES, Blowfish, Twofish and Two-Way. Using the Mcrypt extension is
not a very intuitive process if you are not familiar with encryption; it
can become quite confusing because of the variety of block algorithms
and encryption modes available.
Refer to Listing 4 for a sample of what the Mcrypt extension
offers and how to use it.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20e6580.0x21df7e8"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>

&lt;?php

$key = "AOQKJLCLIGAKJHSD

$string = $_POST['password'];

/* First, you must open the encryption module
   provided by Mcrypt */
$mod = mcrypt_module_open ('blowfish','','ecb','');

   must free the buffers used during the process */
mcrypt_generic_deinit ($mod);

/* Finally, you must close the encryption module
   you have used*/
mcrypt_module_close ($mod);

/* Now here is how we can decrypt our data: */
$padded = // see next line
mcrypt_decrypt('blowfish',$key,$encrypted,'ecb',$iv);
/* At this point, our decrypted string has been
   zero-padded so we need to remove the extra \0s */
$plain = str_replace("\0","",$padded);

Assertions</h2></div></div><p>
Assertions provide the PHP developer with a way to implement error
control and preserve the integrity of data.
This is not a security-related feature of PHP, and it
is implemented in many mainstream languages, such as C or Python,
so why am I bringing it up now? Simply put, error control is the first
step in providing efficient security for your users or your
clients.
</p><p>
Assertions are implemented in PHP through the use of two
functions, assert_options() and assert(). The former should be called
in your application's initialization or configuration file, and the
latter should be implemented anywhere in your code where you need to enforce
the validity of your input.
Listing 5 demonstrates how assertions can be used to create an
error-control system that generates a simple report when an assertion
fails.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20e6580.0x21dfbb0"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Listing 5. Error Reporting through Assertions</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;?php

/* You can toggle assertions throughout your entire
   application by switching ASSERT_ACTIVE to 1 or 0
*/
assert_options(ASSERT_ACTIVE,1);

/* We do want the application to exit when an
   assertion fails. (in this example)
*/
assert_options(ASSERT_BAIL,1);

/* In our example, we will do the error reporting
   ourselves so we turn off the default warnings
*/
assert_options(ASSERT_WARNING,0);

/* display_error will be the name of our custom
   function that will be called if an assertion
   fails
*/
assert_options(ASSERT_CALLBACK, "display_error");

$email = strtolower($_POST['email']);
$parts = array();

// Building your regular expression
$regex = "^([.\'a-z0-9]+)@([.\'a-z0-9]+)$";

/* Checking for valid format and splitting
   the email address at the same time
   Note the special formatting. Everything
   is in quotation marks and the error is
   commented. We will extract this error
   later through regular expressions.
*/
assert("ereg(\$regex, \$email, \$parts); /*
       Invalid email address: $email */");

/* This block will not be executed if the
   assertion fails so we can safely go on */
$username = $parts[1];
echo "Welcome home, " . $username;

The PHPUnit Project is a complete
unit testing suite freely available to PHP developers and is based on what we
have just done. The PHPUnit's home page is located at <a href="http://phpunit.sf.net" target="_self">phpunit.sf.net</a>.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20e6580.0x24eade8"></a>
Data Flow</h2></div></div><p>
If you have worked on many different Web projects, chances are
you have started using a common structure upon which to base your new
projects or you have developed your own. There are many ways to
centralize data management in your application, and depending on the set
of requirements that define your project, some models are more appropriate
than others.
In the next few paragraphs, I introduce a simple design
template that gives the developer a sufficient amount of scalability
and flexibility for most enterprise-grade projects.
</p><p>
What you need to do at this point is implement a way to centralize all
your input and force it to go through a filtering facility. Doing so
gives
you the simplicity you need to implement additional functionality
in a modular fashion.
In our example, we use the following file hierarchy:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
/index.php: only file in root.
</p></li><li><p>
/lib: libraries, protected by .htaccess.
</p></li><li><p>
/lib/config.inc.php: configuration file.
</p></li><li><p>
/tpl: templates, protected by .htaccess.
</p></li><li><p>
/doc: project and APIs documentation.
</p></li><li><p>
/images.
</p></li><li><p>
/classes: classes, protected by .htaccess.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
As illustrated in Figure 2, your application's core is the index.php
file, and it has direct access to any library, template, class
or configuration file, but the user never has access to
those files.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7237f2.large.jpg"><img src="7237f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Application Core
</p></div></div><p>
Let's follow, step-by-step, the design illustrated in Figure 2 by taking
the example of a user logging in to the application.
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
The user queries index.php with no parameters.
Index creates a buffer and passes it over to the switchboard that
calls the default module. This module uses a template to display the
default page of the application.
</p></li><li><p>
The user fills in the authentication form and
submits the form.
The form redirects its output to something like
<tt  >?module=account&amp;action=login</tt>.
The switchboard calls the login function of the
account module, which is simply an interface to the user class.
The function instantiates an object of the user
class. This object is an interface between your module and the database,
and it performs the query.
</p></li><li><p>
The data is sent back from the database to the
object and from the object to the module, which in turn, sets up the
appropriate session variables, calls the proper template and uses it
to modify the buffer. It then sends the response message to the index.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
The data flow in this particular model may seem a little confusing at
first, but it really is simple.
User input is passed quickly to the appropriate module, and error
control is implemented on the switchboard level. Other types of inputs
are database access and filesystem access, and they are filtered by their
appropriate classes. Every class extends a special skeleton class that
provides the input filtering facility, so none of the classes have to
worry about this.
</p><p>
This model is efficient as it provides a scalable and robust
architecture, but keep in mind that many other interesting
models are available. For example, you may want to look at the Phrame Project
(<a href="http://phrame.sf.net" target="_self">phrame.sf.net</a>), which provides an implementation of the Model2 approach,
a derivative of MVC (<a href="http://ootips.org/mvc-pattern.html" target="_self">ootips.org/mvc-pattern.html</a>).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20e6580.0x24ebaf8"></a>
Safe Mode</h2></div></div><p>
PHP's Safe mode is something you should learn to work with
whether you are a PHP developer or a system administrator.
Safe mode is a set of configuration options that allow
the system administrator to alter the behavior of the PHP
interpreter by implementing security measures. From
a system administrator's point of view, this means you must learn how to
implement this feature properly, without making it impossible
for developers to set up their applications on your server. From
a developer's point of view, you must learn what possibly
could get broken in your application if this feature is turned on.
</p><p>
Turning safe_mode on makes sense if you manage a shared server that
serves PHP applications and the PHP developers using this server are
not trusted. Enabling safe_mode in your php.ini file effectively makes
any file-related operation in any of your scripts impossible unless the
UID of the owner of the file is the same as the UID of the running script.
PHP also gives you the ability to change this policy while safe_mode is
on by turning on the safe_mode_gid option. In this case, PHP checks for the GID of the files you are trying to work with instead of their UID.
</p><p>
It also is good practice to not let your users execute any system
binary they want; safe_mode_exec_dir comes into play here.
This priceless feature lets you tell PHP not to perform any binary
execution, through exec() or any other function, unless the binary is
located in the safe_mode_exec_dir, such as /usr/local/php/bin.
</p><p>
Once you have familiarized yourself with the restrictions implemented by
PHP when safe_mode is enabled, you should be able to develop software
that doesn't break when it's run on servers with this directive enabled.
Many ISPs use safe_mode.
The simple guidelines to follow are:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Try to limit file operations, whether read or
write, to the files you have provided with your
application.
</p></li><li><p>
Do not rely on external software to be installed
or executable by your script unless your project
is running on only your servers.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
System administrators also have at their disposal other
powerful tools to ensure the overall security of their systems.
These tools include disable_functions that prevent specified functions from
being called, as well as options such as open_basedir, which limit any file operation to a specific directory.
</p><p>
The PHP documentation team has provided an extensive amount of literature
on the subject. They also have provided documentation for every aspect of
safe_mode and related functions and directives.
