You can help eliminate the spam problem by making it easy
to detect forgeries. Protect your
e-mail address reputation with a simple DNS technique.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f21580.0x20192f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
SPF is an emerging antiforgery standard that aims to
prevent worms, viruses and spam from forging arbitrary
e-mail addresses as the envelope sender in SMTP.
SPF has two parts: domain administrators need to publish SPF records
in the DNS, and e-mail administrators need to install SPF-enabled
MTAs to read those records. SPF records indicate
the servers from which a domain sends outbound mail. Mail coming
from anywhere else is considered forged.
</p><p>
This article, the first of a two-part series, explains the
concepts and trade-offs involved in SPF protection and shows
DNS administrators how to set up SPF records. The second
article is aimed at showing e-mail administrators how to activate SPF
protection in their MTAs.
This article was written in early January 2004 and reflects
the state of the Internet current at that time.

Worms, Viruses, Joe-Jobs and Envelope Sender Forgery</h2></div></div><p>
I got spam from myself today.
I founded pobox.com, and I'm an e-mail guy. So I pressed H for
headers and read the Received lines. Just as I thought:
like much of the spam I receive, this one came from a broadband
machine.
It's probably an old PIII running Windows 2000 unpatched, used
for gaming and MP3s, quietly humming at the foot of
someone's bed, draped in dirty underwear. Maybe it lives on
a potato farm in Idaho; maybe it looks out over Central
Park. Either way, it's probably infected with a variant of
the Sobig virus, written under contract to a spammer. The
machine's rightful owner has no idea he's infected, no idea
his machine has been sending a few hundred spams and
viruses every hour since that forgotten day long ago when he
clicked on that weird attachment that didn't open.
</p><p>
Spam messages disguise their origins. Spammers use compromised machines
to send the spam. They forge message headers. They fake Received
headers to throw off the scent, make up bogus Subjects to trick
Bayesian filters and forge From lines pretending to be PayPal
or eBay.
</p><p>
Spammers also forge the return path. When messages are
undeliverable, they bounce back to the sender whose address
is in the return path. Not the From: address in the
message headers, but the return path of the SMTP envelope,
the RFC2821 MAIL FROM.
Often, spamware uses lists of old addresses, or they simply
guess common user names or launch a dictionary attack. The
result is a lot of bad addresses and a lot of bounces.
</p><p>
Spammers don't want those bounces. They'd rather somebody
else receive them. So, they pick an address at random or use
the recipient's address. That's how they made it look like
I got spam from myself. Sometimes they choose a hated enemy
and maliciously forge his address so he gets flooded with
thousands of bounces.
</p><p>
In 1997, a spammer forged a return address at joes.com, which then was
flooded by so many bounce messages it went
down for ten days&mdash;and gave the world the term
<span   class="emphasis"><em>joe-job</em></span>.
Hotmail and AOL get joe-jobbed every day: a lot of spam
pretends to be from AOL but doesn't really come through
their servers. Under conventional SMTP, AOL can't do
anything about it. If you put the AOL logo on a T-shirt and
tried to sell that shirt, AOL's lawyers would have you
ceasing-and-desisting in a heartbeat. But spammers forge
@aol.com every day. They can get away with it because they
use SMTP.
</p><p>
The Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) was designed more than
20 years ago&mdash;a kindlier, gentler time. The
entire Internet was only a handful of research institutions.
SMTP has served us well since then, but it's beginning to
show its age.
</p><p>
SMTP is open and trusting. Its rules are relatively lax.
You can assert any envelope sender and make up all the
headers you want. You could argue today, though, that a protocol
that lets joe-jobs happen is a little too open, a little
too trusting.
That's where sender authentication comes in. SPF tightens
the rules.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f21580.0x20197c0"></a>
Sender Authentication with SPF</h2></div></div><p>
When you send mail to a domain, your MTA does a DNS lookup
(an MX query) to find out to which server to route the mail.
Such a server is called a mail exchanger (MX). Small domains
tend to have only one MX server. Big domains tend to have
more. Mail <span   class="emphasis"><em>to</em></span> a domain goes <span   class="emphasis"><em>to</em></span> its MX servers.
</p><p>
Now for the big idea. In 99% of all cases, when a domain
sends mail, that mail originates from a relatively small
set of servers controlled by that domain. The domain could
designate those servers using the DNS, then announce that
any mail not received from those servers probably is
forged. That's called a designated sender scheme (Figure 1).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7327f1.large.jpg"><img src="7327f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. With SPF, one mail server can check whether another server
really is associated with the address the mail claims to be from.
</p></div></div><p>
Designated sender schemes are useful because they help
fight forgery and are easy to set up. After all, domain
owners already know which servers send mail from that
domain.
When I say send mail from that domain, I mean
originate an SMTP transaction where the MAIL-FROM envelope
sender shows that domain. I'm not talking about the
From: header. This is an important distinction.
</p><p>
Mail from a domain tends to come from a small number of
servers. That's true for domains large and small. Mail
from aol.com comes from AOL's servers. Mail from my
personal domain comes from my personal servers. It certainly
doesn't come from a machine covered in dirty underwear.
</p><p>
Many ISPs already are implementing these kinds of rules
in a haphazard and often slightly broken way. The problem
is, one ISP doesn't know the insides of another ISP, and
it's easy to guess wrong. Maybe aol.com's mail servers also
originate mail for aol.net or vice versa.
Wouldn't it be better if AOL themselves announced their
designated servers in a simple, flexible, extensible,
open format that everybody could use?
</p><p>
Well, they do.
SPF is a standard, flexible, extensible, open format that
everybody can use. At the time of this writing, AOL recently had started
publishing their SPF record.
</p><p>
MTAs can interpret that record and use it to tell whether mail
that claims to be from @aol.com is a fake.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7327f2.large.jpg"><img src="7327f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. SPF performs a simple DNS-based lookup for each
incoming message.
</p></div></div><p>
All this rule tightening is purely voluntary:
domains that don't publish SPF records can continue to send
mail as before. Some unusual domains might be served
better by not publishing SPF; it's up to them. But most domains
should want to use SPF.
</p><p>
To publish SPF, a domain has to add only one line to its
zone file. That line is a TXT record, and you can publish
it today. Let's see what the TXT record looks like.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f21580.0x2019fa8"></a>
SPF by Example</h2></div></div><p>
Suppose example.com wants to publish SPF. It expects MTAs
everywhere to read its SPF record and use it to reject
forgery attempts. It hopes SPF reduces the volume of
joe-job bounces and bogus abuse reports. So it adds the following line to
its zone file:

<pre     class="programlisting">
example.com.  IN TXT  "v=spf1 a mx ptr -all"
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f21580.0x201a108"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The v=spf1 version string identifies this as an SPF
record. The -all means reject all mail by default. Domains that don't send
any mail, such as
altavista.com, can get by with simply <tt  >v=spf1 -all</tt>. But
if the domain does send mail, it declares mechanisms that
describe how legitimate mail should look. Mechanisms go in
the middle, before -all. The first mechanism to match
provides a result for the SPF query. <tt  >-all</tt> always matches
and so belongs at the end.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f21580.0x201a2c0"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Basic SPF</b></p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>A:</b></span> the A mechanism means the IP address of example.com is
permitted to send mail from example.com.
If you want to say the IP address of some-other.com is
permitted, you can say <tt  >a:some-other.com</tt>.
You can use as many A mechanisms as you want.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>MX:</b></span> the MX mechanism means the MX servers for example.com
all are permitted to send mail from example.com.
If you want to say the MX servers for some-other.com are
permitted, you can say <tt  >mx:some-other.com</tt>.
You can use as many MX mechanisms as you want.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>PTR:</b></span> the PTR mechanism says if a host has a PTR record that
ends in example.com, it is permitted to send mail from
example.com. This would be a good choice for Yahoo, whose
mail server names all end in yahoo.com. It would be a bad
choice for a broadband provider like Comcast.
If you want to say servers whose names end in
some-other.com are permitted to send mail from example.com,
you can say <tt  >ptr:some-other.com</tt>.
You can use as many PTR mechanisms as you want.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>IP4:</b></span> to say the class C network of 192.0.2.0 is permitted to
send mail from example.com, you would write
<tt  >ip4:192.0.2.0/24</tt>.
</p></div><p>
Mechanisms are interpreted left-to-right. Using <tt  >v=spf1 a mx ptr
-all</tt> first would check whether the connecting client was found
in the A record for the domain or, failing that, in its list
of MX servers. Then the MTA would check to see whether the
hostname of the client matched the domain. If none of the
mechanisms matched, -all would be evaluated, the result
would be fail and the MTA would be justified in rejecting
the mail.
</p><p>
A, MX, PTR and IP4 are enough for the overwhelming
majority of domains. The setup wizard at
<a href="http://spf.pobox.com/wizard.html" target="_self">spf.pobox.com/wizard.html</a> can help you configure SPF
for your domain. But if your situation is complex, you can
use the mechanisms described in the &ldquo;Advanced SPF&rdquo; sidebar.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f21580.0x201aa50"></a>
Extensibility</h2></div></div><p>
SPF has a number of built-in mechanisms. The basic ones let
you designate the hosts that send mail from your domain.
This works well for almost all domains out there,
because each domain's mail comes only from a small set of
hosts. But if mail from your domain is distinguished in
some other way, say you always sign it with S/MIME, instead of typing <tt  >a</tt> or <tt  >mx</tt> you
can type <tt  >smime</tt>.
</p><p>
Using designated sender mechanisms (A, MX, PTR and IP4) is
one possible approach to sender authentication. New sender
authentication methods are being developed. SPF is extensible, though, so
it can
work gracefully with them. SPF plugins that
understand future extension mechanisms will be able to interpret them
correctly. SPF plugins that don't understand those
mechanisms will return unknown, and your domain will be
treated as though it did not have an SPF record at all.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f21580.0x201acb8"></a>
Protecting Subdomains and MX Servers</h2></div></div><p>
Today, spammers forge domain names. Tomorrow, they might
forge hostnames. They might try to joe-job your laptop by making up
username@ibook.example.com.
It's a good idea to protect your subdomains as well. You
should start with your MX servers and move on to other hosts
with A records. Here's why.
</p><p>
Bounce messages are sent with MAIL FROM: &lt;&gt;. The null
sender address ensures that bounces don't themselves bounce
and create a loop. When SPF sees the null sender address,
it falls back to the hostname given in the HELO command.
When your MTA sends a bounce message, it announces its
hostname in the HELO command it sends. If that hostname has
an SPF A mechanism listed, the message passes. So SPF
prevents HELO forgery as well.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f21580.0x2413068"></a>
Traveling Mailman and the Forwarding Problem</h2></div></div><p>
SPF was designed to give the greatest benefit for the least
cost. It tightens the rules in a way that makes it hard for
bad people to do bad things, while not bothering the good
people who do good things.
Even so, some power users who have taken advantage of SMTP's
lax rules may be inconvenienced by SPF. This section
describes the two problems SPF causes power users and offers
ways to work around them.
</p><p>
Most end users relay their outbound
mail through their ISPs' SMTP servers. Most modern clients
also support SASL authentication or POP-before-SMTP for
users who need to phone home from outside the ISPs'
networks. Users who always send mail through
their ISPs'
SMTP servers are automatically SPF-compliant and don't need
to do a thing.
</p><p>
But some power users with an MTA on their laptop are used to
originating mail from random IP addresses, bypassing their
ISPs' SMTP servers entirely. SPF accommodates these users:
the advanced mechanism (see the &ldquo;Advanced SPF&rdquo; sidebar) is a way to
exempt certain users from being required to use their
ISPs' SMTP servers. They can keep doing what they want.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f21580.0x24132d0"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Advanced SPF</b></p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Exists:</b></span> the Exists mechanism takes an argument that expands to a
domain name, and you can use macros. For example,
<tt  >exists:%{ir}.%{l}._spf.example.com</tt> might expand to
<tt  >2.2.0.192.ceo._spf.example.com</tt>.
An SPF client would perform an A query on the expanded
domain name, and if it got back any A record (for example, 127.0.0.2)
Exists would result in a pass.
You could use this technique to allow the special user
ceo@example.com to send mail from a particular host, say
192.0.2.2, by creating an A record corresponding to the
domain name above. Some people have written custom DNS
servers to handle complex Exists queries. With Exists,
the sky's the limit.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Include:</b></span> if you send mail through another organization's servers, you
should use the Include mechanism to point to their domain, so
the SPF record is pulled in and expanded. For
example, a vanity domain might use <tt  >include:isp.com</tt> if it sends
mail through ISP.com's mail servers. Any server permitted
to send mail for ISP.com then is permitted to send mail for
the vanity domain. You can include multiple other domains.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>The modifiers Redirect and Exp:</b></span>
modifiers are different from the other mechanisms we've seen
so far; they use equal signs instead of colons.
Although mechanisms can repeat, you can have only one modifier
per SPF record.
Redirect is a modifier that works like Include, except
the original query is replaced completely by the new query.
Exp lets you define an explanation string. If an MTA
rejects a forgery attempt, the explanation string
appears in the SMTP error message that goes back to the
original sender. You may have legitimate users who aren't
using your SMTP servers, and SPF quickly can find out who they
are. You also can set the explanation string to a URL that points to
further information on how to configure mail
clients correctly.
All these mechanisms are described in detail at
<a href="http://spf.pobox.com/mechanisms.html" target="_self">spf.pobox.com/mechanisms.html</a>.
</p></div><p>
Some power users have a dozen or more
addresses that forward all over the place by using entries in
/etc/aliases or .forward files. In classical forwarding,
the envelope sender remains unchanged while the recipient
address is rewritten. This becomes a problem, though, when the
message arrives at the destination&mdash;it still has the
original sender address, and SPF tests fail.
</p><p>
The workaround is easy, however; you simply need to switch to
<span   class="emphasis"><em>remailing</em></span>, where the sender address changes as well. There
are many ways to accomplish this. Read the
SPF FAQ
(<a href="http://spf.pobox.com/faq.html#forwarding" target="_self">spf.pobox.com/faq.html#forwarding</a>) to pick up the
one that's right for you.
Most end users have nothing to do with forwarding;
only power users need to implement this workaround. If you
have third-party service through an alumni, vanity domain
or other commercial forwarding provider (such as pobox.com),
you should expect them to implement remailing for you.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f21580.0x2413958"></a>
Stopping Spam: It's Part of the Solution</h2></div></div><p>
The primary goal of SPF is to stop forgery. I don't want to
get any more spam from myself, and I certainly don't want
you to receive any spam that claims to be from me. Worms and
viruses tend to forge the envelope sender, too, and we can block
them with SPF.
And, stopping forgery carries a bonus. When spammers are
forced to use their true names, we can figure out which
domains are legitimate and which are spammers. People
already are doing this: a right-hand side block list (RHSBL) is the domain name version of a
DNS block list (DNSBL). Spammers who aren't afraid of using their own
domains end up on RHSBLs quickly, and they can be blocked
that way. In an SPF world, RHSBLs will become more
important and effective.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f21580.0x2413a60"></a>
Why Do People Use SPF?</h2></div></div><p>
Big domains, including ISPs, banks and well-known brands care
about controlling their trademarks. They have an obligation
to protect their names. Altavista.com publishes an SPF
record as do AOL and Oxford. More domains get
on the bandwagon every day.
Smaller domains publish SPFs simply because they don't
want to be joe-jobbed.
</p><p>
On the receiving end, ISPs upgrade their MTAs and turn
on SPF simply because it means less forgery&mdash;less spam,
worms and viruses. Their bandwidth costs go down, too,
because SPF lets them cut off the spammer before data is
transmitted. They don't have to perform any cryptography or
verify any signatures. SPF saves money.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f21580.0x2413bc0"></a>
Adoption</h2></div></div><p>
By the time this article is published, SPF support should be
either bundled in or available as a downloadable plugin for
the latest versions of SpamAssassin, Postfix, Sendmail, Exim and qmail.
Commercial antispam vendors have committed
to support SPF; Declude JunkMail, for one, reports that SPF
is successfully blocking spam in the field.
</p><p>
If all goes well, the SPF standard will be published as an
RFC in the near future. But thousands of domains, including
some quite large ones, already publish SPF records. There's no
reason to wait; you should publish SPF today.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f21580.0x2413d20"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
SPF and Conventional Antispam Methods</b></p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>DNS blacklists or blocklists (DNSBLs):</b></span>
IPv4 space is 32 bits wide; 2<sup  >32</sup> is about 4.2
billion&mdash;4.2
billion grains of sand would just about fill a pickup truck.
Imagine trying to paint each individual grain black or white.
IP-based blacklists are a valiant effort, but they operate
at too low a level. A good DNSBL has to decide whether an
IP address is spammy and get it right for each of the
4.2 billion IP addresses. No wonder DNSBLs come and go&mdash;their maintainers burn out and give up.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Right-hand side blacklists:</b></span> RHSBLs use
domain names, whereas DNSBLs use IP addresses.
Domain names are a much better way to identify entities on
the Internet, but RHSBLs haven't been quite as popular as
DNSBLs. Why not? Spam doesn't come from spammer.net. It's forged from
yahoo.com. That's why SPF helps: if
spammers send mail with their true names, blocking them
becomes trivial.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Address verification:</b></span>
at MAIL phase, you can check the validity of the envelope
sender by attempting to send a test message to it. If the
test comes back user unknown, you might not want to accept
the message. This is useful because spammers often make up
addresses at random. But as address verification becomes
more common, spammers can be expected to forge actual
addresses&mdash;all the more reason to use SPF.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Signature solutions:</b></span> PGP/GPG and S/MIME users sign their messages. Recipients
can check signature validity by downloading keys from a
key server. Other schemes have been proposed in which the
DNS itself acts as the repository for public keys. These
solutions are good because .forward files continue to work
without modification. They are bad, however, because a message has to cross
the pipe, costing bandwidth and CPU, before its legitimacy
can be determined. In any case, a domain that uses these
mechanisms still can use SPF to announce that any messages
without a signature should be rejected.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Challenge/response:</b></span>
you don't want to send challenges to spam, especially not
forged spam. If SPF tells you a sender address
definitely was forged, you can junk the message without
bothering to challenge it.
