Can we fix tradeshows? Our veteran showman suggests some open-source
solutions.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dbd580.0x1eb5348"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Put together the badges I've worn at tradeshows, and you'd have
enough to tile a wall. I've played about every role possible at
a show: panelist, attendee, exhibitor, keynote speaker, organizer,
booth builder, reporter and promoter. And I've been at it since
the Dawn of Disco.
</p><p>
What amazes me, after all these years, is how technologies have gone
through one revolution after another, while their tradeshows
hardly have changed at all. Take a time machine back to Comdex in
1984 and, aside from such wireless graces as cell phones and Wi-Fi,
it looks pretty much the same as the one we'll see this fall.
How come?
</p><p>
One reason is tradeshows are markets in the ancient and
literal sense of the word. They are the industrial equivalents of
the tents and stalls that gathered at crossroads and village plazas
back when trade began, long before the birth of currency and the
study of economics. For the industrial categories we call markets,
tradeshows provide a literal marketplace where buyers, sellers and
experts can gather to meet, do business and advance
agreements about what makes their category worthwhile. For a few
days every year the virtual market becomes a real one.
</p><p>
Today the term market applies to every category and subcategory, even to
specialties within specialties. Some tradeshows broadly support whole
industrial pies, while others serve various slices. The largest tradeshow in the world, CeBit in Germany, covers information technology and
telecommunications. I've never been to CeBit, but I have been to
Comdex&mdash;its domestic equivalent&mdash;a dozen times or more. Mostly, however, I
attend niche shows. In the last few years, in addition to Linux shows,
I've attended and often spoken at shows about identity management,
open source, emerging technologies, computing and communications
platforms, Macintosh and Mac OS X, Jabber, BSD, Apache, embedded technology,
interactivity, new products and technologies, computer product
distribution, blogging, peer-to-peer, activist politics, privacy and
security, technology impact on people, customer service, government
technology and electronic commerce&mdash;to name the shows I can
remember attending without looking at old calendars.
</p><p>
Although the subjects of these conferences differed widely, and although they
variously were called conferences, conventions, shows, events,
expos, workshops and -cons of various sorts, they generally held
to long-established tradeshow conventions. Let's look at those conventions:
</p><p>
First, tradeshows gather five types of people:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Exhibitors, including employees staffing booths.
</p></li><li><p>
Speakers, usually keynoters and panelists for breakout sessions.
</p></li><li><p>
Attendees, who visit vendors and listen to speakers.
</p></li><li><p>
Press and analysts, who report on vendors and speakers.
</p></li><li><p>
PR people, who help transmit vendor information to press and analysts.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Shows make money from both exhibitors and attendees. Exhibitors spend many
thousands of dollars for booth space, and attendees spend either a
small sum to visit exhibitors or a larger sum to attend keynotes and
breakout sessions.
</p><p>
Some shows, such as Pop!Tech (<a href="http://www.poptech.org" target="_self">www.poptech.org</a>), don't include
vendors. Others, such as Demo (<a href="http://www.demo.com" target="_self">www.demo.com</a>), showcase
only vendors' new products. But those shows are exceptions. On the whole, the
system I described above is pro forma.
</p><p>
Many tradeshow formalities are defaulted by their venues as
well. Hotels and convention centers exist in large measure to serve
tradeshows. Doing that requires highly formalized architectures and
ritualized procedures. Flexible meeting space, for example, is achieved
by partitioning larger rooms into smaller ones. Speakers are expected to
stand behind podiums, and panelists sit behind tables on stages at the
fronts of rooms. Projectors are provided for presentations or video
enlargements of the speakers and panelists.
</p><p>
These architectural and procedural defaults make two assumptions:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
What matters most is helping vendors sell stuff to customers.
</p></li><li><p>
In a similar way, knowledge flows top-down, from speakers
to audiences.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
Yet, thanks to the Net, markets today are more connected than ever and
less hierarchical. (&ldquo;Hyperlinks subvert hierarchy&rdquo;, David Weinberger
says.) Customers, along with everybody else, are educating themselves
and one another, directly. More market participants are in positions to
teach as well as learn. Large corporate players are no longer the
primary sources of wisdom about the markets they lead. Every market's
wisdom today is highly distributed and able to distribute itself any
way it pleases: e-mails, personal publications on-line, wikis, IM, IRC
and other forms of social computing, as well as through ad hoc
meetings in meat space.
</p><p>
So it's no surprise to hear that attrition now is
a problem in the tradeshow business and that the networked marketplace is a
part of the problem.
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Meetings &amp; Conventions</em></span>, in the January 2004 issue,
says:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
The instances of attendees circumventing traditional registration to
book through on-line third-party providers has avalanched, leaving
planners increasingly frustrated and making attrition a major issue
for associations.
</p><p>
In 2004, a number of hotels will team up with planners to fight the
problem on a united front. &ldquo;Hotel companies traditionally have
stayed on the sidelines and said, 'We are protected by a contract.
It's the customer's problem,'&rdquo; says Joel Pyser, vice president of
field sales for Bethesda, Maryland-based Marriott International Inc.
&ldquo;Well, we can't afford to do that any longer. No one enjoys
presenting a customer with an attrition bill. We have to partner
with them to solve it.&rdquo;
</p></blockquote></div><p>
In this case, notice, the customer is the company that puts on the
tradeshow, not the hotel guest who attends the tradeshow. That
individual is still a consumer:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Web surfing for the lowest rate has become a consumer sport. It also
is a major thorn for planners managing room blocks. The Alexandria,
Virginia-based International Society of Hospitality Consultants estimates
on-line bookings accounted for 30%&ndash;40% of all reservations
booked within a four-week arrival window in 2003&mdash;up 20 percent
over pre-9/11 numbers.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Of course, this top-down perspective will remain ingrained to the degree
that the bulk of income flows from large corporate customers. Still, it
seems to me that this whole industry could benefit from the same open-source value system and development methods that caused the growth of
Linux and the Net.
</p><p>
In that spirit, I'd like to share the best of what I've learned from the
best of the tradeshows I've attended over the last few years. Here goes:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Hold collegial meetings, not sessions. Some of the best sessions at
conferences are the BoFs, or birds-of-a-feather sessions, held after hours.
O'Reilly does an excellent job of aspiring to this format, even
in its standard sessions.
</p></li><li><p>
Insist on long Q&amp;A periods after lectures, with many working
microphones to pass around the audience.
</p></li><li><p>
Record all sessions and make them available on-line in open audio formats.
This also helps sell attendees on coming to the next
conference.
</p></li><li><p>
Use conversation-friendly venues. Pop!Tech is held in an old opera
house in downtown Camden, Maine. The feeling of the whole place is
cozy and comfortable, and somehow it helps make the audience more
involved with each talk.
</p></li><li><p>
Try forbidding vendor pitches. The first BloggerCon wasn't a vendor
venue. It was held at Harvard, in lecture rooms. But vendor pitches
still were discouraged, and it helped open conversation to topics that
transcended market economics.
</p></li><li><p>
Make the Web a living and permanent resource and document archive.
Here nobody beats O'Reilly's system, which includes the
company's own writers, as well as pointers to writing done by outsiders
covering or attending the event.
</p></li><li><p>
Provide wireless Net connections. It was at Esther Dyson's PC Forum
that I first witnessed a complete power shift from stage to audience,
thanks to Net-connected Wi-Fi. That was three years ago. Since then many
other events have added Wi-Fi, but the practice is far from standard. It
should be.
</p></li><li><p>
Start topical conversations in advance of the show. Jerry Michalski
pioneered this when he was involved in PC Forum, many years ago. Today
his retreats are meetings for a persistent community that stays in touch
by e-mail, wiki and other methods. Countless constructive new
conversations have been started and sustained by these off-conference
methods.
</p></li><li><p>
Hold hack-a-thons. Your event's name doesn't need to end in hack for
hack-a-thons to work. ApacheCon launches itself with a hack-a-thon
that's not to be missed, even if you're not a hacker. It begins the
event with a sense that <span   class="emphasis"><em>stuff can be done</em></span>.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
If you have any other ideas, send them here or to your friendly
conference planner. If we do this thing right, we might
revolutionize another industry.
