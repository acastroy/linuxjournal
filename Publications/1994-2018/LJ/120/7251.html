Audit trails are a network security requirement
for both Northrop Grumman and its customers. A small
modification to Samba enabled the company's sysadmins to
create the needed audit trails.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2991580.0x2a89298"></a></h2></div></div><p>
We at Northrop Grumman recently decided to replace the
Microsoft Windows 2000 server on one of our networks with a Linux server running
Samba. The primary motivations for replacing the
Windows server with Linux were:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Common user names and passwords for both Windows
and Linux users.
</p></li><li><p>
Export commonly shared directories and files
using NFS and Samba.
</p></li><li><p>
Allow software developers the freedom to choose
their development environment.
</p></li><li><p>
No additional licensing fees required for
Windows 2000 server and clients.
</p></li><li><p>
Centralized and cleaner audit trails.
</p></li><li><p>
A more secure computing environment.
</p></li><li><p>
Software upgrades can be scheduled when
necessary as opposed to being dictated by
outside software vendors.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
In addition to configuring Samba as a primary
domain controller, modifications were made to the
Samba source code to meet the security
requirements of our network. This article briefly
describes how to install and configure Samba and
then explains in detail how to modify Samba source code
to produce log entries required for audit trails.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2991580.0x2a89920"></a>
Audit Trail Requirements</h2></div></div><p>
Our networks must be configured to meet corporate
and customer requirements regarding security.
Among the various security requirements that must
be met, administrators need to have the ability to
audit activity on the network. The required
information gathered and logged for these audits
is referred to as an audit trail and include the
following information: successful logins, logouts,
failed logins and
password changes.
</p><p>
Most operating systems generate log files with
this information, but it may be scattered in a
number of different files and contain more
information than is necessary. We also
wanted to centralize this information so network
administrators do not have to examine the logs on
every computer on the network. Configured
properly, a Windows 2000 server logs the above
information for all machines connected to the
network, in addition to reporting a myriad of
extraneous information. This additional
information makes security audits longer, more
error-prone and also occupies a lot of disk
space when archived.
</p><p>
In order to use Linux and Samba as the primary
domain server for Windows 2000 clients,
Samba has to duplicate the logging
capabilities of the Windows 2000 server. Once
Samba was configured for the network, it seemed
the only way to meet the logging requirements was
to modify the Samba source code. An additional
benefit of modifying the source code was the
ability to have only the necessary information
recorded in the log files. The replacement of the
Windows 2000 server with Samba would not have been
possible had Samba been a closed-source, proprietary
product.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2991580.0x2a89ad8"></a>
Downloading and Configuring Samba</h2></div></div><p>
The Linux server initially arrived with Red Hat 8.0
and Samba already installed. The first step was to
download the tarred and compressed version of
Samba 2.2.8a from the Web site, <a href="http://www.samba.org" target="_self">www.samba.org</a>.
Once downloaded, Samba was installed by running the
following commands as root:

<pre     class="programlisting">
tar cvfz samba-2.2.8a.tar.gz
cd samba-2.2.8a/source
./configure
make
make install
</pre>
</p><p>
The Samba executables, smbd and nmbd, were
installed under the /usr/local/samba/bin directory.
The Red Hat installation had placed these
executables under the /sbin directory. Using the
newly created Samba executables requires changing
the Samba startup script /etc/init.d/samba. The
current Samba d&aelig;mons should be stopped first by
running the command <tt  >/etc/init.d/samba stop</tt>.
</p><p>
The /etc/init.d/samba file then is edited such that
the commands for starting smbd and nmbd are changed
from
<tt  >/sbin/smbd -D</tt> to
<tt  >/usr/local/samba/bin/smbd -D</tt>
and
<tt  >/sbin/nmbd -D</tt> to
<tt  >/usr/local/samba/bin/nmbd -D</tt>.
The new d&aelig;mons are then started with the command
<tt  >/etc/init.d/samba start</tt>.
</p><p>
Once the new d&aelig;mons are installed successfully,
Samba needs to be configured by setting parameters
in the smb.conf file. For the 2.2.8a distribution,
the default location of this file is /etc/samba.
The smb.conf file consists of sections denoted by
square brackets, and each section names a share or
service. The following example shows some of the
parameter values set under the global section to
create a Primary Domain Controller for Windows
clients:

<pre     class="programlisting">
[global]
netbios name = SambaServer
workgroup     =  NETDOMAIN
domain master = yes
local master = yes
preferred master =yes
os level =  65
</pre>
</p><p>
For authenticating users on the network, the
following parameters also need to be set under
the global section:

<pre     class="programlisting">
encrypt passwords = yes
security = user
domain logons = yes
</pre>
</p><p>
Finally, for Windows 2000 clients, the
domain admin group and add user script global
parameters need to be set as well:

<pre     class="programlisting">
domain admin group = root
add user script = /usr/sbin/useradd -d /dev/null \
                    -g 100 -s /bin/false -M %u
</pre>
</p><p>
Public and private shares for Window clients are
created by adding new sections.
</p><p>
Public:

<pre     class="programlisting">
[share]
path = /home/share
read only = no
browseable = yes
guest ok = no
create mode = 0770
comment = Shared Folder
hide dot files = yes
</pre>
</p><p>
Private:

<pre     class="programlisting">
[homes]
path = /home/%u
read only = no
browseable = no
guest ok = no
map archive = yes
create mode = 0750
comment = Home Directories
hide dot files = yes
</pre>
</p><p>
To verify that the parameters are correct in the
smb.conf file or to debug configuration problems,
use the testparm command. For debugging problems
with Samba in general, the log files log.smbd and
log.nmbd under the /var/log/samba directory are
invaluable. The parameter log level in the
global section of the smb.conf file determines the
amount of detailed information Samba writes to the
log files, with level 0 being the most general and
10 being the most detailed. Each logging level
contains the messages from that level, in addition
to the logging messages below it. For example, a
logging level of 5 contains messages from
level 5, plus those from levels 0 through 4.
</p><p>
Listing 1 is an example from the log.smbd file.
The first line in a typical entry in the log file
contains the date and time the event occurred, the
source file name, the function name and the line
number where the message was generated. The second
line contains the action that occurred, the domain
and client name and a short message describing the
logging event. Later in this article, we examine how these messages are generated in the
Samba source code.

Modifying Samba Source Code for Audit Trails</h2></div></div><p>
Once the network was configured and working
properly, the next step was to record the required
information for the audit trails in the log.smbd
file. Initially, this was attempted by setting
various logging levels in the smb.conf file,
restarting the Samba d&aelig;mons by executing
<tt  >/etc/init.d/samba restart</tt> and then analyzing the
output from the log files while performing various
tasks on a Windows 2000 client. Unfortunately,
regardless of the log level, none of the required
information was being logged. At this point, it
became obvious that modifications to the source
code were necessary to generate the log entries.
</p><p>
The Samba source code is in the
samba-2.2.8a/source directory and is the root
directory for the filename in the log messages.
The first entry in Listing 1 shows the file as
<tt  >smbd/server.c:main(791)</tt>. By examining line 791
in the samba-2.2.8a/source/smbd/server.c file,
you can see the DEBUG macro is used to generate
the log message. The syntax for the DEBUG macro
is:

<pre     class="programlisting">
DEBUG(log_level, "string", arguments);
</pre>
</p><p>
The format for the second and third arguments is
similar to the printf function. Examples of custom
DEBUG statements are shown in Listings 2 through 4.

452     return (chstat);

</pre></div><p>
Creating custom log messages requires inserting
DEBUG macros into the appropriate section of code
and filling in the correct parameters and messages.
Once the DEBUG statements are inserted, the Samba
executables need to be rebuilt by executing
<tt  >make install</tt> in the samba-2.2.a/source directory;
the d&aelig;mons are restarted with the command
<tt  >/etc/init.d/samba restart</tt>. Any new log messages
added to the Samba source files now should appear
in the log files.
</p><p>
Determining where DEBUG statements should be placed
in the code may require setting various log levels
in the smb.conf file. The output of the log files
can help narrow down which source files should be
examined for particular information. Using printf
statements also may help in determining which
variables should be logged and in formulating the
final log message. If you do plan on using printf
statements, smbd and nmbd should be executed
without the -D option by stopping the d&aelig;mons with
the command <tt  >/etc/init.d/samba stop</tt> and executing
<tt  >/usr/local/samba/bin/smbd</tt> and
<tt  >/usr/local/samba/bin/nmbd</tt> on the command line.
The printf statements then are directed toward
standard output and appear on the console.
</p><p>
Listings 2 through 4 show custom DEBUG statements
added to the Samba source code.
Listing 2 shows DEBUG statements added to the
source/rpc_server/srv_netlog_nt.c file for
reporting failed and successful network logons.
The first DEBUG statement reports when an unknown
user attempts to log on to the network, and the
second DEBUG statement records incorrect passwords.
An additional DEBUG statement was added for
installations of Samba using PAM. The final DEBUG
statement records a successful logon to the
network. By examining the log output from
Listing 1, you should see a direct correspondence
between each of the DEBUG statements and the
generated log entries.
</p><p>
Listing 3 shows a DEBUG statement added to the
source/smbd/service.c file to capture when a user
has logged off the system by checking when a share
to the user has been closed. Unfortunately, this
is an unreliable check because the user always
is dropping shares during the course of a session.
There also is a short delay between the time the
user logs off the network and when the dropped share is
recorded. Determining when a user has logged off
the network requires checking any logons to the
machine after the last user share was dropped or
checking whether the machine still is locked by the user.
</p><p>
Once Samba is logging the required information, you
may want to clean up the log file by removing
unnecessary entries. This can be accomplished
by setting the log level to 0 in required DEBUG
statements and setting the log level to 1 or higher
for other DEBUG statements. The log level
parameter in the smb.conf file then should be set
to 0. The logging features of Samba make it easy
to track down unwanted log entries by providing the
exact location of the DEBUG statement. Cleaning up
log.smbd makes the audits easier and less error-prone than a cluttered log file, such as the log
file generated by a Windows 2000 server.

Updating User Passwords</h2></div></div><p>
When updating passwords, system requirements state that
passwords must be at least eight characters long and
the password change must be logged.
In addition, we also
wanted the passwords to be synchronized between
Windows and Linux so users have common logins
for both systems.
</p><p>
For the first requirement, the define statement in
source/include/local.h, on line 175, was changed to
<tt  >#define MINPASSWDLENGTH 8</tt>.
To ensure this change is captured in all the
necessary source files, <tt  >make clean</tt> should be
executed in the source directory before executing
<tt  >make install</tt>.
</p><p>
The source code for verifying and updating password
changes is located in the file
source/smbd/chgpasswd.c. Listing 4 shows the DEBUG
statement that was added to the end of the
chat_with_program function to log when users
successfully change their passwords. In addition
to adding the capability to record successful
password changes, the failed password updates
also are logged. Failed password changes are recorded
because regardless of why the password
update failed, the following message always
is returned to the user:

<pre     class="programlisting">
The User name or old password is incorrect.
Letters in passwords must be typed using the
correct case. Make sure the Caps Lock is not
accidentally on.
</pre>
</p><p>
These log messages can help frustrated users
determine why they are unable to update
their passwords. However, access to these log
messages requires assistance from the
system administrator. Log entries 5 and 6 in
Listing 1 present two examples of user bill being
unable to change his password successfully.
</p><p>
To synchronize passwords between Samba and the Linux system passwords,
set the following fields in the smb.conf file under
the global section:

<pre     class="programlisting">
[global]
unix password sync = yes
pam password change = yes
passwd program = /usr/bin/passwd
passwd chat =*New*password* %n\n *new*password*
&#8618;%n\n *successfully*
</pre>
</p><p>
For most systems, the <tt  >passwd chat</tt> field does not
need to be set, because the default setting works
fine. If the passwd chat field does need to be
set, the syntax should follow the passwd
command's input and output closely. The syntax for
password chat is * for any character and %n for
the new password; spaces designate new lines, and
\n is used when user input is required.
For further help with debugging, set the log level
to 101 and the field <tt  >passwd chat debug</tt> to yes in
the global section of the smb.conf file. As a
last resort, printf and DEBUG statements can be
used in the function chat_with_program in the
chpasswd.c file to help debug the problem.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2991580.0x2d96788"></a>
Future Work</h2></div></div><p>
Some of the current problems mentioned above, such
as displaying a more meaningful error message when
users fail to update their passwords and a
more exact method of determining when users have
logged off the network, need to be addressed.
Additional features, such as user lockout after
five consecutive unsuccessful login attempts and
preventing the user from reusing the five
previous passwords, also should be added. Using
LDAP for both Linux and Windows clients is
worth investigating as well.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Samba provides a reasonable alternative to using Windows 2000 servers
on a network to manage Windows clients. The primary advantage of
Samba over Windows is the ability to modify the Samba source code
to create a system tailored for a specific computing need. It also
offers network administrators the ability to troubleshoot the network
at the source code level. None of this is possible when using
proprietary software, a huge drawback in configuring and debugging
services on a network. All of these factors add up to large cost
savings in both licensing fees and network administration time.
