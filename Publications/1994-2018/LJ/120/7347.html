Application Proxying with Zorp, Part II</i></h3></div><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Mick Bauer</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #120, April 2004</div></div><div><p>
The Zorp proxy server works with
the kernel Netfilter to make an application-level proxy that
looks transparent to the client.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x240c580.0x25042f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
In my last column, I sang the praises of application-layer proxy firewalls
and introduced Balazs Scheidler's Zorp firewall suite, available in
both commercial and free-of-charge versions. This column continues
where we left off, discussing basic Zorp configuration for a
simple inside-DMZ-outside scenario. We are going to configure only a couple
of services, but this should be enough to help prospective Zorp
users begin building their own intelligent firewall systems.
</p><p>
To review, application-layer proxies broker rather than merely
pass the traffic that flows through them. For example, when a
user on one network initiates an HTTP session on the other side
of a proxying firewall, the firewall intercepts and breaks the
connection, acting both as the server (from the client's viewpoint)
and as the client (from the destination server's standpoint).
</p><p>
Zorp uses transparent proxies, which means that users behind a
Zorp firewall need not be aware that the firewall is there; they
may target foreign addresses and hostnames without configuring
their software to communicate with the proxy. This is an important
mitigator against the ugly fact that proxies are inherently more
complicated than other kinds of firewalls. With Zorp, all the
complexity is in the back end, resulting in much happier end users.
</p><p>
But that doesn't mean Zorp is painful for its administrators,
either. I'd rate its complexity as being higher than iptables but
lower than sendmail.cf. So without further ado, let's configure
ourselves a Zorp firewall.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x240c580.0x2504500"></a>Assumptions</h2></div></div><p>
This article assumes that, per my last column, you've successfully
patched your Linux 2.4 kernel and your iptables binary to support the TPROXY module (see
<a href="http://www.balabit.com/products/oss/tproxy" target="_self">www.balabit.com/products/oss/tproxy</a>). It also assumes you have compiled
and/or installed packages for libzorpll, zorp and zorp-modules;
source code and deb packages are available at
<a href="http://www.balabit.com/products/zorp_gpl" target="_self">www.balabit.com/products/zorp_gpl</a>.
My examples further assume you're running Zorp GPL version
2.0, though the examples should apply equally to Zorp Pro 2.0. Zorp
Pro has some proxy modules not included with Zorp GPL, but the
modules common to both behave the same.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x240c580.0x25046b8"></a>
The Scenario</h2></div></div><p>
Zorp supports many more than three interfaces per firewall, but the
most common firewall architecture nowadays is the three-homed-host
architecture shown in Figure 1. This is the architecture I cover here.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7347f1.large.jpg"><img src="7347f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Example Architecture
</p></div></div><p>
Similarly, as you can see in Figure 1, we've got only three data flows:
HTTP from the Internet to a DMZed Web server; HTTP from the internal
network to the Internet; and HTTP and SSH from the internal network to
the DMZ. Absent are things like IMAP, NNTP, FTP and other services that
even simple setups commonly use. If you understand how to configure
Zorp to accommodate these, though, you should be able to figure out others.
I do, however, discuss DNS and SMTP, even though I omitted them from
Figure 1.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x240c580.0x25049d0"></a>
Configuring a Dummy Interface</h2></div></div><p>
The first thing we need to do doesn't directly involve Zorp but rather
the TPROXY kernel module. In transparent proxying, TPROXY needs a dummy
network interface to bind to whenever it splits a data flow in two. This
needs to be an
interface whose IP address is neither Internet-routable nor associated
with any network connected to the firewall.
</p><p>
Linux 2.4 kernels compile with support for dummy network interfaces by
default. You should have one, unless you intentionally compiled your
kernel without dummy driver support. If so, compile a new kernel
with dummy support. All you need to do for TPROXY's purposes,
therefore, is explicitly configure dummy0 with a nonroutable and unused
address. In Debian, you should add the following lines to
/etc/networking/interfaces:

<pre     class="programlisting">
auto dummy0
iface dummy0 inet static
      address 1.2.3.4
      netmask 255.255.255.255
</pre>
</p><p>
Other distributions handle network configuration differently&mdash;Red Hat and
SuSE use ifcfg- files in /etc/sysconfig/network&mdash;but hopefully you
get the picture. Notice the 32-bit network mask: I repeat, this address
must not belong to a real network.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x240c580.0x2504be0"></a>
iptables Configuration</h2></div></div><p>
You may be wondering, isn't this article about Zorp and not
iptables? Yes, but Zorp runs in conjunction with iptables, not in place
of it. TPROXY, in fact, is specifically a Netfilter patch. To use TPROXY,
we need to configure it with the iptables command, as we do for
the rest of Netfilter. (Netfilter is the proper name for Linux 2.4's
firewall code&mdash;iptables is its front-end command.)
</p><p>
In addition, it's recommended that you run certain services, namely DNS
and SMTP, on the firewall as self-contained proxies. If you do,
you need to use iptables to configure your firewall to accept those
connections directly. For example, BIND v9 supports split-horizon
DNS, in which external clients are served from different zone files than
are internal clients. Similarly, Postfix is easy to configure to act as
a relay on behalf of internal hosts, but strictly as a local deliverer
when dealing with external hosts. It makes sense to run such proxy-like
services on a firewall, as long as you configure them extremely carefully.
</p><p>
If you're new to Netfilter/iptables, what follows may make little
sense, and space doesn't permit me to explain it all in detail. Zorp is,
after all, an advanced tool. In a nutshell, what we're going to do with
iptables is
run all packets through some simple checks against spoofed IP addresses.
We then are going to intercept packets that need to be proxied
transparently and
process them in custom chains rather than by using the normal FORWARD
chain.
Technically, nothing is forwarded. Finally, we pass some packets that
are destined for the firewall itself.
</p><p>
Zorp Pro includes a group of scripts collectively called iptables-utils, which simplify
iptables management for Zorp. A free version of iptables-utils for Zorp GPL
2.0 is available at
<a href="http://www.balabit.com/downloads/zorp/zorp-os/pool/i/iptables-utils" target="_self">www.balabit.com/downloads/zorp/zorp-os/pool/i/iptables-utils</a>.
I highly recommend iptables-utils, as it makes it much easier to test
a new iptables configuration before actually committing it.
</p><p>
Because it
uses a syntax that I don't have space here to explain, the following
example is instead a conventional iptables startup script. Here are the
most important parts of such a script.
First should come rules for the special tproxy table that the TPROXY
module adds to Netfilter (Listing 1). This is where we define a custom
proxy chain for each of our networks: PRblue for proxied connections
initiated from our internal network; PRpurple for proxied connections
initiated from our DMZ (none, in this scenario); and PRred for proxied
connections originating from the Internet.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x240c580.0x2504ea0"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Listing 1. TPROXY Rules</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">

iptables -t tproxy -P PREROUTING ACCEPT
iptables -t tproxy -A PREROUTING -i eth1 -j PRblue
iptables -t tproxy -A PREROUTING -i eth2 -j PRpurple
iptables -t tproxy -A PREROUTING -i eth0 -j PRred

iptables -t tproxy -P OUTPUT ACCEPT

iptables -t tproxy -N PRblue
iptables -t tproxy -A PRblue -p tcp --dport 80 \
  -j TPROXY --on-port 50080
iptables -t tproxy -A PRblue -p tcp --dport 22 \
  ! -d firewall.example.net -j TPROXY --on-port 50022

iptables -t tproxy -N PRpurple

iptables -t tproxy -N PRred
iptables -t tproxy -A PRred -p tcp --dport 80 \
  -j TPROXY --on-port 50080

</pre></div><p>
Several things are worth pointing out in Listing 1. First, notice that the
tproxy table contains its own PREROUTING and OUTPUT output chains.
In Zorp, we use the tproxy/PREROUTING chain to route packets to the
proper custom proxy chain (PRblue), based on the interface each
packet enters. As with any custom iptables chain, if a packet passes
through one of these without matching a rule, it's sent back to the
line immediately following the rule that sent the packet to the custom
chain. This is why custom chains don't have default targets.
</p><p>
In the PRblue chain, we've got two rules, one for each type of transaction
allowed to originate from the internal network. All outbound
HTTP material is proxied, that is, handed to a proxy process listening on port
50080. But in the SSH rule, we tell Netfilter to proxy all outbound SSH
traffic unless it's destined for the firewall itself. Although Figure 1
doesn't show such a data flow (Blue&rarr;SSH&rarr;firewall), we need it in order
to administer the firewall. This flow also requires a rule in the regular
filter table's INPUT chain.
In this example scenario, our DMZed Web server
isn't permitted to initiate any connections itself, so we've
created a PRpurple chain without actually populating it.
</p><p>
Now we move on to the regular filter table, this is the Netfilter table
most of us are used to dealing with&mdash;it's the default when you omit
the -t option with iptables. Listing 2 shows our example firewall's
filter table's INPUT rules.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x240c580.0x25051b8"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Listing 2. Filter Table INPUT Chain</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">

iptables -A INPUT -i eth2 -j LOpurple
iptables -A INPUT -j LOG --log-prefix "INPUT DROP: "
iptables -A INPUT -j DROP

</pre></div><p>
The first few lines check packets against some custom chains
that check for spoofed IP addresses; if they pass those checks,
they continue down the INPUT chain. Packets generated by the
TPROXY module itself are accepted, as are packets belonging to
established allowed transactions and loopback packets (lines 4&ndash;6,
respectively). Next, as with the tproxy table's PREROUTING chain,
we route packets to custom chains based on ingress interface. This
time, the custom chains are for packets with local destinations, as opposed
to proxied ones, so I've named them LOblue and so forth.
Next come our filter table's custom chains (Listing 3).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x240c580.0x2505420"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Listing 3. Custom Chains in the Filter Table</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">

iptables -N spoofdrop
iptables -A spoofdrop -j LOG \
  --log-prefix "Spoofed packet: "
iptables -A spoofdrop -j DROP

</pre></div><p>
The first three of these custom chains are the most important: LOblue,
LOpurple and LOred tell Netfilter how to process packets destined
for the firewall itself, based on in which interface the packets arrive. In LOblue, we're accepting DNS queries, SSH connections and
SMTP connections. In LOpurple, we're accepting only DNS queries. And
in LOred, we're accepting DNS replies from our ISP's DNS server
(upstream.dns.server) and SMTP connections.
The last three of these custom chains are the simplest: noise filters
NETBIOS packets, those notorious clutterers of Linux firewall logs;
spoof filters for packets with obviously spoofed, that is, impossible,
source IP addresses; and spoofdrop logs and drops packets caught by
the spoof chain.
</p><p>
Listing 4 shows the remainder of our example iptables script,
an essentially empty FORWARD chain with a default DROP policy and
an empty OUTPUT chain with a default ACCEPT chain. Again, this is a
proxying firewall, so it won't forward anything. You may be uneasy with
the default ACCEPT policy for firewall-originated packets, but this is
both necessary and safe on a Zorp firewall.

Configuring Zorp's Instances</h2></div></div><p>
Finally, we come to actual Zorp configuration files. These are
stored in /etc/zorp, and the first one we tackle is instances.conf,
which defines and controls Zorp's instances. Usually, the rule of thumb is
to define one instance per network zone, so in our example scenario we
have, you guessed it, one instance each for our red, purple and blue
zones. Listing 5 shows what such an instances.conf file would look like.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x240c580.0x25059f8"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Listing 5. instances.conf</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">

blue -v3 -p /etc/zorp/policy.py \
  --autobind-ip 1.2.3.4
purple -v3 -p /etc/zorp/policy.py \
  --autobind-ip 1.2.3.4
red -v3 -p /etc/zorp/policy.py \
  --autobind-ip 1.2.3.4

</pre></div><p>
The first field in each line is the name of the instance. This is
user-definable, but we need to refer to it verbatim in the Zorp
configuration file proper, policy.py. Speaking of which, you may
use separate configuration files for each instance if you wish, or
you may configure multiple zones within a single file. Regardless,
the -p option in instances.conf tells Zorp which file to use for
each instance.
</p><p>
The -v parameter sets log message verbosity: 3 is the medium
setting, and 5 is useful for debugging. This parameter controls
only Zorp-generated log messages and has no effect whatsoever
on Netfilter/iptables logging. Finally, each line ends with an
--autobind-ip setting that determines to which dummy IP Zorp should
bind TPROXY when proxying connections. This IP address can and
should be shared between all instances. This address, obviously,
should be the one you set earlier (see Configuring a Dummy
Interface, above).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x240c580.0x2505cb8"></a>
Configuring Zorp's Application Proxies: policy.py</h2></div></div><p>
Your iptables script determines how packets get routed to proxies, and
/etc/zorp/instances.conf determines how Zorp starts up. But to tell Zorp's
proxies how to behave, you need to set up /etc/zorp/policy.py, or whatever
you called the configuration file(s) referenced in
instances.conf&mdash;policy.py is conventional but not mandatory.
This policy file contains two parts. The first part is a global section in which
zones are defined based on network addresses and allowed services. The
second part is
a service-instance definition section in which each instance listed in
instances.conf is defined based on which services originate in each
and in which those services are mapped to application proxies.
</p><p>
Listing 6 shows a complete global section from our example policy.py. It
begins with some import sections, in which essential Python functions
are included. Next come our zone definitions. If you set up instances.conf
to run one Zorp instance per zone, your zone names here can be similar
to or even the same as your instance names. In Listing 6 I've chosen
different names in order to illustrate that technically, zone names are
distinct from instance names.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x240c580.0x24fc6a8"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Listing 6. policy.py, Part I (Global Settings)</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">

InetZone("redzone", "0.0.0.0/0",
   outbound_services=["red_http"],
   inbound_services=["*"])

InetZone("localzone", "127.0.0.0/8",
   inbound_services=["*"])

# end global section

</pre></div><p>
In each zone definition, you can see a network address that corresponds
to those in Figure 1 and specifications of which services are
allowed. These service names are user-definable and fleshed out
in the subsequent service-instance definitions. The important thing
to understand about these statements is that inbound and outbound
is relative to the zone/network, not to the firewall.
</p><p>
Figure 2 shows what the internal-to-Internet HTTP data flow looks like
as a proxied connection. In this illustration, we see this data flow
exists both as an outbound connection out of the Internal (blue)
zone and an inbound connection to the Internet (red)
zone. This is borne out in the respective bluezone and redzone
definitions in Listing 6. It's also important to use the same
service name in both zone definitions that a given data flow traverses
(blue_http in the case of Figure 2 and Listing 6).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="7347f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. An HTTP Transaction Outbound from Blue, Inbound to Red
</p></div></div><p>
The last point to make about Listing 6 is the * wild card signifies
all defined services. This is narrower than it might seem; * includes
only those services defined in policy.py's service-instance definitions,
not all possible services. Remember, Zorp processes only those
packets that Netfilter and TPROXY send to it. If a given zone is
to allow no outbound or inbound services, the inbound_services
or outbound_services parameter may be either omitted or set to []
(empty brackets).
</p><p>
Listing 7 shows our policy.py file's service-instance definitions. The
first line of each definition must reference an instance name specified
in instances.conf, and the following lines in the definition must
be indented because these rules are processed by Python, which is
precise about indentation. The definition can't be empty: if no
services originate in a given instance, the token pass may be used, as with the purple() instance definition in Listing 7.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x240c580.0x24fcc28"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Listing 7. policy.py, Part II (Instance Definitions)</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">

             "red_http")

</pre></div><p>
Otherwise, the definition should consist of one or more Service lines,
specifying a service name referenced in one or more zone definitions, and a
Zorp proxy module, either a built-in proxy included in the global import
statements or defined in a custom class. The last field in a Service
line is a router, which specifies where proxied packets should be sent.
You can see in Listing 7 that for the red_http service, we've used the
forge_addr=TRUE option to pass the source IPs of Web clients intact from
the Internet to our Web server. Without this option, all Web traffic
hitting the DMZ appears to originate from the firewall itself.
</p><p>
Although in Listing 7 we're using only the HttpProxy and the PlugProxy (a
general-service UDP and TCP proxy that copies application data verbatim),
Zorp GPL also has proxies for FTP, whois, SSL, telnet and finger.
As I mentioned before, you also can create custom classes to alter
or augment these proxies. It's easy to create, for example, an HTTP
proxy that performs URL filtering or an SSL proxy stacked on an HTTP
proxy so HTTPS traffic can be proxied intelligently. Unfortunately,
these are advanced topics I can't cover here; fortunately, all of Zorp's
Python proxy modules are heavily commented.
</p><p>
The TransparentRouter referenced in Listing 7 simply proxies the
packets to the destination IP and port specified by the client.
But in the red instance's red_http service, we see that a
DirectedRouter, which requires a mandatory destination IP and
port, may be specified instead.
</p><p>
Each Service line in a service-instance definition must have
a corresponding Listener line. This line tells Zorp to which local
(firewall) IP address and port the service should be bound. It may seem
counterintuitive that the ports specified in Listing 7's Listener
statements are high ports: 50080 instead of 80 and 50022 instead of
22. But remember, each proxy receives its packets from the kernel
through Netfilter, not directly from clients. Accordingly, these
high ports must correspond to those specified in your tproxy table
Netfilter rules (Listing 1).
</p><p>
I mentioned that unlike HttpProxy, which is a fully application-aware proxy
that enforces all relevant Internet RFCs for proper HTTP behavior,
PlugProxy is a general-service proxy (GSP). Using PlugProxy still gives
better protection than does packet filtering on its own, because the very act of
proxying, even without application intelligence, insulates your systems
from low-level attacks that Netfilter may not catch on its own.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
And with that, we've scratched the dense surface of Zorp GPL. This is by
far the most complex tool I've covered in these pages, but I think you'll
find Zorp to be well worth the time you invest in learning how to use it.

The root download directory for ZorpOS contains
some tools that make using Zorp GPL much easier, including iptables-utils,
a TPROXY-enabled Linux kernel and iptables command. In fact, these are
the free parts of the Debian distribution included with
Zorp Pro, which is why everything in ZorpOS is in the form of
Debian packages. If you aren't a Debian user, everything you want
is in the subdirectories of pool; at the top of each
package's subdirectory are tar.gz files containing source code.
If you are a Debian user, you can use the URL as an apt-get
source: <a href="http://www.balabit.com/downloads/zorp/zorp-os" target="_self">www.balabit.com/downloads/zorp/zorp-os</a>.

The Zorp Users' Mailing List is an amazingly quick and easy way to
get help using Zorp, whether Pro or GPL. This URL is the site for
subscribing to it or browsing its archives. Note that Balabit is a
Hungarian company and its engineers (and some of the most
helpful Zorp users) operate in the CET (GMT+1) time zone: <a href="https://lists.balabit.hu/mailman/listinfo/zorp" target="_self">https://lists.balabit.hu/mailman/listinfo/zorp</a>.
