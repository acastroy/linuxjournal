No games to hack this time;
instead, I go back to basics and talk about how to build sophisticated
shell commands directly on the command line, along with various ways to use
subshells to increase your scripting efficiency.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17f2580.0x18ea358"></a></h2></div></div><p>
I've been so busy the past few months writing scripts, I've
rather wandered away from more rudimentary tutorial content. Let me try
to address that this month by talking about something I find I do
quite frequently: turn command-line invocations into short scripts, without
ever actually saving them as separate files.
</p><p>
This methodology is consistent with how I create more complicated shell
scripts too. I start by building up the key command interactively, then
eventually do something like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ !! &gt; new-script.sh
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17f2580.0x18ea5c0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
to get what I've built up as the starting point of my shell script.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17f2580.0x18ea6c8"></a>
Renaming Files</h2></div></div><p>
Let's start with a simple example. I find that I commonly apply rename
patterns to a set of files, often when it's something like a set of
images denoted with the .JPEG suffix, but because I prefer
lowercase, I'd like them changed to .jpg instead.
</p><p>
This is the perfect situation for a command-line for loop&mdash;something like:

<pre     class="programlisting">
for filename in *.JPEG
do
   commands
done
</pre>
</p><p>
That'll easily match all the relevant files, and then I can rename them one
by one.
</p><p>
Linux doesn't actually have a rename utility, however, so I'll need
to use mv instead, which can be a bit confusing. The wrinkle is this:
how do you take an existing filename and change it as desired? For that, I
use a subshell:

<pre     class="programlisting">
newname=$(echo $filename | sed 's/.JPEG/.jpg/')
</pre>
</p><p>
When I've talked in previous columns about how sed can
be your friend and how it's a command well worth exploring, now you can
see I wasn't just filling space. If I just wanted to fill space,
I'd turn in a column that read &ldquo;all work and no play makes Jack a
dull boy&rdquo;.
</p><p>
Now that the old name is &ldquo;filename&rdquo; and the new name is
&ldquo;newname&rdquo;, all that's left is actually to do the rename. This
is easily accomplished:

<pre     class="programlisting">
mv $filename $newname
</pre>
</p><p>
There's a bit of a gotcha if you encounter a filename with a
space in its name, however, so here's the entire script (with one
useful line added so you can see what's going on), as I'd type in
directly on the command line:

<pre     class="programlisting">
for filename in *.JPEG ; do
  newname="$(echo $filename | sed 's/.JPEG/.jpg/')"
  echo "Renaming $filename to $newname
  mv "$filename" "$newname"
done
</pre>
</p><p>
If you haven't tried entering a multi-line command directly to the
shell, you also might be surprised by how gracefully it handles it, as shown
here:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ for filename in *.JPEG
&gt;
</pre>
</p><p>
The &gt; denotes that you're in the middle of command entry&mdash;handy.
Just keep typing in lines until you're done, and as soon as
it's a syntactically correct command block, the shell will execute it
immediately, ending with its output and a new top-level prompt.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17f2580.0x18eada8"></a>
More Sophisticated Filename Selection</h2></div></div><p>
Let's say you want to do something similar, but instead of changing
filenames, you want to change the spelling of someone's name within a
subset of files. It turns out that Priscilla actually goes by
&ldquo;Pris&rdquo;.
Who knew?
</p><p>
There are a couple ways you can accomplish this task, including tapping
the powerhouse find command with its <tt  >-exec</tt> predicate,
but because this is a shell scripting column, let's look at how to expand
the for loop structure shown above.
</p><p>
The key difference is that in the &ldquo;for name in pattern&rdquo;
sequence, you
need to have pattern somehow reflect the result of a search of the contents
of a set of files, not just the filenames. That's done with
grep, but this time, you don't want to see the matching lines,
you just want the names of the matching files. That's what the
-l flag is for, as explained:

<pre     class="programlisting">
"-l     Only the names of files containing selected lines
                 are written to standard output."
</pre>
</p><p>
Sounds right. Here's how that might look as a command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ grep -l "Priscilla" *.txt
</pre>
</p><p>
The output would be a list of filenames.
</p><p>
How to get that into the for loop? You could use a temporary
output file, but that's a lot of work. Instead, just as I invoked a
subshell for the file rename (the &ldquo;$( )&rdquo; notation earlier),
sometimes you'll also see subshells written with backticks: `cmd`.
(Although I prefer $( ) notation myself.)
</p><p>
Putting it together:

<pre     class="programlisting">
for filename in $(grep -l "Priscilla" *.txt) ; do
</pre>
</p><p>
Fixing Priscilla's name in the files can be another job for
sed, although this time I would tap into a temporary filename and
do a quick switch:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sed "s/Priscilla/Pris/g" "$filename" &gt; $tempfile
mv "$tempfile" "$filename"
echo "Fixed Priscilla's name in $filename"
</pre>
</p><p>
See how that works?
</p><p>
The classic gotcha in this situation is file permissions. An unexpected
consequence of this rewrite is that the file not only has the pattern
replaced, it also potentially gains a new owner and new default file
permissions. If that's a potential problem, you'll need to grab the
owner and current permissions before the mv command, then use
chown and chmod to restore the file owner and
permission, respectively.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17f2580.0x18eb4e0"></a>
Performance Issues</h2></div></div><p>
Theoretically, launching lots of subshells could have a performance hit as
the Linux system has to do a lot more than just run individual commands as
it invokes additional shells, passes variables and so on. In practice, however,
I've found this sort of penalty to be negligible and think it's
safe to ignore. If a subshell or two is the right way to proceed, just go
for it.
</p><p>
That's not to say it's okay to be sloppy and write highly
inefficient code. My mantra is that the more you're going to use the
script, the smarter it is to spend the time to make it efficient and
bomb-proof. That is, in the earlier scripts, I've ignored any tests
for input validity, error conditions and meaningful output if there are no
matches and so on.
</p><p>
Those can be added easily, along with a usage section so that a month later
you remember exactly how the script works and what command flags you've
added over time. For example, I have a 250-line script I've been
building during the past year or two that lets me do lots of manipulation
with HTML image tags. Type in just its name, and the output is prolific:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ scale
Usage: scale {args} factor [file or files]
  -b      add 1px solid black border around image
  -c      add tags for a caption
  -C xx   use specified caption
  -f      use URL values for DaveOnFilm.com site
  -g      use URL values for GoFatherhood site
  -i      use URL values for intuitive.com/blog site
  -k KW   add keywords KW to the ALT tags
  -r      use 'align=right' instead of &lt;center&gt;
  -s      produces succinct dimensional tags only
  -w xx   warn if any images are more than the specified width
  factor  0.X for X% scaling or max width in pixels.
          A scaling factor of '1' produces 100%
</pre>
</p><p>
Because I often go months without needing the more obscure features, it's
extremely helpful and easily added to even the most simple of scripts.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
I've spent the last year writing shell scripts that address various
games. I hope you've found it useful for me to step back and talk about
some basic shell scripting methodology. If so, let me know!
