Use dangerous local-area networks without fear with OpenVPN.

For the past few months, I've been describing how to build a Virtual
Private Network (VPN) server using OpenVPN, a free, multiplatform,
TLS/SSL-based VPN d&aelig;mon. My example usage scenario involves the common
&ldquo;road
warrior&rdquo; setup where remote users connect back to a VPN server on their
&ldquo;home
network&rdquo; by establishing an encrypted VPN tunnel over the Internet.
</p><p>
Last month, in Part III, I finished a line-by-line walk-through of an example
OpenVPN server configuration file (server.ovpn) shown here for your
reference (Listing 1).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf78580.0x1070720"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>

I then talked about running OpenVPN as a server process (the same
executable can be run either as a d&aelig;mon/listener or as a client process),
either running in the foreground, with all log messages printed to the
console:

<pre     class="programlisting">
bash-$ sudo openvpn --config ./server.ovpn
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf78580.0x10709e0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
or in the background, with all log messages being written to
/var/log/daemon.log:


<pre     class="programlisting">
bash-$ sudo openvpn --daemon --config ./server.ovpn
</pre>
</p><p>
While in the early stages of getting OpenVPN working on both server and
clients, you'll definitely want to run the server d&aelig;mon in the foreground,
because you'll probably have to stop and restart it through configuration
tweaks anyhow. Once everything's working, you can put an init-script into
your server's /etc/init.d directory that starts OpenVPN in d&aelig;mon mode
automatically at startup time.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf78580.0x1070bf0"></a>
OpenVPN Client Configuration</h2></div></div><p>
This brings us to client configuration. Listing 2 shows a sample client
configuration file, client.ovpn. Let's dissect it!
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf78580.0x1070cf8"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>

</pre></div><p>
First is the <tt  >client</tt> directive. Like
<tt  >server</tt>, which we covered last
time, client is actually a helper directive that, when read by the
openvpn command, expands to two other directives: pull, which instructs
OpenVPN to accept options pushed to it by the OpenVPN server it connects
to, and tls-client, which enables TLS (SSL) encryption and tells OpenVPN
to assume the role of client any time it initiates a TLS transaction.
</p><p>
Next comes <tt  >proto udp</tt>, which tells OpenVPN to use UDP packets to build its
VPN tunnel. This setting needs to be the same as what's specified on the
server to which you wish to connect.
</p><p>
Next comes <tt  >dev tun</tt>, which tells OpenVPN to encapsulate IP packets via a
/dev/tun interface, rather than Ethernet frames via a /dev/tap device.
I'm sticking to IP encapsulation in my examples, and besides, this
setting has to be the same as on the server to which you wish to connect.
</p><p>
And, to which server do you wish to connect? The one specified in the
<tt  >remote</tt> directive, which has two parameters, IP address (or hostname) and
port. In Listing 2, these are set to 1.2.3.4 1194, specifically UDP port
1194. (If earlier I had set <tt  >proto</tt> to
<tt  >tcp-client</tt>, OpenVPN would assume
you mean TCP port 1194 here.)
</p><p>
The IP address of my example server is 1.2.3.4, which may strike you as
improbable, but this address is, at least, Internet-routable. If you're
going to connect to your OpenVPN server from across the Internet, you'll
need to target an Internet-routable IP address. In my home setup, this is
actually the address of my DSL router, which I've configured to redirect
UDP 1194 connections to the same port on my OpenVPN server, whose real IP
address is a non-Internet-routable 192.168.0.0 address.
</p><p>
After <tt  >remote</tt> comes <tt  >nobind</tt>, which tells OpenVPN to allow the local IP
stack (your Linux kernel's TCP/IP modules) to assign a local
port from which to send and receive OpenVPN packets dynamically, rather than have the
OpenVPN d&aelig;mon &ldquo;bind&rdquo; to (listen on) a specific port like a server process
would. This setting, therefore, is suitable only for VPN client systems.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf78580.0x1071488"></a>
Certificate/Key-Related Directives</h2></div></div><p>
Next, there are five directives related to helper files that OpenVPN will need
to read in order to build a tunnel. <tt  >ca</tt> specifies a file containing at
least one Certificate Authority certificate, specifically, the certificate
of whatever CA will have signed the OpenVPN's server certificate. If you
try to connect to a server whose server certificate was
<span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> signed by
a CA key/certificate specified here, your OpenVPN client process will
terminate the connection.
</p><p>
<tt  >cert</tt> specifies a file containing a client certificate for your OpenVPN
client process to present to the OpenVPN server. This certificate needs to
have been signed by a CA whose certificate resides in the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>server's</em></span>
ca file, or the server will reject connections from <span   class="emphasis"><em>you</em></span>.
</p><p>
In many if not most cases, the simplest way to handle these certificates is
to use the same CA to create and sign both server and client certificates.
In fact, if you remember Part II in this series
(<span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>, March 2010), I
<span   class="emphasis"><em>already</em></span> created a client certificate and key, right after
I created
the server credentials. 
</p><p>
Because this process is both important and simple, let's take a minute to
review it. I'm skipping the process of setting up and creating the Certificate
Authority itself, as that applies only to server setup (you should
do that only once, on the server). So, assuming you've got a working CA
set up on your OpenVPN server as described in Part II of this article, follow these
steps to use OpenVPN's pkitool script to create a new client certificate:
</p><p>
1) su to root:

<pre     class="programlisting">
bash-$ su
</pre>
</p><p>
2) Change your working directory to /etc/openvpn/2.0:

<pre     class="programlisting">
bash-# cd /etc/openvpn/2.0
</pre>
</p><p>
3) Declare some PKI-related environment variables stored in the file
vars:

<pre     class="programlisting">
bash-# source ./vars
</pre>
</p><p>
4) Create the new certificate:

<pre     class="programlisting">
bash-# ./pkitool --pass minion
</pre>
</p><p>
In step 4, the string <tt  >minion</tt> is the name (the
&ldquo;common name&rdquo;, in x.509
parlance) of the host or user whose certificate you're creating. After
issuing this command, you'll be prompted twice to type the certificate's
passphrase.
</p><p>
The output of this command takes the form of three files:
./keys/minion.csr, ./keys/minion.crt and ./keys/minion.key. Only the last
two are important for the purposes of this article: the new client certificate and
client key, respectively.
</p><p>
Of the helper files related to crypto that were created when you set up the
OpenVPN server, your client certificate and key are the only two unique to
the client; ca.crt and ta.key are used on the server and on all clients
that connect to it. Note also that although the client certificate
(minion.crt) contains no private data, the client key minion.key and
the TLS authentication key ta.key both should be kept secret through
local file permissions and by handling them carefully.
</p><p>
For example, you should never e-mail any client key or TA key in clear text
(note that using an https:// URL for Webmail access doesn't count as
message encryption). You should use S/MIME or PGP e-mail encryption if you
need to mail keys to users.
</p><p>
If you use a USB drive or other physical media to distribute keys, you
should either deliver it in person or use a trusted courier to deliver it,
and users should be instructed either to destroy or erase the media after
installing their keys, or keep the media under lock and key. Although having a
passphrase-protected client key <span   class="emphasis"><em>should</em></span> make it hard for an attacker
to use an intercepted key file, it's no guarantee! Under no circumstances
should you issue blank-passphrase client certificates for any VPN
scenario.
</p><p>
Speaking of the client key's passphrase, you also should take care in
how you transmit that passphrase to the key's user. Because it isn't good
policy for any system administrator to know users' passphrases in any
context, users may afterward want to change the key's passphrase. The
simplest way for users to do so is via the openssl command, like so:


<pre     class="programlisting">
bash-$ openssl rsa -in minion.key -out minion.key -aes192
</pre>
</p><p>
The user does <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> need to be root to do this, provided the proper
file permissions are set on minion.key (users should have read/write
access on their own keys). After entering this command, users will be
prompted for the key file's old passphrase and then twice for the new
passphrase.
</p><p>
Once users have copied the files ca.crt, client.crt, client.key
and ta.key over to their client system's /etc/openvpn/ directory, they 
should make sure they have the correct file permissions set. The two .crt
files should be world-readable, but only owner-writable (that is,
<tt  >-rw-r--r--</tt>). The two .key files, however, should be only
owner-readable/writable (that is, <tt  >-rw-------</tt>). 
</p><p>
All four files should be owned by root, assuming your users have root on
their own Linux systems. (Setting up OpenVPN for nonroot users and the
security challenges of doing so are beyond this article's scope.)
</p><p>
Now that you're clear on how to generate and manage client certificate/key
pairs, let's continue working our way down Listing 2. The
<tt  >ca</tt>, <tt  >cert</tt> and
<tt  >key</tt> directives specify the paths of your CA key file, client certificate
file and client key file, respectively. In Listing 2 the values for these
parameters are all just filenames, without their full paths specified. This
implies that those three files are in the same directory as the client
configuration file itself.
</p><p>
So, unlike on the server, where I left all the certificates and keys in
/etc/openvpn/2.0/keys and, therefore, specified a CA certificate path of
2.0/keys/ca.crt, on the client system, you can get by with simply
<tt  >ca.crt</tt>
if the file ca.crt, like the configuration file client.ovpn, is kept in the
directory /etc/openvpn/.
</p><p>
The <tt  >ns-cert-type server</tt> directive says what type of certificate your
client should accept. Because in this example I'm dealing with multiple
clients connecting back to a server, in Listing 2, it's set to
<tt  >server</tt>.
This will prevent some other client from impersonating the server in a
man-in-the-middle attack; the server's certificate, while signed by the
same CA as its clients, has attributes that identify it as a server
certificate, not another client certificate.
</p><p>
The last directive in the certificate/key-file portion of Listing 2 is
<tt  >tls-auth ta.key 1</tt>, which tells OpenVPN to use the file ta.key to add an
extra layer of authentication on your VPN tunnel by requiring all packets
in the TLS handshake phase at the beginning of each tunnel session to be
signed with the specified TLS Authentication key. After the name of the TLS
Authentication key (ta.key), specify a number telling in which
&ldquo;direction&rdquo; to use this file: &ldquo;0&rdquo; for the server and
&ldquo;1&rdquo; for clients.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf78580.0x146a910"></a>
Other Client Settings</h2></div></div><p>
Nearly all of the rest of the directives in Listing 2 are ones I already
covered in Parts II and III of this series when dissecting Listing 1, the
server configuration file. The client-side settings for those directives
are even the same as specified on the server.
</p><p>
In the case of <tt  >user nobody</tt> and <tt  >group
nogroup</tt>, which tell the openvpn
command to run with unprivileged user and group identities after
initialization, make sure the user account nobody and the
group nogroup exist on your client system. Because both typically exist on
most Linux systems, they probably do already. If not, you either can create them
or change the directives to point to some other, existing d&aelig;mon account
or group name. In no event should you change either to any user or group
name used for actual human-use login accounts!
</p><p>
The only other directive worth mentioning here is
<tt  >mute-replay-warnings</tt>,
which I didn't include in the server.ovpn file. Declaring this directive
(without any argument) tells OpenVPN not to log events associated with its
anti-packet-replay mechanism, which tends to trigger false alarms if you
connect to a wireless network. It won't turn off the actual anti-replay
protection; it just suppresses associated local log entries.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf78580.0x146ac28"></a>
Initiating a Tunnel</h2></div></div><p>
You've created a client configuration file and put it into your client
system's /etc/openvpn directory. You've copied over your CA certificate
file, client certificate and key files, and your TA key file. It's time to
connect to the server.
</p><p>
Assuming your client system is running Linux (specifically Ubuntu), and
assuming that, as in Listing 2, your client configuration file is called
client.ovpn, follow these steps the first time you connect to your
server:
</p><p>
1) Change your working directory to /etc/openvpn:

<pre     class="programlisting">
bash-$ cd /etc/openvpn
</pre>
</p><p>
2) Run OpenVPN like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
bash-$ sudo openvpn --config ./client.ovpn
</pre>
</p><p>
3) When prompted, enter your client key's passphrase.

<pre     class="programlisting">
Enter Private Key Password: Your passphrase here
</pre>
</p><p>
Note that in step 2 you started OpenVPN <span   class="emphasis"><em>without</em></span> the
<tt  >--daemon</tt>
directive, leaving it running in the foreground. If everything works
without a hitch, the next time you start OpenVPN, you can use <tt  >sudo
openvpn --daemon --config ./client.ovpn</tt>, in which case OpenVPN will run
silently after asking you for your client key passphrase. On my Ubuntu
client system, OpenVPN logs to the file /var/log/syslog when running in
d&aelig;mon mode.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf78580.0x146b0f8"></a>
Troubleshooting</h2></div></div><p>
Hopefully, at this point you've got a working VPN tunnel back to your
server. If you don't though, two different mistakes have caused the
majority of my own problems using OpenVPN.
</p><p>
First, your tunnel will fail if you fail to copy all necessary files into
/etc/openvpn: client configuration file, CA certificate, client
certificate, client key and TLS Authentication key. These files also
must have appropriate permissions set, and you must run the openvpn command with
the appropriate level of privilege (that is, root privilege).
</p><p>
Second, firewall rules on both server and clients must be either disabled
(left open) or reconfigured to allow OpenVPN traffic to pass. Telling you
how to write such rules easily could occupy half or more of an entire
article, especially if I were to cover the art of forcing certain
types of traffic to use the tunnel. Suffice it to say, for now, check
your iptables rules before you even bother running OpenVPN in server or
client mode.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf78580.0x146b2b0"></a>
Cross-Platform Notes</h2></div></div><p>
In writing this article, I tested both an Ubuntu client and a Windows XP
client. Getting the Windows XP client to connect properly was no more
difficult than on Ubuntu. It was a simple matter of placing the correct
files in the correct directory and tweaking my Windows firewall
configuration a little.
</p><p>
On Windows clients, the <tt  >user</tt> and
<tt  >group</tt> directives have no effect, as
OpenVPN's self-demotion feature is not supported in Windows. Other than
that, however, I found the Windows version of OpenVPN to work in a very
similar manner as the Linux version.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf78580.0x146b4c0"></a>
Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
And that, dear readers, is how you configure OpenVPN to allow yourself to
connect back to your home network from an untrusted remote site. This
process is, in practice, much easier than my taking four months to
describe it implies. Hopefully, my line-by-line dissections of the two
configuration files have given you a strong enough understanding of how
OpenVPN works for you to explore other usage scenarios.
</p><p>
I may devote one more column to this topic, because Virtual Private Networks
are such a powerful tool, and these four installments have covered only a
small subset of its potential. Regardless, I hope you've found this series
useful and that you have success in your own Virtual Private Linux
endeavors. Until next time, be safe!
