Web browser? We don't need no stinkin' Web browser for submitting

I know, there are a million shell scripts waiting to be written to help
administer your computer, run your server and fine-tune your back end, but
I'm obsessed with scripts that interact with on-line data, so that's
what I'm focusing on. My last column marked the end of our Twitterbot, a simple
script that listens and responds to Twitter queries. You can try it by sending an
&ldquo;@&rdquo; message from your Twitter account to @davesbot.
</p><p>
This month, I thought that given the issue's Entertainment theme, it'd be fun to
dig into another facet of shell scripts that interact with the Web by looking
at how to emulate a complex form. The form we'll emulate? Yahoo Movies
advanced search.
</p><p>
Start by checking out Figure 1 (it shows the form). You can see it live by
going to <a href="http://movies.yahoo.com/mv/advsearch" target="_self">movies.yahoo.com/mv/advsearch</a> too.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10740f1.large.jpg"><img src="10740f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Yahoo Movies Advanced Title Search
</p></div></div><p>
We can crack open the HTML and read through the source, but I think it's
more interesting to reverse-engineer it, because, like most search forms, this
one uses the GET method and, therefore, exposes all of its parameters
within the URL of the results page. For example, a search for the title
&ldquo;Strangelove&rdquo;, without any other tweaks,
produces the URL below. Normally, this URL would be all on one line,
but I've separated the URL and the parameters
onto multiple lines to make them a bit easier to see:

<pre     class="programlisting">

http://movies.yahoo.com/mv/search
      ?p=strangelove
      &amp;yr=all
      &amp;gen=all
      &amp;syn=
      &amp;syn_match=all
      &amp;type=feature
      &amp;adv=y

</pre>
</p><p>
The search engine itself is at the URL shown in the first
line of the listing above.
The rest of the lines are parameters sent to the search engine.
You can see that the search term is &ldquo;p&rdquo;
(&ldquo;p=strangelove&rdquo;). You can infer the other parameters by looking at the
form: yr = release decade, gen = genre, syn = synopsis keywords and so on.
</p><p>
Because there are so many possible values, however, we're going to have to
look at the source after all. For example, those genres? Here's how Yahoo
Movies breaks it down:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
act = Action/Adventure
</p></li><li><p>
ada = Adaptation
</p></li><li><p>
ani = Animation
</p></li><li><p>
... (lots of entries skipped for space)
</p></li><li><p>
tee = Teen
</p></li><li><p>
thr = Thriller
</p></li><li><p>
war = War
</p></li><li><p>
wes = Western
</p></li></ul></div><p>
It's quite a list, really!
</p><p>
The question is, can we turn a form of this nature into a simple interactive shell
script that will let users specify constraints on a search and pop open a Web
browser with the resultant search? Of course we can!
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23fb580.0x24f4220"></a>
Turning HTML into a Script</h2></div></div><p>
It would be cool to normalize the problem and come up with a general-purpose solution, some sort of parser that would take HTML form tags as input
and produce shell script segments as output. Uh, no thanks.
</p><p>
Instead, with a few hacks in vi (yeah, I don't use Emacs), I have
the following, as part of a usage() function:


<pre     class="programlisting">

usage()
{
cat &lt;&lt; EOF
USAGE: findmovie -g genre -k keywords -nrst title
Where
   -n   only match those that have news or features
   -r   only match those with reviews
   -s   only match those that have showtimes
   -t   only match those that have trailers

and genre can be one of:
  act (Action/Adventure), ada (Adaptation), ani (Animation),
  ...
  tee (Teen), thr (Thriller), war (War) or wes (Western).
EOF

}
</pre>
</p><p>
This makes life easy and pushes the trick of remembering the three-letter
abbreviation for the genre onto the user. Sneaky, eh? Now, to be fair, good
interface design would have me writing a more sophisticated script that lets
users enter a variety of abbreviations (or the full word) and converts them
into the proper Yahoo-approved abbreviation, but that's actually work, so
we'll skip that too, okay?
</p><p>
Now, note the actual usage I've created:

<pre     class="programlisting">
USAGE: findmovie -g genre -k keywords -nrst title
</pre>
</p><p>
This means there are a couple elements of the form that we are going to
ignore in the script, including which decade the film was released and some of
the more obscure conditional parameters. Still, it's enough to keep us
busy.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23fb580.0x24f4590"></a>
Parsing Parameters with getopts</h2></div></div><p>
I've talked about the splendid getopts within shell scripts
before, without which parsing the six parameters&mdash;two of which have arguments,
four of which don't&mdash;would be a huge hassle. Instead, this is
straightforward. Here are the first few lines to give you the idea:

<pre     class="programlisting">

while getopts "g:k:nrst" arg
do
  case "$arg" in
    g) params="${params:+$params&amp;}gen=$OPTARG" ;;

</pre>
</p><p>
There's a lot to talk about here, but we have covered getopts
before, and you can &lt;cough&gt; check the man page too, right? In a nutshell
though, a letter with a trailing colon means it has a required parameter, so
g and k have arguments (g:k:), while n, r, s and t do not (nrst).
</p><p>
The params expansion is a nifty little shell trick that's worth a special
mention too. The notation ${params:+$params } expands to the value of the
$params variable, plus a trailing space, if the variable already has a value.
Otherwise, it's the null string. The point? To avoid leading ampersands in
the URL that we're building.
</p><p>
Let's have a quick peek:

<pre     class="programlisting">

$ findmovie.sh -g war -k peace -r
finished. params = gen=war&amp;syn=peace&amp;revs=1

</pre>
</p><p>
As we'd hope, the params variable has been expanded to reflect the specific
values that the user has specified on the command line&mdash;in this case, War films
that have reviews and contain the word &ldquo;peace&rdquo; in the synopsis.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23fb580.0x24f4958"></a>
Building the Full URL</h2></div></div><p>
There's a hiccup waiting to bite us with the code in its current state
though. The problem is, what if the user specifies two words in the keywords
value field or, worse, does so in the title field (remember, the last word or
words are the title pattern, the core search for the Yahoo Movies system)?
</p><p>
The answer is that we need to convert spaces into symbols that are acceptable
by the http system. That's easily done, fortunately:

<pre     class="programlisting">
params="$(echo $params | sed 's/ /+/g')"
</pre>
</p><p>
It's not the most elegant solution, but it's certainly functional!
</p><p>
The bigger problem here is that Yahoo requires certain parameters actually be present to
do a search. Choose a genre on the Web interface and click
search, and you'll see that's not sufficient for it to proceed.
</p><p>
As a result, our base URL for searches is going to be a bit more complicated:

<pre     class="programlisting">

baseurl="http://movies.yahoo.com/mv/search"
baseurl="${baseurl}?yr=all&amp;syn_match=all&amp;"

</pre>
</p><p>
Try that, and you'll find it doesn't work. Why? Because there are
some hidden parameters that Yahoo has slipped into the form that are required
to send to the search program. Without them, it just stops.
</p><p>
In fact, here's the baseurl value we need:

<pre     class="programlisting">

baseurl="http://movies.yahoo.com/mv/search"
baseurl="${baseurl}?yr=all&amp;syn_match=all&amp;adv=y&amp;type=feature&amp;"

</pre>
</p><p>
Now, how do we put this all together? It's not so easy, because we still need to
grab whatever's on the end of the invocation (the title pattern),
then mask the spaces:

<pre     class="programlisting">
shift $(( $OPTIND - 1 ))
</pre>
</p><p>
Hang on, let me explain this line before we go further. OPTIND contains the
index into the positional parameters of the script, indicating the first
parameter that wasn't absorbed by the getopts processing. Unfortunately,
it's indexed from 1, and the options array is indexed starting at
zero. The result? We have to subtract one from the value to be able to get the
actual value with the $* notation:

<pre     class="programlisting">

params="$(echo $params | sed 's/ /+/g')"

pattern="$(echo $* | sed 's/ /+/g')"
echo URL: $baseurl${params}\&amp;p=$pattern

</pre>
</p><p>
Now, finally, armed with that, we can search for films that contain the
word &ldquo;love&rdquo; and have reviews:

<pre     class="programlisting">

$ findmovie.sh -r love

URL: ...BASEURL...revs=1&amp;p=love

</pre>
</p><p>
Type that in, and you'll find it works fine, showing 80 films where
&ldquo;love&rdquo; appears in the title and Yahoo Movies is aware of on-line reviews
of the films.
</p><p>
Most Linuxes and other flavors of UNIX have a way that you can launch a Web
browser from the command line, with the specified URL as its home. That's
what we'll do:

<pre     class="programlisting">

echo $baseurl${params}\&amp;p=$pattern
open -a safari "$baseurl${params}\&amp;p=$pattern"

</pre>
</p><p>
There are other things we can do now that we've converted the Yahoo
advanced search form into a shell script, but we'll leave those for next
month!
