See how Handbrake, a powerful and easy-to-use video conversion program, can
help you enjoy your favorite TV shows or films while at your computer,
whether you're at home or away from home.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc5d580.0xd552a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
As an animation and comic-book fan, I like to watch various TV shows
and movies featuring my favorite characters, ranging from the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Simpsons</em></span>
and <span   class="emphasis"><em>Superman</em></span> to <span   class="emphasis"><em>Looney Tunes</em></span> and
the <span   class="emphasis"><em>X-Men</em></span> films. Like most such fans,
I've also bought the various DVD releases of these shows. However, since
I'm not always at home, I also like watching TV programs and movies on
my laptop or Palm Pre smartphone. It's great to be able to watch films
while on vacation and other trips, or cartoons while commuting on the
bus to work. Instead of repurchasing digital download versions of these
programs, however, I find it's much cheaper (and easier, when factoring
in the lack of Linux-friendliness of some on-line digital video stores)
to convert my DVDs into more versatile, computer-ready video files. Doing
this gives me such advantages as being able to store my video collection
in an easily accessible format (without having to swap DVDs from my
bookshelves), being able to convert the files for playback on various
devices (such as my Pre or my old iPod), and keeping a backup of my DVD
collection. Although various video conversion programs are available
for Linux, the most user-friendly one I've found is Handbrake.
</p><p>
Handbrake, a cross-platform program (with versions available for Windows
and OS X along with Linux), comes in both a command-line version and a GUI
version for Linux. An open-source program, Handbrake offers the ability to
convert from unencrypted DVD video sources (including VIDEO_TS folders,
.VOB and .TS files, and .ISO images) and most multimedia files that
FFmpeg can handle, including AVI (.avi) and MPEG (.mpg) files. Output
formats include the Matroska (.mkv) and MP4 (.mp4) video containers;
H.264, MPEG-4 and Theora video codecs; and AAC, MP3 and Vorbis audio
codecs (along with AC3 passthrough).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc5d580.0xd55670"></a>
Installation</h2></div></div><p>
Installation of Handbrake itself is straightforward. If Handbrake
isn't offered in your system's package manager, the Handbrake Web site's
downloads section offers you the choice of installing either a command-line
version or a GUI version, for either 32-bit or 64-bit systems. For the
purpose of this article, I cover the GUI version, which keeps
with Handbrake's emphasis on user-friendliness. If the .deb or .rpm
files offered (geared toward Ubuntu and Fedora users, respectively)
aren't sufficient, another option is to download the source code and
compile Handbrake.
</p><p>
Note that Handbrake does not unencrypt encrypted DVDs on its
own, which includes most commercial DVDs available. Before installing
Handbrake, make sure the libdvdcss library is installed first.
The legality of converting DVD video for one's personal use
may vary by locality, so check with the proper authorities before proceeding.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc5d580.0xd557d0"></a>
From DVD to Laptop</h2></div></div><p>
To cover the basics of Handbrake, let's use it to convert to a more
laptop-friendly format DVD of the hit 2000 superhero film
<span   class="emphasis"><em>X-Men</em></span>
about Marvel Comics' classic mutant-powered superhero team. After
inserting the DVD into the computer (and launching Handbrake), select
the Source button (Figure 1).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10716f1.large.jpg"><img src="10716f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Handbrake's Default Interface, before Loading a DVD
</p></div></div><p>
If the DVD's directory isn't selected automatically, navigate to it;
afterward, select OK, and Handbrake will read the DVD's tracks. The
movie's available tracks will be displayed in the drop-down Title menu,
next to the Chapters beginning and ending boxes and an Angle box. The movie
itself generally will be the track with the longest time listed. Select
the movie's track, then under the File destination box, type what you want
to name the movie. If you don't want to convert all the chapters from
the original source (say, if you just want the opening title sequence
or a particular scene), type in the Chapters boxes the desired range of
chapters. The Angle box can be ignored by most users (including for our
purposes here), given its infrequent use on DVDs.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10716f2.large.jpg"><img src="10716f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Handbrake after Loading a DVD 
</p></div></div><p>
The next step is to decide whether you want to use Handbrake's presets
or your own customized settings. One of Handbrake's strengths is its
various presets, which allow you to choose a convenient high-quality
setting for various conversion purposes. Previous versions of Handbrake
offered myriad presets, but as shown in Figure 3, version 0.9.4 (the
most-recent version, at the time of this writing) has simplified the offerings
for convenience and now include Normal (the default) and High Profile
(high-quality) presets; presets for the iPod, the iPhone/iPod Touch
and the Apple TV; and several now deprecated legacy settings, aimed at
users of previous versions of Handbrake.
</p><p>
For my purposes (keeping the file to play on a laptop), I usually
select High Profile, a high-quality setting, though I've also found
the iPhone/iPod Touch preset helpful for making files specifically for
watching on my Pre, which uses the same video settings as the iPod Touch
and iPhone.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10716f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Handbrake's Presets
</p></div></div><p>
If you're fine with the presets settings as is, the next step is to select
Start, and Handbrake will begin converting the video. However, if you
want to convert multiple DVD tracks (say, the extras on a movie DVD
or all the episodes from a TV show DVD), select Add to Queue first to
add the current track, then select another track as previously described,
and click Add to Queue. Repeat until you've chosen all the desired tracks
from the DVD, then select Start.
</p><p>
If you're looking for finer control over the conversion settings,
you need to do more than just the above, of course. As shown in Figure
1, Handbrake offers several different tabbed panes to adjust various
settings. The panes include Picture (the default displayed in Figures
1 and 2), Video, Audio, Subtitles, H.264 and Chapters. Let's look at
what each pane offers.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc5d580.0xd56068"></a>
Picture</h2></div></div><p>
This is the default pane shown when Handbrake is launched. When the desired video
or DVD to convert from is loaded into Handbrake, a preview scene from
the video is displayed, along with information on the video's dimensions,
including cropping and scaling. Click on the Picture Settings button in
the top bar to adjust the final video's cropping and scaling
settings manually, as well as the detelecine settings (which are mostly used when
converting TV programs from DVD).
</p><p>
I generally leave the dimensions settings alone, along with keeping
decombing turned on when converting TV programs (and off when converting
movies, although turning it off isn't necessary).
</p><p>
The Picture Settings window also can play a brief preview of what the
final converted film will look like, based on the current settings.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc5d580.0xd56220"></a>
Video</h2></div></div><p>
From the Video pane, two drop-down menus offer settings for the video
codec and framerate. Video codec choices include H.264, MPEG-4 and
Theora. There's also an option to turn on two-pass encoding (a setting
that scans the video source twice to ensure a higher-quality result),
as well as radio buttons offering a choice of converting based on either
the bitrate, a specific targeted file size or a constant quality rate.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10716f4.large.jpg"><img src="10716f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Video Pane
</p></div></div><p>
I generally keep H.264 selected (Handbrake's default setting) and leave
the constant quality setting as is, unless I need a specific bitrate or
file size. If so, I also turn on two-pass encoding and select Turbo First
Pass, a setting that speeds up the rate of the first pass. If adjusting
the bitrate manually, I usually choose a figure between 1,000&ndash;1,500kbps
(though I lean toward the conservative side).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc5d580.0xd56538"></a>
Audio</h2></div></div><p>
In the Audio pane, depending on the video source or the preset chosen,
one or several audio tracks may be displayed. The number of tracks
may be added to or subtracted from using the + or - buttons shown.
This is useful if you want to include, for instance, the director's
commentary track from a movie or alternate languages (a potentially
popular feature for, say, Japanese anime fans).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10716f5.large.jpg"><img src="10716f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. Audio Pane
</p></div></div><p>
To adjust the tracks even further, drop-down menus are displayed:
Track, Codec, Bitrate, Sample Rate, Mix and a button for DRC (Dynamic
Range Compression). Track provides the option of choosing which audio
track(s) to encode, including foreign-language tracks or director's
commentary. Codec allows you to choose to which audio codec to encode
(depending on which video container is chosen): AAC, MP3, Ogg Vorbis or
AC3 (the default audio on a DVD). Bitrate and Sample Rates allow you to set
to which bitrate and sampling rates, respectively, to encode. Mix allows
you to select output mixes: mono, stereo, Dolby Surround, Dolby
Pro Logic II and 6-channel discrete. Finally, DRC allows (if activated)
you to adjust the limits of compressing the dynamic range of the audio output.
This setting would be used for audio with very loud or very quiet
portions by altering the resulting audio to increase the sound on very
soft portions and reducing the sound on very loud portions.
</p><p>
For the purposes of encoding my <span   class="emphasis"><em>X-Men</em></span> movie, I'd choose at least one
track (in English, the only language I fluently speak or read), encoded
to AAC with a bitrate of 160kbps, with a mix of either stereo (my very
basic audio setup at home consists of just a pair of speakers) or one
of the surround sound settings. I leave DRC and Sample Rate alone. If I
opt for a second track (say, to include a separate track for surround
sound if I ever upgrade my home audio setup), I'd choose AC3, which
would encode the audio as is from the video source. I also might decide
to include a third audio track for the director's commentary (so I can
hear Bryan Singer expand upon some of the film's plot points). Keep in
mind that adding extra audio tracks, depending on the settings, may make the
resulting file larger.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc5d580.0xd56900"></a>
Subtitles</h2></div></div><p>
The Subtitles pane allows you to include subtitles and closed
captions in the output file, either from the original video
source or from an external file. Although I very infrequently use closed
captioning (not having hearing difficulties and very rarely watching
non-English-language material), this option would be highly useful for
someone converting a subtitled video source.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10716f6.large.jpg"><img src="10716f6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. Subtitles Pane
</p></div></div><p>
The options in this pane include selecting one or more tracks (via the +
Subtitle, + Import SRT and - buttons), then choosing a language for
each track. Forced Only should be checked if you want the subtitles
displayed only when the video demands it (say, when a scene has someone
speaking a foreign language that must be translated and displayed
on-screen for plot purposes). For this option, choose Foreign Audio Search
from the track drop-down menu. Burned In usually will be
chosen automatically if it's a subtitle track, placing the subtitles on
the movie with no way of turning them off. Closed captioning, meanwhile,
doesn't use this feature, and it can be turned on or off in the resulting
file's video player. There's also the option of choosing which track is
the default (via the Default radio button). If you've chosen + Import
SRT, then a different set of options will be presented, allowing you to
choose which external file to use to import subtitles.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc5d580.0xd56c18"></a>
H.264</h2></div></div><p>
The H.264 pane allows Handbrake users to tweak various advanced x264
settings to their specifications. For the average user (such as myself),
this pane can be left alone. Those interested in the settings here can
consult the Handbrake Web site's user guide page, although as the page notes,
it (at the time of this writing) hasn't been updated yet for 0.9.4.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10716f7.large.jpg"><img src="10716f7.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 7. H.264 Pane
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc5d580.0x114f128"></a>
Chapters</h2></div></div><p>
The Chapters pane gives you the option of including chapter markers at the
same places the chapter breaks exist on the original DVD. To activate
this, select the Chapter Markers box. The length of each chapter is
displayed, as well as generic titles reading &ldquo;Chapter 1&rdquo;,
&ldquo;Chapter 2&rdquo;
and so forth. If you want to create specifically named chapter titles
(such as &ldquo;That cool scene where Magneto makes the guns hover&rdquo;
or &ldquo;Statue
of Liberty slugfest&rdquo;), click on the chapter title of choice and type a
new name.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10716f8.large.jpg"><img src="10716f8.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 8. Chapters Pane
</p></div></div><p>
For my usage, I keep the Chapter Markers box checked, although I usually
don't bother renaming the chapters.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc5d580.0x114f5a0"></a>
Customized Presets</h2></div></div><p>
After performing all the previous customizing steps, you might want to
save these settings for future reuse. To do this, click the Save button
shown in Figure 3 at the bottom of the Presets pane, and give the desired
settings a custom name in the box that appears. The new preset then
will appear in the Presets pane, ready to use for future video conversions.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc5d580.0x114f700"></a>
Length of DVD Video Conversion</h2></div></div><p>
After finishing all of the above, to begin conversion, click Start. For
my computer, an HP laptop with 4GB of RAM and a 2.1GHz Intel Core 2 Duo
T6500 processor, running Ubuntu 9.10 (64-bit), it took two hours and 43
minutes to convert the <span   class="emphasis"><em>X-Men</em></span> movie (which runs an hour and 44 minutes)
using the High Profile preset. The end result of all this, of course,
is that I now have a high-quality movie file that I can view (or use)
as I wish.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10716f9.large.jpg"><img src="10716f9.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
As you can see, Handbrake is a great program for those wishing to convert
their video media, particularly their DVDs, to a more versatile digital
format. Thanks to Handbrake, I've converted much of my DVD collection
for easy access and viewing on my laptop, allowing me to enjoy watching
Hugh Jackman (or Bugs Bunny) in action while away from my TV set or
away from my apartment entirely.
