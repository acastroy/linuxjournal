MythTV and XBMC can turn your Linux system into a video playback
device with all the options you've ever dreamed of.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a2a580.0x1b222a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The Linux desktop is a place to work and a place to play. People 
fortunate enough to have time to play have many distractions to amuse them. Audio
fun abounds with programs like Amarok and Rhythmbox. Video enthusiasts
will find a plethora of options, from standalone video players (like
MPlayer, Xine and VLC) to comprehensive multimedia environments (like Freevo
and Moovida). Being a video enthusiast, I find myself drawn to two of the
most popular open-source entertainment tools: MythTV and XBMC.
</p><p>
MythTV (<a href="http://www.mythtv.org" target="_self">www.mythtv.org</a>) is a full-featured digital video recorder built for the Linux
desktop yet perfectly suited to running as a home-theater system. It
includes support for live TV and recordings, video file and DVD playback,
photo galleries, music collections, weather forecasts, movie rentals via
Netflix and even home video surveillance.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10713f1.large.jpg"><img src="10713f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. MythTV can be run as a distributed system, with front and
back ends on different computers.
</p></div></div><p>
XBMC (<a href="http://xbmc.org" target="_self">xbmc.org</a>) is a media player that also supports DVD and video file playback,
music collections, photo galleries and weather forecasts. Unlike MythTV,
XBMC was not originally developed for the Linux desktop. Instead, it was
built to run on modified Xbox hardware, and later it was modified to be a
general-purpose media tool and ported to the Linux desktop. Because of this, some
of XBMC's
features are geared toward the use of Xbox features, such as running
games and dashboards. Even so, XBMC has evolved into an excellent desktop
Linux media player in its own right.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10713f2.large.jpg"><img src="10713f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. XBMC is a media player on steroids.
</p></div></div><p>
MythTV and XBMC are similar tools but have different designs and 
target audiences. This article doesn't attempt to compare them
side by side, apples to apples. Instead, the intention is to examine each
from a user perspective and discover what features have meaning to
different types of users. Because these applications are so feature-rich,
the primary focus here is limited to video services&mdash;playing movies and
watching TV. Although both systems have been designed to work well when
displayed on a TV, this article is written from the point of view of using
the applications on a desktop.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a2a580.0x1b229e0"></a>
Installation and Requirements</h2></div></div><p>
MythTV is a well established project and, as such, is easily installed on
most major Linux distributions using desktop package management tools.
Ready-made packages are available for Fedora/Red Hat/CentOS, Ubuntu,
Debian, OpenSUSE, Mandriva and Arch Linux. There also are live CD
distributions, such as MythBuntu, MythDora and LinHES (formerly KnoppMyth),
which allow you to run MythTV without installing it. Building from source is
possible, but it can be complex, and there are many prerequisites. Using
prepackaged versions is the preferred installation mechanism.
</p><p>
MythTV can be used without TV capture cards. The MythVideo plugin can be
used to view and manage video files that have been ripped from DVDs or
other sources. However, MythTV requires a supported TV capture card to
allow watching live TV. It currently does not provide direct support for
external TV sources, such as Hulu or Veoh.
</p><p>
MythTV back ends start automatically when installed from distribution
packages. To start front ends, use the <tt  >mythfrontend</tt>
command.
You can run other command-line tools, such as
<tt  >mythfilldatabase</tt>, although these often
run automatically once MythTV is configured.
</p><p>
XBMC is built specifically for the Ubuntu distribution, and packages 
are available from the Ubuntu repositories. Other Linux
distributions must build from source. Fortunately, doing so isn't hard, at
least for Fedora. As with MythTV, you need to install many prerequisite packages.
The XBMC Wiki provides copy-and-paste commands for installing them.
Some distributions may require setting some environment variables, but
building the package is the same for all listed distributions:

<pre     class="programlisting">
./bootstrap
./configure
make
make install
</pre>
</p><p>
To install to a program-specific directory, specify a prefix. A prefix
allows installation to a directory that can be removed easily later:

<pre     class="programlisting">
./configure --prefix=/opt/xbmc
</pre>
</p><p>
To start the program, run <tt  >bin/xbmc</tt> from the installation directory, such as
/opt/xbmc/bin/xbmc.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a2a580.0x1b22e58"></a>
Design Overview</h2></div></div><p>
MythTV is designed as a personal video recorder (PVR) application. It is a
network-based system with back ends used to acquire and serve TV and
other media to front ends that handle display and playback.
It supports a wide variety of hardware for both analog and video capture (Figure
3).
The core recording and playback system is extended with plugins that provide
additional features. The MythVideo plugin handles management and playback
of video files, such as DVD rips. MythTV is best known for its wide support
of TV tuner hardware and ability to play and record both analog and digital
TV.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10713f3.large.jpg"><img src="10713f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. MythTV back ends support both analog and digital (HDTV) video
capture cards.
</p></div></div><p>
MythTV's core focuses on watching and recording TV as well as
providing extensive program guide and scheduling support. Some plugins
extend this feature, such as the Archive plugin, which allows saving
recorded programs to DVDs or other files.
</p><p>
Because of XBMC's Xbox roots, it focuses
on being a multifunction media player, capable of many types of
media playback from local or remote sources. This focus also allows the development
team to emphasize the user experience. XBMC is best known for its well
designed and sophisticated user interface and skins (Figure 4).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10713f4.large.jpg"><img src="10713f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. XBMC skins are plentiful and impressive.
</p></div></div><p>
XBMC's core focuses on video playback, but it also is extensible
through the use of Python plugins. Currently, plugins are available that add
support for TV and movie guides, instant messaging and front ends to other
hardware like a TiVo. And, XBMC forms the basis of at least one commercial
venture, Boxee.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a2a580.0x1b23430"></a>
Video Management</h2></div></div><p>
Browsing and playback of video files, such as ripped DVDs, in MythTV is
handled by the MythVideo plugin. MythVideo manages video files under a
single configurable folder. Folders under the top-level folder can be
mountpoints for multiple hard drives. Each folder can have its own icon
(folder.png) that is displayed while browsing the collection (Figure 5). Videos can
be streamed from the back end or played by the front end from an NFS mount.
Over an 802.11g wireless connection, streamed files play with fewer
pauses/skips.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10713f5.large.jpg"><img src="10713f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. The MythVideo gallery view shows folder icons and is the easiest
way to browse a large video collection.
</p></div></div><p>
Using mountpoints under the top-level directory offers multiple options on
how to manage your hard drives. RAID configurations can be used to create
one large storage space. Alternatively, multiple drives can be used for
different genres.
</p><p>
Unlike MythVideo, XBMC is based entirely on the concept of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>sources</em></span>. A source can be a local hard drive or NFS mountpoint
or a remote server providing streamed data (Figure 6). XBMC supports multiple
streaming formats and actually can be used to connect to a MythTV back end
to watch TV and stream video.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10713f6.large.jpg"><img src="10713f6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. The movies source is an NFS drive, but the MythTV source is a network connection.
</p></div></div><p>
To add videos to a MythVideo collection, copy files to the
appropriate folder. MythVideo can play AVI, MPEG and even DVD ISO files
(including menus). To reduce disk usage, 7GB DVDs often are ripped to AVI
files, which can be as small 2GB without loss of quality. However,
ripping like this typically loses the DVD menu options and possibly
the subtitles. If you have the disk space, a DVD ISO copy is faster to create,
and you won't lose any DVD features.
</p><p>
Videos can be added to local or network sources for XBMC. However, XBMC
cannot stream MythTV movies. Instead, the MythTV movie folders must be
mounted via NFS on the XBMC system, and the local mountpoint added as a
video source to XBMC. Like MythTV, XBMC can play a large number of video
file formats.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a2a580.0x1b23ab8"></a>
Organization and Browsing</h2></div></div><p>
MythTV provides three methods for video collection browsing. The first is
Browse mode, and it allows you to browse the entire collection front to back.
The page up and down keys make jumping through the list easy enough, although this
method doesn't remember your last location. The second method is List mode,
and it uses a tree listing to display entries. This listing benefits from a
well structured hierarchy under the top-level video directory. Gallery
mode is the last mode, and it uses icons for folders and movie posters for
individual entries. This is visually appealing and also benefits from a
well structured hierarchy for the video collection, although the number of
entries in each folder displayed over the icons is rather distracting (Figure 7).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10713f7.large.jpg"><img src="10713f7.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 7. MythTV can browse sequentially or through a hierarchy.
</p></div></div><p>
You can give custom icons to folders in MythTV by creating a JPEG or PNG image
in each directory. The size doesn't matter, although making them large enough
to be displayed in high quality on the front end with the highest
resolution may offer the best overall results. MythTV scales the image
as appropriate.
</p><p>
XBMC approaches video organization a little differently. First, it provides
two browsing modes: file and library. File browsing starts by showing
the available configured sources. Choosing one of those then presents a
listing of options relevant to that source. For example, if one source is
a set of videos on a local hard drive and another is a remote MythTV
back end, the former lists the movies in a typical tree hierarchy and
the latter shows features available from the server, such as live TV or
recordings.
</p><p>
In file mode, the listings are similar in structure to a directory listing.
The typical &ldquo;..&rdquo; parent directory lets you back up through the hierarchy.
Library mode allows you to browse only recordings. It won't show sources.
Instead, it shows you the list of scanned recordings. Moving up through the
hierarchy typically involves selecting an up-arrow icon (Figure 8).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10713f8.large.jpg"><img src="10713f8.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 8. XBMC's Library mode displays scanned recordings, but File mode can
access any remote source.
</p></div></div><p>
Like MythTV, folders under XBMC can have custom icons. Place a folder.jpg
file in each directory that requires a custom icon, and it will be displayed
in either mode. If you share the directories between MythTV and XBMC, 
using JPEG will mean only one icon is needed. However, JPEG images don't
support transparency, which means converting a PNG folder icon with
transparency from MythTV to a JPEG for XBMC will lose the transparent
effect (Figure 9).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10713f9.large.jpg"><img src="10713f9.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 9. Transparent PNG folder icons are supported by MythTV, while XBMC
uses JPEG format icons.
</p></div></div><p>
In either mode, the listings can have multiple views. Library mode offers
List, Full List and Thumbnail views. File mode adds Wide Icons and DVD
Thumbs.
</p><p>
Both applications allow browsing by genre. Genre information is set
automatically when metadata is retrieved for a video. Both systems can
stack files. Stacking associates multipart movie files as a single movie.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a2a580.0x1f1c5a0"></a>
Metadata Editing</h2></div></div><p>
Information about videos is known as metadata. The metadata includes movie
title, runtime, cast, synopsis and a variety of items similar to what is
found on IMDB.com or TheMovieDatabase.org. Both applications can
retrieve metadata automatically when new files are added to folders, and both
allow you to edit this metadata while browsing the collection (Figure 10). XBMC offers
multiple configurable sources for metadata on a per-folder basis. MythTV's
metadata sources are dependent on configurable scripts, but only one
script can be configured, and it applies to all files.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10713f10.large.jpg"><img src="10713f10.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 10. MythTV (left) can edit individual movies. XBMC (right) works
only on folders of movies.
</p></div></div><p>
XBMC sets metadata via the context menu. Right-click on any folder to get
the menu, and then select Set Content. Choose a source for the metadata, and
then run an automated scan. XBMC will let you add a movie that is
not found manually, but once you've done this, there is no easy way to remove the
entry if it's wrong. In MythVideo, pressing I over a movie in any browse
mode will bring up a context menu. From there, you can edit the metadata
data, reset it, play the movie or just view more details about the movie.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a2a580.0x1f1c8b8"></a>
Video Playback</h2></div></div><p>
Once you're past the setup and management, you finally can play your
videos. And, this is where the two systems shine. Both offer high-quality
playback of files in AVI, MPEG4 and even ISO formats. ISO offers the best
viewing, because all of the DVD features are available, including menus and
subtitles. Of course, both programs also will play a DVD directly from a
local DVD drive. MythVideo plays videos with no embellishments&mdash;the full
window is the video. XBMC actually can wrap its menus around a playing
video and will play a video in a small window while the user browses other
features (Figure 12). XBMC also offers the usual media controls on-screen. MythTV uses
an on-screen menu, but media controls are supported by keyboard keys without
the aid of on-screen controls (Figure 11).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10713f11.large.jpg"><img src="10713f11.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

control while playing.

</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a2a580.0x1f1cd30"></a>
TV Guide, Playback and Recordings</h2></div></div><p>
From the user perspective, TV playback under both systems is very similar to
video playback. XBMC places TV as another source under its Video feature.
MythTV separates videos from TV, although TV recordings still are under the TV
function. The main difference between MythTV and XBMC is the way the guide
is displayed. MythTV has a built-in guide that is updated by a back-end
server (Figure 13). The guide is accessed from the OSD menu while watching live
TV or when scheduling a recording.
</p><p>
MythTV can record live TV from any configured hardware. The more TV tuners
installed on the back ends, the more sources for recordings. When one tuner
is busy recording, another can be used to watch live TV. You can schedule recordings 
using any of the numerous guide search mechanisms, and you can start recordings 
while watching a show. You also can view recordings even
while it is still recording, as long as some recorded data is available.
Recordings are given priorities so that if they conflict and not enough
video sources are available, the higher priority gets access to the
device.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10713f13.large.jpg"><img src="10713f13.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 13. The MythTV guide is color-coded by genre.
</p></div></div><p>
There is only one way to watch recordings, and MythTV uses a tree structure for
finding the recordings. Migrating recordings from MythTV's TV feature to MythVideo
requires archiving them first via MythArchive. This is not particularly
user-friendly, so keep your expectations low for hanging onto recordings.
</p><p>
XBMC uses a MythTV back end to show live TV. It also uses MythTV's guide
information. However, it shows the guide information using the same view
types as videos in File mode. XBMC, however, cannot record data. It can
play only live TV or view existing video files. It cannot create new video
files from live TV.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a2a580.0x1f1d0f8"></a>
Appearance and Intangibles</h2></div></div><p>
Both systems support the VDPAU extensions for NVIDIA, which provides high-quality
playback. Because both support OpenGL, they also provide video
controls, such as brightness, contrast and color controls (Figure 14). The actual
features available under MythTV depend on various configuration options for
both video and TV features. XBMC always has the same options available
from any video playback, be it video files or live TV. These controls were
available for an NVIDIA-based display. Other video hardware may present
different options.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10713f14.large.jpg"><img src="10713f14.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 14. Video controls are available in both programs.
</p></div></div><p>
MythTV uses upfront configuration of window sizes and doesn't allow scaling
the display while you watch. This isn't a problem once you're set up to
display on a real TV, but if you watch on a desktop while you work, it's more
of an issue. XBMC can display full screen, as does MythTV, but it also allows
playing in a window that can be scaled while video is playing.
</p><p>
Neither system will stream Internet video, so you can't get to Hulu or Veoh
from them. There are hacks for doing this, but they mostly just launch the
Hulu player as an external application.
</p><p>
Both systems are fairly stable. XBMC crashed a few times during my research,
and I experienced a few lockups, although the latter may have been due to some
interaction with the MythTV back end. MythTV crashes are very seldom. During
my research, it crashed once while experimenting with the use of subtitles while
playing a DVD ISO file.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a2a580.0x1f1d4c0"></a>
Summary</h2></div></div><p>
The XBMC experience with its polished skins is very entertaining. But,
without a TV source, you still need a MythTV back end to watch TV. If
you watch TV while you work, using XBMC as a TV front end to a MythTV
back end is ideal, because you can scale the XBMC window interactively.
MythTV may be your only choice if you need to watch, schedule and record
multiple sources at once.
</p><p>
Both tools do an admirable job with video file collections. MythTV
provides more flexibility in setting metadata on a per-movie basis, while
XBMC has attractive browsing options and supports more metadata sources.
But, don't expect to play Blu-ray disks any time soon with either tool. For
one thing, they produce huge files (50GB typically), if you can rip them at all.
</p><p>
This is far from a comprehensive review of MythTV and XBMC. Both offer far
more features and capabilities than can be given justice in a single
article, especially if your goal is to hook them up to a real TV and use
them as home-theater systems. If you enjoy using your Linux system for
media playback, you owe it to yourself to investigate both of these
excellent applications.
