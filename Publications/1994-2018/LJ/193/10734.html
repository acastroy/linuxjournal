<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #193, May 2010</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Last year, I wrote about <span   class="bold"><b>Mathieu Desnoyers</b></span>'
efforts to re-license some
<span   class="bold"><b>userspace read/copy/update</b></span> (RCU) code from the
<span   class="bold"><b>GPL</b></span> to the <span   class="bold"><b>LGPL</b></span>. At
the time, Mathieu was going through the laborious process of getting
permission from all the contributors, but <span   class="bold"><b>IBM</b></span> held a patent on some of
the ideas in the code and had licensed the patent only for use in GPL
software. Subsequently, Mathieu wrote to me to give an update on the
situation. Apparently, IBM graciously extended its patent license
to include the LGPL. And, regarding the remaining kernel contributors,
such as <span   class="bold"><b>Ingo Molnar</b></span>, who didn't want to release their code under the
LGPL, Mathieu was able either to redo the work of those contributions
himself or to piece together those bits successfully into a separate
GPL-only file, while the lion's share of the code now also could be
released as LGPL and the headers under a <span   class="bold"><b>BSD</b></span>-style license.
</p><p>
This is one of the few cases of a relatively large number of
contributors being sought out and asked permission to re-license their
code. As you can see, Mathieu had to resort to some workarounds in a
couple cases, such as redoing a contributor's work himself, and his
experience may pave the way for other re-licensing efforts. I know
several folks have expressed an interest in re-licensing the entire
Linux kernel under the <span   class="bold"><b>Open Software License</b></span>,
and <span   class="bold"><b>Linus Torvalds</b></span> has
said he might prefer that license over the GPL v2 if he had the
choice. But, the Linux kernel is most likely way too big ever
to get permission from enough contributors to re-license.
</p><p>
By the way, anyone who wants to correct or augment anything I say here
each month is welcome to contact me at <a href="mailto:zacharyb@gmail.com">zacharyb@gmail.com</a>, as Mathieu
did with his update.
</p><p>
A recent effort to enable <span   class="bold"><b>devtmpfs</b></span> by default on all kernel compiles
has met with some opposition. <span   class="bold"><b>Kay Sievers</b></span> pointed out that all major
distributions include it in their upcoming releases. Although that
may be true, <span   class="bold"><b>Alan Cox</b></span> noted that the current releases of
those same distributions&mdash;that is, the releases in use by nearly
everyone&mdash;don't include it. At the very least though, it does seem that
devtmpfs no longer will be marked &ldquo;experimental&rdquo;. It's a bona fide
feature, at this point, and probably in the relatively near future
when the standard distributions really do ship with it, the kernel
folks will enable it by default, as Kay recommends.
</p><p>
The list of stable trees that will continue to be supported is being
updated. <span   class="bold"><b>Greg Kroah-Hartman</b></span> announced that the
<span   class="bold"><b>2.6.27-stable tree</b></span> will
be actively maintained by him until sometime around the middle of
2010. At that point, it's expected that <span   class="bold"><b>Willy
Tarreau</b></span> will take it over
from him, but through that time, patches will be fewer and fewer.
Instead, Greg said that the <span   class="bold"><b>2.6.32-stable tree</b></span> will be the next long-term
stable tree, and he expects to maintain it for another two or three years.
One of the primary reasons for keeping this kernel alive is that the
major distributions went with that version, so it made sense to
provide the distribution maintainers with clean upgrade paths. But,
Greg also made it clear that this would have to be a two-way street&mdash;he'd maintain the 2.6.32-stable kernel just as long as the
distribution maintainers kept feeding him fixes. There's no need to wait until
2.6.27 is put to bed either. As Willy said, everyone should feel free
to start sending in fixes for the 2.6.32 tree right away.

<h2 class="title">Listening on the Command Line</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Joey Bernard</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #193, May 2010</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Linux has tons of programs for listening to
audio, including Totem, Rhythmbox, MPlayer and VLC.
Each of those examples run in an
X11 environment. What if you want to listen to
music on the command line? Well, let's take a look. Before we
do though, note that this article assumes you
have a working audio subsystem on your machine.
</p><p>
Most distributions now use PulseAudio as the audio server, which provides
a standard wrapper around the actual audio hardware. This way, software
simply needs to talk to the PulseAudio server and doesn't need to worry
about the messy details of how to talk to each soundcard out there. The
PulseAudio system also includes utilities you can use on the command
line. To simply play an audio file, do this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
paplay --volume=32768 example.mp3
</pre>
</p><p>
This plays the audio file example.mp3 at 50% volume (volume is set
between 0 and 65536, or it can be silent or 100%). The paplay utility can play
any audio format supported by the libsndfile library, so you should be
able to play most audio files you encounter. If you don't have any
audio files, use the included parec utility. This
program grabs raw audio data from your audio card's input and dumps
it to standard output; you can pipe this off to a file to save for
later. To play back this raw data, use the included
pacat utility. It takes raw audio data and dumps it out to the audio
card's output speaker.
</p><p>
What if you want to listen to a whole list of audio files?
Several choices are available for handling entire playlists
from the command line, such as cplay and moc. Both
programs give you a file list on startup, and from there, you can
play individual files or construct playlists. Both programs use shortcut keys
to create, edit and otherwise manage your playlists.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10734blastf1.large.jpg"><img src="10734blastf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
cplay
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10734blastf2.large.jpg"><img src="10734blastf2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
moc
</p></div></div><p>
You also can make your computer talk to you from the command line.
Several utilities
can give your computer a voice, including Recite, Festival
and eSpeak. The simplest is Recite. It takes text from standard input
and outputs audio to the speakers. There aren't many options available. To
make a text file speak, execute:

<pre     class="programlisting">

recite &lt;example.txt

</pre>
</p><p>
You also simply can execute <tt  >recite</tt>, then start typing. Remember that
Recite won't see the end of your typing until you press Ctrl-D to mark the
end of input. Then, it speaks the entire text you just typed. 
</p><p>
Festival provides more options. To get a basic output
of text to audio, execute:

<pre     class="programlisting">
festival --tts example.txt
</pre>
</p><p>
You also can use other languages. The default is
English, but for Spanish, Russian or Welsh, use the
command-line option <tt  >--language &lt;string&gt;</tt>. Festival also
uses Scheme as a scripting language, which opens it up to a huge amount
of modification. Spend some time reading the manual at
<a href="http://www.cstr.ac.uk/projects/festival/manual" target="_self">www.cstr.ac.uk/projects/festival/manual</a> for more
information.
</p><p>
The last utility is eSpeak, which has several other available command-line
options. You can set the amplitude with <tt  >-a &lt;integer&gt;</tt>
(0&ndash;20;
the default is 10), the pitch with <tt  >-p &lt;integer&gt;</tt>
(0&ndash;99; the default is 50)
and speed with <tt  >-s &lt;integer&gt;</tt> (in words per minute; the default is 160). 
Several voices are available; find out which ones are installed
on your system by using the option <tt  >--voices</tt>. Once you
select one, use the option <tt  >-v
&lt;voicename&gt;</tt> to use it. 
Then, dump it out to a .wav file with the <tt  >-w
&lt;wave file name&gt;</tt> option. A full command line looks like this:


<pre     class="programlisting">
espeak -v en-scottish -w example.wav -f example.txt
</pre>
</p><p>
You can play it with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
paplay example.wav
</pre>
</p><p>
Now your computer will speak in a Scottish accent, sort of. Speech
synthesis still isn't perfect.
</p><p>
Now that you have all these audio files, you may want
to do some processing on them, and sox is a useful tool for doing just
that. One utility included in the package is called soxi. It gives you
file information about your audio files. In its most basic form, you
can use sox to change the file format of an audio file simply by running:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sox example.wav example.au
</pre>
</p><p>
sox uses file extensions to figure out that you are
intending to convert the file example.wav (in wav format) to example.au
(in the Sun AU format). You also can do processing on the audio through
command-line options. Set the number of bits per sample with
<tt  >-b &lt;bits&gt;</tt>. Set the number of channels with
<tt  >-c &lt;channels&gt;</tt>. Setting it to mono would be <tt  >-c
1</tt>, and stereo
would be <tt  >-c 2</tt>. You can set the sample rate, in Hertz,
with <tt  >-r
&lt;rate&gt;</tt>. Additionally, many options apply filters to audio
files. Read the manual page for more information on
sox. Here's an example command line:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sox example.wav -b 8 -c 1 -r 8000 example.au
</pre>
</p><p>
The above takes an input file called example.wav and converts
it to 8 bits per sample, mono (or 1 channel), with a sample rate of 8,000Hz and writes it out to a file with an AU format. 
</p><p>
The sox package also
contains two other utilities, play and rec, which provide another
way of playing audio files and recording audio to a file. sox also provides
the full spectrum of processing and filters.
</p><p>
I chose the above example so I
could show you one last interesting trick. On Linux systems, you 
can cat this output file (with this specific file format) directly
to the device file /dev/audio. This dumps the output directly to the
soundcard. So, if you want to be sneaky, you can convert some files to
the AU file format with the sox command above, copy them over to your
target machine, and cat them to /dev/audio when you want to make a
nuisance of yourself. Now you can enjoy
your music and play with audio files, without the overhead of
a GUI application.

<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Mitch Frazier</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #193, May 2010</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
For many Linux power users lost in a Windows world, the most
glaring omission is the lack of an SSH client.
Of course, there's Cygwin and all the good things that come with it
in addition to an SSH client (and server), but if you're looking for
something a little more lightweight or if you want a GUI SSH client, 
PuTTY probably is the tool you need.
In addition to SSH, PuTTY also supports Telnet and Rlogin.
</p><p>
PuTTY supports most of the features Linux users are used to having:
X11 forwarding (you'll need a separate X server for this),
port forwarding, tunneling and so on.
PuTTY supports SSH-1 and SSH-2 and has support for public key authentication.
PuTTY comes with the pscp and psftp companion tools for command-line
access to SCP and SFTP.
</p><p>
Because it's a GUI application, PuTTY's settings, including those for different
hosts, are configured and stored via the GUI interface. Only when you've actually
made a connection to a host do you interact with a terminal window.
</p><p>
PuTTY is mature program. The first release listed in the changelog, 0.45,
is from 1999. The latest is 0.60, released in 2007.
PuTTY is available from <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty" target="_self">www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty</a>.

It wasn't too long ago that all geeks worth their salt had full-blown
computers in their living rooms connected to their TVs, running software
packages like MythTV, GeeXBoX, XBMC or something similar. Although those
packages still are great ways to consume media, they're far from the only
ways to do it. Now you can buy embedded media players off the shelf.
Popcorn Hour, WDTV Live, Roku, ASUS O!Play and dozens of other embedded
devices (most if not all running Linux) will plug in to a television and
play video, audio, photos and so on.

</p><p>
The only problem is with customization. Although vendors certainly win when
it comes to hardware, their software often leaves a lot to be desired.
Hopefully, hardware manufacturers will take what they've learned in the
computer world and transition to the set-top box world. Spend time
on the hardware and let someone else do the software! Imagine an
off-the-shelf device that supplied HDMI, infrared remote, onboard
Flash storage and enough flexibility to install your own front end.
Now, imagine that device was less than $100. With the Roku SD costing less
than $80, it's certainly not a pipe dream.
</p><p>
So vendors, are you listening? We just want to make your life easier!
You supply us with awesome hardware, and we'll supply you with awesome
software. And, it will be open source&mdash;no licensing required.

Studies show taking frequent breaks from work increases productivity,
makes for a more pleasant work environment and reduces stress. Although there
probably are healthier ways to spend your occasional breaks from work,
game emulators certainly provide a fun way to relax. Assuming you're
tech-savvy enough to land a job that allows you to use Linux, and that
you're geeky enough to desire a way to play old Nintendo games, I think
it's safe to assume you will be able to procure ROM images for those
games you legally own&mdash;you know, those games sitting in a box in your
parents' basement.
</p><p>
With the addition of emulators like ROCKnes, iNes, zsnes and their ilk,
you can spend those 15-hour, er, -minute, breaks playing classics
like <span   class="emphasis"><em>Super Mario Brothers</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>F-Zero</em></span>,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Zelda</em></span> and so on. If you can land a
USB game controller, it will make the experience that much more fun.
Let's not fool ourselves, although <span   class="emphasis"><em>World of Warcraft</em></span> might be addictive,
it doesn't hold a candle to those 30-hour sessions of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Dragon
Warrior</em></span>
we used to play over the weekend instead of doing homework. Have fun,
and try not to get fired!

<h2 class="title">Send E-mail with Telnet</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Kyle Rankin</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #193, May 2010</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Poor telnet has gotten a bad rap over the years due to the fact
that if you use it for remote logins, your password shows up in
plain text. However, even though you should use SSH for remote sessions,
you shouldn't completely throw away telnet. After all, telnet is just
one way to connect to a remote port and send text commands to it. When
you start poking around at a number of protocols like HTTP and SMTP,
you'll find that if you know the right commands, you can telnet into
those ports and act like a more sophisticated client.
</p><p>
One way I use telnet is to test whether a mail server works. Sure, I could
use an e-mail client, but then I'd have to reconfigure it. Plus, sending an
e-mail with telnet is a nice geeky party trick (well, maybe the parties
I go to), especially if you forge your FROM address.
</p><p>
First, use telnet to connect to port 25 on your mail server:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ telnet mail.example.net 25
Trying 123.234.123.234...
Connected to mail.example.net.
Escape character is '^]'.
220 mail.example.net ESMTP Postfix
</pre>
</p><p>
Next, use the HELO command to tell the server what domain you are coming
from. It will respond with its name:

<pre     class="programlisting">
HELO microsoft.com
250 mail.example.net
</pre>
</p><p>
After that, use the <tt  >MAIL FROM:</tt> command to tell the
server the e-mail address
this e-mail is coming from. The fun part here is that you can make the
FROM address appear to be from anyone. If the mail server accepts it,
it will reply with <tt  >250 Ok</tt>:

<pre     class="programlisting">
MAIL FROM: bill.gates@microsoft.com
250 Ok
</pre>
</p><p>
We're in! Okay, now use the <tt  >RCPT TO:</tt> command to tell the
server to whom you
are sending the e-mail:

<pre     class="programlisting">
RCPT TO: lj@greenfly.net
250 Ok
</pre>
</p><p>
Finally, let's type in the body of the e-mail. Type <tt  >DATA</tt> and
press Enter. The mail server will respond with instructions to end your e-mail
body with an empty line containing a single dot. After this point, I
typed in a Subject header and the rest of the body of my e-mail, but you
can add as many headers as you want here. When you're done with
the message, type a period on a line by itself:

<pre     class="programlisting">

DATA
354 End data with &lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;.&lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;
Subject: Linux is awesome
Hi,

It's Bill. I just wanted to let you know 
Linux is awesome.

Sincerely,
Bill Gates
.
250 Ok: queued as 12BDBE6FEE9

</pre>
</p><p>
When you're finished with your e-mail session, type <tt  >quit</tt> to exit:

<pre     class="programlisting">
quit
221 Bye
Connection closed by foreign host.
</pre>

One of the best things about the new LinuxJournal.com is the ability to
interact with the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> staff and your fellow readers. Visit
<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/participate" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/participate</a> to search for other
readers or find <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span> editors and make connections. You'll also find forums, community
events and our IRC channel. There are many ways to be a part of our
growing community, so check them out and jump right in. 
</p><p>
When you visit authors' profiles, you'll see a list of all their articles
as well as what they've been up to on LinuxJournal.com. You'll also see
their favorite articles, and if you log in, you can leave them a message. We
hope you'll make some connections and think of us as your virtual LUG. I
look forward to connecting with all of you!
