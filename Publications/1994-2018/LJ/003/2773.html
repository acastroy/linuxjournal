Linux developer, but not known what e-mail address to send your
mail to? Mike McLagan, with help from Liem Bahneman, has created a
new Internet domain called linux.org. If you want to send e-mail to
Alan Cox (who is in charge of Linux networking development), but
can't remember his e-mail address, you can send it to
<a href="mailto:Alan.Cox@linux.org">Alan.Cox@linux.org</a>
and it will be correctly forwarded to him. You can send mail for me
to
<a href="mailto:johnsonm@redhat.com">johnsonm@redhat.com</a>,
and for Linus himself to
<a href="mailto:torvalds@transmeta.com">torvalds@transmeta.com</a>.
<a href="mailto:Pat.Volkerding@linux.org">Pat.Volkerding@linux.org</a>
is the maintainer of Slackware, and
<a href="mailto:Mike.McLagan@linux.org">Mike.McLagan@linux.org</a>
maintains this service. If you need to find out what aliases exist,
you can get a list of the aliases from ftp.linux.org in the file
/pub/info/alias-list. Linux developers only may request an alias
from
<a href="mailto:alias-request@linux.org">alias-request@linux.org</a>.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25a3580.0x269b608"></a>Other Services</h2></div></div><p>World Wide Web (WWW or W3), a distributed hypertext
application which organizes information across the entire Internet,
(see the article by Bernie Thompson on page 9 for an introduction
to WWW which explains of all the terms in this paragraph) includes
quite a bit of information about Linux. linux.org provides a set of
Linux documents all together in one place. The URL is
<a href="http://www.linux.org" target="_self">www.linux.org</a>.
[The site can now be found at
<a href="http://www.linuxresources.com" target="_self">www.linuxresources.com</a>]
I was very suprised as I browsed the WWW pages on www.linux.org to
find connections to a HTML version of my own book, the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Kernel Hackers' Guide</em></span>, available. There
is a lot out there, and it is worth exploring if you have a
connection to the Internet.</p><p>Another service that linux.org will provide is ftp service
from ftp.linux.org. As I write this, the ftp directory on
ftp.linux.org is mostly empty, but Mike is asking for help from
Linux developers to change this. Mike is considering several other
services, which will be announced in forthcoming issues of <i  >Linux Journal</i>, and is taking suggestions at
<a href="mailto:Suggestions@linux.org">Suggestions@linux.org</a>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25a3580.0x269b920"></a>Non-Intel Linux</h2></div></div><p>When Linux first came out, Linus said that Linux would be
very difficult to port to other architectures. Everyone paid
attention when he said this, but no one appeared to notice when he
later said that Linux had become much more portable; as portable as
most versions or clones of Unix.</p><p>For over a year and a half, work has been under way on a port
of Linux to the Motorola 680x0, specifically the Amiga. Work went
in fits and starts until Hamish MacDonald announced his first port,
but since then progress has been rapid. It is now starting to work
well, at least for hackers, and supports many common devices. The X
Window System has not yet been ported, but Linux/68 compiles
itself, has shared libraries, and runs emacs. Join the
<b  >680X0</b> channel of the mailing list if the
Linux/68 port interests you. Send an empty mail message to
<a href="mailto:linux-activists-request@niksula.hut.fi">linux-activists-request@niksula.hut.fi</a>
for instructions on how to do this.</p><p>In the last few weeks, a version for the Atari TT and Falcon
has been begun, and now is booting itself. Soon all of these 680x0
platforms should be supported by a single kernel, or at least be
built from the same source. Linux/68 has most of the features of
Linux/i86 (standard Linux), and is still under development. It
requires a 68020 with a seperate MMU or a 68030 or 68040. 68000 and
68010 are not and will not be supported.</p><p>Recently, Jim Paradis of DEC announced that he has started
work on a port of Linux to the DEC ALPHA chip, and two college
students have announced that they have begun work on a port to the
PowerMac. DEC has offered to loan Linus an ALPHA to work on an
ALPHA port, and IBM has offered to loan Linus a PowerPC to work on
a PowerPC port. There is a lot of interest in ports of Linux to new
architectures; not only on the part of hackers and even general
consumers, but now also by some of the largest companies in the
industry.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25a3580.0x269bbe0"></a>Brave New Linux</h2></div></div><p>The Linux groups (especially comp.os.linux.misc) have been
aflame in the last few weeks with rumors about Novell developing a
complete Unix-like environment based on the Linux kernel. These
reports, mostly fueled by reports in PC Week, have not been
confirmed, but they do demonstrate that interest in Linux is
spreading in the &ldquo;conventional&rdquo; market and that the &ldquo;major players&rdquo;
the the computer industry have taken notice.</p><p>Even if the rumors are not true (although they sound
convincing), the fact that PC Week named Linux its &ldquo;Product of the
Week&rdquo; is major recognition, since PC Week is heavily oriented
towards DOS and Windows, and has historically shown little interest
in Unix or unix-like systems.</p><p>What can you do to encourage this recognition? I suggest that
whenever you order hardware for your Linux box, that no matter who
the vendor is, you explain that you will use the hardware with
Linux, and ask if the hardware is supported under Linux. Be willing
to explain what Linux is if they don't know. Several times, I have
had an experience something like this: &ldquo;Does that work with Linux?&rdquo;
&ldquo;What's Linux?&rdquo; &ldquo;A free Unix-like operating system.&rdquo; &ldquo;Free?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes,
free.&rdquo; &ldquo;How can I get a copy?&rdquo;...</p><p>If you are interested in commercial software applications
being made available for Linux, call the company and ask if a Linux
version is available. If enough people ask, the company will get
the message&mdash;software companies do not make a living by ignoring
large groups of potential customers. On the other hand, remember
that they do not make a profit by making a port that only one
person will buy.</p></div></div>
