to communicate and cooperate, the Internet has sped up the pace of
scientific innovation. With 20 million users and growing, it has
created a culture based on instant information and hyperkinetic
communication.
</p><p>The challenge now is to expand the power of the Internet to a
wider audience and make it more convenient for all. Rising to this
challenge is a system called the World Wide Web. By bringing all of
the Internet's old and new resources together, the Web stands to
become the one simple, standard way to access all of the Internet's
riches.</p><p>It stands to revolutionize the revolution.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14e7580.0x15df5b0"></a>What is the Web?</h2></div></div><p>To picture the World Wide Web, imagine a page from a book. By
pressing your finger on any of the words, you receive a new page
with more detailed information about eh subject selected. The Web
is like a huge book being constructed on the Internet.</p><p>Tens of thousands of these pages are already scattered around
the world. They are created by experts and novices of all
disciplines who use the Internet. The amount of information
available is stunning: an encyclopedia, a dictionary, world maps,
complete information on US government agencies, extensive Linux
documentation, and much much more. It's an amazing source of
information.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14e7580.0x15df710"></a>How does it Work?</h2></div></div><p>The Web is really a collection of computers, hooked together
over the Internet, that pass pages of information back and forth. A
program called a Web browser is used to find and view information.
When you select a word in your Web browser, a message goes out to
another computer somewhere in the world. That computer will respond
by sending back the page you requested.</p><p>The messages between computers are encoded in the form of a
Universal Resource Locator. The URL describes what kind of
information you want, and where to look for it. It's like a mail
address for the Web.</p><p>The pages can contain text, images. sounds and more. A page
can even contain fill-in-the-blank forms which you complete to send
information off to another computer. A protocol called HTML
describes, in general terms, how the text, images, and forms should
be positioned on the page. Web browsers can use this general
description to lay out pages in different ways. For example, a
browser that works in text mode only can ignore all the images. Or
an X Windows browser can shift the text and images of a page when
the window is resized.</p><p>URLs describe the locations of a page, and HTML provides an
adaptable description of the information. Together, they make the
Web an extremely flexible system.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14e7580.0x15df920"></a>Why Use the Web?</h2></div></div><p>To everyone familiar with Internet newsgroups, FTP sites, and
gopher servers, the Web may not seem groundbreaking. But the impact
is, in fact, dramatic.</p><p>The most important advantage is simplicity. To maneuver
around libraries of information, you need only click the mouse to
learn or key combinations to memorize.</p><p>The Universal Resource Locator also provides an easy way to
access other forms of Internet information such as gopher and
archie. This way, there is only one, simple interface used to
access a multitude of resources. New users benefit most from this
simplicity.</p><p>Unlike newsgroups, Web information stays around as long as
the author, or anyone else, wants to keep it available. Unlike
information available vie FTP, the information is cataloged and
categorized, so it is much easier to find and access. Unlike
gopher, the information is laid out like one gigantic book. You can
read what you like, and select more detail only if you're
interested.</p><p>Many have predicted that cyberspace would become a chaotic
mess where information is impossible to find. The World Wide Web is
a system designed to bring order to the chaos.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14e7580.0x15dfb88"></a>Linux and the Web</h2></div></div><p>Linux is one of the best systems, commercial or otherwise,
for access to the Web. Linux is a version of Unix, the native
platform of the Internet. So the best Web tools are often available
on Linux before DOS, Windows, or Macintosh.</p><p>Two of the most popular tools for the Web are Mosaic and
lynx. They are Web browsers with different goals. Lynx is small and
text-only. Mosaic is large and full-featured. To browse the wealth
of information on the Web, just pick one, install, and wander off
to explore the wonders of the Web.</p><p>Lynx will display the text of a page without any images or
fancy fonts. It only requires the keyboard arrow keys for
navigation. This simplicity makes it fast and flexible. Lynx uses
the VT100 protocol, so people without access to X Windows can still
use lynx, including users logging in to a Linux system
remotely.</p><p>Lynx is miserly with disk space and memory. It will only take
up 320K of disk and consume about 620K of RAM while running. This
makes lynx perfect for 4MB Linux workstations.</p><p>Lynx is not as common as Mosaic, however. This is primarily
because lynx doesn't support the colorful images and different
fonts that make the Web so expressive. For these, Mosaic or some
other graphical browser is required to experience the full richness
of the Web.</p><p>Lynx is freely available. To get lynx for Linux, check the
Linux Software Map. For lynx source code, FTP to
ftp2.cc.ukans.edu.</p><p>In contrast to lynx stands Mosaic. Mosaic is probably the
best Web browsers available, and it is certainly the most famous.
It takes full advantage of the Web.</p><p>Mosaic is a graphical browser, so it will only run on systems
with X Windows (or MS Windows or Macintosh). A number of companies
such as Quarterdeck have licensed the free Mosaic for commercial
use rather than write their own. Mosaic is truly a high=quality
application. But the price for beauty is more memory and disk
space. Mosaic consumes over 1.3MB of disk space, and will use about
2MB of RAM while running.</p><p>Linux lynx, Mosaic is freely available. This freedom is
slightly restricted, however, because Mosaic uses Motif programming
libraries. This means you cannot recompile Mosaic yourself without
a license for the Motif libraries.</p><p>To get Mosaic, search for it in the Linux Software Map. A
copy of Mosaic can be found at sunsite.unc.edu and most other Linux
sites. Assuming you have X Windows, no special installation
procedures are needed. Just prepare to be impressed by a very
professional program.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14e7580.0x15dffa8"></a>Using Linux to Contribute to the Web</h2></div></div><p>DOS, Windows, and Mac users can happily access the Web with a
browser. But the extra dimension Linux adds is the ability to
become part of the Web&mdash;the ability to make information available
to others via a Web server.</p><p>Setting up a Web server is certainly more difficult than
using a browser, but is still surprisingly easy. This ease of use
allows a large number of Internet users to contribute to the Web
project. And Linux makes a great platform for a Web server because
of its small size and speed. With the growing body of Internet
Linux users, the potential is enormous.</p><p>Httpd is a popular Web server available for Linux. Its
creator, NCSA, is the same group that developed Mosaic.Httpd will
consume about 200K RAM while running. The program itself uses very
little disk space. Just allocate enough disk space to hold all the
pages of Web information.</p><p>The burden of the Web on a Linux server was tested by
creating a working Web site on a i386-33 Linux machine. During a 40
day span, the PSU Linux WWW received 5375 requests from 1328
different sites around the world. This is an average of 6.9
requests per hour and 165 per day. The Web requests never
interfered with any work being done by other users at the machine.
A Linux system can easily provide Web services and have horsepower
to spare.</p><p>To get httpd and set up your own Web server, look for httpd
in the Linux Software Map. For full documentation on httpd, look at
http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/. This site has all the documentation
needed for installation.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14e7580.0x15e0210"></a>The Web Means Business</h2></div></div><p>The Web has attracted a surprising amount of attention from
the commercial world. This is a testament to its effectiveness. No
other existing system has the clean design, flexibility and
momentum that the Web enjoys. &ldquo;It's the killer application of the
Internet,&rdquo; says Eamonn Sullivan of PC Week. &ldquo;I know everyone says
that now, but that doesn't make it any less true.&rdquo;</p><p>PC Week Labs discovered Linux during the course of setting up
a Web server. The result is they continue to use Linux on their
server, and Linux won PCX Week's Product of the Week for April 18,
1994. Press exposure of this sort will inspire new and exciting
business applications for Linux.</p><p>The number one buzzword in business today is client/server.
The Web and Linux fit perfectly into such a system. A documentation
solution for a large organization can be quickly and effectively
developed with the Web.</p><p>For example, a business might be grappling with the
documentation requirements of ISO 9000, the process quality
standard of the International Standards Organization. Using the Web
with Linux servers and clients running Mosaic, documents related to
ISO 9000 can be sorted in one location, updated only by the group
responsible for that process. But anyone inside the organization
can view the documents. The Web is an easy, open solution to a
thorny problem.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14e7580.0x15e0420"></a>Exciting Possibilities for the Linux
Community</h2></div></div><p>Still, the greatest potential of the Web lies with the
Internet-connected Linux community. As Linux continues to prove
itself to Internet users, the audience for a Linux Web will grow.
By distributing data around the world, enormous amounts of
information can be conveniently accessed from any Linux machine.
There are already a number of Web servers which have manual pages
and info files on-line. Hook into the Web and save space.</p><p>The first possibility is for manual pages and info pages.
This infrequently accessed information can be viewed via the Web
instead of storing copies on every machine. There are already a
number of Web servers which have manual pages and info files
on-line. Hook into the Web and save space.</p><p>Using FTP to access files can be difficult for novice users.
A Web browser provides a friendly interface for getting files from
FTP sites. Common FTP sites can appear as links on a Web page.
Newsgroups, also, can be accessed via the Web. Hypertext links
between followups are automatically created.</p><p>Subscribing to mailing lists can be automated. Using fill-in
forms, users could select links to subscribe and unsubscribe. In
the same way, they could register with Linux User Counter.</p><p>To better bring the Linux community together, a Web server
can be configured so that each user has a home page of information
about themselves. A tree of Linux information can be developed,
right down to individuals. New Linux users would register
themselves, and their home page, with some local server. Every new
local server would register itself with a central server. Now the
location and interests of each Linux user are easily
available.</p><p>Lastly, there is potential for information beyond mere man
pages. Linux is extraordinary in the quantity and quality of online
information available. Because of the contributions of groups like
the Linux Documentation Project, information about nearly every
aspect of Linux use are available. All of these manuals,
information sheets, and FAQs can be made available on the
Web.</p><p>What makes this possibility so exciting is that each manual
can be stored in one place&mdash;the author's home site. So when a
document is updated, the author has only one central location the
change it. Although the documents would actually be scattered
around the world, to the Web user they would all appear on one
easy-to-locate Web page. The Web provides an optimal system for
both authors and users.</p><p>The World Wide Web is still in its infancy. The first half of
1994 saw triple-digit growth in Web traffic. By encompassing older
systems of information access, like gopher, the Web guaranteed
instant compatibility.</p><p>Native Web information is exploding. Through the Internet and
through CD-ROM distribution, the Linux community is finding many
new and creative uses for this flexible technology. No doubt more
and better uses will be forthcoming. It is certain that the
phenomenal growth of the Web will continue.</p><p>Bernie Thompson ran the PSU Linux WWW during its 3-month life
