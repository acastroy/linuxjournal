    The week of March 21-25 I attended the UniForum show in San
    Francisco. At
    that show I played the multiple roles of press person, <i  >Linux Journal</i>
    booth staffer, Linux evangelist and general-purpose nerd. It was an
    exciting show for me and for Linux.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x109b580.0x1193240"></a></h2></div></div><p>For those unfamiliar with UniForum, it is
an annual Unix extravaganza with hundreds of vendor exhibits, a
host of tutorials and other seminars and tens of thousands of
attendees. While some attendees are casually dressed, it is
becoming more the &ldquo;suit and tie&rdquo; Unix show.
</p><p>The show is put on by the UniForum Association, a nonprofit,
vendor-independent association of developers, vendors and end
users. The association has been around since 1981 and is in the
business of promoting open systems as well as providing leadership
in cooperation and standards and education.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x109b580.0x11933a0"></a>Our Booth</h2></div></div><p>The <i  >Linux Journal</i>/New York Unix booth was busy all three
days. In fact, the people in the next booth came over and mentioned
how our booth had much more traffic than the other booths in the
area. Then they started asking questions about porting their
product (CD-ROM-mastering software) to Linux.</p><p>Much as in SSC's booth at the University of Washington
computer fair where I spent a day two weeks earlier, most people
came over to talk about Linux rather than ask what it was. Some
Linux-related vendors dropped by including James Vera of Fintronic
and Adam Richter of Yggdrasil.</p><p>Lots of Linux users dropped by and told us about their Linux
systems and experiences. Many non-Linux users, after talking to us
about Linux, headed upstairs to Computer Literacy's bookstore to
purchase a Linux CD-ROM.</p><p>Of the vendors that stopped by, a group of people from Compaq
was the most interesting. They showed up with one of their laptops
with Linux on it. Certainly not difficult to do but it was real
nice to see that a hardware manufacturer had recognized Linux as
something real. When they offer their computers with Linux as an
alternative we will know they are serious.</p><p>Dion Johnson of developer relations for SCO also dropped by.
He told me he was glad we were here, as not everyone was going to
run SCO Unix. Gee, what could I say. :-)</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x109b580.0x1193660"></a>The Show</h2></div></div><p>In my evangelist role I walked around the show talking to
vendors about Linux. My primary target was communications board
manufacturers. Virtually all of them had heard of Linux and I did
get contact names at a couple of the companies so I could talk
further about Linux and intelligent comm boards. One vendor,
Cyclades, gave one of their semi-intelligent comm boards to a Linux
user on the condition that he write a Linux driver for it. I
arranged the deal, adding the condition that he write an article
about it for <i  >Linux Journal</i>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x109b580.0x11937c0"></a>Grove's Keynote</h2></div></div><p>I attended Andrew Grove's keynote address on Wednesday
morning. Andy is the CEO of Intel. I found it interesting that the
CEO of a company that grew on the marketing of MS-DOS was giving a
keynote at a Unix-based convention. It certainly reinforced the
respectability of Unix as a real operating system with a real
market.</p><p>Grove said &ldquo;Unix has gone from challenger to defender without
having ever been declared the winner&rdquo;. This made me think about my
15 years working with Unix. My perception was that Unix was pretty
mainstream but I live in Seattle which makes me think that jeans
and birkenstocks are mainstream dress. But, if the CEO of Intel
also feels that Unix won the OS battle maybe it really did.</p><p>He went on to say that Windows NT is the big challenger and
that we need to get our collective acts together if we want to be
successful in maintaining our position. Most of this responsibility
is, of course, with the Suns and HPs and IBMs to cooperate on
presenting a unified Unix. But, the Linux community can play an
important part. If we can offer a reliable low-cost solution we can
head off the move to another operating system.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x109b580.0x1193978"></a>Dennis Ritchie</h2></div></div><p>On Friday, Dennis Ritchie gave a keynote address. The title
was &ldquo;Building the Operating System of the Future: How the Lessons
of Unix are Shaping Plan 9&rdquo;. Ritchie, along with Ken Thompson,
developed the Unix operating system 25 years ago. Ritchie is now
head of the computing techniques research department at AT&amp;T
Bell Laboratories. Plan 9 is the current research project much like
Unix was 25 years ago.</p><p>The first half of Ritchie's talk covered the history of Unix
development. When talking about the AT&amp;T/Sun alliance he
pointed out that the creation of OSF, the consortium formed by
other vendors to defend against AT&amp;T and Sun setting the
direction of Unix without other vendor input, was a direct result
of their work. At the time of the creation of OSF, Ken Thompson was
on sabbatical in Australia. Dennis sent e-mail to Ken about it and
Ken's response was, &ldquo;Geez, Dennis, DEC and IBM in the same bed and
WE did it.&rdquo;</p><p>I talked to Ritchie at the press conference after his talk. I
asked him if he saw parallels between development work on Unix 20
years ago and Linux today. He admitted that he wasn't familiar
enough with current Linux development to be able to make the
comparison but he did expect that it was the case.</p><p>I then offered him a copy of <i  >Linux Journal</i> and received a
surprising answer. He said, &ldquo;Oh, I've seen copies [of <i  >Linux Journal</i>] around the terminal room at The Labs.&rdquo; Made me feel like
Linux had made it into the big leagues.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x109b580.0x1193c38"></a>Block of Booths?</h2></div></div><p>UniForum will happen again next year. And while we wait for
UniForum there are other Unix shows such as Unix Expo. We had a
booth at UniForum, are being represented by Telemax at the Dayton
Hamvention and are planning for a booth at Unix Expo.</p><p>In order to make Unix users aware of the Linux movement, the
Linux community needs to make a show of force at these events. A
block of booths would certainly help. We may be able to have a
shared booth for smaller Linux vendors as part of this block. If
you are interested in this idea, contact Joanne Wagner, our
advertising manager. If we get enough interest she will coordinate
this.</p><p><a href="2775f1.jpg" target="_self"><i  >LJ</i>
