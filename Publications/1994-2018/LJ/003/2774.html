    I am sure some of you out there want to figure out how to start
    making
    money as a software developer or computer consultant. The general answer
    is &ldquo;solve a problem&rdquo;.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c5d580.0x1d55240"></a></h2></div></div><p>Back in the early days of inexpensive
Unix systems it was a serious uphill battle to sell Unix-based
computer systems to small businesses. Why? Because MS-DOS did
everything they wanted. By the time these businesspeople realized
they had a problem-they needed a computer system that could be
accessed by more than one person at a time- Novell was telling them
they needed Netware to hook together their MS-DOS systems.
</p><p>Well, Novell managed to sell these MS-DOS people another
operating system. Most probably didn't realize it but they were
Netware users with MS-DOS &ldquo;terminals&rdquo;. It sold because they could
keep on thinking they were running MS-DOS and it solved the
problem.</p><p>I am sure some of you out there want to figure out how to
start making money as a software developer or computer consultant.
The general answer is &ldquo;solve a problem&rdquo;. In the rest of this column
I am going to show how you can use Linux to solve problems and make
money along the way. Get rich quick? No. Guaranteed? No. But, if we
all play it right it has a good chance of success.</p><p>In the past the hurdles to selling a complete system
were:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Getting the hardware</p></li><li><p>Getting the software</p></li><li><p>Putting together something that was needed</p></li><li><p>Finding customers and selling it</p></li><li><p>Supporting what you sell</p></li></ul></div><p>Has something changed? Not in this list, just in what you
need to do to jump these hurdles. Let's look at them one at a
time.</p><p>In Seattle there are almost as many places that sell
computers as sell gasoline. At one time I thought there would be
more computer stores than expresso stands but now that dry
cleaners, insurance agents and car dealers are selling espresso I
would guess not. This means that it is pretty easy to buy a
computer-even one that can run Linux. Add to this the fact that
computer hardware is just plain inexpensive these days and you have
another advantage over the old days when you had to sell your
firstborn in order to afford to buy a computer.</p><p>If you are not a hardware whiz (or don't want to be) your
best bet is to talk to the owner of a computer store. Not a big
chain, just a local businessperson who would be interested in your
story. Tell him about Linux, about yourself and about why he will
benefit. What you want is for him to supply the hardware to your
customer and be responsible for it when it breaks. He can make the
profit on the hardware and you don't get any of the hassles
including financing and inventory.</p><p>This deal helps both of you. You send hardware customers to
him. He sends people looking for multi-user solutions to
you.</p><p>The second item on the list is software. This is still a
problem with Linux. In fact, Linux is probably not the right answer
for a general-purpose business solution yet. But there are lots of
things that can be done, and in many cases, Linux is a better
answer for the customer.</p><p>But first, here is why it is a better answer for you:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Minimal costs for software-Linux is (almost) free
and 100 copies of Linux cost the same as one copy.</p></li><li><p>You can get the source code for Linux and other
programs such as Ingres or Postgres that you need to work with. You
may not want to hack source code but it means it can be done and,
as it is available without a $100,000 licensing fee, you can
probably find someone to do the hacking for you if it becomes
necessary.</p></li><li><p>It costs your customer less. If the customer has
$20,000 to spend to solve their problem and you can reduce the
software cost by a few thousand by using Linux on the systems
instead of a commercial OS, you get to put those few thousand in
your pocket, or split the difference with the customer.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c5d580.0x1d55c90"></a>What should you do?</h2></div></div><p>The best place to start is with something you need or want.
If, for example, you currently work for a small company that sees
the Internet as a way to expand their business, offer to help them
get on the Internet. Get a Linux system, an Internet connection,
and get it up and running. Get a news server and an ftp server
running for their announcements and bulletins. Develop programs or
scripts to translate internal files into announcements suitable for
electronic retrieval.</p><p>You will have solved a problem, probably got a few gold stars
(and a black eye or two) and have learned how to put together
something that is needed by lots of businesses. Now you have a
product: your skill and expertise in getting a small business
electronically connected to the Internet. Start marketing but also
start thinking of what else you can do; what would be a logical
additon. For me, voice mail and FAX retrieval seems like the
logical complement: If the customer doesn't have e-mail they can
request the same information via FAX or, if all else fails, voice
mail.</p><p>Building this system is not for everyone but it is something
that is useful and needed. If, instead, you are an accountant with
C programming experience, you might want to consider some
accounting software. Or start with the Ingres or Postgres database
and build an application that solves a problem for your
business.</p><p>As Linux grows it will start to appeal more to commercial
software vendors. This means that you can either get in on the
ground floor building applications you need (and making money with
them) or wait for whoever the new &ldquo;Lotus&rdquo; is to appear as the
application provider for the Linux market.</p><p>For those of you who just want to use applications, start
writing letters to <i  >Linux Journal</i>. Tell us what you want and why.
There is a lot of talent out there ready to write code. If you can
identify what is needed, someone may provide it.</p></div></div>
