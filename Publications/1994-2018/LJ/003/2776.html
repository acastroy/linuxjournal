icmake recognizes some `special' operators. These are:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>The `younger' operator is used to compare two
strings which represent filenames. An expression using younger is
evaluated to non-zero or zero and may be used in a condition. The
operator `newer' is an alias for younger.
</p><p>The expression using the younger operator yields non-zero if
a file with the name represented by the left operand is more recent
than the file represented by the right operand.</p><p>E.g., the following code prints a message if file main.c is
more recent than main:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
if ("main.c" newer "main") printf ("main.c is more recent than
main\n");
</pre></li><li><p>The `older' operand compares two files and yields
non-zero if the file represented by the left operand is older than
the file represented by the right operand. When the date of a file
is compared using older or younger and when no file with such a
name is present, then the age of the file is assumed to be
infinite. A consequence of this implementation is that as in the
following code example, a message is displayed if &ldquo;try&rdquo; does not
exist:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
if ("try.c" younger "try") printf ("try.c should be
compiled!!\n");
</pre></li></ol></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1411580.0x15098c8"></a>4.4.4.3. Type casts</h2></div></div><p>Though icmake does not allow the use of operators on
different types, it is possible to convert one type into another.
The conversion of a type into another type is referred to as a
`type cast'.</p><p>Type casts are denoted by a type name in parentheses before
the operand which should be converted, e.g., (int)x converts the
operand x to integer representation. Type casts are not allowed on
all types. For example, a list variable cannot be converted to
int.</p><p>The following type casts are permitted:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>An integer may be cast to string. For example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
   string
                stringvar;
        stringvar = (string) 14; // now, stringvar is "14"
</pre></li><li><p>A string may be cast to int. This is the reverse
action of the type cast shown in the listing above.</p></li><li><p>A string may be cast to a list. This may be
particularly useful when filenames should be added to or removed
from a list, e.g., in the listing below, the filename &ldquo;main.c&rdquo; (a
string) is removed from the list cfiles:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
list
        cfiles;
                        // cfiles is set to hold a list of cfiles =
                        makelist ("*.c");   // all filenames with
                        extension .c
cfiles -= (list) "main.c";      // filename main.c is removed from
                        // the list
</pre></li></ol></div><p>Note that the string &ldquo;main.c&rdquo; must be converted to a list
type to allow the subtraction from the list.</p><p>Other typecasts, specifically from a string to an
ascii-representation, can be realized through specialized functions
(see, e.g., the function ascii() in the next section).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1411580.0x1509e48"></a>Built-in functions</h2></div></div><p>Built into icmake is a number of functions which may be used
to perform special operations, such as scanning a directory for
files, displaying information, etc.. Here, all built-in functions
are described.</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>arghead</b></span>: int
arghead(string): This function sets the argument head to string.
The `argument head' is used with the functions exec() and
execute(), described below.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>argtail</b></span>: int
argtail(string): This function sets the argument tail to string.
The `argument tail' is used with the functions exec() and
execute(), described below.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>ascii</b></span>: int
ascii(string): This function returns the ascii-number of the first
character in the string, supplied as argument, e.g., ascii(&ldquo;A&rdquo;)
returns 65.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>ascii</b></span>: string
ascii(int): The overloaded function, which expects an int argument,
returns a string representation of a numeric ascii number. e.g.,
ascii(65) returns &ldquo;A&rdquo;.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>change_base</b></span>:
string change_base (string, string): This function changes the
basename in the string which is supplied as its first argument to
the basename which is supplied as second argument. The string with
the changed basename is returned.
</p><p>Example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
string
        name;
name = change_base ("main.c", "test");  // name now is "test.c"
</pre></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>change_ext</b></span>: string
change_ext(string, string): This function changes the extension in
the string which is supplied as its first argument to the extension
which is supplied as second argument. The modified string is
returned.
</p><p>The extension (the second argument) may be specified as an
empty string (&ldquo;&rdquo;); in this case change_ext() removes the extension.
Also, the extension may be specified as one dot (&rdquo;.&ldquo;); in this case
change_ext() removes the extension but leaves the dot.</p><p>Example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
char
        name;
name = change_ext ("main.c", "o");      // name now is "main.o" name =
change_ext (name, "");       // name now is "main" name = change_ext
(name, ".");      // name now is "main."
</pre></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>change_path</b></span>:
string change_path(string, string): This function changes the path
in the string which is supplied as its first argument to the path
which is supplied as second argument.
</p><p>Example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
string
        name;
                                // name is now "/bin/prog"
name = change_path ("c:/usr/local/bin/prog", "/bin"); name = change_path
(name, "");  // name is now "prog"
</pre></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>chdir</b></span>: string
chdir(int, string): This function changes the current working
directory to the supplied name. The first int argument may be
<b  >P_CHECK</b> or <b  >P_NOCHECK</b>. This
argument is optional. When absent, <b  >P_CHECK</b> is
assumed. Failure to change the working directory with the presence
of <b  >P_CHECK</b> leads to the termination of icmake
process.
</p><p>However, on completion of the icmake process the original
directory is always restored.</p><p>A string containing the new working directory, always ending
in a directory separator, is returned. The string argument may
terminate in a final slash. The returned string can be used to
inspect whether the requested directory is reached, given that the
modifier <b  >P_NOCHECK</b> is supplied as first
argument.</p><p>Two special string arguments are recognized by
<b  >chdir()</b>:</p><p>a. A directory argument which consists of one dot (i.e., the
string &rdquo;.&ldquo;) realizes a `change' to the current directory. The
return value is then a string holding the current working
directory.</p><p>b. A directory argument which is an empty string (i.e., the
string &rdquo;&ldquo;) will not produce a directory change. Instead, the
directory from which icmake was started originally is
returned.</p><p>Example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
                   // print the current working directory
                        printf("Current dir: ", chdir ("."), "\n");
chdir ("/usr/bin");     // change to directory /usr/bin
                        // print startup directory
printf ("Startup dir: ", chdir (""), "\n");
</pre></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>cmdhead</b></span>: int
cmdhead(string): This function sets the command head to string. The
`command head' is used with the functions exec() and execute(),
described below.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>cmdtail</b></span>: int
cmdtail(string): This function sets the command tail to string. The
`command tail' is used with the functions exec() and execute(),
described below.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>echo</b></span>: int
echo(int): This function determines whether, before the execution
of a command, the command will be displayed. The argument of the
function determines the displaying mode: when zero, displaying is
suppressed; else, commands are displayed before execution. Two
predefined constants are available for use as an argument to
echo(): the constants ON and OFF. The values of these constants
are, respectively, 1 and 0. Initially, echoing is on.
</p><p>Example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
   echo (ON);      // commands will be displayed echo (OFF);     //
        commands will not be displayed
</pre></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>element</b></span>: string
element(int, list): This function retrieves a string from a list.
The order number of the name in the list is given by the first
argument. Note that this index is zero-based, i.e., the first
element in the list has index 0. The last element in the list has
index <b  >sizeoflist(list) - 1</b>.
</p><p>Example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
           list
                        l;
                string
                        n;
                int
                        i;
                l = makelist ("*.c"); for (i = 0; i &lt; sizeoflist (l);
                i++) if (element (i, l) newer "main") printf ("Source file
                ", element (i, l), " is more recent than main\n");
</pre></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>element</b></span>: string
element(int, string): This function retrieves a substring of one
character from the string given as its second argument.
</p><p>The character which is returned is found in the second
(string) argument at the offset position specified in the first
(int) argument. This index is zero-based: the first character of
the string has index 0.</p><p>Example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
           string
                        s;
                int
                        count; i;
                count = 0; s = "Hello world"; for (i = 0; element(i,
                s); i++)
                        count++;
                printf("String '", s, "' contains ", count, "
                characters.\n");
</pre></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>exec</b></span>: int
exec(int, string, ...): This function executes a command by
spawning a child process. The arguments are:
</p><p>a. The first argument is an optional mode (an int). It may be
P_CHECK (0) or P_NOCHECK (2). These predefined constants determine
whether the exit status of the command should be checked or not. If
the exit status should be checked, and a non-zero value is returned
by the called program, the processing of the icmake file is
aborted. If the first argument is omitted (i.e., if the first
argument is not an int), P_CHECK is assumed.</p><p>b. The second argument is the command to run (a string). This
is the name of the program to be activated.</p><p>c. The following arguments are the arguments which should be
passed to the called program. These arguments may be ints, lists or
strings.</p><p>Each command is composed of the program name (the second
argument), followed by the current setting of the command head (see
cmdhead(), followed by all arguments and terminated with the
command tail (see cmdtail()). Each argument to the command is
prefixed with the argument head (see arghead()) and postfixed by
the argument tail (see argtail()).</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>execute</b></span>: int
execute(int, string, string, string, ..., string, string): This
function executes a command by spawning a child process. The
arguments are:
</p><p>a. The first argument is an optional mode (an int). It may be
P_CHECK (0) or P_NOCHECK (2). These predefined constants determine
whether the exit status of the command should be checked or not. If
the exit status should be checked, and a non-zero value is returned
by the called program, the processing of the icmake file is
aborted. If the first argument is omitted (i.e., if the first
argument is not an int), P_CHECK is assumed.</p><p>b. The second argument is the command to run (a string). This
is the name of the program to be activated.</p><p>c. The third argument is the command head (a string). This
string is used as first argument to the program name. The string
may be empty (i.e., &rdquo;&ldquo;), in which case no command head is
used.</p><p>d. The fourth argument is the argument head (a string). This
string is prefixed to all following arguments. The string may be
empty, in which case no argument head is used.</p><p>e. The following arguments are the arguments which should be
passed to the called program. These arguments may be ints, lists or
strings.</p><p>f. The next to the last argument is the argument tail (a
string). This string is postfixed to each argument passed to the
called program. The string may be empty, in which case no argument
tail is used.</p><p>g. The last argument is the command tail (a string). The
command run by the execute() function is postfixed with this
string. The string may be empty, in which case no command tail is
used.</p><p>After execution, execute() resets the command head, command
tail, argument head and argument tail to empty strings. Both the
exec() and execute() functions terminate the making process if
error checking is turned on (mode flag P_CHECK) and if the run
command exits with a non-zero exit value. If error checking is off,
the exit status of the child process is returned.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>exists</b></span>: int
exists(string): This function tests if a file exists. The file name
is supplied as argument. A non-zero value is returned when the file
exists; else, zero is returned.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
   if (exists ("main.c"))
                     printf ("file main.c found\n");
                else
                     printf ("file main.c not found\n");
</pre></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>fgets</b></span>: list
fgets(string, int): This function reads a line of text from the
file whose name is given as its first (string) argument. Reading
starts at the offsetposition specified in the second (int)
argument. A list is returned, containing as its first element the
string which was read, including the final newline character (as it
is returned by the C++ function fgets()). The second element of the
returned list contains the string representation of the offset of
the file after the line was read. This string can be cast to an
int.
</p><p>Example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
   // showing the file info.doc on the screen: int
                        offset;
                list
                        l;
                for (
                        offset = 0;
                                 l = fgets("info.doc", offset);
                                offset = (int)element(1, l)
                )
                        printf(element(0, l));
</pre></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>fprintf</b></span>: int
fprintf(string, ...): This function appends information to the file
whose name is given as its first string argument. The remaining
arguments define the information which is written to the file. The
information is always appended to an existing file, which is opened
in textmode.
</p><p>fprintf() acts analogously to printf() (see below), but the
information is written to file rather than to screen.</p><p>The arguments beyond the first argument of fprintf() define
the information to print and may be ints, lists or strings.
Example: <b  >fprintf ("file.txt", 1, " line written to file.txt\n");</b>
</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>get_base</b></span>: string
get_base(string): This function returns the basename of the
filename stored in the string argument. The empty string is
returned if the argument contains no basename. This happens when a
disk or a root directory is specified in string. It may also happen
if the syntax rules for a filename specification are violated.
Example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
                                // prints 'main'
        printf(get_base ("/path/main.c"));
                                // prints 'No basename: '
        printf("No basename: ", get_base ("/"));
</pre></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>getch</b></span>: string
getch(): This function returns one character as a ministring. The
character is read from the standard input stream (usually the
keyboard).
</p><p>Under Unix, this function waits until a key and the enter key
are pressed. Example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
        printf(getch());        // prints a character
                                // (or an empty string)
</pre></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>get_ext</b></span>: string
get_ext(string): This function returns the extension in the string
argument of the function. The empty string is returned if the
argument does not contain an extension. Example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
        printf(get_ext ("/path/main.c"));   // prints 'c' printf(get_ext
        ("main"));           // returns empty string
</pre></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>get_path</b></span>: string
get_path(string): This function returns the path stored in the
string argument of the function. An empty string is returned if
string does not contain a disk specifier. The function returns the
longest possible pathname which can be derived from the string
argument. Example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
printf(get_path ("/path/main.c"));      // prints '/path/' get_path
("main.c");            // returns an empty string
</pre></li><li><p>getpid: int getpid(): This function returns the
process number of the currently executing icmake program. Example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
        // this function kills the current process..
        // analogous to exit()
        void harakiri()
        {
        exec ("kill", "-9", getpid ());
        }
        // this function returns a name for a temporary file
        // based on the process ID number file names are,
        // e.g., "/tmp/_TMPFILE.1256"
        string tempfilename ()
        {
             return ("/tmp/" + "_TMPFILE." + (string)getpid());
        }
</pre></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>gets</b></span>: string
gets(): This function returns the return value of the C function
gets() as a string. The function accepts character, including
backspaces allowing corrections, until the enter-key is pressed.
The entered characters are returned in a string. Example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
        printf(gets()); // prints a string
                        // (or an empty string)
</pre></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>makelist</b></span>: list
makelist(int, string): This function makes a list of strings,
representing filenames which match the expanded form of its
argument. The arguments are an optional int, specifying the type of
directory entries to search for, and a string specifying the file
mask. The returned list may hold zero or more names.
</p><p>The first int argument specifies the type of entries to
search for. It may be O_FILE (when searching for files), O_DIR
(when searching for directories) or O_SUBDIR (when searching for
subdirectories). The difference between the searching for
directories and the searching for subdirectories lies in the fact
that the current directory, denoted by &rdquo;.&ldquo;, and the parent
directory, denoted by &rdquo;..&ldquo;, are not considered subdirectories but
are considered directories. This argument may be absent, in which
case O_FILE is assumed.</p><p>A fourth type is O_ALL. When this type is given, makelist()
searches for all directory entries irrespective of their type;
e.g., under DOS, hidden and system files are matched as well as
normal files or (sub)directories.</p><p>The behavior of makelist() is dependent on the used platform,
e.g., to search for all files or (sub)directories under DOS, the
file mask &rdquo;*.*&ldquo; must be given. The file mask &rdquo;*&ldquo; will fail to find
files or (sub)directories with an extension. Furthermore,
makelist() behaves under DOS similar to the C run-time functions
<b  >_dos_findfirst()</b>
and <b  >_dos_findnext()</b>;
e.g., <b  >makelist(O_DIR, ".")</b>
returns a list containing the name of the current directory.</p><p>In a similar vein, the filemask &rdquo;*&ldquo; will, under Unix, fail to
find files or (sub)directories starting with a dot. Example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
        list
                l;
        l = makelist ("*.c"); printf ("All found *.c files are: ",
        l, "\n"); l = makelist (O_SUBDIR, "*"); printf ("All found
        subdirectories are: ", l, "\n");
</pre></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>makelist</b></span>: The
function makelist(), furthermore, has overloaded versions. These,
apart from a first optional int indicating the type of entries to
search for, expect three arguments. The arguments of these versions
are a (string) mask; a comparison operator which must be younger,
newer or older; and a (string) referencefile. The function returns
a list of files matching the mask which are older or newer than the
referencefile.
</p><p>An optional first int argument, which specifies the type of
directory entry (O_FILE, O_DIR or O_SUBDIR) may be present.
Example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
list
                l;
        l = makelist ("*.c", newer, "libprog.a"); printf ("All .c files
        newer than libprog.a are: ", l, "\n");
</pre></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>printf</b></span>: int
printf(int, ...): This function displays information. The arguments
define the information to print and may be ints, lists or strings.
A list is printed as a series of all its elements with spaces in
between.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>putenv</b></span>: void
putenv(string): This function may be used to set environment
variables during the execution of icmake programs. The environment
variables remain active during the complete icmake run. Example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
        main() {
                putenv("term=vt320");      // set variable system("set");
                // show settings
        }
</pre></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>sizeof</b></span>: int
sizeof(list): This function performs the same action as
sizeoflist().</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>sizeoflist</b></span>: int
sizeoflist(list): This function determines the number of names held
in a list. Example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
        list
                l;
        int
                i;
        list = makelist ("*.c"); i = sizeoflist (l); printf ("There are
        ", i, " names in the list.\n");
</pre></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>stat</b></span>: list stat(int, string): This function
attempts to retrieve file attributes of the file specified by the
second string argument. The first int argument may be P_CHECK or
P_NOCHECK. When absent, P_CHECK is assumed. The making process is
aborted when stat() fails to retrieve file attributes and when
P_CHECK is given for the first argument. The returned list holds
the following information:
</p><p>a. The first element is a string representation of the mode
of the file or directory. This string can be converted to an int
where the following bits represent the modes:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The bit S_IFDIR is set when the entry is a
directory.</p></li><li><p>The bit S_IFCHR is set when the entry is a
character-special.</p></li><li><p>The bit S_IFREG is set when the entry is a regular
file.</p></li><li><p>The bit S_IREAD is set when the entry is
readable.</p></li><li><p>The bit S_IWRITE is set when the entry is
writeable.</p></li><li><p>The bit S_IEXEC is set when the entry is
executable.</p></li></ul></div><p>The second element is the file size, also represented as a
string.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>strlen</b></span>: int
strlen(string): This function returns the number of characters in
the string which is supplied as its argument. Its working is
analogous to the function strlen() in C.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>strlwr</b></span>: string
strlwr(string): This function returns a copy of the string which is
supplied as argument in lower case.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>strupr</b></span>: string
strupr(string): This function returns a copy of the string which is
supplied as argument in upper case.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>strtok</b></span>: list
strtok (string, string): This function parses the first string in
substrings, separated from each other by the separators specified
in the second string. Each substring is an element of the returned
list. If no separators are specified (i.e., the second string is
empty), the individual characters of the first string become the
elements of the returned list. Example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
        list
                l;
        int
                i;
        l = strtok("Hello-world\n", "-");
        printf("Two elements: ", l, "\n");
        l = strtok("Hello-world\n", "");
        printf("A string of ",
        sizeof(l), " characters\n");
</pre></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>substr</b></span>: int
substr(string, string) This function searches for the string which
is given as the second argument in the string given as first
argument. The position where the second string occurs in the first
string is returned. The value -1 is returned when the second string
does not occur in the first string.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>system</b></span>: int
system(int, string): This function activates the operating system's
command interpreter to run the command defined by the argument. The
string holds the command to execute and, if needed, its arguments.
</p><p>The first argument specifies whether a failure of the
system() function should terminate the making process. The value of
this int may be P_CHECK or P_NOCHECK. This argument may be absent,
in which case P_CHECK is assumed. The return value of system() is
zero when the command could successfully be executed. A return
value which is not zero can be received by the makefile only when
P_NOCHECK is given as first argument.</p><p>system() succeeds if the command could be executed and if the
return value of the command itself is zero.</p></li></ol></div></div></div>
