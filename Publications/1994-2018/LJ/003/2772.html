    Fred van Kempen is tha author of the &ldquo;net2&rdquo; networking code
    and is currently co-owner of a startup called ARIS that is
    putting together a commercial-quality Linux-based system.
    The following interview was conducted via e-mail in late
    April.

must be another side to you. What do you do for fun?
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Fred:</b></span> Apart from catching up
my reading and sleeping every now and then (I tend to forget doing
both of these...) hacking, listening to music a lot, and attending
to family matters pretty much fill up my days. Hmm, perhaps people
will now understand why my computers are named &ldquo;metallica&rdquo;,
&ldquo;bonjovi&rdquo; and such? (smile)</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>Linux Journal</i>:</b></span> When did you
get interested in computers? What inspired it?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Fred:</b></span> In 1984 or so. Our
school has this huge IBM (The Computer), which had all of our
grades and such stuffed away. I then decided I'd be a computer
technician one day...</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>Linux Journal</i>:</b></span> When did you
first start working with Linux?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Fred:</b></span> Uhm, in October 1991.
I just switched from a 20MHz 286 to a 25MHz 386DX, and a giant hard
disk crash terminated the Minix system that was running on it. I
then tried a number of UNIXes on that machine, and ultimately a
friend dropped some disks with the MCC 0.96c release. It ran pretty
well, and was quite fast, even on the slow 25MHz CPU.</p><p>I had seen systems like 386BSD crawl on it, so...</p><p>Then, after installing stuff like news and such (all ports
from the Minix system, as I got to like that stuff for its being
small and simple) I started reading news again, and found that
someone was about to release TCP/IP for Linux. This was just what I
was doing with Minix at the time, and I decided to stick with Linux
at least until after I checked the TCP/IP stuff. That, by the way,
was Linux 0.98.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>Linux Journal</i>:</b></span> For those
unfamiliar with your contribution to the Linux effort, describe
what you have done.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Fred:</b></span> Well, mostly system
cleanups (the Linux kernel structure has come a long way since 0.95
or so..) and of course the networking code. After some ugly flamish
messages on the network, the original Linux NET author decided to
quit the project, and I took over. Since then, the Linux NET code
has been vastly improved, and it made Linux a real operating
system, capable of competing with other UNIX-like systems like
386BSD and such.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>Linux Journal</i>:</b></span> Why did you
decide to do it?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Fred:</b></span> I have always been
doing network-related things, even in the era in which I was
programming PDP-11 computers in assembly. Taking over the NET
effort was natural, as I was already rewriting major parts of it,
with in mind a system, compatible with &ldquo;existing standards&rdquo; as much
as possible.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>Linux Journal</i>:</b></span> Did you do
the work alone or did others get involved?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Fred:</b></span> I started out on my
own, but later on several people joined the team. Of course, having
multiple minds work on code is usually good for the code, because
each person has a different view. I think the current NET
development team is one of the better network programming teams
around.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>Linux Journal</i>:</b></span> Who are the
others? Does each person have a specific task or area of
expertise?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Fred:</b></span> The others are:</p><p>Laurence Culhane: SLIP driver author, pre-alpha tester
(<a href="mailto:mycroft@holmes.demon.co.uk">mycroft@holmes.demon.co.uk</a>
)</p><p>Mattew Dillon: Tester, &ldquo;skb&rdquo; code debugger, general
race-condition tracer, tidbits-tracer
(<a href="mailto:dillon@apollo.west.oic.com">dillon@apollo.west.oic.com</a>)</p><p>Johannes Stille: TCP-hacker. Johannes spent a great deal of
time on improving the TCP module, and the results are very good.
Also, a lot of tracing, testing, etc.
(<a href="mailto:stille@titan.westfalen.de">stille@titan.westfalen.de</a>)</p><p>Terry Dawson: Testing, especially on slow (HAM) links which
can cause very funny (ahem) situations.
(<a href="mailto:terryd@extro.ucc.su.oz.au">terryd@extro.ucc.su.oz.au</a>)</p><p>Fred Baumgarten: Testing, race-conditions, Netstat system,
HAM link testing.
(<a href="mailto:dc6iq@insu1.etec.uni-karlsruhe.de">dc6iq@insu1.etec.uni-karlsruhe.de</a>)</p><p>Danny ter Haar: Testing the code, often with fatal results
for his disks. We had some fun during the first set of &ldquo;code
cleanups&rdquo; ... ;-)</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>Linux Journal</i>:</b></span> You are a
ham, right? Does your Linux work and being a ham fit
together?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Fred:</b></span> Yes, I recently passed
my US HAM test. Well, being someone highly interested in using and
improving the art of digital communications over radio links, doing
this on a system for which networking is natural is only a plus.
The latest-and-greatest release of Linux Networking was designed to
fit all kinds of networking experiments in an easy-to-implement
way. As such, using Linux for HAM-like activities (meaning sending
and receiving mail, talking to other people in general, exchanging
knowledge and such) feels good. It's what made Linux in the first
place...</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>Linux Journal</i>:</b></span> Does Linux
work with AX.25 (amateur packet) code?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Fred:</b></span> Yes. Right now, there
are three ways to connect HAM equipment to a Linux machine:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Use the Linux version of the NOS software, either
the WAMPES release, or the JNOS/Linux release. Personally, I prefer
the JNOS code. This means running a user-level program, which
handles all the ugly details. No kernel code is required.</p></li><li><p>Use the AX.25 kernel code currently developed by
Alan Cox. This code works fine, but needs a modified kernel to
run.</p></li><li><p>Use the new code I am writing for Linux. This is a
long-term project, and right now, is only of interest for people
who are willing to spend a lot of time re-implementing a set of
horrible protocols. &lt;laugh&gt;</p></li></ol></div><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>Linux Journal</i>:</b></span> Do you see a
future for you and Linux?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Fred:</b></span> Well, I certainly
would hope so. I am co-owner of a US company which is trying to
introduce Linux in the commercial market.</p><p>ARIS Technology, Inc (we usually call it ARIS, or even just
ATI) is a small company located at the Technology Park of the
Mississippi State University in Starkville, MS. It was founded by
Dr. Michael L. Stokes, computer programmer and researcher at MSU's
&ldquo;Engineering for Research&rdquo; (ERC) facility, and later I joined
him.</p><p>ATI's short term plans are to consult with medium to large
companies interested in bringing Internet into their business. We
use Linux to do this when PC's will do the job because it will save
money. As part of this plan, we will offer turn-key Linux systems
through a local (Starkville) computer dealer. Longer term plans are
to offer a commercial version of Linux based on Linux/PRO in CDROM,
tape and diskette distributions.</p><p>This OS will offer a good stable platform for other
commercial software vendors to support, and will support licensed
software such as Motif 2.0, WordPerfect, etc. The distribution will
be mostly licensed under GPL, though some custom desgined software
will carry a license similar to SUN's (source code available free
to licensed users for personal non-commercial use).</p><p>(ATI is reachable through the Internet at ARIS.COM. My
address there is
<a href="mailto:waltje@ARIS.COM">waltje@ARIS.COM</a>, Dr.
Stokes' address there is
<a href="mailto:stokes@ARIS.COM">stokes@ARIS.COM</a>.
)</p><p>One of the advantages to this method of Linux availability
could be that the commercial software developers, with all their
great but usually DOS or &ldquo;commercial UNIX&rdquo;-based applications, may
notice our efforts, and get interested in Linux as a platform to
which they can port their products. Also, the fact that Linux is
cheap has pushed many organizations and companies into installing
it for business, fun or semi-personal use. After doing that, they
usually find that a UNIX-like system, however cheap, needs a system
administrator to keep it running smoothly. I think Linux created a
lot of jobs in these fields, which is good...</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>Linux Journal</i>:</b></span> Do you have a
vision of what the Linux community will look like in a few
years?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Fred:</b></span> Depending on what some
of the recent Linux projects produce (I am talking about ELF/COFF,
iBCS and Wine here), Linux users will either continue to be
semi-hackers like now, who use Linux for fun (as there won't be any
real applications) or standard things (mail, news etc.) or there
may come some sort of shift towards the &ldquo;business&rdquo; and
&ldquo;semi-business&rdquo; class of users, who use Linux systems for
applications, like they would use a &ldquo;any-commercial-UNIX-here&rdquo; now.
Right now, it is hard to say what will happen.</p><p>Personally, I think the Linux community will have to get used
to (a) paying some money for the software they use (for example,
shareware and commercial applications), and (b) a somewhat more
closed development environment of the system itself. Many, many
people will disagree, and exactly this program is what is keeping
Linux from a major breakthrough in The Real World.</p><p>This really is a shame, because Linux has proved the fact
that expensive, commercial software doesn't always do a job better
than a free system. The only thing keeping the commercial systems
ahead is the fact that they have the support of the third-party
application developers, which Linux does not have.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>Linux Journal</i>:</b></span> Thanks for
