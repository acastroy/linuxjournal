    A mail transport agent that combines advanced capabilities
    with easy configuration.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1182580.0x127a298"></a></h2></div></div><p>As a Linux (or Unix) user you are
certainly familiar with the program you use to read your electronic
mail. It may be mail, mailx, elm, mush or pine but it preforms the
function of allowing you to access your mailbox in an orderly
fashion. This program is called a mail user agent or MUA.
</p><p>But, how does all that mail get in the mailbox? And when you
send mail, how does it get routed properly? That is the job of the
mail transport agent or MTA.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1182580.0x127a3f8"></a>Introduction to Sendmail+IDA</h2></div></div><p>It's been said that you aren't a REAL Unix system
administrator until you've edited a sendmail.cf file. It's also
been said that you're a crazy person if you've attempted to do so
twice :-)</p><p>Sendmail is an incredibly powerful program. It's also
incredibly difficult to learn and understand for most people. Any
program whose definitive reference (Sendmail, published by O'Reilly
and Associates) is 792 pages long quite justifiably scares most
people off.</p><p>Sendmail+IDA is different. It removes the need to edit the
always-cryptic sendmail.cf file and permits the administrator to
define the site-specific routing and addressing configuration
through relatively easy-to-understand 'tables'. Switching to
sendmail+IDA can save you many hours of work and stress.</p><p>Compared to the other major mail transport agents, I've yet
to find anything that you can't do faster and simpler with
sendmail+IDA. Typical things needed to run a normal UUCP or
Internet site are absolutely trivial to accomplish. Normally
difficult configurations are simple to create and maintain.</p><p>At this writing, the current version of sendmail5.67b+IDA1.5
is available via anonymous ftp from ftp.uiuc.edu. It compiles
without any patching required under Linux.</p><p>All the configuration files required to get sendmail+IDA
sources to compile, install, and run under Linux are included in
newspak-2.0.tar.gz which is available via anonymous ftp on
sunsite.unc.edu in the directory /pub/Linux/system/Mail.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1182580.0x127a6b8"></a>Sendmail+IDA Configuration Files -
Overview</h2></div></div><p>Traditional sendmail is set up through a system configuration
file, typically /etc/sendmail.cf or /usr/lib/sendmail.cf, that is
not anything close to any language you've seen before. Editing the
sendmail.cf file to provide customized behavior can be a humbling
experience.</p><p>Sendmail+IDA makes such pain essentially a thing of the past
by having all configuration options table-driven with rather
easy-to-understand syntax. These options are configured by running
m4 (a simple macro processor) or dbm (a simple database processor)
on a number of data files via Makefiles supplied with the
sources.</p><p>The sendmail.cf file defines only the default behavior of the
system. Virtually all special customization is done through a
number of optional 'tables' rather than by directly editing the
sendmail.cf file.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>mailertable - define special behavior for a remote
host or domain</p></li><li><p>uucpxtable - force UUCP delivery of mail to a
domainized host</p></li><li><p>pathtable - define the pathalias-style UUCP path to
a remote host or domain</p></li><li><p>uucprelays - short-circuit the pathalias path to
well-known remote hosts</p></li><li><p>genericfrom - convert internal addresses into
generic ones visible to the outside world</p></li><li><p>xaliases - convert generic addresses to/from valid
internal ones</p></li><li><p>decnetxtable - convert SMTP addresses to
decnet-style addresses</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1182580.0x127ad98"></a>The sendmail.cf file</h2></div></div><p>Description</p><p>The sendmail.cf file for sendmail+IDA is not edited directly,
but is generated based on an administrator-specified m4
configuration file. This file creates a few definitions and
otherwise points to the tables where the 'real work' gets done. In
general, it is only necessary to specify the paths used on the
local system, the name(s) the site is known by for e-mail purposes,
and which default mailer (and perhaps smart relay host) is
desired.</p><p>There are a large variety of parameters that can be defined
to establish the behavior of the local site or to override
compiled-in configuration items. These configuration options are
identified in detail in the documentation that comes with the
sources in the file &lt;IDA_SOURCE_DIR&gt;/ida/cf/OPTIONS.</p><p>Example</p><p>A m4 file for a minimal configuration (UUCP or SMTP with all
non-local mail being relayed to a directly connected smart-host)
can be as short as 10 or 15 lines excluding comments.</p><p>A typical sendmail.m4 file for a UUCP-only site who talks to
an Internet relay host is shown below.</p><p>Virtually all systems should set the DEFAULT_HOST,
DEFAULT_MAILER, and PSEUDONYMS.</p><p>UUCP hosts will probably also need to define the UUCPNAME,
RELAY_MAILER, and RELAY_HOST parameters.</p><p>If your site is SMTP-only and talks 'Domain Name Service',
you would change the DEFAULT_MAILER to TCP-A and probably delete
the RELAY_MAILER and RELAY_HOST lines.</p><p><a href="2771f1.jpg" target="_self">See Figure 1</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1182580.0x127b210"></a>The mailers.linux LOCAL_MAILER</h2></div></div><p>Most operating systems provide a program to handle local
delivery of mail. Typical programs for the major variants of Unix
have defaults in the sendmail+IDA binary. In Linux, it is necessary
to explicitly define the appropriate local mailer since a local
delivery program is not necessarily present in the distribution
you've installed. This is done by specifying the LOCAL_MAILER_DEF
in the sendmail.m4 file.</p><p>The following example is how you would set the local mail
delivery program to be the commonly available (and ported to Linux)
program 'deliver' to provide this function.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2771f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
EXAMPLE
</p></div></div><p>There is a also built-in default for 'deliver' in the
sendmail+IDA Sendmail.mc file that gets included into the
sendmail.cf file. To specify it, you would not need a mailers.linux
file and would instead define the following in your sendmail.m4
file:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
dnl -- (in sendmail.m4) --
define(LOCAL_MAILER_DEF, DELIVER)dnl
# mailer for local delivery
</pre><p>Unfortunately, Sendmail.mc assumes deliver is installed in
/bin, which is not the case with Slackware1.1.1 (which installs it
in /usr/bin). In that case you'd need to either fake it with a link
or rebuild deliver from sources so that it resides in /bin.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1182580.0x127b630"></a>Sendmail+IDA dbm Tables</h2></div></div><p>Sendmail+IDA provides a number of tables to provide the
ability to override the default behavior of sendmail (specified in
the sendmail.m4 file) and define special behavior for unique
situations, remote systems, and networks. These tables are
post-processed with dbm using the provided Makefile.</p><p>Most sites will need few, if any, of these tables. If your
site does not require these tables, the easiest thing is probably
to make them zero length files (with 'touch') and use the default
Makefile in $LIBDIR rather than editing the provided
Makefile.</p><p>A generic site that is on Internet and speaks Domain Name
Service (or one that is UUCP-only and forwards all mail via UUCP
through a smart RELAY_HOST) probably does not need any specific
table entries at all.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1182580.0x127b7e8"></a>mailertable</h2></div></div><p>Description</p><p>The mailertable defines special treatment for specific hosts
or domains based on the remote host or network name.</p><p>It is frequently used on Internet sites to use a particular
protocol (uucp/smtp) to forward to an intermediate mail relay host
or gateway in order to reach a remote network.</p><p>UUCP sites will generally not need to use this file.</p><p>Order is important. Entries match based on a top-down
interpretation of the rulesets so it is generally wise to place the
most explicit rules at the top of the file and the more generic
rules below.</p><p>Example</p><p>Suppose you want to forward all mail for a mythical
JoeUniversity via UUCP to a relay host 'sysA'. To do so, you would
have a mailertable entry that looked like the following:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# (in mailertable)
#
# forward all mail for the domain .joe-u.edu via uucp to sysA

UUCP-A,sysA .joe-u.edu
</pre><p>Suppose you want all mail to the larger .edu domain to go to
a different relayhost 'sysB' for address resolution and delivery.
The expanded mailertable entries would look quite similar.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# (in mailertable)
#
# forward all mail for the domain .joe-u.edu via uucp to sysA

UUCP-A,sysA .joe-u.edu
#
# forward all mail for the domain .edu via uucp to sysB
UUCP-A,sysB .edu
</pre><p>As mentioned above, order is important. Reversing the order
of the two rules shown above will result in all mail to joe-u.edu
going through the more generic 'sysB' path through the explicit
'sysA' path that is really desired.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# (in mailertable)
#
# forward all mail for the domain .edu via uucp to sysB

UUCP-A,sysB .edu

#
# no mail for joe-u will go through sysA because the above
# rule was matched and used by sendmail

UUCP-A,sysA .joe-u.edu

#
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1182580.0x127bcb8"></a>Mailertable Format</h2></div></div><p>In the mailertable examples above, the UUCP-A mailer means
use UUCP delivery with domainized headers. The comma between the
mailer and remote system tells sendmail to merely forward the
message to 'sysA' for address resolution and delivery. Mailertable
entries are of the format:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
MAILER DELIMITER RELAYHOST HOST_OR_DOMAIN
</pre><p>There are a number or possible mailers. The differences are
generally in how they treat addresses.</p><p>Typical mailers are TCP-A (tcp/ip with Internet-style
addresses), TCP-U (tcp/ip with UUCP-style addresses), UUCP-A (uucp
with Internet-style addresses).</p><p>The choice of the character separating the mailer from the
host portion on the left-hand-side of a mailertable line defines
how the address is modified by the mailertable.</p><p>! - (exclamation point) means strip off the recipient hostname
before forwarding to the mailer</p><p>, - (comma) means do not change the address in any way. Merely
forward via the specified mailer to the specified relay host</p><p>: - (colon) means remove the recipient hostname only if there
are intermediate hosts between you and the destination</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1182580.0x12728b8"></a>uucpxtable</h2></div></div><p>Usually, mail to hosts with fully-qualified-domain-names is
delivered via Internet-style (SMTP) delivery based on the domain
name server (DNS) configuration. The uucpxtable forces delivery via
UUCP routing by converting the domainized name into a UUCP-style
un-domainized remote hostname.</p><p>It is frequently used when you're a MX forwarder for a site
or (sub)domain or when you wish to send mail via a direct and
reliable UUCP link rather than potentially multiple hops through
the default mailer and any intermediate systems and
networks.</p><p>UUCP sites that talk to UUCP neighbors who use domainized
mail headers would use this file to force delivery of the mail
through the direct UUCP point-to-point link between the two systems
rather than using the less direct route of through the RELAY_MAILER
and RELAY_HOST or through the DEFAULT_MAILER.</p><p>Internet sites who do not talk UUCP probably would not use
the uucpxtable.</p><p>Example</p><p>Suppose you provide MX forwarding service to a system called
'foo.bar.com' in DNS and 'foobarcom' in the UUCP maps. You would
need the following uucpxtable entry to force incoming mail for
their host to go through your direct UUCP connection.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#======= /usr/local/lib/mail/uucpxtable  ==========
#Mail sent to joe@foo.bar.com is rewritten to foobarcom!joe and
#therefore delivered via UUCP

hosts or networks. The pathtable file should be in pathalias-style
syntax, sorted alphabetically.</p><p>Most systems will not need any pathtable entries.</p><p>Example pathtable</p><pre     class="programlisting">

to occur after a DNS lookup has occurred. It permits the
administrator to make shorthand names available for commonly
referenced systems or domains by replacing the shorthand name with
the proper one automatically. It can also be used to replace
incorrect host.domain information with 'correct'
information.</p><p>Most sites will not need any domaintable entries.</p><p>Example</p><pre     class="programlisting">

sendmail generally runs setuid-root.</p><p>Changes to the aliases file do not take effect until the
'/usr/lib/sendmail -bi' command is executed to build the required

used. Consult with the documentation that comes with the
sendmail+IDA sources for details.</p><p>uucprelays</p><p>The uucprelays file is used to 'short-circuit' the uucp path
to especially well-known sites rather than using a multi-hop or
unreliable path generated by processing the UUCP maps with
pathalias.</p><p>genericfrom and xaliases</p><p>The genericfrom file hides local usernames and addresses from
the outside world by automatically converting inside usernames to
generic 'From' addresses that do not match internal

the genericfrom and aliases file so that both incoming and outgoing
username translations occur from a master xaliases file.</p><p>decnetxtable</p><p>The decnetxtable rewrites domainized addresses into

transport and delivery agents and there is no &ldquo;one true directory

pieces of the system (Usenet news, mail, tcp/ip) agree on the
location of the local mail delivery program (lmail, deliver, etc.),
remote mail delivery program (rmail), and the mail transport
program (sendmail or smail). Such assumptions are not generally
documented, although use of the 'strings' command can help
determine what files and directories are expected. The following
are some problems we've seen in the past with some of the commonly
available Linux binary distributions and sources.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Some versions of the NET-2 distribution of tcp/ip
have services defined for a program called 'umail' rather than

'deliver', but expects it to be located in /bin rather than the

Sites</h2></div></div><p>Frequently, Internet hosts will have trouble getting mail
into misconfigured remote sites. There are several variants of this
problem, but the general symptom is that mail is bounced by the
remote system or never gets there at all.</p><p>These problems can put the local system administrator in a
bad position because your users generally don't care that you don't
personally administer every system worldwide (or know how to get
the remote administrator to fix the problem). They just know that
their mail didn't get through to the desired recipient on the other
end and that you're a likely person to compain to.</p><p>A remote site's configuration is their problem, not yours. In
all cases, be certain to NOT break your site in order to
communicate with a misconfigured remote site. If you can't get in
touch with the Postmaster at the remote site to get them to fix
their configuration in a timely manner, you have two
options.</p><p>It is generally possible to force mail into the remote system
successfully, although since the remote system is misconfigured,
replies on the remote end might not work...but then that's the
remote administrator's problem.</p><p>You can fix the bad headers in the envelope on your outgoing
messages only by putting a domaintable entry for their host/domain
that results in the invalid information being corrected in mail
originating from your site:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# (in domaintable)
braindead_site.correct.domain.com braindead_site.wrong.domain.com
</pre><p>or.....</p><p>Treat them as totally brain-dead and strip off all
hostname.domain information in the envelope of messages to them
from your site.</p><p>The '!' in the following results in mail being delivered to
their remote site and appearing to be locally originated (for
sendmail purposes). The return address for your site will not be
changed, so the proper return address will still show up in the
message.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# (in mailertable)
TCP!braindead_site.correct.domain.com braindead_site.wrong.domain.com
</pre><p>Regardless, even if you get mail into their system, there is
no guarantee that they can reply to your message (they're broken,
remember...) but then their users are yelling at their
administrators rather than your users yelling at you.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1182580.0x12746f8"></a>Forcing Delivery to a Remote System via UUCP or
SMTP</h2></div></div><p>Without use of any of the optional DBM tables, sendmail+IDA
delivers mail via the DEFAULT_MAILER (and possibly RELAY_HOST and
RELAY_MAILER) in the m4 file used to generate sendmail.cf. It is
easily possible to override this behavior through entries in the
domaintable or uucpxtable.</p><p>Forcing mail to be transferred via UUCP</p><p>In an ideal world (from the Internet perspective), all hosts
have records in the Domain Name Service (DNS) and will send mail
with fully qualified domain names.</p><p>If you happen to talk via UUCP to such a site, you can force
mail to go through the point-to-point direct UUCP connection rather
than through your default mailer by essentially 'undomainizing'
their hostname through the uucpxtable. The result is that sendmail
will then determine (via UUCPNODES in the sendmail.cf m4 file) that
you are directly connected to the remote system and will queue the
mail for delivery with UUCP.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# (in the uucpxtable)
# un-domainize sys2.com to force UUCP delivery
sys2 sys2.com
</pre><p>Preventing mail from being delivered via UUCP</p><p>The opposite condition also occurs. Frequently, systems may
have a number of direct UUCP connections that are used infrequently
or that are not as reliable and always available as the default
mailer or relay host.</p><p>For example, in the Seattle area there are a number of
systems that exchange the various Linux distributions via anonymous
uucp when the distributions are released. These systems talk UUCP
only when necessary, so it is generally faster and more reliable to
send mail through multiple very reliable hops and common (and
always available) relay hosts rather than through unreliable direct
point-to-point UUCP links.</p><p>It is easily possible to prevent UUCP delivery of mail to a
host that you are directly connected to. If the remote system is
domainized, you can add an entry in the domaintable that will fully
domainize the hostname, and prevent a match by the UUCPNODES line
in the sendmail.cf m4 file. The result is generally that mail will
go via the relay_mailer and relay_host (or default_mailer).</p><pre     class="programlisting">

file called /usr/local/lib/mail/sendmail.st file and reports the
number of messages and number of bytes transferred by each of the
mailers used in the senmail.cf file. This file must be created by
the local administrator manually for sendmail logging to occur. The
running totals are cleared by removing and recreating the
sendmail.st file. One way is to do the following:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cp /dev/null /usr/local/lib/mail/sendmail.st
</pre><p>Probably the best way to do quality reporting regarding who
uses mail and how much volume passes to, from, and through the
local system is to turn on mail debugging with syslogd. Generally,
this means running the /etc/syslogd daemon from your system startup
file with a line in /etc/syslog.conf that looks something like the
following:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
mail.debug /usr/adm/syslog.mail
</pre><p>The sendmail.st file does not grow enough to be a concern. If
you use mail.debug and get any medium to high mail volume, the
syslog output can get quite large. Output files from syslogd
generally need to be rotated or purged on a routine basis from
cron.</p><p>There are a number of commonly available utilities that can
summarize the output of mail logging from syslog. One of the more
well known utilities is the syslog-stat.pl file that is distributed
with the sendmail+IDA sources.</p></div></div>
