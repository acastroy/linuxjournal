telecommunications dictionary&rdquo;. This new edition weighs in at 1110
pages and is totally filled with computer and telecommunications
terms. Although you probably won't be looking for everything in the
book you can be fairly sure that what you are looking for is
there.</p><p>For example, look under &ldquo;error control protocols&rdquo; and you
will find a very good explanation of V.42, MNP and LAP-M stretching
to about a page. Or look up &ldquo;group 1, 2, 3, 3bis &amp; 4&rdquo; and get
another one-page explanation of various FAX standards. I even found
&ldquo;pentium&rdquo; in the book. I had to look for PEP, Telebit's proprietary
modem protocol, to stump the book.</p><p>If it has anything mildly to do with telecommunications it
seems to be in the book. That's the good news. But there's some bad
news as well. First, the whole book is set in Helvetica type. This
works ok for short definitions but it becomes just plain hard to
read for longer explanations. The type face is fairly large so that
isn't a serious problem, but Harry could have made a better book
and saved a lot of paper by doing the work in a serifed face and
smaller point size.</p><p>The second problem with the book is an assortment of small
errors. For example, the 8088 is described as the 8-bit version of
the 16-bit 8080. Most anyone knows the 16-bit cousin is the 8086,
not the 8080, but such an error makes me nervous that there may be
some real hidden &ldquo;gotchas&rdquo; hidden in the more technical
information. The book even defines the 80387SX as the coprocessor
for the 80385SX microprocessor. Yeah, we all know that this was
supposed to be the 80386SX as the book has already said but, once
again, simple typos like this scare me.</p><p>The bottom line? I think Newton's book is worth purchasing,
but I hope the 7th edition addresses these concerns.</p></div></div>
