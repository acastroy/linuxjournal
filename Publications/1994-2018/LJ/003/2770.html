    In a previous issue, Jeff discussed ways to reduce disk
    space usage under Linux. In this sequel article, he shows
    some useful techniques for making the best use of another
    valuable resource&mdash;memory.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf05580.0xffd298"></a>Introduction</h2></div></div><p>Like most Unix-compatible operating systems, the single most
important factor in determining the performance you get out of
Linux is often the amount of physical memory available. This is
often a source of confusion to users accustomed to other systems
such as MS-DOS. Since many Linux users are on a tight budget, the
option of simply purchasing more memory is not always feasible.
This article presents some ways in which you can make better use of
the memory you already have.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf05580.0xffd3a0"></a>Background</h2></div></div><p>Linux implements a demand-paged virtual memory system.
Processes have a large (4 gigabyte) virtual memory space. As
virtual memory is referenced, the appropriate pages are transferred
between disk and physical memory.</p><p>When there are no more physical memory pages available, the
kernel swaps some older pages back to disk. (If they are code pages
that have not been changed, then they are just discarded; otherwise
they are written to the swap areas.)</p><p>Disk drives are mechanical devices; reading and writing to
disk is several orders of magnitude slower than accessing physical
memory. If the total memory pages required significantly exceed the
physical memory available, the kernel starts spending more time
swapping pages than executing code. The system begins thrashing,
and slows down to a crawl. If this increases to a point where the
swap device becomes fully utilized, the system can virtually come
to a standstill. This is definitely a situation we want to
avoid.</p><p>When extra physical memory is not in use, the kernel attempts
to put it to work as a disk buffer cache. The disk buffer stores
recently accessed disk data in memory; if the same data is needed
again it can be quickly retrieved from the cache, improving
performance. The buffer grows and shrinks dynamically to use the
memory available, although priority is given to using the memory
for paging. Thus, all the memory you have is put to good
use.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf05580.0xffd5b0"></a>Tools for Measuring Memory Utilization</h2></div></div><p>In order to know what your memory situation is and whether
any changes you make are resulting in improvement, you need to have
some way of measuring memory usage. What tools do we have at our
disposal?</p><p>When the system first boots, the ROM BIOS typically performs
a memory test. You can use this to identify how much physical
memory is installed (and working) in your system, if you don't know
already. On my system, it looks something like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ROM BIOS (C) 1990
008192 KB OK WAIT......
</pre><p>The next piece of useful information is displayed during the
Linux boot process. Output such as the following should be
displayed:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Memory: 7100k/8192k available (464k
kernel code, 384k reserved, 244k data) ...
Adding Swap: 19464k swap-space
</pre><p>This shows the amount of RAM available after the kernel has
been loaded into memory (in this case 7100K out of the original
8192K). You can also see if the swap space has been properly
enabled. If the kernel bootup messages scroll by too quickly to
read, on many systems you can recall them at a later time using the
&ldquo;dmesg&rdquo; command.</p><p>Once Linux is running, the &ldquo;free&rdquo; command is useful for
showing the total memory available (which should match that shown
during boot-up), as well as a breakdown showing the amount of
memory being used, and the amount free. (If you don't have a &ldquo;free&rdquo;
command, you can use &ldquo;cat /proc/meminfo&rdquo;.) Both physical memory and
swap space is shown. Here is a typical output on my system:</p><div class="table"><a name="N0xf05580.0xffd8c8"></a><p class="title"><b> Here is a typical output on my system:</b></p><table     summary=" Here is a typical output on my system:" border="1"><colgroup><col><col><col><col><col></colgroup><tbody><tr><td><p>total</p></td><td><p>used</p></td><td><p>free</p></td><td><p>shared</p></td><td><p>buffers</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Mem:</p></td><td><p>7096</p></td><td><p>5216</p></td><td><p>1880</p></td><td><p>2328</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Swap:</p></td><td><p>19464</p></td><td><p>0</p></td><td><p>19464</p></td><td><p>2800</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>The information is shown in kilobytes (1024 bytes). The
&ldquo;total&rdquo; memory is the amount available after loading the kernel.
Any memory being used for processes or disk buffering is listed as
&ldquo;used.&rdquo; Memory that is currently unused is listed in the &ldquo;free&rdquo;
column. Note that the total memory is equal to the sum of the
&ldquo;used&rdquo; and &ldquo;free&rdquo; columns.</p><p>The memory indicated as &ldquo;shared&rdquo; is an indication of how much
memory is common to more than one process. A program such as the
shell typically has more than one instance running. The executable
code is read-only and can be shared by all processes running the
shell.</p><p>The &ldquo;buffers&rdquo; entry indicates how much of the memory in use
is currently being used for disk buffering.</p><p>The &ldquo;free&rdquo; command also shows very clearly whether the swap
space is enabled, and how much swapping is going on.</p><p>To better understand how the kernel uses memory, it is
instructive to watch the output of the &ldquo;free&rdquo; command as the system
is used. I'll show some examples taken from my own system; I
suggest you try similar experimentation yourself.</p><p>On bootup, with one user logged in, my system reports the
following:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
        total   used    free    shared  buffers
Mem:    7096    2672    4424    1388    1136
Swap:   19464   0       19464
</pre><p>Note that we have considerable free memory (4.4MB) and a
relatively small disk buffer (1.1MB). Now watch how the situation
changes after running a command that reads data from the disk. (In
this case I typed <b  >ls -lR /</b>.)</p><pre     class="programlisting">
        total   used    free    shared  buffers
Mem:    7096    5104    1992    1396    3460
Swap:   19464   0      19464
</pre><p>We see that the disk buffer has grown by over 2 MB. This
brings the &ldquo;used&rdquo; memory up correspondingly, and the free memory
down. Next, I start up the X Window system and examine the
results:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
        total   used    free    shared  buffers
Mem:    7096    7016    80      3112    3792
Swap:   19464   8       19456
</pre><p>This has caused the memory used to increase to 7MB, leaving
only 80K free. The increase is to support the additional processes
running (the X server, window manager, xterm, etc...). Note that
the disk buffer didn't shrink, because there is still free memory.
Remember: &ldquo;free&rdquo; memory means memory that is being wasted.</p><p>Now I start up the GNU chess program, having it play against
itself. This starts two instances of a rather large program:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
        total   used    free    shared   buffers
Mem:    7096    7016    80      1080    860
Swap:   19464   5028    14436
</pre><p>We see now that the disk buffer has shrunk down to less than
1MB and we are 5MB into swap to accommodate the large processes.
Because of the swapping, the system has slowed down, and heavy disk
drive activity can be heard. There is still a small amount of free
memory. (The kernel tries to prevent user processes from taking all
of the available memory; it reserves some for the &ldquo;root&rdquo; user
only.)</p><p>The next step is to exit the X Window system and the
applications running under it; here is the result.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
        total   used    free    shared  buffers
Mem:    7096    2444    4652    412     1480
Swap:   19464   728     18736
</pre><p>We now have lots of free memory, the swap usage is almost
gone (some idle programs are still presumably swapped out), and the
disk buffer is starting to grow again.</p><p>The &ldquo;top&rdquo; and &ldquo;ps&rdquo; commands are also very useful for showing
how memory usage changes dynamically, and how individual processes
are using memory. For the scenario described earlier, we can see
from the output of &ldquo;ps&rdquo; that each of the two chess processes was
taking almost 8MB of virtual memory, obviously more than could fit
in physical memory, causing the system to thrash.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
USER  PID %CPU %MEM SIZE  RSS TTY STAT START   TIME COMMAND ...
tranter   282  4.1 34.4 7859 2448 v01 D  14:08 0:11 gnuchessx 40 5
tranter   285  7.9 30.7 7859 2180 v01 D  14:09 0:21 gnuchessx 40 5
...
</pre><p>Another facility for getting system status information is
built into the virtual console driver. This depends on your
keyboard mapping, but the default for the US keyboard is to use the
Scroll-Lock key. Pressing &lt;Alt&gt;&lt;Scroll Lock&gt; shows the
current value of the CPU registers. The &lt;Shift&gt;&lt;Scroll
Lock&gt; combination shows memory information, similar to the
&ldquo;free&rdquo; command, but more detailed. Finally, &lt;Ctrl&gt;&lt;Scroll
Lock&gt; will give information on individual processes, much like
the &ldquo;ps&rdquo; command.</p><p>These keys can be particularly handy if your system is slow,
or appears to have crashed. Note that if you are running the syslog
daemon, this information will probably be logged to a file instead
of being displayed on the console. On my Slackware system for
example, it is logged to the file /var/adm/syslog.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf05580.0xff55f8"></a>Increasing Available Memory</h2></div></div><p>Now that we have some measurement tools at our disposal, its
time to try to improve the memory situation. The first line of
attack is before Linux boots&mdash;your ROM BIOS setup program has some
options that may increase the amount of memory available. Many
systems can shadow the ROM address ranges in RAM, because it is
faster than ROM. Unlike MS-DOS, however, Linux doesn't use the ROM
BIOS routines, so disabling this can free close to 200K of memory
(if you still run MS-DOS occasionally then you may not want to do
this).</p><p>Incidently, now is also a good time to look at your other
setup options and do some experimentation. You may be able to
improve CPU performance with the options to enable caching and
setting the CPU clock speed. One way to measure this is to use the
BogoMIPs rating displayed when Linux boots as an indicator of CPU
speed (this is not always accurate though, because as everyone
knows, BogoMIPs are &ldquo;bogus&rdquo;). If you boot Linux from a hard disk,
you may also be able to speed up reboot times by disabling the
floppy disk drive seek at bootup. Don't change too many settings at
once, or you may not know which changes are having a positive
effect. Be sure to write down your original settings in case you
put your system in a state where it will no longer boot.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf05580.0xff5758"></a>Recompiling the Kernel</h2></div></div><p>Are you still using the default kernel that came when you
installed Linux? If so, shame on you! Kernel memory is
special&mdash;unlike the memory pages used by processes, the kernel is
never swapped out. If you can reduce the size of the kernel, you
free up memory that can be be used for executing user programs (not
to mention reducing kernel compile times and disk storage).</p><p>The idea here is to recompile the kernel with only the
options and device drivers you need. The kernels shipped with Linux
distributions typically have every possible driver and file system
compiled in so that any system can boot from it. If you don't have
network cards, CD-ROM, SCSI, and so on, you can save considerable
memory by removing them from the kernel. Besides, you can't really
consider yourself a Linux hacker if you've never recompiled a
customized kernel yourself.</p><p>If there are drivers that you only need occasionally,
consider building several kernels, and set up LILO to let you
choose an alternate kernel when booting. If you have a math
coprocessor, you can consider taking out the FPU emulation routines
as well. You can also remove any of the Linux file systems that you
do not require.</p><p>More advanced Linux hackers might want to look at the
&ldquo;modules&rdquo; facility which allows for loadable device drivers. With
this you can dynamically add and remove drivers without rebooting.
This facility has been available for some time to kernel hackers,
and it has now become a part of the standard kernel. This facility
is particularly useful for rarely used devices such as tape drives
that are only occasionally used for backup purposes.</p><p>Finally, make sure you are running a recent kernel. Newer
kernels, as well as (in most cases) being more stable, also have
improvements in memory usage.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf05580.0xff59c0"></a>Compiling Applications</h2></div></div><p>If you develop your own applications, or compile code you
obtain from the Internet or bulletin board systems, then using the
right compile options can reduce the memory used. Turning on
optimization will generally produce code which is smaller and
executes faster, as well as requiring less memory. A few
optimizations, such as in-line functions, can make the code larger.
You should also check that your executables are dynamically linked
and stripped of debug information.</p><p>Which optimizations are best depend on the specific
application and even on the version of compiler used; you may wish
to experiment.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf05580.0xff5b20"></a>Reducing Memory Usage Further</h2></div></div><p>Once Linux is up and running your new kernel, it's time to
look at where the memory is going. Before you even log on, how many
processes are running?</p><p>The bare minimum for a Linux system would typically
be:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>init (this starts all other processes)</p></li><li><p>update (this periodically writes the disk buffers
to disk)</p></li><li><p>a single getty (which becomes your shell when
logged in)</p></li></ul></div><p>Run &ldquo;top&rdquo; and see what is running on your system. How many
getty processes do you need? Do you really need all those other
processes such as lpd, syslogk, syslogd, crond, and selection? On a
standalone system, you don't need to run full networking
software.</p><p>If you are using an init package that supports multiple run
levels, you might want to consider defining several different run
levels. This way you could, for example, switch your system between
full networking and running standalone, allowing you to free up
resources when you don't need them.</p><p>You can also examine some of your larger executables to see
if they were built with the appropriate compiler and linker
options. To identify the largest programs, try using a command such
as this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ls -s1 /bin /usr/bin /usr/bin/X11 |  sort -n | tail
</pre><p>Strictly speaking this only finds the largest files, but file
size is usually a good indication of the memory requirements of a
program.</p><p>The most common shell under Linux is GNU BASH. While very
functional, it is also quite large. You can save memory by using a
smaller shell such as the Korn shell (usually called ksh or
pdksh).</p><p>The emacs editor is also big; you could use a smaller editor
such as vi, jove, or even ed instead.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf05580.0xff6150"></a>The X Window System</h2></div></div><p>If you ran the command line described earlier, one of your
largest binaries was probably the X server. The X Window system
takes a lot of memory resources.</p><p>The first question to consider is, do you really need to run
X? Using the virtual consoles and selection service you can have
multiple windows supporting cut &amp; paste of text using a mouse.
Particularly while performing large compiles (such as the kernel),
you should consider the option of simply not running X.</p><p>There is also a windowing system called &ldquo;mgr&rdquo; than can be
used as an alternative to X, but requires less memory.</p><p>If you decide to use X, then you can obtain replacements for
some of the standard tools that require less resources. &ldquo;Rxvt&rdquo; is
similar to xterm, but requires significantly less memory. The
window manager &ldquo;fvwm&rdquo; will also use less resources than others, and
&ldquo;rclock&rdquo; is a small X-based clock program. These three tools,
written by Robert Nation, can make running X feasible on a machine
that constantly swapped before.</p><p>How many programs do you run on the X desktop? Run &ldquo;top&rdquo; to
see how much memory is being taken by xclock, xeyes, xload, and all
those other goodies you think you need.</p><p>The &ldquo;Tiny X&rdquo; package, put together by Craig I. Hagan,
contains the Korn shell, fvwm window manager, rxvt, rclock, X
server, and the minimum of other files needed to run X. The package
is small enough to fit on one 3.5" floppy disk. Also included are
some useful notes on saving memory under X.</p><p>With the techniques described here, you can run small X
applications reasonably well on a machine with only 4 megabytes of
memory. On machines with more memory, the same methods will allow
you to run larger applications and free up memory to use for disk
buffering.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf05580.0xff6468"></a>Conclusions</h2></div></div><p>By combining the techniques I've described, the net effect on
system performance can be well worth the effort. I encourage you to
experiment, and along the way you'll almost certainly learn
something new.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf05580.0xff6570"></a>For More Information</h2></div></div><p>The software mentioned in this article is available on a
number of Internet archive sites, including sunsite.unc.edu and
tsx-11.mit.edu. I suggest getting a copy of the Linux Software Map
to help track down the software you need.</p><p>If you want to learn more about how the Linux kernel
implements memory management, check out &rdquo;The Linux Kernel Hackers'
Guide&ldquo;, by Michael K. Johnson, part of the Linux documentation
project. Appendix A of that document includes an extensive
bibliography of books covering operating system concepts in
general.</p><p>&rdquo;How to Maximize the Performance of X" is periodically posted
to the Usenet newsgroup news.answers, and contains more ideas for
improving X performance on small systems.</p></div></div>
