    This article will explain how to program the VT interface to do
    things
    which can't easily be done with &ldquo;escape sequences&rdquo; on a Linux console,
    giving a reference for the ioctl()'s needed to do this. Much of this

were consecutive, for those of you who aren't up on some of the
weirdness of Linux history ...), Orest Zborowski1 undertook the
task of getting the X Windowing System to run on Linux. Instead of
taking the short-sighted methods and spending his time porting X to
Linux, Orest ported Linux to X. To do this, he wrote the orginal
Unix-domain sockets for Linux and the VT interface, which is a
subset of the VT interface under SVR4. Later, Andries Brouwer2, who
did most of the work for loadable keymaps, added more keyboard
handling functionality.
</p><p>This article will explain how to program the VT interface to
do things which can't easily be done with &ldquo;escape sequences&rdquo; on a
Linux console, giving a reference for the ioctl()'s needed to do
this. Much of this column is derived from a document written by
Orest, as he is interested in disseminating this information
further.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1391580.0x1489450"></a>The VT interface</h2></div></div><p>The VT interface is a set of ioctl()'s that can be performed
on any console device. VT's are tightly bound to VC's, or virtual
consoles. They are named differently because they are called VT's
in SVR4, and also because in the source there is some
differentiation between VT operations and VC operations. VT
numbering is the same as VC numbering: 0 is a synonym for the
&ldquo;current&rdquo; VT, and all real VTs start from 1. In all the ioctls
below, it is legal to use VT 0 as the target of the ioctl&mdash;it
simply affects the VT that's currently active.3</p><p>This is different from SVR4, where 0 is the first VT, and
/dev/console is the current VT. This difference is due to the fact
that the orignal VC's in Linux used VC 0 as /dev/console, whereas
SVR4 makes /dev/console a seperate device. This does not cause
problems in practice, fortunately.</p><p>The header files sys/vt.h and sys/kd.h are pretty much
complete, according to SVR4 rules, but much of their content is
unsupported by Linux. The header file</p><p>The linux/keyboard.h file maintains more information dealing
with keyboard mapping, and contains the parts written by
Brouwer.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1391580.0x1489660"></a>VT Reference</h2></div></div><p>ioctl(int ttyfd, KIOCSOUND, unsigned int count)</p><p>KIOCSOUND will turn on a sound using the relation</p><pre     class="programlisting">

count_ticks is composed of two pieces: the upper 16 bits hold the
number of ticks (hundredths of a second under Linux/86, at least;
see the HZ define in linux/sched.h) that you want the sound to
last, while the lower 16 bits hold the count, which is the same as
the count argument to KIOCSOUND. The call returns

<b  >0x3b4</b> to <b  >0x3df</b> (which covers
the common graphics ports). For access to ports outside this range,
use the <b  >ioperm(2)</b> system call.</p><pre     class="programlisting">

mode.</p><p>Bugs: No special provisions are made to save or restore the
contents of the VT during this call. It is up to the application to
save any necessary information for later restoration. This is
because chipset-specific information is required to properly save
or restore the contents of the VT.</p><pre     class="programlisting">

</pre><p><b  >GIO_SCRNMAP</b> returns the console
translation table. See the keymap package for details. VT switching
When the user types &lt;Alt&gt;-&lt;Fn&gt;, where n is the number
of a VT, the kernel will switch to that VT. The same sequence
happens if some process performs an <b  >ioctl(fd, VT_ACTIVATE,
n);</b></p><p>First, if the &ldquo;switch-to&rdquo; VT is in <b  >VT_AUTO</b>
mode, then the kernel will ignore the switch request if it's also
in <b  >KD_GRAPHICS</b> mode, else it will continue the
switch.</p><p>If the &ldquo;switch-to&rdquo; VT is in <b  >VT_PROCESS</b>
mode, the relsig signal is sent to the &ldquo;switch-from&rdquo; process so it
can release the VT. If the process accepts the signal, the kernel
will await the <b  >VT_RELDISP ioctl</b> from it. If the
process has died, the VT is forcib-ly reset to
<b  >KD_TEXT</b> and VT_AUTO mode. This can cause great
confusion and unhappiness, but the kernel can't do anything
better.</p><p>The &ldquo;switch-from&rdquo; process will need to perform any cleanup,
and issue the <b  >VT_RELDISP ioctl</b>, telling the
kernel that it is OK to continue the switch. It is also possible
for it to deny the switch, in which case the kernel discontinues
the switch.</p><p>If the &ldquo;switch-from&rdquo; process has consented to the switch, the
kernel will change to the new VT, changing the keyboard mode and
LED's as well. Then, if the new VT is under
<b  >VT_PROCESS</b> control, the &ldquo;switch-to&rdquo; process is
sent the acqsig signal. If this process is missing, the new VT is
reset to <b  >KD_TEXT</b> and <b  >VT_AUTO</b>
mode. In this fashion, there is a certain amount of auto-resetting
going on during normal use. Of course, if a process makes graphics
changes in <b  >KD_GRAPHICS</b> mode, these will not be
undone by the kernel.</p><p>At this point the switch is complete. The &ldquo;switch-to&rdquo; process
may call <b  >VT_RELDISP VT_ACKACQ</b>, but this is not
required by the kernel. If there were any processes waiting for
this new VT to become active, they are woken at this point.</p><p>Examples</p><p>For most people, the X source code is far too large to easily
download, and far too large to easily study. There are, however,
other examples available. <b  >svgalib</b> provides an
easy-to-use interface to these functions, as well as providing a
consistent interface to VGA and some SVGA video boards. It also
serves as example code for those who want to roll their own code,
as it includes examples of using <b  >mmap()</b> and
<b  >ioperm()</b> to directly access video memory, once
it has used the <b  >ioctl()</b>'s described above so
that it is allowed to. The following code fragments descibe one way
to access ports and memory, without using svgalib.
<b  >PAGE_SIZE</b> is defined in
<b  >&lt;linux/page.h&gt;</b>, and
<b  >GRAPH_SIZE</b> and <b  >GRAPH_BASE</b> may
differ from video card to video card. This code is based on code in
vgalib version 1.2.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
FILE *mem_fd;
char *graph_get, *graph_mem;
if (ioperm(port, 1, 1)) {
   fprintf(stderr, "Can't access port %x\n", port); exit(1);
} if ((mem_fd = open("/dev/mem", O_RDWR)) &lt; 0) {
   fprintf(stderr, "Can't open /dev/mem\n"); exit(1);
} if ((graph_get = malloc(GRAPH_SIZE + (PAGE_SIZE-1))) === NULL) {
fprintf(stderr, "Insufficient memory\n");
   exit(1);
}
graph_mem = graph_get; if ((unsigned long)graph_mem % PAGE_SIZE)
   graph_mem += PAGE_SIZE - ((unsigned long)graph_mem % PAGE_SIZE);
graph_mem = (unsigned char *)
                mmap((caddr_t)graph_mem,
                        GRAPH_SIZE, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE,
                        MAP_SHARED|MAP_FIXED, mem_fd, GRAPH_BASE);
if ((long)graph_mem &lt; 0) {
   fprintf(stderr, "mmap error\n"); exit(1);
}
</pre><p>At this point, writing to <b  >graph_mem</b> is
actually writing to screen memory. <b  >iopl()</b> and
<b  >ioperm()</b> can also be used to get permission to
write to ports, as can the <b  >KDADDIO ioctl()</b>,
described above. The Linux Documentation Project man pages include
man pages on <b  >iopl()</b> and
<b  >ioperm()</b>, so I will not document them here, as
those man pages should have come with your Linux distribution. They
are accessible on sunsite.unc.edu as
/pub/Linux/docs/LDP/man-pages/* if you do not have them.</p><p>The DOS emulator also uses some of these calls to provide the
interface that DOS is used to having to real DOS programs, and to
allow DOS sessions to use the video bios provided with the video
card.</p><p>The definitive example code for most of the <b  >KD*i
ioctl()</b>'s is the keymap package, distributed with the
Linux kernel.</p><p>For next month, I plan to explain how these calls can be used
to write a screen-lock package for Linux, as my space and time are
up for this month.</p></div></div>
