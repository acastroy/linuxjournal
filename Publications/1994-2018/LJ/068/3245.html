    How to set up local and networked printing services in
    Linux.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15f5580.0x16ed450"></a></h2></div></div><p>In the 16th century, the printing press
opened up a whole new world of communications. Print was the first
mass communications medium, paving the way for books, magazines,
newspapers and all the other amenities of this generation. Although
we live in a world dominated by computers and electronics, the
printing press still plays an important role in our everyday lives.
This fact is especially apparent if you are reading the print
version of this magazine.
</p><p>Today, the power of the printing press is available to the
individual. Computers, printers and copy machines allow virtually
anyone to communicate effectively to any number of people. Better
still, it's easier and cheaper than ever.</p><p>One of the most common questions asked by newcomers to the
Linux world is how to get their printers working with Linux. There
are, in actuality, a few different ways to accomplish this task.
First, however, you must enable <span   class="bold"><b>lp</b></span>
support in the kernel and recompile. This is done in most kernels
already. To check if your kernel is ready, plug your printer in and
watch your kernel startup messages. If you see references to lp0 or
lp1, your kernel is configured for parallel printing.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15f5580.0x16ed660"></a>Setting it Up</h2></div></div><p>The most primitive way to print a text file is simply to use
the <span   class="bold"><b>cat</b></span> command to send it to the
printer at /dev/lp1:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cat filename.txt &gt; /dev/lp1
</pre><p>This will catenate the file (in this case, filename.txt) to
/dev/lp1, your printer device. Replace /dev/lp1 with the device
name of your printer, if it is different.
</p><p>The main problem with printing text files this way is that
most people get the dreaded &ldquo;staircase&rdquo; effect. It makes the
printed text look</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Something
   Like
      This.
</pre><p>This is not acceptable, so most people use
<span   class="bold"><b>lpd</b></span> (line printer daemon) to print
files. If you don't have lpd already installed, it is obtainable
from
<a href="ftp://metalab.unc.edu/pub/Linux/system/printing" target="_self">ftp://metalab.unc.edu/pub/Linux/system/printing/</a>
as the lpr-linux package. Once you have downloaded and installed
the software, you can add the following lines to one of your
startup scripts, in order to start lpd when the system boots.
<pre     class="programlisting">
if [ -f /usr/sbin/lpd ]; then
   echo -n "Starting lpd..."
   /usr/sbin/lpd
fi
</pre>


You might want to replace the path to lpd with your custom path.
</p><p>However, running lpd alone isn't very useful. All it actually
does is facilitate the queueing of print jobs. It does no
translating or converting&mdash;that's why print filters are used. As
you may know, many Linux and X applications can output and print to
PostScript. This includes Netscape and the GIMP. To take advantage
of these powerful applications and many others, you have to install
a filter for your specific printer. Several different printer
filter packages are available, so almost all popular printers are
supported.</p><p>To install a filter, the first thing you must do is download
the one you want. Many filters are available from the Sunsite Linux
archives at
<a href="ftp://metalab.unc.edu/pub/Linux/system/printing" target="_self">ftp://metalab.unc.edu/pub/Linux/system/printing/</a>.</p><p>The most popular print filters are
<span   class="bold"><b>apsfilter</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>magicfilter</b></span>. In addition to the
major print filters, there are many small converters and
translators as well as other printer filters available for download
at metalab. After you have downloaded the package you want, just
follow the directions provided and install the package. (Note that
metalab.unc.edu used to be sunsite.unc.edu.)</p><p>Now comes the tricky part. The lpd software reads from a
configuration file called the printcap, or printer capability
database. The printcap is a simple text file that holds the
information necessary for lpd to output to printers. It has vast
capabilities and options, but we're going to edit it in only the
simplest ways right now. Fire up your favorite text editor and open
the file /etc/printcap. If there is text currently in the file,
make sure you don't need it (it's all commented and annotated), and
comment out unneeded lines by placing a # symbol in front of the
first character of those lines.</p><p>At this point, you are ready to start entering printer
information into the file. Make sure you have installed your print
filter correctly before proceeding.</p><p>Append this <span   class="emphasis"><em>one</em></span> line to your
/etc/printcap file:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
if=/<span   class="emphasis"><em>path</em></span>_to/<span   class="emphasis"><em>print_filter</em></span>:
</pre><p>First, replace <span   class="emphasis"><em>name</em></span> with the name of
your printer. Second, replace <span   class="emphasis"><em>lpx</em></span> with the
device name of your printer, which is probably lp1. Finally,
replace <span   class="emphasis"><em>/path_to/print_filter</em></span> with the actual
path to your print filter. You must remember to change the
permissions of your installed print filter so that it is executable
and readable. Simply type:
<pre     class="programlisting">
chmod 755 /
</pre>


Also, make sure the print spool directory, /var/spool/lpd, exists.
If you want to print to a remote printer on another UNIX machine,
set up the printer on that machine, then append (don't start a new
line)
<pre     class="programlisting">
rm=remotehost:rp=remoteprinter:
</pre>


to the previous /etc/printcap entry shown above. If you decide to
do this, however, replace <b  >:lp=/dev/lpx:</b> with a
plain <b  >:lp=:</b>. For more options to put in the
printcap file, look at the man page for printcap (type
<b  >man&nbsp;printcap</b> at the prompt).
</p><p>Now, restart lpd by issuing the following command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
killall -HUP lpd
</pre><p>There should be a brief pause, then you will be dropped back
to a command prompt. If you've followed these directions correctly,
do a test print: fire up Netscape and print a test page. Click on
the File menu and select &ldquo;Print&rdquo; or &ldquo;Print Frame&rdquo;. Make sure
the Print Command field is set to
<pre     class="programlisting">
lpr -
</pre>


Of course, replace <span   class="emphasis"><em>printername</em></span> with the name
you gave your printer in /etc/printcap. There is no space between
the <b  >-P</b> and <span   class="emphasis"><em>printername</em></span>. To
print text files, you can open them up in a program that is
printer-aware (such as Netscape), or you can type the following on
a command line:
<pre     class="programlisting">
lpr -
</pre>


Replace <b  ><i><tt>printername</tt></i></b>
with the printer's name and replace
<b  ><i><tt>filename</tt></i></b> with the
name of the file you want to print. At this point, if all went
according to plan, there should be a nicely printed piece of paper
on your printer.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15f5580.0x16ee630"></a>Sharing Your Printers</h2></div></div><p>Now that you have your printer set up for yourself, you might
want to consider sharing it with the rest of the network. There are
a few ways of doing this. With other UNIX or Linux machines with
BSD-styled print systems, just follow the directions in the
previous section, and you'll be off and running. Pay attention to
the specified network configuration line.</p><p>The most likely scenario, however, is one Linux machine
sharing its printer or printers with one or more Windows machines.
To do this, you're going to want to use Samba, the SMB
implementation for UNIX, which runs quite well on Linux. After you
have finished setting up the printers, install Samba on the Linux
machine. Samba is available at
<a href="http://www.samba.org" target="_self">http://www.samba.org/</a> and
is open-source software as well.</p><p>Read through the Samba documentation to get it installed.
It's a quick install, but it does require some editing of
configuration files. For those of you who are impatient, here's a
simple configuration file to use (locate it at
/usr/local/samba/lib/smb.conf):</p><pre     class="programlisting">
[global]
   remote announce = 192.168.1.255
   interfaces = 192.168.1.1/255.255.255.0
   netbios name = your_computer_name
   workgroup = your_workgroup_name
   printing = bsd
   security = share
[public]
   comment = Public Stuff
   path = /tmp
   public = yes
   writable = yes
</pre><p>This will export one share for use on the network, named
&ldquo;public&rdquo;. If you have the Win95 machines set up with the same
parameters, you should be able to browse the public share and look
through all of its subdirectories.
</p><p>Once that is done, you're ready to add the printer. The
printer is added to the config file in the following manner:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
[printername]
   path = /
   printer name =
   writable = yes
   public = yes
   printable = yes
   print command = lpr -<span   class="emphasis"><em>Pprintername</em></span> %s; rm %s
</pre><p>Replace <span   class="emphasis"><em>printer_spool_dir</em></span> with the
printer's spool directory (I just use /tmp, but you can use
/var/spool/lpd/ if you wish) and <span   class="emphasis"><em>printername</em></span>
with the name of your printer (I just used hp).
</p><p>At this point, restart Samba:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
killall -HUP nmbd; killall -HUP smbd
</pre><p>Make sure you can still browse files across the network. This
time, you should see a printer icon with the assigned name from the
Samba configuration file.
</p><p>On the Win95 clients, it would be best to install a generic
PostScript printer. Then all your Win95 programs will output
PostScript, and the printer filter on your Linux server will be
able to both spool and print your documents as if they were local
documents. To add a network printer in Win95, select the
&ldquo;Network&rdquo; option when the Add Printer script prompts you.
However, this approach doesn't always work, and you might want to
use a more crude way of printing by changing the print command line
in the above config file snippet to the following:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
print command = cat %s &gt; /dev/lp1; rm %s
</pre><p>Replace /dev/lp1 with the device to which your printer is
attached. After you have replaced that line, re-install the printer
on your Win95 box as the actual type; i.e., if you have a LaserJet
4L, install it as a LaserJet 4L in Win95. Note that with this
method, no print spooling will take place on the Linux machine.

in Linux. If you're fortunate enough to have a network in your home
or office, you should also be able to set up the printer in
question for use on the network by other computers. If you're still
