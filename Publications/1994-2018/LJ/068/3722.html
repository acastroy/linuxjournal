that impacts your corporate strategy. Think about how you'd feel if
a guy sat down at your lunch table one afternoon when you were
interviewing an applicant for a vice-president's position and tried

you have a reasonable expectation of privacy and respect when
you're at a table for two in a public place, so too do the users of

pose?</p><p>From its origins in China, Weiqi has spread through Asia and
indeed throughout the world. In Korea, where it is most popular, it
is known as Baduk, while in Japan and elsewhere, it has the
familiar name Go. Its rules are simple and easily acquired, yet the
mathematical and logical complexities are vast and largely
unfathomable. Indeed, some say Go can be as demanding and subtle as
art or science, while the scope for personal expression is such
that it is said one cannot hide his personality on the Go board. So
what is your Linux box's personality like? Go find out!</p><p>The board is 19x19; the stones are round. Everything else is
just numbers, a dendrite path which I would
<span   class="emphasis"><em>vaguely</em></span> estimate to contain a number of paths
somewhere around 361!/111! (if we assume 250 moves per game).
Navigating this path well has proven to be an impossible task for
computers. Still, in the post-Deep Blue world, Go may be both the
most promising and the darkest frontier in artificial intelligence
gaming. From chess, we developed heuristic searches and witnessed
the power of brute force when we trimmed our search trees, not to
mention the parallel processing research which occurred during the
construction of Deep Blue. The subtlety of Go, which is less
materially dependent than chess and has more branches in the
dendrite with a less clear objective (territorial acquisition
rather than monarch hunting), has rendered brute force largely
ineffectual, and we have to resort to pattern recognition and
analysis and strange algorithms to make a computer think like a
human. What we learn from developing Go software could expand our
knowledge base of AI theory and techniques a great deal. The
computer chess authority Hans Berliner remarked that Go &ldquo;may have
to replace chess as the task par excellence for AI.&rdquo; Fortunately
for us Linux enthusiasts, there is some very high-quality Go
software floating about, free of charge and with the source code,
of course.</p><p>If you have long been frustrated by GNU Chess, you can get
back at the GNU Project by beating GNU Go&mdash;well, maybe not. While
computers are relatively worse at Go than at chess, GNU Go is not a
weak program. In fact, it recently took second place at the 1999
U.S. Computer Go Championship, winning the &ldquo;Best New Program&rdquo;
award as well. It has a text interface, but since it understands Go
modem protocol, it can also be played against other programs or
with the Cgoban interface. Check out
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gnugo/devel.html" target="_self">www.gnu.org/software/gnugo/devel.html</a>
if you're interested in playing or contributing to the
project.</p><p>

</p><p>Baduki, by Jim Laebum (who goes by Artist), is free Go
software with its own graphical interface. The program is actually
quite good, and the interface is nice. The board seems to have come
from the GIMP's wood pattern (I suspect, since I did this myself
for Go software I was writing). The software allows you to set
handicaps and play levels, and the interface scales to whatever
window size you like. Additionally, Baduki can give its rationale
for moves, show its thinking process and display alternate moves.
Baduki understands GMP (Go modem protocol); thus it can play on IGS
(Internet Go Server), NNGS (No Name Go Server) or against another
program such as GNU Go. The Baduki home page lives at
<a href="http://soback.kornet21.net/~artist/baduk/baduki.html" target="_self">soback.kornet21.net/~artist/baduk/baduki.html</a>.</p><p>

</p><p>CGoban (Complete Goban) by William Shubert is the Go
equivalent of xboard. It allows users to play Go against programs
(such as GNU Go or Baduki), or against other players on the
Internet Go servers. In addition, CGoban allows one to examine SGF
files, that is, game records. The interface looks quite nice (the
standard wooden board with black and white stones), scales to
whatever size you like, and should run on all UNIX systems with X.
CGoban will automatically connect you to the Go server of your
choice with a simple mouse click. The home page of CGoban is

</p><p>The Internet Go Server is the on-line meeting place for wired
Go enthusiasts the world over. You can
<span   class="bold"><b>telnet</b></span> in and play with a text
interface, or use a graphical interface like CGoban. IGS is similar
to the chess servers, with the typical commands applying like who,
match, observe, kibitz, tell and shout. I find the atmosphere to be
friendly enough, though less talkative than the chess counterparts.
Also, blitz Go seems to be less popular than blitz chess, and as
for lightning Go, I don't know. (Lightning chess is one or two
minutes per game, a rather difficult schedule for Go.) If you want
to check out IGS's well-designed web page (available in English,
Chinese, Korean and Japanese), go to
<a href="http://igs.joyjoy.net" target="_self">http://igs.joyjoy.net/</a>.
Or, if you want to go directly to the server, use
<b  >telnet&nbsp;igs.joyjoy.net 6969</b> (yes, port
6969). There are a few other Go servers wandering about, No Name Go
Server (NNGS) being one of the more popular. CGoban already knows
the addresses and will connect you automatically.</p><p>Whether Go interests you on a playing level or a programming
level, many on-line resources are available as well as software and
many excellent books. A visit to your local bookstore or gaming
shop should provide you with ample opportunity to foster an
obsession (assuming, of course, that you don't find it boring).
Likewise, if AI is your thing, Go is in need of creative solutions
and has a lot of scope for truly clever, brilliant thinkers. If you
become outstandingly fond of Go, you may even want to check out
your local club, which would probably be overjoyed to have a new
member. Happy Going! (Next month, something more violent...)</p><p>&mdash;Jason Kroll</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x150c580.0x19ff400"></a>STUPID PROGRAMMING
TRICKS&rarr;SCROLLTEXTS</h2></div></div><p>Last episode, we initialized console graphics (at great risk
to our system's health) but we didn't do much afterwards. Now it's
time for something truly impressive, a feat which Microsoft has
apparently not yet accomplished&mdash;a smooth scrolltext.</p><p>&ldquo;What is a scrolltext?&rdquo; you may ask, in particular if you
haven't been around on a Commodore 64, Amiga or PC and names like
Fairlight, Red Sector and Future Crew mean very little to you.
Hopefully, you've at least seen the intro screen from Jet Set
Willy. What it comes down to is this: scrolltexts are the most
exciting form of communication ever. Words that glide across the
screen, often advertising the latest release or copy party,
complaining about high school teachers, or detailing unfortunate
experiences at the hands of public transit, usually accompanied by
music (MODs) blaring in the background with animated graphics and
the ubiquitous star fields. Perhaps you've seen Microsoft's screen
saver which scrolls words across the screen and noticed it flickers
terribly. It is <span   class="emphasis"><em>very</em></span> simple to fix, so our
scrolltext won't flicker; then we can taunt the Microsofties to fix
their screen saver.</p><p>The routine is quite simple. We start by initializing three
graphics screens: a physical screen, a virtual screen and a scroll
board screen. The physical screen is the graphics context which
will be displayed, the virtual screen is the graphics context we
use as a whole-screen copy to the physical screen. That is, we make
changes to the virtual screen, and when everything's ready, copy it
to the physical screen. The third screen is the scroll board, a
virtual graphics context which will be wider than the physical
screen by one character (8 pixels) and will be only as tall as the
font itself (again, 8 pixels). Since we're using an 8x8 font and a
320x200 graphics screen, we can fit 40 (320/8) characters on a
line, making 41 characters for our scroll board. Once we've set up
these three contexts, we'll use a simple loop to get the letters
scrolling. After that, we can add anything we like: 3-D graphics,
dancing animals, star fields or anything else. Here's the
loop:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Write 41 letters to
<b  >scroll_board</b>.</p></li><li><p>Copy 40 letters from
<b  >scroll_board</b> to
<b  >virtual_screen</b>, always copying to the same
location on <b  >virtual_screen</b>, but copying from one
pixel farther to the right each time, so that at first we get the
first 40 letters, then the first 40 letters minus the first row of
pixels from the first letter but with the first row of pixels of
the 41st letter and so on, until we have scrolled 8 pixels (the
width of our current font).</p></li><li><p>After each copy of <b  >scroll_board</b>
to <b  >virtual_screen</b>, copy
<b  >virtual_screen</b> to
<b  >physical_screen</b> and hold for a vertical refresh.
(This makes things look smooth and lets us add things later, like
the dancing animals.)</p></li><li><p>Once we have moved 8 pixels forward in
<b  >scroll_board</b>, such that we are copying the 2nd
through the 41st letter (instead of the 1st through 40th), we
reprint 41 letters to <b  >scroll_board</b>, starting one
letter in, such that what was once, for example, &ldquo;Hello world
welcome to my glorious scroll&rdquo; would become, &ldquo;ello world welcome
to my glorious scrollt&rdquo;.</p></li></ul></div><p>This routine is fairly simple and requires only a couple of
variables: one to keep track of how many pixels in we are and one
to keep track of how many letters in we are. Also, we want to make
sure we don't run out of scrolltext and start scrolling bits of
random memory, which would ultimately lead to a segmentation fault.
While we might prefer to draw each letter individually and just
keep modulating around the length of the scrolltext, we get faster
drawing if we print characters as a string once instead of calling
<span   class="bold"><b>gl_writen</b></span> 41 times every time we
move 8 pixels. So, leave some blank space at the beginning and end
of your text to ensure smooth wrapping. We could also create the
whole scrolltext as one really long graphic, but that would be
cheating.
</p><p>Once the basic scrolltext is going, we can do all sorts of
fun things. We could, for example, have a sinusoid equation for the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>y</em></span> value of where the text is placed such that
it would bounce up and down on the screen, or we could insert some
graphics and possibly call <span   class="bold"><b>mikmod</b></span>
or <span   class="bold"><b>playmidi</b></span> to get some music
going. Compile with</p><pre     class="programlisting">

Board</h2></div></div><p>On September 30 at the Embedded Systems Conference in San
Jose, Lyle Ball and Bryan Sparks of Lineo proposed a group to be
called the Embedded Linux Advisory Board (EMLAB). This proposed
body would serve as an advocacy group, helping Linux to gain
greater visibility and name recognition in the embedded systems
arena through activities such as establishing Linux Pavilions at
embedded systems shows and promoting birds-of-feather sessions and
Linux presentation tracks. Other possibilities include:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Shared software development, for example, a GPL
flash-disk file-system driver. Like Linux itself, such software
offers a fundamental basis on which embedded systems may
grow.</p></li><li><p>Vendor-neutral comparisons of embedded Linux
approaches</p></li><li><p>Tracking and publicizing Linux design wins</p></li><li><p>Setting standards</p></li></ul></div><p>Funding would come from corporate sponsorship with
complimentary memberships open to community groups, such as Linux
Router Project or individual developers, via a nomination process.
</p><p>Lineo hopes to turn EMLAB over to an independent board to be
selected soon.</p><p>Present at the announcement were Lineo and some of its
customers and strategic partners including Ziatech, Motorola and
Intel. The press was represented by <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Weekly
News</em></span> and <i  >Linux Journal</i>.</p><p>Reaction from companies and groups not present was cautious,
though there is support for the idea of such an
organization.</p><p>Lineo has set up a server hosting an open mailing list and a
web site. For list subscription information, e-mail info@emlab.org.
