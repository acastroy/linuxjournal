    administrator.

computers by most companies today, the most important person in any
company is most likely the system administrator. I know we depend
heavily on ours. The hard disk on our server crashed the day we
were to start layout last month. Dan Wilder, our sys admin, worked
his magic to get us up and running in less than half a day. Without
him on site, downtime could conceivably have stretched long enough
that we would have missed our print deadlines. His solution was a
temporary one but it got us past the critical time, and he has
since replaced the disk completely.
</p><p>Home users are their own system administrators and get to
know the fun of logging on as root to give themselves
<span   class="emphasis"><em>more power</em></span>. Along with power comes
responsibility, and keeping the system secure for users&mdash;even if
only yourself&mdash;is a high priority. We have an article this month
for the new user about how to make your system secure after
installation, as well as one for the more advanced user on keeping
the domain name system secure.</p><p>We also have an article for company system administrators
dealing with integrating Linux in a large-scale network with other
systems. Last but not least, we start a two-part series on Virtual
Private Networking, a cool way to protect your network. And, of
course, don't forget the Strictly On-Line articles (see upFRONT)
which include four system administration topics: transparent
firewalls, building a firewall with IP chains, Kerberos and
Expect.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x123e580.0x1336450"></a>Awards</h2></div></div><p>We will be attending Comdex about the time this issue is

the Penguin Playoffs award winners for the Linux Business Expo.
Linus Torvalds will be there too, and will present the Penguin
