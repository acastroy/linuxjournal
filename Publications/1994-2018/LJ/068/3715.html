&ldquo;feature freeze&rdquo; for 2.3 was just announced. By the time you read
this, it will be down to last-minute testing and making sure all is
well before final release. What's new other than more device
drivers? I don't yet know everything new, but I do know that once
again, I'll need to learn new firewalling software. For 2.0, it was
<span   class="bold"><b>ipfwadm</b></span>--not bad, but no
fine-grained control. For 2.2, it is
<span   class="bold"><b>ipchains</b></span>--I liked the control, but
heard many complaints about its complexity, and I found very few
configuration tools for this beast. So I'm off to download and
compile the latest kernel to test the new
<span   class="bold"><b>netfilter</b></span> that will be 2.4's
packet mangling software. Here's hoping for configurability and
simplicity in one package.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>mason:</b></span>
<a href="http://www.pobox.com/~wstearns/mason" target="_self">http://www.pobox.com/~wstearns/mason/</a></p><p>This aptly named software is, you guessed it, a firewall
configuration program. Basically,
<span   class="bold"><b>mason</b></span> learns about the traffic
passing through your gateway (soon to be your firewall) and records
the traffic so you can build a firewall brick by brick (or chain by
chain, as it were). The recording is done in the form of a line
that can be used by mason or by the
<span   class="bold"><b>ipchains-restore</b></span> script. When the
software fires up, it checks what type of system you have: if it is
a 2.0.<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> system, it will use ipfwadm; if
2.2.<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span>, it will use ipchains. The new netfilter
software rules should not be significantly different from ipchains,
and support will be added before the 2.4.<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span>
release if it hasn't been already (some of the code was in place
but disabled in the version I tested). The software does require
you to review the rules, so you do need to be able to read and
understand them to decide which rules to keep. It requires bash,
ipchains or ipfwadm, and a kernel built with firewall
support.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>si:</b></span>
<a href="http://si.netpedia.net" target="_self">http://si.netpedia.net/</a></p><p>This command-line system information utility will fill pages.
<span   class="bold"><b>si</b></span> will tell most folk more than
they ever cared to know about their system, what resources (IRQs,
DMAs, etc.) are being used, what programs are running, how much
memory they're using, etc. The information can be obtained by other
programs, but it will take a few. In fact, I'm not sure what more
information you could get or want. While I haven't verified it, I
suspect this program is reading a good part of the /proc tree to
return all this information; at least, it matches the information I
know to be available, just not as easily readable in /proc. It
requires glibc.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>system-info:</b></span>
<a href="http://blaine.res.wpi.net/files/system-info.0.7.tar.gz" target="_self">blaine.res.wpi.net/files/system-info.0.7.tar.gz</a></p><p>Going from information overload to almost underwhelming by
comparison, this utility will provide one page of information
nicely formatted in HTML&mdash;great for putting something up on a web
page. I looked, and while it had a fair amount of information for
only one page's worth, it was innocuous enough. I would feel safe
putting this on a public web page, whereas the utility above is
more information than even a wannabe cracker would want (or need).
It requires Perl.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>DNS sleuth:</b></span>
<a href="http://atrey.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/~mj/linux.html" target="_self">atrey.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/~mj/linux.html</a></p><p>This little jewel is a DNS checker. With both a command-line
interface and a web interface,
<span   class="bold"><b>sleuth</b></span> will check whether the
configuration of your DNS complies with the RFCs. It will give you
warnings for some things and errors when it sees something
completely wrong. The best part is it will tell you what is wrong
and reference the RFC so you can see for yourself why it's bad and
how to fix it. No more guessing if it's correct or not&mdash;fast and
thorough. It requires Perl and the Net::DNS Perl module.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>landb</b></span>:
<a href="http://avenir.dhs.org/landb" target="_self">http://avenir.dhs.org/landb/</a></p><p>Have a large LAN? Thankfully, I don't any more. But if I did,
particularly one that spans buildings (much less floors), and
typically two or more /24 (class C) networks, I'd be using
something like this database to keep it sorted. It really is
overkill for a small network, though. I think I'd add a few comment
fields to hold a name and number or two for problems. Makes a nice
complement to a resource manager like MOT (Ministry of Truth) or
IRM (IT Resource Manager). It requires Perl, CGI, DBI, DBD modules,
MySQL and a web server.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>yafc</b></span>:
<a href="http://www.stacken.kth.se/~mhe/yafc" target="_self">http://www.stacken.kth.se/~mhe/yafc/</a></p><p><span   class="bold"><b>yafc</b></span> is yet another FTP
client. You may be thinking, &ldquo;I already have both graphical and
command-line FTP tools, and <span   class="bold"><b>ncftp</b></span>
(a command-line client to which this is a competitor) fills the
latter niche nicely.&rdquo; However, the nice thing about competition is
the newcomer has to have something that works better than the
incumbent, or otherwise why bother? Well, this one has&mdash;at least
for me. Side by side, I found yafc easier to use (important even to
a command-line-junkie like myself) and better designed. It has a
few parameters you can set, like <b  >cache</b> and
others. It requires libncurses, libreadline and glibc.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>august</b></span>:
<a href="http://www.lls.se/~johanb/august" target="_self">http://www.lls.se/~johanb/august/</a></p><p>It's been a while since I looked at any kind of HTML markup
editor, and I don't remember them being all that friendly or easy
to use, so my HTML editor of choice has always been
<span   class="bold"><b>vi</b></span>. Now, you've probably guessed
I'm not much of a webmaster (it's true, I'm not)--I'm into
substance over form. About the only thing I didn't see in
<span   class="bold"><b>august</b></span>, but would like to, is some
markup selections for PHP. It requires Tcl/Tk.</p></div></div>
