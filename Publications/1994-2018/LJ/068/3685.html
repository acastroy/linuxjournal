    A description of this new technology and its impact on machine
    performance.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xfc6580.0x10be8c8"></a></h2></div></div><p>In 1998, AMD (Advanced Micro Devices)
released a new family of x86 CPUs that included 3DNow! capability.
3DNow! is designed to deliver enhanced performance for certain
multimedia and floating-point operations. Other x86 clone CPU
manufacturers, such as Cyrix and IDT (Integrated Device Technology,
Inc.), also initially pledged to support 3DNow! in forthcoming
CPUs. Currently, 3DNow! support is provided by IDT's most recent
generation of processors (WinChip 2) as well as by AMD's K6-2, K6-3
and Athlon (K7) families of processors.
</p><p>In this article, we'll describe the 3DNow! technology
(especially how it impacts performance on the popular K6-2 and K6-3
CPUs) and show how to detect and take advantage of 3DNow! using
Linux. 3DNow! is an exciting development; using it effectively can
unleash outstanding performance by AMD and IDT processors.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xfc6580.0x10bea28"></a>What is 3DNow!?</h2></div></div><p>3DNow! builds on the Intel MMX (multimedia extensions to x86)
capability. Ariel Ortiz Ramirez described MMX and how to utilize it
with Linux in issue 61 of <i  >Linux Journal</i>, so we
won't go into much detail here about MMX. Briefly stated, MMX adds
eight 64-bit &ldquo;multimedia&rdquo; registers (MM0 through MM7), and 57
instructions that operate on those registers, to the x86 platform.
Multiple short integers can be stored (packed) into each multimedia
register, and the MMX instructions allow parallel computations on
these packed integers. While MMX is restricted to operation on
integers, 3DNow! extends the multimedia registers by enabling
multiple (two) single-precision floating-point numbers to be stored
(packed) into each of them. The 3DNow! instruction set includes 21
new operations on the multimedia registers. The majority of these
instructions provide fast, pipelined single-precision (packed)
floating-point computation.</p><p>3DNow! capability is well-suited for fast calculation of
common graphics operations such as clipping, lighting and 3-D
transformations, as well as special effects involving application
of physical models (e.g., fog, cloud and gravity effects). However,
any application with a fair amount of floating-point computations
can benefit from use of 3DNow! When used effectively, 3DNow! can
increase the floating-point throughput of an application by a
factor of two to four (or even more for some special-purpose
applications). The increased performance results because each
3DNow! operation produces two outcomes (packed into each multimedia
register), whereas standard floating-point operations by the
floating-point unit (FPU) produce only one outcome per
operation.</p><p>Furthermore, in the AMD K6-2 and K6-3, the MMX and 3DNow!
operations have access to dual pipelined execution units, enabling
up to two 3DNow! operations to execute simultaneously. Thus, up to
four results can be computed per processor clock cycle on the K6-2
and K6-3. (This compares to a maximum of one floating-point result
per clock cycle for the Pentium II; thus, a PII/450 has a peak
performance of 450 MFLOPS (million floating-point operations per
second) while a K6-2/450 has a peak performance of 1800 MFLOPS).
The standard floating-point computations on the AMD K6-2 and K6-3
are not pipelined, which means there is a delay of two or more
clock cycles between each concluded standard floating-point
computation. Using the 3DNow! capability can turbo-charge the
floating-point throughput of programs that utilize 3DNow!
instructions. For computers equipped with an AMD K6-2, K6-3 or IDT
WinChip2, peak floating-point performance is possible only for
programs that contain 3DNow! instructions.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xfc6580.0x10bec38"></a>Getting Started</h2></div></div><p>Unfortunately, few compilers can generate 3DNow! instructions
for compiled code. Thus, to exercise the 3DNow! capability in
programs written in high-level languages such as C/C++, FORTRAN or
Pascal, it's necessary to include explicit assembly code which has
3DNow! operations. This is not difficult to do, so we will
demonstrate how to use 3DNow! in C/C++ programs in Linux.</p><p>One way to determine whether a given machine supports 3DNow!
is to download and run an application that identifies the processor
and checks for 3DNow! capability. AMD has an application of this
type that can be downloaded from their corporate web site. A
practical solution for determining from within a program whether
the host CPU supports 3DNow! is to use the
<span   class="bold"><b>CPUID</b></span> instruction, which returns
information on processor features and is supported by the entire
x86 family. If a program determines that 3DNow! support is present,
it can exercise the appropriate sections of code which utilize
3DNow! Specifically, 3DNow! support can be determined by calling
the instruction <b  >CPUID 8000_0001h</b>. This
instruction sets flag bits in the EDX register according to the
CPU's level of multimedia support. Bit 31 of the EDX register
indicates whether there is 3DNow! support; thus, CPUID sets this
bit to 1 if the CPU supports 3DNow! If bit 30 is also set to 1, the
CPU supports the enhanced extensions to 3DNow! available in the new
AMD Athlon processor.</p><p>Some assemblers include support for 3DNow! instructions;
assembly language modules that include 3DNow! instructions will be
assembled without difficulty by such assemblers. However, many
assemblers do not include direct support for 3DNow! In many cases,
it is still possible to use 3DNow! instructions with those
assemblers, although it will be necessary to define the
instructions as pseudo-instructions using data blocks or emits.
Fortunately, AMD's web site has a C++ header file that contains
macro definitions for the 3DNow! instruction set. Inclusion of this
header file can enable development of embedded assembly code within
higher-level language programs. These macros specify the
hexadecimal decoding for the 3DNow! instructions using the
<span   class="bold"><b>emit</b></span> pseudo-instruction; the
header file may need to be modified for certain compilers, as not
all of them support emit. Under Linux, we used the freely available
Netwide Assembler (NASM) to assemble code. NASM allows
pseudo-instruction macros to be built using the
<span   class="bold"><b>db</b></span> command. We have created a
header file that defines the 3DNow! instructions using the
<span   class="bold"><b>db</b></span> commands. This header file is
available for download from
<a href="http://merlin.cs.uah.edu/visgig/threednow" target="_self">http://merlin.cs.uah.edu/visgig/threednow/</a>.
However, NASM versions from 0.98 and beyond support 3DNow!, so the
header file is needed only with older versions. Incidentally, we
found that NASM 0.97 doesn't allow MM2, MM3, MM6, or MM7 to be
result registers for 3DNow! operations. NASM 0.98 has no such
problem.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xfc6580.0x10bf000"></a>Using 3DNow in Gradient Computation</h2></div></div><p>Some applications are especially well-suited for 3DNow!, such
as graphics rendering. Optimizing applications with a tiny amount
of isolated floating-point operations may not be worth the effort,
due to the extra time associated with coding in assembly language.
There are several criteria to look at before deciding whether to
use 3DNow! with the K6-2 or K6-3. First, the application should
have at least a few single-precision floating-point computations
grouped in one part of the program, as there is some overhead
involved in switching into MMX/3DNow! mode. While in MMX/3DNow!
mode, standard floating-point operations that use the regular FPU
are not possible. Standard integer operations are fine while in
MMX/3DNow! mode. The new K7 reportedly won't have this overhead.
The MMX mode switch can also break up internal instruction
pipelining, which could add overhead. The best way to minimize the
impact of the overhead is to use 3DNow! in units that contain
several single-precision floating-point operations. Performance
will also be improved if the floating-point data is organized in a
successive, regular format (such as arrays of floating-point
numbers) that enables a series of 3DNow! operations to be performed
in sequence.</p><p>One application that can be efficiently implemented using
3DNow! is an image gradient calculation (edge detection),
especially range image gradients. To illustrate how 3DNow! can
enable efficient operations on Linux, we'll be looking at how the
gradient calculation can be optimized for range and volume data. In
an image collected on a 2-D grid, gradient is a measure of the
local change of pixel values (e.g., pixel intensity) at a
particular point; in a 3-D volume, gradient measures the difference
of intensity between a voxel (volumetric element) and its
neighbors. There are a variety of methods for determining the
gradient. For an image collected on a grid, one way to compute the
gradient is as the directional differences in value of the four
immediate neighbors (to the north/south and east/west) of each
pixel. When this difference is computed for the entire image, the
result is that points that lie on the border between regions
usually have strong gradient magnitudes. The gradient magnitudes
can be viewed as an image&mdash;they look like a collection of region
boundaries of the original image. The image in Figure 1 is a range
image produced from laser-range data. In a range image, each pixel
is a floating-point value which expresses the distance from the
viewing plane of the corresponding point on the imaged object.
We've displayed the image using intensities where brighter values
indicate closer points. Figure 2 shows the computed four-direction
gradient for the range image of Figure 1.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3685f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1.
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3685f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2.
</p></div></div><p>In general, the gradient magnitude at a particular point is
given by the equation</p><pre     class="programlisting">
|Gradient|=sqrt((0.5*delta(
</pre><p>where delta(<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span>) is equal to the change in
pixel intensity in the x direction and
delta(<span   class="emphasis"><em>y</em></span>) is the change in the y direction.
We've illustrated the gradient for pixel P1 in Figure 3. P1's
gradient magnitude is:
<pre     class="programlisting">
Gradient(P1)=sqrt(0.25*((depth(P2)-depth(P0))
+(depth(P4)-depth(P6))&lt;+&gt;2&lt;+&gt;)).
</pre>

</p></div></div>

</p><p>3DNow! is well-suited to perform this computation for range
images. Since range images can be stored as an array, points that
lie next to each other on a row will appear consecutively in
memory. MMX has an instruction,
<span   class="bold"><b>movq</b></span>, that moves a &ldquo;quadword&rdquo;
(four words&mdash;two single-precision floats) from memory into a
multimedia register. This means consecutive image pixels P4 and P5
can be loaded into a multimedia register with one move. If P6 and
P7 are loaded into another MMX register, we can use the 3DNow!
operation <span   class="bold"><b>PFSUB</b></span> to subtract the
contents of pairs of registers. The result of one 3DNow!
subtraction will be the delta(<span   class="emphasis"><em>y</em></span>) for both P1
and P2. One more subtraction can yield
delta(<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span>) for these pixels. Additionally,
3DNow! operations can be used to square
delta(<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span>) and delta(<span   class="emphasis"><em>y</em></span>), to
add them together, to apply the multiplicative factor and take the
square root. The whole process can be implemented using fewer
assembly instructions (and about half the execution time) than
would be required for implementations using standard floating-point
instructions.</p><p>We developed the assembly language function
<span   class="bold"><b>XYGRAD</b></span> to assist in calculating
range image gradients. (The code for this function can be found in
the archive file
<a href="../listings/068/3685.tgz" target="_self">ftp.linuxjournal.com/pub/lj/listings/issue68/3685.tgz</a>.)
The function processes a single row of image pixels at a time using
3DNow!. XYGRAD can be called from any C program using the prototype
shown in the code. After assembling XYGRAD with NASM,
<span   class="bold"><b>gcc</b></span> is used to link it with a C
program that utilizes XYGRAD.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xfc6580.0x10bfc60"></a>Understanding Gradient Calculation Using
3DNow!</h2></div></div><p>XYGRAD is passed as a pointer to the original image, called
img_ptr, along with the size of the row to process. The function
steps through each image row four pixels at a time. For a set of
four pixels, the change in intensity in the x direction is
calculated first. The quadword containing P0 and P1 is moved with
movq into MMX register MM0. P2 and P3 are moved into the MM1
register. These registers are then subtracted using the 3DNow!
packed subtraction (i.e., <b  >PFSUB</b>
<b  >MM0</b>, <b  >MM1</b>). The result is
stored in the first operand, MM0, which is later squared using the
packed multiplication operation (<b  >PFMUL</b>
<b  >MM0</b>, <b  >MM0</b>). Similar steps are
followed to calculate the gradient in the y direction, with the
squared difference being stored in the MM2 register. MM0 and MM2
are then added to get
delta(<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span>)&lt;+&gt;2&lt;+&gt;
+delta(y)&lt;+&gt;2&lt;+&gt;, which is stored in the output array
referenced by <span   class="bold"><b>result_img_ptr</b></span>.
After the whole image has been processed, a second 3DNow!-optimized
module is called by the C program to calculate the square root of
each pixel in the resulting image. This completes the gradient
calculation. The complete source code for both the C and assembly
modules used in the range image gradient calculation program can be
downloaded from
<a href="http://merlin.cs.uah.edu/visgig/threednow/gradient" target="_self">http://merlin.cs.uah.edu/visgig/threednow/gradient/</a>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xfc6580.0x10b6910"></a>3DNow! Optimizations</h2></div></div><p>One thing we kept in mind during the coding process is the
ability of the K6-2 and K6-3 CPUs to pipeline instructions in two
execution pipelines. Due to the architecture of these processors,
certain restrictions apply to the pipelining of 3DNow!
instructions. Namely, each 3DNow! instruction belongs to one of two
subsets, and two instructions from the same subset cannot be issued
in parallel. For instance, the packed floating-point subtraction
(PFSUB) and packed floating-point addition (PFADD) both belong to
the same subset, and therefore cannot be issued in the same clock
cycle. On the other hand, the packed floating-point multiplication
(PFMUL) belongs to the other subset of 3DNow! instructions;
therefore, PFMUL and PFADD instructions can execute simultaneously,
provided there is no operand dependency between them. It's
beneficial to interweave instructions from each subset as much as
possible to increase the likelihood of parallel computation. Most
integer MMX operations do not have such a restriction on the K6-2
and K6-3; achieving optimal floating-point performance does require
a little more consideration by the programmer.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xfc6580.0x10b6a18"></a>Gradient Calculation Performance</h2></div></div><p>Our 3DNow!-optimized gradient-calculation programs delivered
excellent performance. We conducted tests of the programs on a
dual-bootable PC with a 300MHz AMD K6-2 CPU to determine 3DNow!
performance in both Windows and Linux environments. On Linux, we
used the Netwide Assembler (NASM) version 0.98 to assemble the
assembly modules. We used GNU C (gcc) version 2.7 to compile a C
driver and link the driver to the assembly code. On Windows, we
used a popular commercial C compiler to assemble, compile and link
the assembly and C codes. The Windows assembler/compiler did not
recognize 3DNow! instructions, so we had to include the AMD header
file that defines 3DNow! using the pseudo-instruction macros. We
tested the 3DNow!-optimized gradient calculations on several range
images and 3-D volumes.</p><p>Tables 1 and 2 show performance results for two
representative data sets. In Table 1, the average CPU times for
execution of the 3DNow!-optimized range image gradient calculation
in Linux and Windows environments are shown. (Times are averaged
over 2000 trials for a 240x240 range image.) By comparison, the
3DNow!-optimized code ran about nine times faster under Linux than
unoptimized standard C code which computes the data according to
the same pattern of pixel access, i.e., the unoptimized code was
implemented purely in C without use of 3DNow! and was compiled
without any compiler optimizations. When the standard C version of
the gradient was compiled with maximal optimizations by gcc in
Linux (using optimization switches of
<b  >-O2&nbsp;-ffast-math</b>), it was still more than
three times slower than the 3DNow!-optimized code. This time,
improvement is significant; the 3DNow!-optimized version of the
range image gradient calculation can be done in real time at frame
rates under Linux. The performance improvement was nearly as
impressive for the volume gradient computations&mdash;the times shown in
Table 2 are for a 72x256x256 volume. The 3DNow!-optimized volume
gradient executed more than 2.5 times faster than fully optimized
standard C implementation, and better than 4.5 times faster than an
unoptimized standard C implementation.</p><p><a href="3685t1.html" target="_self">Table 1</a></p><p>We've also tested the performance of the standard C range
image gradient implementation (i.e., the implementation without
3DNow! code) on a Pentium II/333 running Linux. Using full compiler
optimizations, the 240x240 range image's gradient was computed in
17% more time on the PII than on the K6-2. Thus, we estimate that
the K6-2 can calculate range image gradient under Linux about 30%
faster than a comparably clocked PII. Of course, we should add that
it's generally easier to develop modules in C than in assembly
language.</p><p><a href="3685t2.html" target="_self">Table 2</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xfc6580.0x10b6d88"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>3DNow! is an exciting development for desktop computing,
offering the potential for significantly improved performance for
many applications. 3DNow! can be effectively utilized in Linux
using NASM and gcc. For applications that involve floating-point
calculations, especially those where speed is critical,
incorporating modules that utilize 3DNow! instructions can unlock
outstanding floating-point throughput in popular CPUs such as the
IDT Winchip 2 and the AMD K6-2, K6-3 and Athlon processors.</p></div></div>
