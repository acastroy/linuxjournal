    The authors describe how to split an existing network
    without affecting the configuration of the machines already
    present by using the proxy arp technique.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10fb580.0x11f3608"></a></h2></div></div><p>One of the most difficult problems when
dealing with a firewall is that the network or subnetwork we want
to protect usually has to be split into at least two subnetworks:
one on the external side and one on the internal, protected side.
This, apart from the planning stage, can result in the
reconfiguration of all machines in the network to the new
configuration. What is worse is that in case of a hardware fault of
the firewall, you'll have to reconfigure all machines in your
network so they will be able to see the outside until you repair
the firewall machine. The configuration of the firewall can be even
harder if you don't have access to the configuration of the machine
that actually connects your network to the external world, very
often a router or something leased from a telco (telephone
company).
</p><p>We are going to explain a smarter way of adding a firewall to
your network without breaking it into subnetworks or reconfiguring
any machine on the internal or external network, except from the
firewall machine itself, by just fooling the other machines into
thinking nothing changed. We will cover the aspects of the network
configuration and packet routing, not real packet-filtering
firewalling, since this has already been covered in depth in
another <i  >Linux Journal</i> issue (see
Resources).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10fb580.0x11f37c0"></a>Requirements and Assumptions</h2></div></div><p>In the practical examples, we will pretend we have a C class
network, where our contact with the external network is the .1
machine in the network (let it be a router, a machine or whatever).
We will assume the IP numbers .2 and .3 to be free for our use. We
will also need another IP greater than or equal to .4, so we must
be sure these aren't used for other purposes. Of course, with a
different network configuration, you'll have to adjust some
calculations to make the method fit your needs. To make things even
clearer in the examples below, let's fix our C class network to the
1.2.3.0 one.</p><p>As for the Linux box that will work as a firewall, you must
actually have the kernel compiled with the usual networking
options, including IP forwarding and IP firewalling and whatever
you else may need, for example, IP accounting. Also, enable IP
forwarding in the kernel; in newer kernels, this is done by
enabling it directly in the /proc file-system. (For example, by
using <b  >echo
1&gt;/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward</b>. Your initialization
scripts should take care of this.) Another thing to note is that
you should have a working <span   class="bold"><b>arp</b></span>
program installed on your system. In fact, some distributions are
shipped with an arp binary that is compiled without the new
SIOCSARP kernel interface, so it doesn't work, and if you forget to
check this one thing, it may cause you many unnecessary
headaches.</p><p>The Linux box must have two Ethernet cards installed: eth0,
connected to the internal network; and eth1, directly connected to
the gateway machine for our network to the world.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10fb580.0x11f3a28"></a>Network Configuration</h2></div></div><p>Now, the network interfaces on the firewall machine must be
configured. The internal network interface will be configured in
the same way as the other internal machines, as if it had all
machines on the network. So in our class C example, the eth0
configuration would be the following:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
inet addr :  1.2.3.4
network   :  1.2.3.0
broadcast :  1.2.3.255
netmask   :  255.255.255.0
</pre><p>Remember that in place of
<span   class="bold"><b>1.2.3.4</b></span>, you can use any other
unused address. The commands to do this are
<pre     class="programlisting">
ifconfig eth0 1.2.3.4 netmask 255.255.255.0\
   broadcast 1.2.3.255
route add -net 1.2.3.0
</pre>


This configuration will also apply to all machines in the internal
network behind the firewall; of course, the IP address will change
on each.
</p><p>The second network interface, eth1, will be configured as if
it had a very small network; actually, four IPs is the least we can
manage. This is where the firewall machine and the gateway will be
placed.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
inet addr :  1.2.3.2
network   :  1.2.3.0
broadcast :  1.2.3.3
netmask   :  255.255.255.252
</pre><p>This is obtained using the following commands:
<pre     class="programlisting">
ifconfig eth1 1.2.3.2 netmask 255.255.255.252\
   broadcast 1.2.3.3
route add -net 1.2.3.0
route add default gw 1.2.3.1
</pre>


The routing table is now set, so that packets for the entire class
C network will be redirected to the internal eth0 interface, while
the packets for the small network will be routed to the external
eth1 interface. Finally, the default gateway has to be set for all
machines on the internal network, that is, 1.2.3.1. Please note
that this routing scheme works because the most specific route is
applied first.
</p><p>There are two more questions to solve. First, how will the
gateway know how to reach the internal machines? Remember, we
haven't changed the gateway configuration, so it still thinks it
has the C class network attached to it. Second, how will the
machines be able to reach the gateway? After all, they still
believe they have the entire C class network, including 1.2.3.1, on
their network interface. Well, it will be easy; we just make
believe all the machines are on a class C network. The trick is to
hack the process of translating the IP address to the hardware (in
our case, Ethernet) address, which is called the ARP (address
resolution protocol). (If you're not familiar with this, please
consult the NET-HOWTO and Proxy-ARP miniHOWTO.) This can easily be
done by telling our firewall machine to answer all ARP requests for
the gateway on the internal network and reply to all requests for
any internal machines from the gateway. Practically, this is done
in two stages. First, by publishing, via arp, the gateway and the
firewall machine on the internal network, more exactly:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
arp -v -i eth0 -Ds 1.2.3.1 eth0 pub
arp -v -i eth0 -Ds 1.2.3.2 eth0 pub
</pre><p>Thus, when someone asks for .1 or .2 on the internal network,
the firewall will reply, giving its Ethernet hardware address. In
the second stage, we will publish all internal network IPs from .4
to .255, on the firewall-gateway small network. For the entire C
class network, it look like this:
<pre     class="programlisting">
arp -v -i eth1 -Ds 1.2.3.128 eth1 netmask\
   255.255.255.128 pub
arp -v -i eth1 -Ds 1.2.3.64 eth1 netmask\
   255.255.255.192
pub
arp -v -i eth1 -Ds 1.2.3.32 eth1 netmask\
   255.255.255.224 pub
arp -v -i eth1 -Ds 1.2.3.16 eth1 netmask\
   255.255.255.240
pub
arp -v -i eth1 -Ds 1.2.3.8 eth1 netmask\
   255.255.255.248
pub
arp -v -i eth1 -Ds 1.2.3.4 eth1 netmask\
   255.255.255.252 pub
</pre>


This way, we have partitioned the address space and published all
our IPs. When the gateway asks for the hardware address of an
internal machine, the firewall will reply giving its address. Since
we turned on the IP packet forwarding, once the firewall has a
packet and replies to the ARP request, it will forward it to the
destination machine according to the routing table.
</p><p>This solution has proven to be very useful for us, especially
when we had to enhance the existing network without causing &ldquo;too
much trouble&rdquo;. The last step is, of course, tuning the firewall,
IP accounting, transparent proxy or whatever you need on the Linux
box&mdash;but that is another story.</p><p><a href="3246s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
