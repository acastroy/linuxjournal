    Because the DNS plays such a vital role in the Internet, it
    is important that this service be protected and secured.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1757580.0x184f2f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>The Domain Name System (DNS) is essential
to the functioning of the Internet. The DNS organizes the Internet
into distributed hierarchical domains. This hierarchical domain
structure provides ease of administration and scalability. It must
be kept secure.
</p><p>In July of 1996, Eugene Kashpureff was able to hijack the
www.internic.net (Internic) web site to www.alternic.net
(Alternic). As a result, visitors to the Internic net site were
directed to the Alternic web site. This was done without
authorization from Internic. In late 1997, Kashpureff was arrested
in Canada. He pleaded guilty to computer fraud in March of 1998.
This incident serves to demonstrate the importance of DNS and the
impact that a security attack on the DNS could have on
organizations that provide services on the Internet. In today's era
of e-commerce and &ldquo;webification&rdquo; of everything, DNS security is
imperative.</p><p>BIND (Berkeley Internet Name Domain) is an implementation of
DNS. I will describe here the vulnerabilities discovered in BIND
and measures you can take to protect against them. I will assume
you are familiar with the workings of the Internet and the DNS
architecture.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1757580.0x184f4a8"></a>BIND Versions</h2></div></div><p>Two major BIND versions are available today: BIND version 4.9
and the BIND 8 series. Most new development of BIND continues on
the 8 series. The latest BIND, version 8.2.1, was released on June
21, 1999, and is available from
<a href="http://www.isc.org" target="_self">http://www.isc.org/</a>. In the
4.9 BIND series, the latest version of BIND is 4.9.7.</p><p>BIND is usually available as part of most UNIX-based
operating systems. However, vendors tend to be behind in adapting
to the latest BIND version. You can determine the version of BIND
provided by the vendor of your operating system by checking the
system log files.</p><p>The Internet Software Consortium (ISC) sponsors the
development of BIND. The latest version of BIND provides many new
features and security enhancements. Chief among these are full
support for negative caching, the ability to run multiple virtual
DNS servers, bug fixes from previous versions and performance
enhancements. Table 1 compares some of the primary differences
between BIND 8 and BIND 4.9.7. The ISC states the following about
the two different streams of BIND:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>BIND version 4 is officially deprecated in favor
of BIND version 8 and no additional development will be done on
BIND version 4, other than for security-related patches.</p></blockquote></div><p><a href="3691t1.html" target="_self">Table 1</a>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1757580.0x184f818"></a>BIND Vulnerabilities and Issues</h2></div></div><p>The risk to a BIND server may arise from a need for a
functionality that can leave the BIND server susceptible to
attacks, mis-configuration of BIND and vulnerabilities in BIND. The
following vulnerabilities/issues in BIND could be exploited.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1757580.0x184f920"></a>Cache Poisoning</h2></div></div><p>This vulnerability exists in all versions of BIND prior to
version 4.9.6 and version 8.1.1. It allowed an intruder to cause a
victim name server to query a remote name server controlled by the
intruder. The remote name server would return bogus information to
the victim name server. The bogus information would be cached on
the victim name server for a period specified by the
<b  >TTL</b> field of the record returned by the remote
name server. Very simply, this attack allowed the intruder to point
the victim name server's host name IP address mapping to an
alternate IP address of the intruder's choice. Eugene Kaspureff
used cache poisoning to divert the traffic from www.internic.net to
www.alternic.net.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1757580.0x184fa80"></a>Inverse-Query Buffer Overrun</h2></div></div><p>BIND versions prior to BIND 4.9.7 and BIND 8.1.2 are
vulnerable to this. This vulnerability allowed an intruder to gain
root-level access on the victim name server, or just cause the
server to crash. Earlier versions of BIND allowed the inverse-query
feature (see Glossary). Actually, according to the DNS
specification, the inverse queries are optional. By default, the
servers are not configured to respond to fake queries. However,
BIND 8 can be configured to provide fake responses to inverse
queries. It is those servers configured to respond to fake queries
that are vulnerable. The inverse-query feature code is disabled
(commented out in source code) in BIND versions 4.9.7 and
later.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1757580.0x184fb88"></a>Denial of Service</h2></div></div><p>BIND version 4.9.7 and 8.1.2 perform better bounds checking
than the previous versions. The previous BIND version could be
exploited to access an invalid memory location causing the server
to crash. A crash leaves the name server unable to answer queries,
which is a denial of service.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1757580.0x184fc90"></a>Zone Transfers</h2></div></div><p>Slave name servers perform a zone transfer from the master
name server to update their zone database. By default, the master
name server will permit zone transfer requests by any host. This
does not strictly fall in the category of vulnerabilities. However,
the name server contains valuable information about network
resources. Information such as the host names, number of hosts,
textual information on the hosts (HINFO, TXT) and names of mail
servers is made available in zone transfers. Hence, it provides the
intruder with intelligence information that can be utilized to
launch other types of attacks on an enterprise.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1757580.0x184fd98"></a>Unauthorized Dynamic Updates</h2></div></div><p>Dynamic updates are associated with BIND versions 8 and later
only. Dynamic updates do not apply to the BIND 4 series. The
dynamic update feature allows authorized hosts to update the zone
records of a name server. If improperly configured, an intruder may
be able to add/delete/replace the records for a zone.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1757580.0x184fea0"></a>Allowing Recursive Queries</h2></div></div><p>This falls more in the category of misuse or abuse of the
name server by individuals outside your organization. To put it
simply, anyone on the Internet can use your name server to perform
recursive queries. This can cause your name server to become
extremely busy in responding to everyone else's queries.
Additionally, everyone on the Internet will be using your bandwidth
to do so. Furthermore, this is related to the cache-poisoning
vulnerability.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1757580.0x184ffa8"></a>Securing DNS</h2></div></div><p></p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="3691f1.large.jpg"><img src="3691f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1</p></div></div><p>This section focuses on measures that name-server
administrators can take to secure their DNS environment on UNIX.
Figure 1 displays a flow-chart-based approach to securing BIND. The
following measures, when implemented properly, will assist in
securing BIND.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1757580.0x18502c0"></a>Use Most Current Version of BIND</h2></div></div><p>The system syslog files contain information about the current
version of BIND a system is running. The BIND 8 series provides
greater granularity in defining ACLs (access control lists) and
configuring the name server. More specifically, BIND 8 series is
preferred over BIND 4. Using the most current version of BIND 8
series will protect against the cache poisoning, inverse query
buffer overrun and the denial of service vulnerabilities.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1757580.0x18503c8"></a>Restrict Zone Transfers</h2></div></div><p>BIND provides configuration options to restrict zone
transfers. By default, Zone transfer is enabled and anyone can
perform zone transfers against the name server database. The
<b  >ls {<i><tt>domain_name</tt></i>}</b>
command in <span   class="bold"><b>nslookup</b></span> facilitates
this. To restrict zone transfers, use the
<b  >allow-transfer</b> and <b  >xfernets</b>
configuration statements in BIND version 8 and 4.9,
respectively.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1757580.0x1850688"></a>Establish Access Control on Queries</h2></div></div><p>This is necessary to restrict the hosts that can query the
name server. In particular, this is useful for zones internal to an
organization. Furthermore, restricting queries minimizes exposure
to the cache-poisoning vulnerability. By default, BIND permits
anyone to query, even for zones for which a name server is not
authoritative. Only BIND 8 provides ACLs for queries. The BIND 8
configuration statement <b  >allow-query</b> is used to
define the ACL for queries based on IP addresses.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1757580.0x18507e8"></a>Restrict Recursive Queries</h2></div></div><p>If recursion is not desired, it is best to disable it. Such
non-recursive servers are responsible for answering queries for the
zones for which they are authoritative. In addition, these servers
are difficult to spoof because the server does not cache any data.
Most often, internal clients send a recursive query to the name
server. In such cases, recursion may be desired and must be
enabled. Such servers must permit recursion and establish ACLs on
queries (<b  >allow-query</b>).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1757580.0x1850948"></a>Restrict Dynamic Updates</h2></div></div><p>Dynamic updates are a feature of BIND 8. By default, BIND 8
disables dynamic updates. If dynamic updates are required, such
updates should be restricted to individual IP addresses rather than
network addresses. The <b  >allow-update</b>
configuration statement defines the addresses from which a server
will accept updates.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1757580.0x1850aa8"></a>Prevent IP Spoofing</h2></div></div><p>BIND statements such as <b  >xfernets</b>,
<b  >allow-transfer</b>, <b  >allow-query</b>
and <b  >allow-update</b> statements define ways of
restricting many features by IP addresses. This type of
configuration does not provide any protection if the IP addresses
are spoofed. To protect against IP spoofing, network administrators
must establish proper IP spoofing controls on the firewalls,
bastion hosts and intrusion detection systems (IDS).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1757580.0x1c48f60"></a>Architectural and Other Considerations</h2></div></div><p>Some other measures that can be used to secure the name
servers include the use of split-brain name servers and removing
unnecessary information from the DNS database.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1757580.0x1c49068"></a>Split-Brain Name Server</h2></div></div><p>A split-brain name server consists of two separate name
servers. These are quite common in a firewalled environment.
Typically, one name server (sometimes referred to as the external
name server, outside the firewall) provides information on the web
servers, the MX records, other name servers and names associated
with any other services offered by a location. The other name
server, inside the firewall, contains information on the other name
servers in the enterprise. As you can see, the external name server
is the interface to the outside world and therefore provides only
minimal information. To provide further protection, the external
name server can be configured to turn off recursion.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1757580.0x1c49170"></a>Name Servers with Defined Roles</h2></div></div><p>The idea is to differentiate between name servers that permit
recursion and those that do not. It is necessary to permit
recursion on some name servers so that clients issuing recursive
queries continue to operate. In such situations, one name server
can be configured with recursion turned off. Such a name server is
authoritative for its zone and will reject recursive queries.
Typically, this is the type of server registered with the network
domain registries. The other name server permits recursion;
however, it permits such queries from only a few authorized
hosts/networks. This allows only authorized resolvers to query the
recursive name server.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1757580.0x1c49278"></a>Remove Unnecessary Information in
Database</h2></div></div><p>Unnecessary data in the name server makes it easier to gather
intelligence from the name server. Information such as the names of
users and administrators, phone numbers and detailed information
about the host's make and model, if unnecessary, may be omitted
from the name server database.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1757580.0x1c49380"></a>Run BIND as a Non-Root User</h2></div></div><p>BIND normally runs as root. Running BIND as root may allow an
intruder to exploit vulnerabilities, allowing them to run commands
and read/write files as root. BIND server 8.1.2 and later provide
you with the option to run BIND as a user other than root. In
addition, BIND 8 also provides the option to
<span   class="bold"><b>chroot</b></span> the name server. The
<b  >u</b> and <b  >t</b> options to the name
server daemon accomplish this.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1757580.0x1c49590"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>Significant security enhancements and improvements have been
made in the BIND implementation of DNS. At a minimum, install the
most recent version of BIND to protect against commonly known BIND
vulnerabilities. To further secure your environment, use the
security configuration options in the latest release of BIND. Be
careful when you apply BIND updates to your environment, especially
if you obtain them from the ISC web site as opposed to your OS
vendor. Proper care must be taken when applying vendor patches.
Often, vendor patches will overwrite the BIND executable and other
related files. The result may be a broken or vulnerable name
server.</p><p>To keep up with the latest developments in BIND, read the
BIND newsgroups, periodically check the ISC web site, and review
all DNS-related announcements from your OS vendor. BIND 8.2
includes DNS security features as specified by RFC 2065 (DNSSEC,
DNS Security Extensions). The DNS security features use public key
cryptography to provide data origin authentication and data
integrity. Each zone has its own private/public key and uses its
private key to sign the resource records. The DNSSEC extensions are
currently not widely deployed. Under DNSSEC, the public key of a
zone needs to be signed by its parent zone. As of this writing, the
Internic does not yet sign the child zone keys.</p><p>Finally, it is most important to say that DNS is only a
service, meaning you will be able to access a resource if you have
its IP address. Your name server is only as secure as the network
and other servers on the network. It is thus paramount that you
have suitable network and server security measures in place before
trying to protect your name servers.</p><p><a href="3691s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p><p><a href="3691s2.html" target="_self">Glossary</a></p></div></div>
