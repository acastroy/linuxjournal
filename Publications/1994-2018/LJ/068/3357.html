    The author describes the end-to-end process of defining and
    implementing a data collection project using Linux. The
    project illustrates the use of Expect, stty, cron, a little
    C programming, gnuplot and ioctl to the serial device
    driver.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1655580.0x174d450"></a></h2></div></div><p>I have been doing a fair amount of
testing and monitoring on the system and hardware clocks of my
Debian 2.0 machine that I use for file (Samba), communication
(ISDN/masq/diald), printing and modem pool (mserver) service on my
home office network. I wanted to see how well I could correct the
system clock with <span   class="bold"><b>adjtimex</b></span> without
running <span   class="bold"><b>ntpd</b></span> all the time and
keeping the ISDN line to my ISP up. I had been recording daily data
for the clocks and an <span   class="bold"><b>ntp</b></span> (network
time protocol) reference server using the logging feature of
adjtimex with <span   class="bold"><b>cron</b></span> and an
<span   class="bold"><b>Expect</b></span> script. I was noticing some
odd changes from day to day, and was beginning to wonder if
temperature was affecting the server's system clock.
</p><p><a href="3357s3.html" target="_self">Why Debian?</a></p><p><span   class="bold"><b>adjtimex</b></span> allows you to
fiddle with the kernel parameters which control the system clock.
The file /etc/rc.boot/adjtimex contains settings for TICK and FREQ,
the coarse and fine settings used to tune out variations in the
frequency of the crystal oscillator on the motherboard which
supplies the interrupts to the system clock timekeeping process.
The command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/usr/sbin/adjtimex --log --host ns.nts.umn.edu
</pre><p>logs data for the reference ntp server, in this case
ns.nts.umn.edu, the system clock and the hardware clock to
/var/log/clocks.log. By using
<pre     class="programlisting">
adjtimex --review=/var/log/clocks.log
</pre>


you can get suggested changes for TICK and FREQ which will tune the
kernel clock and hopefully get it to match the ntp reference
server. This is all well and good, as long as the clock crystal is
stable; but what if it varies with temperature?
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1655580.0x174d978"></a>The Idea</h2></div></div><p>What if I could measure and record the temperature near or
actually inside the server? I could then correlate the temperature
data with the system clock data to see if they were related. I have
a Micronta (Radio Shack) digital multimeter with a serial
interface. All I needed to collect the data was a circuit to
convert temperature to voltage and interface the meter to a serial
port on the server.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1655580.0x174da80"></a>Gathering the Hardware Tools</h2></div></div><p>A little research on the Net turned up a couple of
thermocouple to millivolt converters, but they cost much more than
I wanted to pay. Being an electrical engineer and having worked at
a measurement company for many years, I knew that a temperature to
volts converter circuit is fairly simple. A couple of friends
helped out by putting together a circuit that provides .01 volts
out per degree Fahrenheit that fits on a piece of vector board
about an inch square and runs from a 9-volt battery. See Figures 1
and 2 for the schematic diagram and a picture.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="3357f1.large.jpg"><img src="3357f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1. Schematic for Temperature-to-Volts
Converter</p></div></div>
</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="3357f2.large.jpg"><img src="3357f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 2. Converter</p></div></div>
</p><p>The Micronta No. 22-182 LCD Digital Multimeter comes with a
five-conductor cable and a short section in the manual describing
test programs for MS-DOS and MS-BASIC. A quick check showed that
these worked fine. The serial interface communication parameters
are 1200 baud, 7 data bits, no parity and 2 stop bits. Using the
meter's continuity test function, I made a cable drawing as shown
in Figure 3, a complete pinout and description of the serial port
signals as found on a PC. These ports have male connectors with
either 9 or 25 pins, and are wired as DTE (data terminal
equipment). The RS-232 specification is designed so that a DTE port
as on the PC can be connected to a piece of DCE (data communication
equipment), typically a modem, with a straight-through cable. DCE
usually has a female connector. You can use Table 1 to wire up a
9-pin to 25-pin conversion cable if you need one. Now I was ready
to try reading the meter on Linux.</p><p><a href="3357f3.txt.html" target="_self">Figure 3</a></p><p><a href="3357t1.html" target="_self">Table 1</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1655580.0x174e160"></a>Gathering the Software Tools</h2></div></div><p>Before I hooked up the cable to /dev/ttyS0, I checked to see
if there were any drivers like
<span   class="bold"><b>getty</b></span> or
<span   class="bold"><b>gpm</b></span> running on the port. Sure
enough, there was a leftover gpm driver for a mouse, even though
the mouse had long since been disconnected. I did an</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/etc/init.d/gpm stop
</pre><p>and renamed the <span   class="bold"><b>init</b></span> script
with
<pre     class="programlisting">
mv /etc/init.d/gpm /etc/init.d/nogpm
</pre>


to prevent gpm from restarting in the event of a reboot. If you
have a getty process running on the port, you will have to disable
it by commenting out the correct line in /etc/inetd.conf and
restarting init with
<pre     class="programlisting">
kill -HUP 1
</pre>


Use something like
<pre     class="programlisting">
ps auxw|grep tty
</pre>


to make sure the serial port you are trying to use is free.
</p><p>I used stty to set the port to the meter's communication
parameters with this command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
stty speed 1200 cs7 cstopb -echo clocal &lt; \
   /dev/ttyS0
</pre><p><b  >speed 1200</b> sets the baud rate,
<b  >cs7</b> sets 7 data bits, <b  >cstopb</b>
sets 2 stop bits and <b  >parity</b> is
<b  >none</b> by default. I added the
<b  >-echo</b> to make sure the device driver didn't echo
back characters sent to the port and <b  >clocal</b> to
disable the modem control signals.
</p><p>I decided to use Expect to collect the data, since the meter
has a very simple &ldquo;send a command&rdquo; and &ldquo;get a response&rdquo;
paradigm. <span   class="bold"><b>Expect</b></span> is a powerful
tool and can be used to automate UNIX programs which interact with
a user or processes needing a command or trigger and return some
kind of response. <span   class="bold"><b>Expect</b></span> is built
on top of Tcl, a widely used extensible language. I had recently
discovered Expect and found it is one of those tools you just don't
know how you ever got along without. You can easily automate things
with Expect that are extremely difficult or next to impossible with
shell scripts or other languages. Sol Libes' book,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Exploring Expect</em></span>, was a valuable resource. Mr.
Libes is the author of Expect. I also found the Expect and Tcl web
pages very helpful. I had previously used Expect to automate a
couple of tasks such as the clock data logging mentioned
above.</p><p>The meter protocol is very simple: send the meter a
<b  >D\r</b> (a capital D followed by a return), and it
sends back a 14-character string ending in a <b  >\r</b>
(return). The message sent back by the meter is of the form:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Byte     1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E
Ex. 1    D C - 1 . 9 9 9 9   V     \r
Ex. 2          1 . 9 9 9 9 M o h m \r
</pre><p>In practice, since this is a 3-1/2 digit multimeter, a space
character replaces the least significant digit in column 9.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1655580.0x174ebb0"></a>The First Try</h2></div></div><p>Now that I had the port cleared and set to the right
communication parameters and the cable hooked up, I was ready to
talk to the meter.</p><p>However, when I hooked it up to the serial port on the Linux
box, I got no outputs. Luckily, I have a serial breakoutbox, a
piece of test equipment that has a two-color LED for each signal,
switches to disconnect signals and sockets to jump them together.
This is plugged in between the computer port and the piece of
equipment you are trying to diagnose. My inexpensive box lights the
LEDs red for negative voltages and green for positive
voltages.</p><p>After much probing and watching the serial breakout box, I
discovered that the meter depended on having the RTS (request to
send) signal stay low to provide the negative voltage for the
meter's output drive circuit. Without RTS low, the meter's TXD
(transmitted data) line wouldn't work. Normally when you open a
port, both the RTS and the DTR (data terminal ready) lines go
high.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1655580.0x1b46fb8"></a>Creating the Missing Tools</h2></div></div><p>Now, how do you control the modem control lines on a serial
port? This is where having access to the source code for the serial
drivers, and other utilities truly helped. If this were just a DOS
application (single user, single tasking), it would be simple to
read the ACE's (asynchronous communication element) control
register, set the right bit, and write the data back out to the
port. Since user-space programs can't write directly to system
devices, I had to figure out how to tell the device driver to
manipulate the RTS line. After much searching, I found a UNIX
serial support site, which led to a serial utility site, which had
a utility that I could hack to do what I wanted. I'm not a super C
programmer, but this was just what I needed to give me the clues on
how to operate the ioctl function of the serial driver. I hacked up
a couple of programs: <span   class="bold"><b>clrrts.c</b></span> to
clear the RTS line, and <span   class="bold"><b>modctl.c</b></span>,
which can either set or clear RTS or DTR on a serial port. The
source of clrrts.c and modctl.c can be found in the archive file
<a href="../listings/068/3357.tgz" target="_self">ftp.linuxjournal.com/pub/lj/listings/issue68/3357.tgz</a>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1655580.0x1b471c8"></a>Working Around the Gotchas</h2></div></div><p>During my earlier sessions with Expect, I discovered a little
hitch with Expect and cron. The Expect version 5.25 delivered with
Debian 2.0 stable (libc6) will not spawn processes when run by
cron. The Expect 5.19 on Debian 1.3 (libc5) works fine. I reported
a bug to the Debian maintainers to learn that it might be a while
until the libc6 issues were fixed. I worked around the problem by
manually installing the Expect 5.19 executable and Tcl 7.4 support
libraries, from my Debian 1.3 system to the 2.0 server, which
already had the general libc5 support libraries, to support another
libc5 package I was running.</p><p>The meter has an auto-shutoff feature, which can't be
disabled. It shuts the meter down if more than ten minutes go by
with no activity. Clearly, this wasn't very good for long-term data
collection. To fix this, I added some code to the Expect script to
define how many times per hour I wanted the data logged, and set
cron to read the meter once per minute. This keeps the meter on,
but avoids having a huge log. The crontab line that runs rddmm.exp
is:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
* * * * * /usr/bin/expect5.19 /root/rddmm.exp
</pre><p>A couple of things showed up after a reboot. I discovered the
Expect script was timing out, since the meter was not responding.
Two things came out of this. The first was some interesting things
that happen when you attempt to change certain
<span   class="bold"><b>stty</b></span> parameters, and the serial
port cable does not have connections to the modem control input
lines: CTS (clear to send), DSR (data set ready) and DCD (data
carrier detect). Basically, the port gets stuck. Since the cable
that came with the meter left CTS, DSR and DCD open, and I did not
want to modify the cable, I figured out which stty parameters
<span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> to use: <span   class="emphasis"><em>hupcl</em></span> and
<span   class="emphasis"><em>crtscts</em></span>. I had placed
<span   class="emphasis"><em>hupcl</em></span> in the original stty settings for the
port while sorting out the RTS low requirement. The port had
accepted the <span   class="emphasis"><em>hupcl</em></span> setting, because at the
time the command was issued, I had the serial breakout box on the
port and used the jumpers to wrap around the modem control signals.
But when the meter cable alone was connected to the port, the lack
of the feedback signals CTS, DSR and DCD caused
<span   class="emphasis"><em>hupcl</em></span> to hang the port. This didn't show up
until reboot.
</p><p>Second, I needed to set &ldquo;raw&rdquo; mode on the serial port, the
default as booted parameters are set to &ldquo;cooked&rdquo; which translates
returns to newlines. This prevented the Expect script from seeing
the \r at the end of the response. These changes were also
incorporated into the Expect script.</p><p>The Expect script,
<span   class="bold"><b>rddmm.exp</b></span>, with the lines numbered
for reference, is included in the archive file along with a
line-by-line explanation of the code.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1655580.0x1b47748"></a>Refinements</h2></div></div><p>Both the temperature conversion circuit and the multimeter
run from 9-volt batteries. Since I wanted to take data for weeks at
a time without worrying about them going dead, I designed and built
a couple of simple power supplies using adjustable voltage
regulators and the cube transformers that plug in the wall, to act
as battery eliminators. These also fit on a piece of vector board a
little over one square inch. (See Figure 4.)</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="3357f4.large.jpg"><img src="3357f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 4. Battery Eliminator

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1655580.0x1b47a60"></a>Visualizing the Data</h2></div></div><p>The last part was visualizing the data. I used
<span   class="bold"><b>gnuplot</b></span> to read the log file and
plot temperature versus time. I hadn't used gnuplot before, but a
couple of hours going through the man pages got me to a point where
I could view the plot on the Linux console or print it to my HP
LaserJetIII.</p><p>Lines in /var/log/temps.log look like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Dec 31 10:45:01 server1 rddmm: 68.9 Degrees F
</pre><p>The operative gnuplot directives are:
<pre     class="programlisting">
set xdata time
set format x "%b %d\n%H:%M"
set title "Internal Server Temperature at Timekeeping Crystal"
set timefmt "%b %d %H:%M:%S"
set xrange [ "Jan 03 14:00:00" : "Jan 04 07:59:00"]
set ylabel "Degrees F" -2
plot "/var/log/temps.log" using 1:6 with lines 1
</pre>


The <b  >xdata</b> and <b  >timefmt</b>
directives tell gnuplot the horizontal axis is measured in time and
how the times in the log file look. The <b  >xrange</b>
directive determines which lines of the log file get plotted. The
<b  >format x</b> directive defines the labels on the x
axis; the <b  >\n</b> between the date and time forces a
two-line label. The plot command tells gnuplot where to find the
log file, which columns to plot and to use line plot style 1. The
<b  >set title</b> and <b  >set ylabel</b> put
a title and y-axis label on the plot.
</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="3357f5.large.jpg"><img src="3357f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 5. Temperature Versus Time</p></div></div>
</p><p>To print the plot to the laser jet, I used:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
set terminal pcl5
set output '/root/plot.out'
replot
</pre><p>Then from the shell:
<pre     class="programlisting">
lpr /root/plot.out
</pre>


In a similar fashion, I plotted the difference of system clock time
measurements versus the reference NTP server on the Internet with
the gnuplot directives shown here:
<pre     class="programlisting">
set xdata time
set timefmt "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M"
set xrange ["1999-01-03 15:00":"1999-01-04 07:00"]
set format x "%b %d\n%H:%M"
set title "Delta sysclock Minus Delta refclock"
set ylabel "Seconds" -2
plot "/root/clk_hr.prn" using 1:3 with lines 1
</pre>

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1655580.0x1b48560"></a>The Envelope, Please</h2></div></div><p>And now, after all of this, is the system clock being
affected by temperature? By looking at Figures 4 and 5, you can see
that the variations in the clock differences do not follow the
temperature variations inside the server. As a matter of fact,
there is a large time variation that corrected itself, which I must
chalk up to variations in network latency. By taking time data once
per hour instead of once per day as I was originally doing, it
became easier to identify the random network variations, which had
originally peaked my curiosity.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1655580.0x1b48668"></a>Summary</h2></div></div><p>These techniques are also adaptable to measuring and
recording other physical parameters using devices with a serial
interface. This particular digital multimeter can measure DC and AC
voltage and current, capacitance, frequency and transistor gain.
All these are accessible through the serial interface.</p><p>Linux and a project like this have brought me back to the
days when you could actually create something useful with hardware
and software. Sadly, most things for computers today come out of a
shrink-wrapped box. Linux provides me with the tools I can use to
make things happen in the real world.</p><p><a href="3357s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p><p><a href="3357s2.html" target="_self">Acknowledgements</a></p></div></div>
