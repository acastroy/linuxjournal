    One company's solution to a customer problem using Linux and
    open-source software.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21c2580.0x22ba450"></a></h2></div></div><p>I work for a company that's involved in
the design and manufacturing of custom circuits. Historically, we
have designed printed circuit boards and boxes that are further
integrated by our customers into their systems. Until recently we
were rarely involved in what is commonly called systems design and
integration. However, times are changing and as we broaden our
customer base, we have adapted to meet these needs. Most of the
time, we have been able to meet the immediate requirements using
DOS and in some cases Windows. This year, we began using Windows 98
to be able to use some of the newer video capabilities, and in one
case, Linux stepped in to quickly solve a network connectivity
problem. This paper is a brief description of one project that
provided the opportunity to get more involved with Linux and the
capabilities of this new operating system.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21c2580.0x22ba558"></a>Description of the Problem</h2></div></div><p>Recently, a customer, who is involved in retail sales and has
customarily done their own systems integration, asked us to look at
designing a Card Access System to replace their existing system.
There were two primary reasons for this. One of these was cost.
They felt that by designing a system to specifically meet their
requirements, the production cost would be lower than by asking for
customization of a product already on the market. The second reason
was much more important to them. They wanted to be able to extend
this new system and add interfaces into other parts of their
overall store system. The store system includes their point-of-sale
(POS) controller and a link to a security video system. These
aspects of the system design will be discussed in more detail
later.</p><p>The basic requirements to be met were:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Entry into an area was to be controlled through the
use of a credit-card-style <span   class="emphasis"><em>key</em></span>.</p></li><li><p>If a user did not have their
<span   class="emphasis"><em>key</em></span> it would be possible for them to enter the
number manually.</p></li><li><p>Employees could be added or deleted either
automatically through the POS system or manually by the store
manager.</p></li><li><p>Access to an area was granted or denied based on
the <span   class="emphasis"><em>key</em></span> and the type of area in
question.</p></li><li><p>Configuration of the system could be changed easily
on site.</p></li><li><p>If any area was accessed without a valid
<span   class="emphasis"><em>key</em></span>, an alarm was to be sounded.</p></li><li><p>Alarms could be reset by a manager, or optionally,
by any valid <span   class="emphasis"><em>key</em></span>.</p></li><li><p>Alarm conditions would be sent to the security
video system.</p></li><li><p>Managers would be able to override the system and
allow doors to be propped open for extended periods of time.</p></li><li><p>A must was the capability to query the system and
examine activity based on area, time and/or employee.</p></li></ul></div><p>Although these requirements are fairly basic, three things
stood out. The first was they wanted the updates of the access
database to occur from the POS system. However, this was something
that remained &ldquo;in the future&rdquo;. Because of this, the second point
was updates would need to be made locally which required an
intuitive interface. Finally, the design of the security video
system was being designed at the same time so the link to that
would also be in the future. Other than having so many points that
would remain for in the future, this was quite typical of many of
the projects we've done. One other difference was we were to
deliver a complete system rather than just the parts.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21c2580.0x22bb000"></a>Implementation</h2></div></div><p>Because of the distributed nature of the store environment,
the decision was made to use an EIA RS-422 type of interface to
distribute the system throughout the store. The basic idea was to
have several serial lines from the central PC going out to multiple
door-access modules on each serial line. Each door-access module
would control up to four readers (or doors), see Figure 1. The
choice of four readers was based on a typical proximity of doors
and the amount of wiring needed for the readers, the solenoids and
alarms. Since we had designed card readers and other data entry
type of equipment in the past, it was decided to implement the card
reader as a wall-mounted panel with an 8051 type device controlling
it. Any entry from either the keypad or from a card swipe would be
buffered and sent to the door-access module when polled. The
door-access module would later forward it on to the central PC when
it was polled. The design of the system allows up to ten
door-access modules per serial link or a maximum of 40 doors per
serial link.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="3555f1.large.jpg"><img src="3555f1.jpg"></a></div>
</p><p>Figure 1.
</p><p>When the project was started, the feeling was that we would
use Windows 95/98 as the operating system. This was a natural
considering that in addition to the necessary communication it
could provide database services through the use of Microsoft Access
and an intuitive user interface. However, as the hardware design
progressed, it became apparent the programming resources would not
be available within an acceptable time frame. When it came time to
allocate resources for this job, I was winding down from another
job and was asked about how I would approach the design of the user
interface. Not being very familiar with Windows programming but
having some exposure to the browser interface, I asked if it would
be appropriate to switch to Linux and provide the user interface
through the use of Apache and an appropriate browser. The design
team immediately picked up on the idea and presented it to the
customer. When it was pointed out that this implementation would
not require the user to be present at the equipment, which is
typically crammed into a closet, the customer responded, &ldquo;Neat.&rdquo;
When asked if they would have objections to implementing it on
Linux, their response was, &ldquo;Cool.&rdquo; With this, I was on my
way.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21c2580.0x22bb318"></a>Committing to the Open Source Paradigm</h2></div></div><p>Several aspects of using Linux needed to be considered before
actually committing to this program. Many companies have been
battling with these issues as Linux has struggled to move into the
mainstream. The most important to us was whether or not the
development resources would be available to us. Having worked with
the GNU utilities, namely <span   class="bold"><b>gcc</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>gdb</b></span>, on a previous project, I felt
developing the main program would present no problem. The next
issue was the support required to allow the database interface to
be provided through the user's browser. Again, a little research
showed not only was the support there, but also there were many
choices. One question that was asked of me was how we would handle
the constant flux of kernel development. It didn't take long to
realize it was not necessary to continually upgrade these systems
just to stay up to date. All we needed was a workable version that
could be propagated through the whole product. Since the source
code is available, if the kernel were to develop in a direction
incompatible with our system, we would not be abandoned with an
albatross.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21c2580.0x22bb4d0"></a>Implementing the Serial Interface and the
Control Program</h2></div></div><p>It seems that programming for a serial line in any system is
a challenge and nothing comes easy. This was particularly true for
this project as I had minimal experience with the UNIX environment
and had to handle up to eight serial ports. Because of previous
experience, the design team had already selected the Digi
International eight-port 422 card. My first task was to set it up
to run under Linux. I felt like I was groping around in the dark
and looked for any kind of confirmation that I was doing things
right. I tired to use <span   class="bold"><b>minicom</b></span> with
a loop-back plug just to see if it worked. If it had, there'd be
little mention of it here, but it didn't, and I spent considerable
time reviewing what I had done. Finally, I called the Digi
International support people. Of course, they had me try all the
usual, and I was willing to entertain them on the off chance that I
had overlooked something. To make a long story short, after several
cycles of e-mail, one of their second-line support people picked up
on my plight. While working with him, I certainly learned much
about the inner workings of Linux, and it was worth the time for
that alone. Finally, we discovered the problem was in the version
of the driver I had; in fact, it had not been written to support
the 422 card. A simple change and it started working. This
experience proved to me that Linux is indeed a supported
system.</p><p>Now that all the hardware was in place, it was my job to make
it work. I was rather puzzled as to how I would handle up to eight
serial interfaces and so I did some reading. This included the
appropriate HOWTOs and any books I could get. Fortunately one of
them was <span   class="emphasis"><em>Beginning Linux Programming</em></span> by Neil
Matthew and Richard Stones, Wrox press, 1996. In it, they develop
an excellent example of the use of FIFOs to communicate between
tasks. I took their example and expanded it, so that each serial
interface had its own task and all communicated through FIFOs to
the central controlling task. To see how the various tasks relate,
see Figure 2. This proved to be an excellent choice for two
reasons. The first is that the central controlling task could spawn
a task for each serial link. If only one was needed for an
application, only one task was spawned, etc. The second is that the
serial task could perform all polling, error checking and
retransmission without involving the controlling task in any way.
This made the controlling task much simpler in that it dealt only
with valid messages that needed action.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="3555f2.large.jpg"><img src="3555f2.jpg"></a></div>
</p><p>Figure 2.
</p><p>One of the problems I've had in the past with programming
serial links is that, unless you can master the interrupt
mechanism, the system spends a large amount of time spinning its
wheels waiting for something to happen. In the Linux system, I was
able to use the <span   class="bold"><b>select</b></span> call to
allow each task to go into the idle state until something needed to
be done. This happens while the controlling task is waiting for a
message to arrive from one of the readers. The timeout feature of
the select call was also used to trigger a background task. If no
messages arrived from any reader within ten seconds, a subtask
would perform background housekeeping. It also happens in the
serial task. In this case, the select is set to wake up on arrival
of a message from either a reader or the controlling task. Again,
the timeout feature was used, but this time it indicated that one
of the door-access modules had failed to respond, which is
indicative of a hardware problem.</p><p>With these basics in place, the development of the rest of
the program progressed very rapidly. I want to point out that the
multi-tasking power of Linux and the capabilities of gdb came
through during this phase. Since the serial task was spawned by the
controlling task, no screen was attached, and thus, there was no
way to print the usual diagnostic messages during the development
phase. One of the first things I did was to learn how to use
<span   class="bold"><b>syslogd</b></span> to report error conditions
within these tasks. Secondly, I used the capability of gdb to
connect to an already running task and debug it.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21c2580.0x22bb9f8"></a>Interface Between the Control Program and the
Database</h2></div></div><p>This was one area where we had just enough experience to be
dangerous. We knew it could be done and this was one potential hot
spot. In evaluating various database packages, we looked at the
licensing terms and the availability of support for embedded and
web applications. It seemed as though many of the databases
available for Linux took care of the last two requirements. The
licensing aspect was more varied in that several of the
better-known packages provided for a single user or non-commercial
use at no fee. Since we would be installing this on many systems
and for commercial purposes, licensing was an issue we didn't want
to overlook. When we pursued it, we found some of the license fees
were higher than the going rate for MS Access. That alone
eliminated some of the choices. We eventually settled on using
PostgreSQL. Besides the very liberal copyright, we were strongly
influenced by the availability of high-quality documentation.
Having the opportunity to review the manuals before even committing
to downloading the code was enough to reassure us this was a good
path to follow.</p><p>Once the database was chosen, we had to get down to the
details of implementation. The first part was to define the schema.
Having had some experience with SQL previously, I found that
<span   class="bold"><b>psql</b></span> was easily adapted. Knowing
that the schema was likely to change as the project evolved, I
wrote a few scripts to define all the tables and fill in default
values. This took care of setting up the database. The next step
was to define the interface to the control program. On the same
premise that the database schema would change, I set up the
interface as a separate module with subroutines to read selected
data into working buffers. With the exception of the log table, all
of the tables were read only for this function. Thus, there is a
subroutine to read a selected record from each of the tables. The
only other exception to this approach is that when the system first
came up, a way was needed to determine just how many doors were
implemented. This merely took a set of subroutines that would open
the table, return the next entry in the table on each call and then
close the table. This allowed the program to scan all possible
entries to set up the communications links and other structures.
All the functionality I needed was provided by the lilbpq library
included with the distribution. It turned out to be easier than I
had first expected.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21c2580.0x22bbbb0"></a>Interface Between the Database and the User
Interface</h2></div></div><p>This aspect of the project is a bit more complicated because
of the number of different packages involved. If you recall from
the outset, the idea was to use the web browser as the user
interface. This meant we needed to provide a web server on our end
of the link. For anyone in Linux, the choice of Apache is a
no-brainer. However, we needed to link it up to our database in
some way. Because of the availability of Perl expertise, we chose
to go that route. In order to provide a complete package, we also
needed to include other modules. For the interface to the database,
we added ApacheDBI, DBD for Postgres and the Perl DBI package. To
support all we needed in Apache, we added Digest, HTML-Parser,
MIME-Base64, URI, Apache-SSI, libnet, libwww-perl, and mod-perl.
Quite a conglomeration of packages, but when installed correctly,
it all worked very well.</p><p>The design of the user interface was broken into two primary
sections. The first was a set of routines that formats the data for
display on the user's screen. The second is a main routine that
accepts input from the user and processes it. Generally, that
processing consists of updating the database and passing control to
an appropriate routine to display a new set of data for the user.
On top of all this, Javascript was used at the browser level to
perform validity checking before passing parameters back to the
main routine. Because of the amount of data being passed back and
forth between the browser and the system, we kept things fairly
simple. The only graphic we used was an identifying logo.</p><p>In general, the user is allowed to select a specific table
from a top-level menu. Once a table is selected, the user is
allowed to list the current table, look up an existing entry,
modify an entry, and of course, add or delete entries. Since the
data in the various tables may be somewhat sensitive and the people
defining a door have different needs from those defining job codes,
we added one other table to the system. The security table has
nothing to do with normal operation of the system, but instead
determines who may see what tables. It worked out nicely and it
also gave us a means of allowing only certain users to have access
to the system.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21c2580.0x25c6b28"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>One of the primary questions to ask yourself at the end of
the project is: Should we have done it differently? Although there
is a lot of pressure to follow the Microsoft flow because people
are familiar with that environment, I'd have to answer &ldquo;No.&rdquo; The
system as we installed it has met or exceeded all of the customer's
expectations. The facilities provided with the linux operating
system have allowed us to deliver a system that is reliable and is
easily serviced and upgraded. For example, cron is used in
conjunction with the logrotate utility to ensure that the log files
don't fill up all disk space. Yet, at the same time, we can easily
review the last four weeks of data. In a similar vein, PostgreSQL
provides all of the database services that are required and, along
with a quick script, delete stale data. These together keep the
system from getting bogged down with bloated files. Other utilities
come into play as well, the apcupsd daemon monitors the ups and
ensures an orderly shutdown if necessary. As a side benefit, we
also have a log of the power in the building. Using mgetty with
pppd allows dial-in for any servicing that may be required. So far,
all updates to the system have been handled through this path as
the current network connection between us and the site is very
slow.</p><p>The choice of using apache to provide the GUI couldn't have
been better. When we started, the idea was to allow any browser on
the network to gain access and allow updates to occur from remote
locations. As noted above, the network connection is slow so this
has not happened to any great extent. Also, by coincidence, the
initial site did not have any other local machines. To take care of
this situation, the X windows system was put into use and the
Netscape browser is used at the machine. A special login was
defined that placed the user into Netscape and on exiting X
windows, the user is logged out. Security has been retained and the
user is none the wiser.</p><p>Another thing to ask is: Where might we be headed in the
future? The first step is provide a serial link to report activity
to the external security system. A second is to have updates to the
system database be done from another machine. Initial discussions
centered around using a spare serial ports for these functions. No
problem! In getting this far, we have all the experience with
serial programming to know exactly what's needed for both tasks.
Later discussions have moved towards using a TCP/IP link for the
update function. Again, no problem with the networking environment
provided by linux!</p><p>We have also been asked by the customer about setting up a
central monitoring facility with the intent of being able report
hardware failures. With the networking capabilities, both direct
and dial-in, it was fairly simple to propose a system where a
central unit could poll all of the units in the field.
Alternatively, the field systems could call in and report their
health. The system could even be a hybrid of these two approaches!
The customer has not yet responded to this proposal, but it is not
a big step to see that not only can all systems be monitored, but
all program updates could be handled through this mechanism as
well.</p><p>As you may see from my enthusiasm, I'm all for linux! The
biggest barrier we've had is that of the familiar environment that
people have come to expect. My expectations are that, given time,
there will be a shift in the linux world and there will be
'education' of the masses and it will become more natural to use
linux for projects of this type. In anticipation of this type of
shift, the system was recently ported over to Red Hat version 6.0.
With some minor tweaking for Apache and a recompilation of our code
to use the new libraries, the transition was fairly
uneventful.</p></div></div>
