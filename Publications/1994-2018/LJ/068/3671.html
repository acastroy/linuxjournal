    An explanation of the work required to take an existing
    Progress application and deploy it on Linux, and the
    advantages and disadvantages of doing so.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2659580.0x27513f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>Progress Software recently announced that
by the time you read this article, the Progress RDBMS will be
available in a native Linux port. Why is this good news? Because it
immediately makes thousands of new applications available on our
favorite operating system.
</p><p>Over 5,000 applications have been written in Progress by
Independent Software Vendors (ISVs). All of these applications
could potentially use Linux as a back-end server, and many, if not
most, provide a character interface which would allow Linux to
serve as a client as well.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2659580.0x2751558"></a>The Progress Environment</h2></div></div><p>If you are not familiar with it, Progress is an
enterprise-level relational database and 4GL development
environment which has been running on UNIX systems for 15 years. It
supports a wide variety of operating systems, including servers for
NT, AIX, HP/UX, Solaris, Compaq Tru64 UNIX and many other popular
platforms. It also supports character clients on UNIX plus
character or graphical MS-Windows clients.</p><p>Version 8.3 of the database engine, the first version to be
ported, can store half a terabyte of data in a database. (Of
course, if that's not enough, you can connect to a couple of
hundred databases simultaneously.) Also, each database can handle
up to 4,000 simultaneous user connections. Version 9, which will be
ported shortly after 8.3, supports 1000 times the data and up to
10,000 users.</p><p>One of the nice things about Progress, in my opinion, is that
it also scales down. If you want to run single-user on a low-end
486, you can. Database size can go down to less than a megabyte.
Running a single-user session, or serving a handful of users on a
small application remotely, can fit nicely in a 16MB Linux machine.
Try running Oracle on NT and see what kind of power you need to get
the same job done.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2659580.0x2751710"></a>Deployment Architecture</h2></div></div><p>Where does Linux fit into a Progress deployment? In order to
answer that, you need to know something about Progress'
architecture.</p><p>Databases can be accessed in either single-user or multi-user
mode. Single-user sessions give a single client process complete
control of a database. Multi-user Progress sessions consist of
three different types of processes: clients, servers and a broker
process which manages database connections. Deployment
architectures can be chosen to support a wide variety of business
needs and available machinery.</p><p>A broker process runs on the machine containing the database.
The broker manages client connection requests and allocates a
shared memory area which is used by all the processes connecting to
the database.</p><p>The client process is the one the user sees; it presents
information to and accepts input from the terminal. A client may
also run as a background process, in which case it is not
associated with a terminal but is architecturally identical to a
foreground client. Clients are of two types: self-service and
remote. A self-service client runs on the same machine as the
broker and the database, and handles its own database manipulation
requests. A remote client uses the TCP/IP networking layer rather
than connecting directly to the shared-memory area created by the
broker. This allows the remote client to be on a different machine
than the database. The broker spawns server processes to respond to
remote client requests. Each server process can handle many
simultaneous client connections. The remote client sends data
retrieval and update requests to the server; the server executes
the requests as though it were itself a self-service client, and
sends the results back to the remote client.</p><p>This design easily allows separation of database and clients.
Not only that, the communications between them are standard so you
can mix and match operating systems. If you are currently running
Windows clients against an NT server, you can move the database to
Linux and the Windows clients will operate unchanged.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2659580.0x2751978"></a>New Deployment Options</h2></div></div><p>This flexibility allows Linux to fill several different roles
in a Progress deployment. Granted, the ability to replace the
back-end server machine with Linux is a real boon in several ways,
which any Linux fan will be able to tell you: the smaller
footprint, the difference in cost and the reliability of this
operating system are already well-known. Also, remote maintenance
comes free with Linux; you must otherwise buy not only the
expensive OS license, but network-hogging third-party remote
control software as well.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="3671f1.large.jpg"><img src="3671f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1. Linux can offload client work from an
overburdened server.</p></div></div>
</p><p>Turn the situation around, and say you've already got a
high-end UNIX server that 300 users
<span   class="bold"><b>telnet</b></span> into in order to run their
character-based application. If that single machine is struggling
under the load of the database server plus running all the client
processes, it is now easy to offload half the work, plus a fair
proportion of the memory usage and disk I/O, by adding a few Linux
servers to handle remote clients. Users no longer log in to your
main UNIX machine; they log in to the Linux servers and use them as
remote clients. Figure 1 is a diagram of this arrangement. Let's
discuss four benefits of this arrangement.</p><p>One, the load on the database server is reduced. The memory
consumed by running (say) ten clients on the machine is freed in
exchange for one server process, which is about the same size as a
single client. The number of clients a server process can support
will vary based on the demands of the application. Server processes
can typically serve the requests of anywhere from five to 20 remote
clients simultaneously. Additional server processes are started
automatically by the broker, based on the number of new connection
requests from clients and on broker parameter settings. The CPU
cycles which previously went to client calculations, screen
manipulation and other front-end tasks are freed completely and
moved to the new Linux machines. Any client-side disk I/O, used for
temporary storage, record sorting and application printing or other
output, is also removed from the server. Using Linux can therefore
boost the available power of your expensive high-end server
machine.</p><p>Two, security levels are increased because the users no
longer need to have a login on your main server. Instead, they now
use TELNET to log in to one of the Linux machines that contain no
critical data.</p><p>Three, if all the Linux machines are configured more or less
identically, which would make sense from an administrative
standpoint as well, you increase the fault tolerance of your
architecture. If one of the Linux machines needs to come out of
service for some reason, those who were previously using that
machine for their clients can immediately log in to one of the
other Linux machines and continue their work.</p><p>Four, the machines running Linux need fewer configurations
than you might think. Given a generous four or five megabytes of
memory per client and very little disk space, a dozen or more
well-behaved interactive clients should be able to run on a single
mid-range processor. This small footprint, along with the price of
PCs today, means that these client services can be purchased for
well under a hundred dollars a seat. Compare that price with adding
a second high-end server to perform the same function.</p><p>The networking bandwidth required between the Linux machines
and the database server will vary based on your application. You
might choose either to put the Linux machines close to the database
server or to distribute them to your field offices, depending on
the application demands and the available infrastructure.</p><p>Linux may have a place at several levels of your deployment
and can in fact be phased in as needed, or used only where it is
convenient.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2659580.0x2751f50"></a>Porting Existing Applications</h2></div></div><p>Since the front end (application) and the back end (the
database) are so independent, let's examine what needs to be done
one step at a time.</p><p>To move an existing Progress character-based application, the
good news is all it takes is a recompile. That's it! In fact, there
are some instances in which you don't even have to recompile; if
you are staying within the same machine class, the same r-code
(compiled code) can just be copied from one machine to another and
it will run. This is because Progress r-code is not truly compiled
code, but rather an interpreted binary format. As long as you
remain within the same machine class (defined as machines with the
same byte alignment, endianness, and word size), your compiled code
will not even need a recompile.</p><p>The only time any complications in this process will occur is
when you have OS-specific code within your application. Progress
code doesn't care what OS it runs on, but if you make a call to an
external routine (such as <span   class="bold"><b>ps</b></span> with
flags specific to your old OS), you will need to make those
modifications. However, this situation is fairly rare. Common
operating system functions (such as file copy and delete) can be
handled generically within Progress by using statements like
<b  >OS-COPY</b> which work regardless of the underlying
platform.</p><p>In some circumstances, porting an existing database is just
as easy. Officially, Progress does not support copying a database
between operating systems or machine architectures. In order to do
this, you must do a dump and load. This is a process of extracting
the structure and all the data from the database in an ASCII form,
then copying the ASCII data to the new machine and loading it into
the new database. However, there is an unsupported loophole which I
take advantage of regularly. Currently, I dual-boot my laptop with
NT and Linux, and I have a Progress database on an NT FAT drive
which is visible when I boot Linux. This database is accessible
from either OS. I have application code (uncompiled because that is
more convenient for me, but I could also share a compiled version)
which accesses this database no matter which choice I make at boot
time. There can't be much better proof than that. The true
technical limitations on copying databases are much the same as
those for copying compiled code: if the machine architecture and
the word size are the same, you should be okay.</p><p>If your situation does require a dump and load, and you want
the time your application is unavailable to be as short as
possible, there are some techniques which will dramatically reduce
the down time of your database. I regularly travel to customer
sites and have seen some extreme examples of this: one database,
with a size measurable in tens of gigabytes, was unavailable for
only 45 minutes and only in the final phase of their dump and
load.</p><p>This sort of performance, however, requires some custom work
in advance. Generally, it involves dumping and loading stable data
ahead of the actual cutover point; the greatest time savings occurs
when you can define stable data most broadly. For example, if you
have modification dates on a table, the entire table can be dumped
and loaded in advance; then, when you are ready to cut over to the
new system, re-dump only those records modified since the first
dump.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2659580.0x27522c0"></a>A Good Match</h2></div></div><p>Porting an existing character application written in Progress
is remarkably simple. With over 5000 applications already written,
the arrival of Progress on the Linux scene should make a large dent
in the &ldquo;Linux has no application&rdquo; argument. Progress is flexible
enough in its deployment capabilities that it allows Linux to be
integrated into existing deployments transparently to provide
greater scalability and cost-effectiveness.</p></div></div>
