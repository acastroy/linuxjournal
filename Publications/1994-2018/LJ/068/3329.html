    Mr. Leipold explains what Kerberos is and why you want to
    use it.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x226b580.0x23632f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>Kerberos is a powerful set of programs
which allow you to have encrypted connections to virtually
anything: TELNET, FTP and even e-mail. This is of little use to the
modem user, but in larger settings where Ethernet is used and
sniffing is a real danger, Kerberos provides a viable and powerful
solution. There is, however, one problem&mdash;Kerberos is notoriously
known for being overly complex and difficult to install. This
article is designed to help you make a good start; before you know
it, with a little experimentation everything will (kind of) work. I
wish I could explain everything in detail here, but then, this
would be a book, not an article.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x226b580.0x23633f8"></a>Here Comes Disaster</h2></div></div><p>Like almost every major upgrade/change, it would be ideal to
make a backup of your system. If you can, do it. If you don't have
a tape drive be careful installing, Kereberos shouldn't write over
your files, but if you want to be sure, make copies of /sbin
somewhere. It takes two seconds and if something goes wrong it will
be well worth your time.</p><p>Now we go grab the files. There are binary and source
distributions of Kerberos for Linux. I've found that the source
usually causes me less problems than the binaries. If you are up to
playing around a bit go ahead and get the source, otherwise grab
the binaries. Either can be found at
<a href="http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/www" target="_self">http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/www/</a>.
I'll cover only the binaries here&mdash;simply because compiling the
source isn't part of the scope of this article. I'm going to assume
you managed to install things right. One important note: If you do
choose to use the source (I recommend you do) make sure you extract
all the tar archive files, not just the one containing the source.
Also, if you install things in a different directory (not /krb5)
then you will need to modify the files mentioned below to reflect
your installation directory.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x226b580.0x23635b0"></a>Two Files: /etc/krb5.conf and kdc.conf</h2></div></div><p>These two files control virtually everything. They control
the name of your REALM (see below) and who can connect; however,
they can be fairly complex. Before you set them up, you will
probably need to understand a few terms:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>REALM</b></span>: I think of
a realm as a &ldquo;group&rdquo;. Machines will belong to this group. It has
become almost standard procedure to make the realm the same as your
domain name, just with capital letters. In my case, I called it
UNDER, but you could call it anything you wanted. Yes, you can have
more than one REALM, but you probably won't need one. Remember&mdash;the
REALM <span   class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> case sensitive! Pick a standard and
stick to it.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>KEYTAB</b></span>: a file
that contains encrypted information allowing users/machines to
authenticate themselves. Each machine that attempts to authenticate
itself to the KDC (see below) must have one. This is done by
issuing the <span   class="bold"><b>ktadd</b></span> command under
<span   class="bold"><b>kadmin</b></span>.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>KDC</b></span>: the Kerberos
Distribution Center&mdash;the one that causes you headaches. This is the
machine that controls access.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>PRINCIPAL</b></span>: a
principal is a &ldquo;definition&rdquo; of a user or a host. It is,
effectively, what tells the server a user exists or a server is
trusted.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>INCIDENT</b></span>: when
making a new principal, the notation is as follows:
<b  ><i><tt>incident</tt></i>/<i><tt>host</tt></i>@REALM</b>.
For example, with ktadd, doing something like</p></li></ul></div><pre     class="programlisting">
        ktadd host/pepsi.kellogg.nwu.edu@UNDER
</pre><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>would make the incident host for the machine
pepsi.kellogg.nwu.edu which is part of the UNDER realm.</p></li></ul></div><p><a href="3329l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a>
</p><p>Take a look at my /etc/krb5.conf file and notice the
following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><b  >default_realm = UNDER</b>: name of
your realm.</p></li><li><p><b  >profile =
/krb5/var/krb5kdc/kdc.conf</b>: location of your kdc.conf
file</p></li></ul></div><p>Also note the section called <b  >[realms]</b>.
Under it, I have the name of my realm, UNDER, and the machine that
hosts that information, in this case, underground.kellogg.nwu.edu.
This will be the hostname of where you just installed Kerberos.
<b  >[domain_realm]</b> explains who can connect to the
realm: anyone from anywhere within kellogg and within res-hall (the
dorm rooms at Northwestern). Replace all the information mentioned
above with the name of your REALM and the name of the machine you
installed the server on.
</p><p><a href="3329l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2</a></p><p>Now on to your kdc.conf file. You are going to need to place
it wherever you defined it in /etc/krb5.conf. My suggestion is you
place it in the same directory I did. This will mean making these
directories. If you do that, you can just copy my kdc.conf and save
yourself some time. Just change the name of the realm to whatever
you picked when making krb5.conf file. These two files are integral
to making things work. You may want to double check for typos and
possibly save yourself some headaches later.</p><p>Now, some tedious but easy work must be done. Create the
database that controls who can login where by issuing the following
command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# kdb5_util create -r
Initializing database '/krb5/lvar/krb5kdc/principal' for
  realm '
master key name 'K/M@<span   class="emphasis"><em>YOUR_REALM</em></span>'
</pre><p>In my case, <span   class="emphasis"><em>YOUR_REALM</em></span> would have been
UNDER. Just replace it with whatever the host name of the machine
you are on right now is. You will be asked for a master password;
pick something you won't forget.
</p><p>Now you must make an ACL file. This basically controls who
can connect and administer the REALM. It can also be complex, but
for our purposes we will keep it simple. Edit the file (or create)
defined by <b  >acl =</b> in the kdc.conf file. Place the
following on a line by itself:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
*/admin@
</pre><p>This means the administrator can control things. I don't see
why you would want anything else anyway.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x226b580.0x2364840"></a>More Fun with Commands</h2></div></div><p>Now it is time to add users to the machine. First, start off
with the administrator account.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# kadmin.local
kadmin.local: addprinc admin/admin@
Enter password for principal "admin/admin@
   your_password
Re-enter password for principal "admin/admin@
   your_password
Principal "admin/admin@<span   class="emphasis"><em>YOUR_REALM</em></span>" created.
</pre><p>Then create a keytab on the server. This will authenticate
who can modify things on the server and who cannot. Make sure you
place everything on one line (including
<b  >kadmin/changepw</b>):
<pre     class="programlisting">
kadmin.local: ktadd -k /etc/kadm5.keytab kadmin/admin kadmin/changepw
Entry for principal kadmin/admin with kvno 3, encryption type
DES-CBC-CRC added to keytab WRFILE:/etc/kadm5.keytab.
Entry for principal kadmin/changepw with kvno 3, encryption type
DES-CBC-CRC added to keytab WRFILE:/etc/kadm5.keytab.
</pre>


You should see something <span   class="emphasis"><em>similar</em></span>, but probably
not identical. Then you have to add the necessary information to
the server. Edit your /etc/inetd.conf and insert the following:
<pre     class="programlisting">
krb5_prop 754/tcp # Kerberos v5 slave propagation
kerberos-adm 749/tcp # Kerberos v5 admin/chpwd
kerberos-adm 749/udp # Kerberos v5 admin/chpwd
kpasswd 761/tcp kpwd # Kerberos "passwd" -kfall
</pre>


Now, as root, restart <span   class="bold"><b>inetd</b></span> and
run <span   class="bold"><b>krb5kdc</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>kadmind</b></span>. Congratulations, most of
the pain is over. It took me eight hours to get here my first time
trying this&mdash;hope you did better.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x226b580.0x2364cb8"></a>Moment of Truth</h2></div></div><p>Now test it. A few commands to know about are
<span   class="bold"><b>kinit</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>klist</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>kdestory</b></span>. These initialize your
tickets which authorize you, list them and destroy them. (Yes, from
the user's point of view, everything is fairly simple.) So try it
out by doing a <b  >kinit
admin/admin@YOUR_REALM</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">
underground:~&gt; kinit admin/admin
Password for admin/admin@UNDER:
underground:~&gt; klist
Ticket cache: /tmp/krb5cc_1000
Default principal: admin/admin@UNDER
Valid starting      Expires             Service principal
08 May 98 15:04:45  09 May 98 01:04:43  krbtgt/UNDER@UNDER
</pre><p>If you got it to work this far, you are virtually done. Add
yourself as a user. Run kadmin&mdash;it should ask you for a password,
same as the one you typed in way back when you created
kadmin/admin. The procedure for adding another user is just as
simple. Each user is a &ldquo;principal&rdquo; (don't ask me where the name
came from).
<pre     class="programlisting">
kadmin:  addprinc
Enter password for principal "user@
Re-enter password for principal "user@
Principal "user@<span   class="emphasis"><em>YOUR_REALM</em></span>" created.
</pre>


Should you make a mistake, just delete the principal like so:
<pre     class="programlisting">
kadmin:  delprinc user@
Are you sure you want to delete the principal "user@
Principal "user@<span   class="emphasis"><em>YOUR_REALM</em></span>" deleted.
</pre>


Now test this out the same way you did the administrator. You
should get a new ticket.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x226b580.0x275d380"></a>How Nice, But ...</h2></div></div><p>I still haven't explained how to <span   class="emphasis"><em>use</em></span> it,
so here we go. In order for you to be able to use Kerberos
encrypted services on a machine, it must satisfy the
following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>It has a principal
host/<span   class="emphasis"><em>hostname</em></span>@REALM on the server</p></li><li><p>It has the correct services set up.</p></li><li><p>It has a keytab file and has /etc/inetd.conf set up
right.</p></li></ul></div><p>The easiest way to try this out is to set up the server so
that it will let you make encrypted connections, before you attempt
to add other machines. The problem is that it is a bit different
from setting up another machine. So we are going to say we want to
have kerberized TELNET and FTP on the machine pepsi.kellogg.nwu.edu
for this example. To do this, you need to satisfy the three
requirements above.
</p><p>Let's go over the first. You are going to need to install
Kerberos on the machine you want to offer kerberized services on
first. All this means is putting the binaries on the machine (in
our example pepsi.kellogg.nwu.edu). So just go install the
binaries. You can, if you want, just copy them over. Then copy your
/etc/krb5.conf file from the KDC (server) and place it on the
machine you are giving kerberized services (pepsi.kellogg.nwu.edu).
From that machine, you must run <b  >kinit
admin/admin</b>. Then run <b  >kadmind</b> from
your machine (or in my case pepsi.kellogg.nwu.edu) and run the
following commands:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
kadmin: addprinc host/pepsi.kellogg.nwu.edu
kadmin: addprinc telnet/pepsi.kellogg.nwu.edu
kadmin: addprinc ftp/pepsi.kellogg.nwu.edu
kadmin: ktadd host/pepsi.kellogg.nwu.edu telnet/pepsi.kellogg.nwu.edu
        ftp/pepsi.kellogg.nwu.edu
</pre><p>A quick explanation is in order. For each service you plan to
offer that is kerberized, you must have a principal. Hence, the use
of <span   class="bold"><b>telnet</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>ftp</b></span> with the
<span   class="bold"><b>addprinc</b></span> command. Then you must
make the keytab. That is done by issuing the ktadd command. All of
this must be done on the machine, you are setting up to offer
services (in this case pepsi.kellogg.nwu.edu).
</p><p>Finally, edit your /etc/inetd.conf and add the following
lines. You will want to comment out any previous definitions of
telnet and ftp.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
klogin stream tcp nowait root /krb5/sbin/klogind klogind -ki
   eklogin stream tcp nowait root /krb5/sbin/klogind klogind -eki
   kshell stream tcp nowait root /krb5/sbin/kshd kshd -ki
   telnet stream tcp nowait root /krb5/sbin/telnetd telnetd -a valid
   ftp stream tcp nowait root /krb5/sbin/ftpd -a
</pre><p>Go back to the main server and create yourself a ticket
(<b  >kinit
<i><tt>user</tt></i>@YOUR_REALM</b>). Now make a
user (see above addprinc command) for yourself and try to login
using telnet like this:
<pre     class="programlisting">
underground:~&gt; telnet -l cosimo pepsi
Trying 129.105.197.33...
Connected to pepsi.kellogg.nwu.edu (129.105.197.33).
Escape character is '^]'.
[ Kerberos V5 accepts you as "cosimo@UNDER" ]
Last login: Fri May  8 13:44:44 on tty2
Linux 2.0.30.
pepsi:~&gt;
</pre>


Note how you didn't have to enter a password. That's okay, because
the ticket gave you the access to the machine. The ticket does
eventually expire, but it can be renewed by issuing a new
<span   class="bold"><b>kinit</b></span> command. (Do a
<span   class="bold"><b>klist</b></span> to see when it does expire.
If you copied my /etc/krb5.conf, it will be 600 minutes.)

changing <b  >telnetd -a valid</b> to <b  >telnetd -a

they don't run kinit, they won't even get a login prompt if you use
<b  >telnet -a valid</b>. Remember, since the passwords
are stored on your KDC, make sure no one breaks into it; otherwise,
they will have access to all the machines to which the KDC grants
access. Get to know the terms principal, realm, kdc, etc.&mdash;almost
anything you come across will use them.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x226b580.0x275df88"></a>Now What?</h2></div></div><p>Well, you most likely feel I've left out a lot&mdash;and you are
