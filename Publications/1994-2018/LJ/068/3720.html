  the best way to partition it. Any suggestions? &mdash;Jes,
jes2@mindspring.com</p><p>You do not say what you plan to do with the disk, or what the
host machine is (server? workstation?). Personally, I usually
partition as such:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/       (about 50Meg)
/safe   (same size)
/var    (half the space left)
/usr    (the other half)
</pre><p>I then link /home to /var/home and /tmp to
/var/tmp/tmp. /safe is a copy of my root partition so that I can
boot on it with LILO if my boot partition becomes badly damaged,
and it also gives me a copy of my configuration files in
/etc.
</p><p>Adding more partitions can be nice, but the more you add, the
more chances you have to run out of space in one of them. For
instance, I think making /tmp a separate partition instead of
linking it to /var is a stupid idea, unless you're willing to give
it several hundred megabytes, or even a gigabyte, because some
programs can create huge temporary files and may fail in bizarre
ways if your /tmp partition is too small.</p><p>/usr is also meant to be read-only, which works very well on
Debian and works mostly on Red Hat (they have incorporated most of
my bug reports). In both cases, you'll still have to remount the
partition as read/write before installing a package, however.  &mdash;Marc
Merlin, merlin@varesearch.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf12580.0x100a3a0"></a>Networking Oddities</h2></div></div><p>I have tried to install Red Hat 6.0 twice now from the CD
included in Sams' <span   class="emphasis"><em>Red Hat Linux 6 Unleashed</em></span>,
and both times have run into the same problem. Installation goes
fine, and when done, I can log in at the console with no problems,
I can telnet out, ping, etc., and I can ping it from other machines
on my internal network. When I use
<span   class="bold"><b>telnet</b></span> to log in to the machine, I
get &ldquo;telnet: unable to connect to remote host: Connection
Refused&rdquo;. When I try to do the
<span   class="bold"><b>finger</b></span> command, I get the same
error. When I use FTP to get to the machine from a 95 workstation,
I get &ldquo;Refused&rdquo;. When I try to do the
<span   class="bold"><b>finger</b></span> command, I get the same
error. When I use FTP to get to the machine from a 95 workstation,
I get &ldquo;ftp:connect :10061&rdquo;, and of course, it does not connect.
On this machine, the IP address is 189.0.1.50, and the subnet
address is 255.255.0.0. Interestingly though, Apache does work, and
I was able to connect the Samba client to the Samba server, so
TCP/IP seems to be working, but only some services.</p><p>My inetd.conf file has the lines</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ftp stream tcp nowait root /usr/sbin/tcpd in.ftpd\
   -l -a
telnet stream tcp nowait root /usr/sbin/tcpd\
   in.telnetd
</pre><p>Further down, I also uncommented the line</p><pre     class="programlisting">
finger stream tcp nowait root /usr/sbin/tcpd\
   in.fingerd
</pre><p>I have used Red Hat and other Linux flavors for over two years, and
have never had a problem like this before.  &mdash;Charles Almond,
charles@ovis.net
</p><p>I answered a similar question for a local user who
had exactly the same problem just last week. Make sure your
<span   class="bold"><b>inetd</b></span> daemon is
actually running. All the file changes in the world do nothing if
the daemon isn't present to read it. You can do a <b  >ps
ax</b> and scroll through the list of running processes to
make sure it is present.  &mdash;Chad Robinson, chadr@brt.com</p><p>There is another possible reason: the connections are being
denied by tcpwrappers. Check /etc/hosts.allow, /etc/hosts.deny and
/var/log/syslog.  &mdash;Marc Merlin, merlin@varesearch.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf12580.0x100a920"></a>PPP Locked by Process</h2></div></div><p>I'm trying to connect to my service provider. I got them to
tell me how to set it up according to all their specifications
through <span   class="bold"><b>linuxconf</b></span>, and according
to them, the setup is right. When I run <b  >ifup
ppp0</b>, I get the following message:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
pppd 2.3.7 started by root uid0 device is locked by pid438 exit.
</pre><p>How do I unlock ttyS1? &mdash;Kirk, webmaster@dcas.net
</p><p>Looks like there is or was another
previous process (438) running, which has or had the /dev/ttyS1
device locked. I think this is the port where your modem is
connected. Log in as root, check if the 438 process is still
running with <b  >ps aux|grep 438</b>; if so, kill or
terminate it with <b  >kill -HUP 438</b> and check on the
/var/lock directory for any file with a name like &ldquo;LCK..ttyS1&rdquo;
which is the actual lock file. Remove it and try again.  &mdash;Felipe E.
Barousse, fbarousse@piensa.com</p><p>There is also the possibility that two programs are trying to
lock the device when you try to dial out. If that appears to be
happening (which is most likely the case if there is no lock file
but pppd always dies), try removing any lines that say &ldquo;lock&rdquo; in
/etc/ppp/options.  &mdash;Steven Pritchard, steve@silug.org</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf12580.0x100ace8"></a>RPMs, Downloading</h2></div></div><p>I am an end user with a Caldera 2.2 Linux system. My question
regards the installation of new software in the RPM format and the
dreaded failed dependences with respect to a missing or wrong
version of a library. I generally use the KDE
<span   class="bold"><b>kpackage</b></span> program but have had the
same problem with the command line
<span   class="bold"><b>rpm</b></span>. Let me give a real
example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Download program.rpm
Run kpackage&mdash;reports: Unsatisfied dependencies
libgdk-1.2.so.0
libgtk-1.2.so.0
</pre><p>But, the Caldera 2.2 system has</p><pre     class="programlisting">
libgdk.so.1.0.5
libgtk.so.1.0.5
</pre><p>Obviously, I need to install an update to GTK+ library. So, I
  downloaded gtk+1.2.3 which provides:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
libgdk-1.2.so.0
libgtk-1.2.so.0
</pre><p>Next, I download the package and use kpackage to install. Guess
what: <b  >Unsatisfied dependencies</b> appears for this
package:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
libc.so.6 (glibc2.1)
libc.so.6 (glibc2.0)
</pre><p>How can two versions of this library be required?</p><pre     class="programlisting">
libm.so.6 (glibc2.1)
</pre><p>Caldera 2.2 has GLIBC 2.1-3 which provides</p><pre     class="programlisting">
libc.so.6
libm.so.6
</pre><p>How do you resolve this issue which is general and not specific to
this one program? More importantly, is there a HOWTO or FAQ or
whatever that details working with these libraries&mdash;lic5, libc6
(2.0 and 2.1), lisbstdc++ and
<span   class="bold"><b>egcs</b></span>? Unless this information is
readily available to newbies so that new software can be added to
their Linux system, they will be dependent on the software provided
by their distribution. I would appreciate your solution to this
problem.  &mdash;Don, dollberg@worldnet.att.net
</p><p>It seems that you have the libraries you need, but that
Caldera and the package you're trying to install (probably built on
Red Hat) don't agree on dependency names. You can try to force the
install with</p><pre     class="programlisting">
rpm -i --nodeps package.rpm
</pre><p>Another option is to download package.src.rpm and
  rebuild it:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
rpm --rebuild package.src.rpm
</pre><p>This will generate an rpm that will install on your
system.  &mdash;Marc Merlin, merlin@varesearch.com
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf12580.0x100b528"></a>Ejecting a CD-ROM</h2></div></div><p>I have Red Hat 5.1, 5.2 and 6 and I can't get my CD-ROM to
eject. I have tried umount, then eject on the CD-ROM. I've tried
umount, then eject on the cdplayer window. I've also tried it
mounted; nothing works. My system is a Compaq Deskpro 4000 pII CPU,
3.2GB hard drive, 32MB RAM, IDE CD-ROM.  &mdash;Uriah Seagraves,
useagraves@excite.com</p><p>When the CD-ROM is mounted, the operating system will issue a
lock command that prevents the eject function from operating. I
suspect your CD-ROM is not actually being unmounted. Execute the
command</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cat /proc/mounts
</pre><p>to view what the kernel thinks is actually mounted
to be sure the drive isn't in the list.  &mdash;Chad Robinson,
chadr@brt.com
</p><p>The <b  >eject</b> command uses the
<b  >cdrom</b> argument as default, check on your /dev
directory if you have a symbolic link from &ldquo;cdrom&rdquo; to the actual
device that handles your CD-ROM drive. In my case, also on a Red
Hat 6.0 system, it is:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ ls -l cdrom
lrwxrwxrwx   1 root     root   3 Aug  9 13:47 cdrom -&gt; hdd
</pre><p>If there is no such link, create it by
typing</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ ln -s hdd cdrom
</pre><p>It should work then. Actually, you can give any name to
the CD-ROM unit by creating links on the /dev directory such
as</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ln -s hdd compactdisc
</pre><p>and later on use <b  >eject compactdisc</b>.
Since you do not mention the specific brand of your CD-ROM unit and
it seems you have tested it under several Linux versions, bear in
mind that the physical CD-ROM unit must support the
<span   class="bold"><b>eject</b></span> command. Also,
type <b  >man eject</b> on your system and read more
about the options of the eject command.  &mdash;Felipe E. Barousse,
fbarousse@piensa.com
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf12580.0x100bb58"></a>Boot Process Question</h2></div></div><p>How do I change the order of items in the boot process? I am
running Red Hat on a laptop and I want to load the PCMCIA services
before the initialization of the network interfaces. Right now, the
interfaces are initialized and eth0 fails because the PCMCIA
services don't load until later in the boot process.  &mdash;Jeff Blaha,
jeffery.f.blaha@us.arthurandersen.com</p><p>If you look at the /etc/rc.d/rc2.d directory and type
<b  >ls -la</b>, you will see a list of files (possibly
among others) starting with a capital S exactly in the order they
are executed by the boot process, and a list of files starting with
capital K in the order they are executed by the shutdown or system
going down processes. The order is alphanumeric and determined by
the numbers that follow the Ss or the Ks. If you rename, say,
S45pcmcia to S07pcmcia (i.e., to some number lower than the one
belonging to the network startup), the PCMCIA services will start
before the network services. This applies to all startup and
shutdown script files on the rc1.d, rc2.d and rc3.d directories
under /etc/rc.d/. Modifying startup and shutdown order of these
files may damage your system behavior and/or some of its services,
so be careful.  &mdash;Felipe E. Barousse, fbarousse@piensa.com</p><p>This is how it's supposed to work: the Ethernet interface
gets configured when pcmcia gets loaded, so there is nothing wrong
with the message you see. However, should you need to start PCMCIA
sooner, you can edit /etc/rc.d/init.d/pcmcia and lower the second
digit on the chkconfig line. For instance, change
<b  >chkconfig: 2345 45 96</b> into <b  >chkconfig:
2345 9 96</b>. Then type:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
chkconfig  --del pcmcia;  chkconfig --add
pcmcia
</pre><p>The links in /etc/rc.d/rc?.d/ will be regenerated.
This will change the order in which PCMCIA is started.  &mdash;Marc
