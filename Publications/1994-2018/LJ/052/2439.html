    Removing a software package is made easy by using Dr.
    Ekdahl's deltree command.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15f7580.0x16ef450"></a></h2></div></div><p>Ever needed to excise a large software
package from your file space only to discover it dispersed over a
directory tree containing over a hundred files and one tenth as
many subdirectories? The command <b  >rm -rf</b> will
clear everything away nicely. However, in order to learn more about
walking a Linux directory tree, let's look at implementing
<b  >rm -r</b> as a home-brew (DOS-like)
<span   class="bold"><b>deltree</b></span> command in Linux is not
difficult and will make it easier to remove unused or unwanted
software packages if you own the utility and use it in your own
file space.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15f7580.0x16ef660"></a>Linux C Library Resources: Files and
Directories</h2></div></div><p>To select C library resources to complete this task, we first
determine which resources are generally available in UNIX and then
which of these resources Linux implements. Two UNIX functions
contained in the header file ftw.h walk a directory tree:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
int ftw ( const char * path,
        int (*funcptr )
        ( const char *, const struct stat*, int ),
        int depth )
</pre><p>and
<pre     class="programlisting">
int nftw (const char * path,
        int (*funcptr)
        (const char *, const struct stat*, int, struct FTW*),
        int depth,
        int flag )
</pre>


Linux does not implement the second function, so we turn to the
first; <span   class="bold"><b>ftw</b></span> walks a directory tree
from top to bottom. For each directory entry, ftw calls the
function pointed to by <b  >funcptr</b> with the name of
the entry, a pointer to a <b  >stat</b> structure
containing inode information and a flag set to convey information
about the directory entry in question:
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>FTW_F</b></span>: a
file</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>FTW_D</b></span>: a
directory</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>FTW_DNR</b></span>: a
non-readable directory</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>FTW_NS</b></span>: stat
failed and inode information is not available.</p></li></ul></div>

What does ftw return to the caller? If it completes a successful
walk through the tree, it returns <b  >0</b>. Otherwise,
it returns <b  >-1</b> and sets the global error flag
<b  >errno</b> appropriately. Using ftw, it is a simple
matter to create a function designed to delete directory items and
to pass a pointer to that function to ftw (see
<a href="2439l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a>):
</p><p>In <span   class="bold"><b>DelEntry()</b></span>, the C library
function</p><pre     class="programlisting">
int remove ( const char * path )
</pre><p>in stdio.h does the actual work. This function returns
<b  >0</b> if successful, <b  >-1</b> if
unsuccessful and sets the global variable <b  >errno</b>
as necessary to handle a number of different error conditions,
which the Linux man pages explain in detail.
</p><p>There is, however, a catch. In UNIX,
<span   class="bold"><b>remove</b></span> may generally be used to
delete either files or empty directories. In Linux,
<span   class="bold"><b>remove</b></span> only processes files and
would therefore empty the directory tree but leave the tree itself
standing. Two UNIX C library functions may provide
solutions:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
int rmdirp ( char * d, char *d1 )
int rmdir ( const char * path )
</pre><p>Linux does not implement the first UNIX function
<span   class="bold"><b>rmdirp</b></span>, so we focus on the second.
The function <span   class="bold"><b>rmdir</b></span> removes only
empty directories and returns 0 on success, <b  >-1</b>
otherwise with <b  >errno</b> set. To accomplish our
task, we must walk the tree twice: once from the top down to the
directory at the bottom, deleting files as we go, and the second
time from the bottom back to the top, removing empty directories in
reverse order. The perfect tool to achieve this result is a
container class: a stack of pointers to directory path names.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15f7580.0x16f04d0"></a>StrStack: A Stack of Pointers to char
Arrays</h2></div></div><p>When ftw calls DelEntry, it supplies a flag indicating
whether it found a file, a directory or cannot cope, and we can use
this flag to fill <b  >StrStack</b> with path names
inside DelEntry as ftw walks the tree. The question is where to put
the stack. The header file ftw.h specifies the signatures of the
ftw function and the function pointed to by
<b  >funcptr</b>, and neither signature includes a stack,
so we cannot pass the stack in by reference as a parameter to
DelEntry. The simplest solution is to create
<b  >StrStack</b> as an external variable in the
implementation file funcs.cpp which holds the function definitions
for <span   class="bold"><b>main</b></span>. As an external variable,
<b  >StrStack</b> will be equally accessible to DelEntry
and to DelDirectories, provided it is defined in the implementation
file above these functions.</p><p>Several aspects of StrStack require explanation. StrStack
differs from the average stack in that each node contains pointers
to two different, dynamically allocated structures: a pointer to
the next node and a pointer to character strings of varying
lengths. Two allocations are necessary to create a node, and two
separate deallocations are necessary to destroy a node. By making
StrStack responsible for both allocations, the code is more
reliable, more robust and has no memory leaks. In addition, if the
caller was responsible for allocating and deallocating memory
containing character arrays, then exocode could literally pull data
out from under StrStack, leaving dangling pointers.</p><p>In some places, implicit recursion accomplishes allocation
and deallocation, and it may not be obvious at first glance how the
process works. Let's examine the copy constructor for StrStack
shown in <a href="2439l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2</a>.</p><p>The class copy constructor is designed to create a copy of a
StrStack object in case a function ever passes a stack in or out by
value. The code in the function is obvious except for one
line:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
next_ = new strNode ( *srcnode.next_ );
                // indirect recursion
</pre><p>This line is an example of indirect recursion, and it
duplicates all the nodes in the StrStack node sequence. How does it
work? The argument to <b  >new</b> is: <b  >strNode (
*srcnode.next_ )</b> which is another call to the node copy
constructor with the next node in sequence as argument. As long as
each node contains a pointer to another node, the copy constructor
repeatedly calls itself recursively until it encounters a
<b  >NULL</b> in the <b  >next_</b> field of
the last node in the sequence. With that, the recursion ceases and
begins to unwind, constructing a copy backwards from the tail of
the node sequence to the head. Note that the copy constructor
deals, as promised, with two different dynamic allocations:
allocating memory for the node, and then for the character array
which holds the path name. In the node destructor, the line
<b  >delete&nbsp;next_ again</b> triggers a sequence of
implicit recursions which result in the destructor calling itself
until the final <b  >NULL</b> at the end of the list is
encountered. At that point, the recursion unwinds, and nodes are
deleted from the tail of the list back to the head.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15f7580.0x16f0bb0"></a>More Utilities</h2></div></div><p>If C library calls do most of the grunt work, writing a
simple utility like deltree is neither difficult nor time consuming
and may offer unanticipated opportunities to use the framework of
the program to address additional problems. This code can be
adapted to perform the same functions as
<span   class="bold"><b>find</b></span>; use it as a skeleton for a
<span   class="bold"><b>findfile</b></span> command which scans a
directory tree for file names matching a command-line argument.
Just replace the file and directory deletion subroutines with
functions that compare each file name with the target name and
print out the path name to each match.</p><p>Do you port code from the Borland or Watcom PC DOS or OS/2
environments and move entire directory trees into Linux space at
once? If so, then you have probably discovered that unwanted files
migrate along with the necessary ones: files with suffixes such as
.map, .sym, .dsk, .swp, .prj, .exe, and the like. With
modification, deltree can also provide a framework for a
<span   class="bold"><b>cleandir</b></span> utility that removes the
chaff from the toolbox directory tree. To make the necessary
changes, replace StrStack with a StrList class which contains a
list of target file name suffixes. Instead of removing all files,
the utility checks the suffix of each file in the directory tree
against the list of target suffixes and deletes selectively. Once
you have the hang of walking a Linux directory tree, creating
plug-in functions to perform other tasks is a simple matter, and it
is easy to generate a group of utilities which address a broader
spectrum of directory tree maintenance issues.</p><p>All code needed to implement this command is available by
