    A quick tour of the various directories in Linux and the
    files contained in each.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27a1580.0x2899348"></a></h2></div></div><p>Important to solving many problems in
Linux is understanding where files are located in the directory
structure. There is, however, no &ldquo;absolute&rdquo; or &ldquo;perfect&rdquo;
directory structure; since Linux is so configurable, the same files
can be put in literally any place and everything will still work.
The home directory for the user joebob will customarily be
/home/joebob, but can be set to be /.joebob. In order to prevent
everyone from being constantly confused, however, a general
standard was formed.
</p><p>Unlike some other operating systems, Linux does not have all
of its files in one enormous, messy directory. The files are
distributed neatly, and once you have a basic understanding, it is
easy to find and modify any file you wish. This article will go
through the directory tree in alphabetical order by directory name
with references to other directories.</p><p>The first directory is /bin which is short for binary, the
file format of most executables. Basic executables for commands,
such as <span   class="bold"><b>ls</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>sync</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>rm</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>cat</b></span>, are contained in /bin. Other
directories containing binary files are /usr/bin/, /usr/X11R6/bin,
/usr/local/bin and ~/bin.</p><p>The next directory is /boot. Not all distributions have this
directory. If present, it usually contains kernels and boot maps
for booting. I keep kernels in the / directory.</p><p>Next is /cdrom, where the CD-ROM drive is mounted in some
distributions. Others may mount it in /mnt/cdrom.</p><p>Next is the /dev directory, which contains many files
(<span   class="bold"><b>ls</b></span> shows 1041 on my machine).
These files are device files (and sometimes FIFOs and other files,
such as the text /dev/sndstat) which allow you to access devices.
These are not actual drivers; they are just interfaces to the
devices. Important files such as /dev/mixer and /dev/fd0 are stored
here.</p><p>Next is the directory /etc, a very important directory
indeed. It contains data files for many programs, including the
configuration files for LILO. The kernel may save sound device
configuration to /etc/soundconf. Scripts run when Linux starts up
are usually kept in /etc/rc.d. The way files are set up in rc.d
changes in different distributions. Another important file is
/etc/inittab which contains some system settings, such as run
levels and what happens when <b  >ctrl+alt+del</b> is
pressed. To keep anyone from rebooting my machine, I set
<b  >ctrl+alt+del</b> to run
<span   class="bold"><b>amp</b></span> and play an mp3 file. Many
servers have commented out that line to prevent the machine from
being rebooted by unauthorized users. Another important place is
/etc/X11, which can contain your XF86Config file; however, this
file may be in many other locations. Also in this directory is the
subdirectory /etc/xdm, in which you can customize your XDM login
for some amazing looks. (Refer to http://torment.ntr.net/xdm/ for
more information.)</p><p>Next is the directory /home. This directory contains home
directories for users. The subdirectories /home/ftp and home/http
may be here for use by their respective daemons connect.</p><p>The directory /lib, like /bin, contains basic executables and
the basic libraries. The directories /usr/X11R6/lib, /usr/lib and
/usr/local/lib are other repositories of libraries.</p><p>Sometimes you will see the directory /lost+found. This
directory may contain inodes which were somehow &ldquo;lost&rdquo; in the
file system with no other location in which to be placed. An
<span   class="emphasis"><em>inode</em></span> is the data structure on disk in which a
description of a file's attributes is stored.</p><p>Some block devices, such as floppy and CD-ROM drives, are
mounted in the /mnt directory. Some distributions use /cdrom for
CD-ROMs and /mnt for floppies, while still others use /mnt/cdrom
for CD-ROMs and /mnt/floppy for floppies.</p><p>Next is /proc, quite a curious directory. Notice that as root
you cannot edit any of its files. (If you can, it is a bad thing.)
This directory contains kernel data and has its own file system
(/proc) and strangely enough, typing
<span   class="bold"><b>du</b></span> in /proc returns the value 0.
The kernel stores all sorts of data in this directory, which is why
you shouldn't edit it.</p><p>The /root directory is the home of root. Often, in /root, you
will find programs or scripts written by root that perform some
task for the machine.</p><p>The /sbin directory contains binaries that normal users
generally don't need&mdash;binaries meant for superusers. Other sbin
directories are /usr/sbin, /usr/local/sbin, etc., which contain
<span   class="bold"><b>ldconfig</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>mke2fs</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>quotaon</b></span> and other programs not
needed by regular users.</p><p>The /tmp directory is unique in that it has write permissions
set for everyone. This directory contains temporary files and FIFOs
for many programs.</p><p>Now we come to /usr, probably the largest directory on your
computer. /usr contains many files for users (as the name implies)
and their programs. It has subdirectories similar to those in the
root directory. The directory /usr/X11R6 contains files for X. Here
you will find man pages, executables, libraries and include files
for X. (As a side note, the X include files in /usr/include are
linked to /usr/X11R6/include/X11.) In /usr/bin there are many more
executables such as <span   class="bold"><b>passwd</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>nice</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>zgrep</b></span>. The directory /usr/doc may
hold help files for the system. The /usr/lib directory contains
more libraries, and directories for different programs that don't
contain libraries for those programs but rather data files. The
next subdirectory is the all-powerful /usr/local. If you compile
and install a program, it will most likely be installed in
/usr/local. Those who did not upgrade distributions and wanted to
install glibc by hand (me), found that glibc was installed in
/usr/local/include instead of /usr/include as it is on newly
installed systems. Many programs, including our favorite the GIMP,
will install some data files in /usr/local/share. Since it contains
programs you install, /usr/local will probably become your favorite
directory. /usr/src is where the kernel source should be
kept.</p><p>Finally, there is the /var directory in which you will find
e-mail spools, printer spools, files containing scores for games
and nothing else of much interest.</p><p>Clearly, the directory tree in Linux isn't all that complex.
One of the best features of Linux is that if things go wrong, you
can fix them. Rebooting and reinstalling your OS isn't your only
option. To tell the truth, I have never had to do so. With an
understanding of where files are located in Linux, system
maintenance becomes easier.</p></div></div>
