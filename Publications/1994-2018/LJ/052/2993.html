get my Soundblaster 16 card recognized and up and running with the
correct modules but destroys my Ethernet modules loaded by
<span   class="bold"><b>kerneld</b></span>?</p><p>I have tried both my Intel Ether Express and SMC Ultra cards
(not at the same time) and the same thing happens with both network
cards as soon as sndconfig is run. Running the Kernel Daemon
Configuration in X has no luck in getting the Ethernet module
loaded again.</p><p>&mdash;Alan Kendall Red Hat</p><p>I'm not sure why it happens, but sndconfig basically just
messes with /etc/conf.modules. You might want to back that file up,
run sndconfig, backup the new file, and replace it with your old
file. Then merge the sound config lines from the file sndconfig
created into your original one. If that doesn't fix it, chances are
you have hardware conflicts with your sound card and your Ethernet
card. If you have further problems, e-mail
sound-bugs@redhat.com.</p><p>&mdash;Donnie Barnes redhat@redhat.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2198580.0x22903f8"></a>openwin Setup</h2></div></div><p>How do I set up <span   class="bold"><b>openwin</b></span>? I

toward Slackware because I'm told it's very powerful and not very
fancy. I'm going for more of the learning factor by installing
it.</p><p>Anyway, I was wondering if someone could basically explain
the correlation between the different distribution names and the
kernels. Are the kernels universal for all the distributions, or
are they built separately? To what degree, if any, are they
compatible? If they're not, I may take a look at the available
software before I install any one version.</p><p>Thank you very much.</p><p>&mdash;Brian Crowe</p><p>Free software (in the sense of freedom) is developed by
independent programmers or research groups, who donate it to the
user community (sort of&mdash;authors do retain a copyright on the
programs). A distribution is an independent effort to put together
all of the needed software to build up a complete operating system
with applications and all that's needed. Usually, distributors
modify some of the original packages to suit their view of the
overall system. The kernel is one of the first packages you update;
they are all compatible.</p><p>At application level, there is a lot of standardization
between the different distributions (thanks to the &ldquo;Filesystem
Hierarchy Standard&rdquo;, an accepted document), the only real
difference being in the organization of their graphical tools to
administer the system.</p><p>&mdash;Alessandro Rubini rubini@systemy.it</p><p>The distributions are built around the Linux kernel, but they
each have their own way of doing installation, packaging and
configuration. After one installs a particular distribution, they
can download the newest kernel and install it themselves if
necessary.</p><p>&mdash;Mark Bishop mark@tct-net.org</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2198580.0x2290a80"></a>FTP Problem</h2></div></div><p>When doing an FTP install and encountering an FTP problem,
the window with some detail of the problem is immediately
overwritten by the FTP setup window. How do I determine the problem
and attempt to fix it?</p><p>&mdash;Mike Newsome Red Hat 5.0</p><p>The FTP install tries to get each package twice. Once that
fails, it errors out. Apparently the error window is getting
overwritten with a new setup window.</p><p>In general, if you got an error like that, it means you lost
your connection to the FTP server. There aren't many other
&ldquo;errors&rdquo; that can occur in the FTP install. FTP installs are not
recommended over crowded networks (i.e., the Internet), because
it's getting impossible to reliably move 200+ MB of data without
some sort of problem. Handling error conditions created by this
situation during the install of a complete operating system is very
difficult. The FTP install does work very well over local or
semi-local networks where you are guaranteed at least some
bandwidth.</p><p>&mdash;Donnie Barnes redhat@redhat.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2198580.0x2290ce8"></a>Configuration Question</h2></div></div><p>My notebook is using the CT65555 VGA chip set (2MB) with a
13.3-inch Active display (1024x768), and I can only get 1024x768
8-bit colour. How can I configure Red Hat to use 1024x768 16-bit
colour?</p><p>&mdash;Corne Red Hat 5.0</p><p>First, edit your /etc/X11/XF86Config file and add another
&ldquo;Display&rdquo; subsection to the &ldquo;Screen&rdquo; section. The subsection
you add should look like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">

with TeX on a Linux system. I called Adobe to order the font and
was told, &ldquo;We only sell products for Windows and Macintosh. We do
not support UNIX&rdquo;. I tried ordering the Mac version of the font.
When the package arrived it had three floppies. Two of them hold
Adobe's ATM program, and Hfsutils could mount each of them on my
Linux system. The third holds Caslon, and I could not mount it with
Hfsutils or in any other way. In short, I see no way to get either
<span   class="bold"><b>pfa</b></span> or
<span   class="bold"><b>pfb</b></span> files for Caslon. I've spent
several days poking around the Web, and I can't find any references
to this problem&mdash;let alone a solution.</p><p>I am nearly finished with a Linux application for an academic
journal. It allows the journal to code articles, book reviews and
other material in the journal. My program produces a TeX version of
the journal, HTML for the parts that go on the journal's web site,
and index files compatible with 60 years of index data for the
journal. I started the project with the understanding (from Walsh's
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Making TeX Work</em></span>) that TeX can use any Adobe
type 1 font. Now, it appears that is only true on a Windows or Mac
platform.</p><p>Am I missing something (perhaps really obvious)? If not, this
looks to me like a serious problem for Linux users who want to
develop and run commercial applications.</p><p>&mdash;David Bausum</p><p>I agree with you, this is a real problem
for Linux users. Commercial software packages tend to assume the
user is not able to copy files around, so they encapsulate every
data file into a proprietary format, and distribute their own
executable programs to extract such data.</p><p>The right approach would be to distribute zip files, or
another known data format, but everyone thinks they have the best
format around, and they don't care about real-world computer
users.</p><p>Although I have never used Adobe fonts, I'm pretty sure that
after installing them on one of the supported operating systems
you'll find the needed .pfa and .pfb files, which will work for
Linux. This means you must first access a Windows or a Macintosh
box to do the initial install of the fonts, then copy them to your
Linux box.</p><p>&mdash;Alessandro Rubini rubini@systemy.it</p><p>[As a side note, SSC has used the Windows versions of the
Adobe fonts on Linux quite successfully on our Reference Cards.

relatively easy way to migrate part of the file system to the new
drive (/usr/bin) without a full backup or reinstall?</p><p>&mdash;Alan Jump Red Hat 5.0</p><p>You need to partition the new drive using Linux
<span   class="bold"><b>fdisk</b></span>, changing the
system ID flag for the partition(s). After that is done, you need
to &ldquo;make&rdquo; new file systems, using
<span   class="bold"><b>mkfs</b></span>. Mount the new file system on
an empty directory such as /mnt. Then use <b  >cpio
-pdum</b> to copy the content of the old /usr/bin
directory to the /mnt directory. Add a new line in the /etc/fstab
file, indicating the new file system is to be mounted on the
/usr/bin directory. Bring the machine to the single-user state,
move the old /usr/bin to /usr/bin.old, and create a new, empty
/usr/bin. Reboot, and the new file system will contain your
/usr/bin files.</p><p>&mdash;Paulo J V Wollny paulo@wollny.com.br</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2198580.0x22917e8"></a>Downloading Photos</h2></div></div><p>I need a program, script or information on how to get the

annoying me.</p><p>I've heard of several workarounds for this problem, but never
found a final solution. I've recompiled my kernel several times,
going through the Makefile to check that all kernel options are
fine. I've followed the make sequence correctly (which includes the
compilation and installation of all modules from scratch). Yet, I'm
always surprised by at least one of these warnings at boot-time.
Rather than a magical solution, I would appreciate a good
description of the problem (which I'm sure will help me solve this
issue).</p><p>Thank you guys. Keep up the good work.</p><p>&mdash;German Horacio</p><p>Kernel modules are stored in the /lib/modules directory in a
subdirectory corresponding to the kernel release. So if you have
just compiled kernel 2.0.33, the result of</p><pre     class="programlisting">
make modules_install
</pre><p>would be to place all the kernel modules in
/lib/modules/2.0.33. Unfortunately, if you already have a 2.0.33
subdirectory from a previous kernel compile or kernel install,
these new modules will add to those already there. If some of the
original modules were not compiled as modules or are not supported
in the new kernel, they will generate an &ldquo;unresolved symbols&rdquo;
error message when the new kernel is booted.
</p><p>A safe solution is to always move the old modules directory
to a neutral location, such as:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
mv /lib/modules/2.0.33 /lib/modules/2.0.33.old
</pre><p>before executing
<b  >make&nbsp;modules_install</b>. It can be
deleted later when you are sure you will not need the old kernel.
This same error (and others) could be produced by failing to
run</p><pre     class="programlisting">
make modules
make modules_install
</pre><p>after a new kernel compile. </p><p>&mdash;Dwight Johnson dwj@aaronsrod.com</p><p>Answers
