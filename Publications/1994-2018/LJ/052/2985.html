    Mr. Taves tells us how he set up the USPS with Linux boxes for
    running OCR software and image capture.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1231580.0x1329500"></a></h2></div></div><p>The United States Postal Service deployed
over 900 Linux-based systems throughout the United States in 1997
to automatically recognize the destination addresses on mail
pieces. Each system consists of five dual Pentium Pro 200MHz
(PP200) computers and one single PP200, all running Linux.
</p><p>The USPS already had the mail-piece scanners and some old
custom computers that recognized the addresses. This project
connected the Linux computers to each scanner in order to run more
modern OCR (optical character recognition) algorithms supplied by
RAF Technology Inc. This system was designed by me during the time
I was Vice President of Engineering at RAF Technology Inc.</p><p>One of the five Linux boxes has a monitor, keyboard, mouse,
CD-ROM and floppy&mdash;the other four are headless. Each has 128MB RAM
and a 2.5GB hard drive. The mail pieces are scanned at 212dpi at a
rate of 12 per second. The binary image is sent to one of the Linux
boxes via a custom cable and receiver board. The board packs the
bits and uses DMA (direct memory access) to transfer the data over
the PCI bus. The receiving computer runs a process that compresses
the images and routes them via Ethernet to one of 10 identical
processes, two for each CPU, that do the hand-print recognition and
machine-print recognition. Those algorithms recognize the text from
the image in less than a second and return the ASCII results to a
database on a separate computer that looks up the zip code. The
slave computers are connected on a subnet with the master which has
a second Ethernet card connected to the rest of the computers
associated with the scanner. The local network is 10Mbps Ethernet
and handles the compressed binary images sent to the slaves and the
ASCII results received from the slaves.</p><p>Originally, I planned to run only machine-print recognition
algorithms, which use far fewer resources than hand-print
recognition algorithms. The majority of the mail stream is
machine-printed addresses. The original system was designed to have
four single PP200s, each with 32MB RAM. Only one was to have a CD,
hard disk and monitor. The others, called slaves, would have no
mass storage and would boot off the ROM on the Ethernet card. Just
before the system was to be deployed, the USPS decided that the
hand-print recognition developed by SUNY Buffalo was accurate
enough to include in the system. We reconfigured the slaves to have
a 2.5GB hard disk and 128MB RAM.</p><p>I shopped for the best combination of size, speed and cost
for the slave computers and settled on a tidy 3.5-inch high rack
chassis from Tri Map International. One other choice was a passive
back plane with up to four PC-on-a-card computers. PC-on-a-card
computers are basically ISA cards with a complete PC on them. The
card gets power from the back plane, and you can plug four cards at
a time into one back plane, since the back plane is separated into
four separate ISA busses. The theory is that you can put more CPUs
into a smaller package. The passive back plane takes up 7 inches of
vertical space on the rack for the four CPUs. The width and depth
of the rack is basically fixed. The problem was that PC-on-a-card
computers were quite expensive and didn't support the fastest CPUs.
At that time, I could only get P166s on a card when PP200s were
available in the Baby AT form factor. The Baby AT form factor is
the extremely popular PC motherboard type that has the big round
keyboard plug. I was much more comfortable recommending the baby AT
form factor because replacement motherboards would be available
forever. The best choice turned out to be the nifty 3.5-inch high
chassis. So for 7 inches of vertical space, I got two PP200s
instead of four P166s, at a much lower cost and with a more common
motherboard.</p><p>As I worked on this project, computers just kept getting
faster. By the time we deployed, we put two dual PP200s in the
3.5-inch chassis and the PC-on-a-card computers were still only
capable of taking P200s. It is not clear what would be the best
choice today. Pentium IIs come on a big riser card that won't fit
in the 3.5-inch chassis. The 3.5-inch chassis required a special
board that bent the Ethernet card 90 degrees, so it was parallel to
the motherboard. This limited the number of cards that could be
plugged in; fortunately, I needed only the Ethernet card.</p><p>Linux was an excellent OS for this application. To make the
OS and OCR software run in 32MB RAM with no swap, the kernel was
recompiled with only the essentials&mdash;an impossibility with a
Microsoft OS. Because Linux is free, I didn't have to worry about
license fees. The device driver for the custom card was relatively
painless to develop, and I must say Linux &ldquo;product support&rdquo; was
far superior to anything else I've used. When I had trouble
allocating large amounts of real memory in the kernel, I e-mailed a
question and always received a quick response. As it turned out, I
needed to muck with the source code and recompile, as a large
amount of real memory was needed for a side project in which the
USPS wanted to capture 8-bit gray-scale images.</p><p>The scanners, already in place, could produce 8-bit
gray-scale data. Unfortunately, at 12 images per second the
gray-scale data arrives at a rate of 28MBps. The capture card and
PCI bus would be able to deliver the data to the PC's RAM, but the
disk wouldn't be able to store it fast enough. I set up the PCI
card to fill RAM with images until no space was left. The data
would then be read from the device driver and written to the disk.
While the data is written to the disk, the scanner continues to run
at 12 mail-pieces per second, but the PCI card just ignores the
images until the RAM has been freed up. With this system, the USPS
can capture a decent sampling of gray-scale mail-piece images in
real time.</p><p>The USPS told me they were having another company build a
custom, portable, gray-scale, data-capture machine, in order to be
able to capture sample images throughout the USA. I told them an
expensive custom solution was not necessary because I could build
one in a few weeks for a few thousand dollars each. I did this by
putting together several luggable Linux boxes. I used the
portable-style computer case that has a color flat-panel display
and a full-size keyboard that snaps against the screen. Since I
needed to put a tape drive and a PCI card in the PC, I couldn't use
a laptop. I had no problems getting an X Window System server
running on the portables. The setup would have worked without X,
but it was important to the USPS to be able to look at the images
on the spot. These data-capture units, as setup, gave them just
what they needed and worked great.</p></div></div>
