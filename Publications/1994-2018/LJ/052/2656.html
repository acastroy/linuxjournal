interesting. I tucked the author's name and the book's title away
in my memory, and several months later when I was in a large
bookstore, I purchased <span   class="emphasis"><em>Master and Commander</em></span> by
Patrick O'Brian. Within a dozen pages I was hooked. In the
intervening years I've enjoyed all of the 18-volume series dealing
with the adventures of Maturin and Aubrey during the Napoleonic
Wars. The point of this story is that, when I find an author I
like, I'll read as many of his books as I can. I've found the same
approach works with technical books.
</p><p>In <i  >LJ</i> issue 42, I described how I
discovered W. Richard Stevens' <span   class="emphasis"><em>Advanced Programming in
the UNIX Environment</em></span>. In conjunction with the project
described in that review, I needed to learn something about UNIX
network programming. By coincidence, Stevens' first book was
entitled <span   class="emphasis"><em>UNIX Network Programming</em></span>. Without
hesitation I ordered the book in late 1996, even though it was six
years old and possibly dated. For reasons I don't quite understand
(but put down to my own deficiencies), <span   class="emphasis"><em>UNP</em></span> and
I never quite clicked in the way <span   class="emphasis"><em>APUE</em></span> and I
did. Even so, when I learned in the fall of 1997 that a second
edition of <span   class="emphasis"><em>UNP</em></span> was about to be released, I
ordered a copy as soon as it was available.</p><p>Generally, I am leery of new editions. All too often the book
has a new preface, a new cover (with the words &ldquo;new&rdquo; or
&ldquo;improved&rdquo; in big letters), a new copyright date, some cosmetic
reshuffling of material, and little else. Some publishers and
authors specialize in this game. That is not true for this book.
The complete title gives a hint that the new edition is real. (In
fact, three volumes are planned for the second edition.) A cursory
glance at the table of contents confirms that this is an entirely
new book. Within several days of working with it, something
clicked, and the basics of UNIX network programming fell into place
for me.</p><p>I like working with Stevens' books because he makes beautiful
books. The operable words here are &ldquo;makes beautiful&rdquo;. The second
word is important because a beautiful book&mdash;one that is well
organized and whose pages contain a balanced presentation of text
(explaining the topic at hand), diagrams (showing relationships),
tables (summarizing or detailing particular items) and code&mdash;makes
the beginner's journey through new material much easier. The first
word is important because a beautiful book does not just happen. It
is made in the same way a medieval work of art was made: by an
individual who spent years mastering a field, and then used that
mastery in various projects. One of the tools Stevens uses is
troff. If you have an interest in design and layout, you might
profit from the part of Stevens' web site dealing with typesetting
and troff resources. Lest the reader think I'm making too much of
this, let me note that I'm currently working my way through several
books in another area (best left unnamed). Unfortunately, none are
as well organized (beautiful in the sense described above) as
Stevens' books are. As a result, I find each to be difficult to
work with.</p><p>The new book has a complete rewrite of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>UNP</em></span>'s chapters on Berkeley sockets and System
V's TLI. Although it is over 1000 pages long, it is not padded and
does not (unnecessarily) duplicate material from Stevens' earlier
books. There is very little general (non-network) programming
covered in the book. References to <span   class="emphasis"><em>APUE</em></span> are
made as necessary. Similarly, Stevens refers to the TCP/IP series
rather than duplicates material covered there. Also, he has managed
to cut through the generalities about networking that occupied 10%
of the first edition of <span   class="emphasis"><em>UNP</em></span>. For example, on
page 6 of the new book, Stevens presents code for a working client
program, and on page 13 he presents code for the complementary
server. When a client connects, the server gets the time and sends
it to the client which prints it and quits. The result is trivial
(just as the classic &ldquo;hello world&rdquo; program is), but it provides a
working client-server program hardly a dozen pages into the
book.</p><p>This new book mixes working, portable, real-world, annotated
code with text, diagrams and tables to document the sockets (and
XTI) API. Over 50 programs and 100 functions are discussed in the
book.</p><p>Working code means you can obtain all the examples used in
the book from Stevens' home page
(http://www.kohala.com/~rstevens/). For example, in less than an
hour I downloaded a 226KB gzipped tar file, expanded it, ran
Stevens' configuration routine, ran the Makefile which builds the
library used by all programs and subsequent Makefiles, and compiled
the programs for Chapter 1. During the make of the library, I had a
small problem because I don't have a threads library on my system.
A quick change to the library Makefile (removing references to
threads) fixed things. I've not compiled all the programs supplied,
but the ones I have compile and run the way the book says they
should.</p><p>Portable means the code will compile not only on Linux
systems (yes, Linux is one of the systems used as an example in the
book), but on BSD, HP UNIX, Digital UNIX, Solaris (Sun/SPARC) and
Unixware systems. Some of these are running IPv4 protocol stacks,
others are running IPv6. The code &ldquo;doesn't care&rdquo;; it is portable.
One of the themes running through the book is how a programmer can
write library routines which are protocol stack and system
independent. Portable also means POSIX compliant, in particular
Draft 6.6 (March 1997) of P1003.1g.</p><p>Real world means the code deals with errors. A programmer
must constantly ask &ldquo;how can this code, this library call, this
function fail? If it does, how can I either gracefully end the
program or recover and keep going?&rdquo; For many new programmers this
is a difficult lesson to learn. Stevens worries about this, and the
beginner will benefit from his examples.</p><p>Annotated means that when code is discussed in the book, the
printed listing includes the subdirectory and file name for the
code, the lines in the listing are numbered, and the discussion in
the text puts an appropriate, line-number range in the margin of
the text. This makes it easy for you to move from text (discussing
a range of lines) to the printed listing (in the book) to the
actual file (on your hard disk).</p><p>The book contains much more than code. Stevens writes well.
He has developed a style which allows him to interrupt his
narrative discussion with historical and current observations. He
does this by adjusting the margins and changing the font. It is
easy to skip the &ldquo;notes&rdquo; on a first reading and then focus on
them on subsequent passes through a section or chapter. One example
of the timeliness of these notes is his explanation of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>denial of service</em></span> attacks on page 99. When
appropriate, Stevens includes a diagram which provides an alternate
explanation for a topic. Also, when appropriate, he includes a
table which summarizes similar pieces of a topic. The result is a
work which is encyclopedic without being stifling.</p><p>I find I can approach a new chapter or section and first
study the code, then examine the diagrams, then read the text and
finally repeat the process, possibly in a different order. As I
understand more, the various approaches reinforce each other so
that the whole ends up being greater than the sum of its parts.
Finally, the various tables are natural places to refer back to,
once I understand a topic or when I have a specific
question.</p><p>The book is organized into four parts. The first is 50 pages
(two chapters) of introductory material. This includes the working
client-server program referred to above. The second is 200 pages
(seven chapters). This discusses the basic networking functions
utilized by Berkeley sockets (socket, bind, etc.). This part
contains many programs and program fragments. The third is 500
pages (18 chapters) and deals with miscellaneous topics. The fourth
is 120 pages (seven chapters) and covers the basic API for X/Open
Transport Interface. The beginner will want to read the first two
parts carefully. The more advanced reader should skim part one to
get a sense of Stevens' style and then refer to part two as needed.
To a large degree, the chapters in part three are independent of
each other. That means, once the basics from part two are clear, it
is very easy to pick and choose among the topics discussed in part
three. If you are interested in threads, skip to Chapter 23. If you
are interested in IPv4 and IPv6, turn to Chapters 10 and 24.</p><p>Rather than give more details here, I will invoke the spirit
of Linux and refer you to Stevens' web site. If you look there, you
will find information about each of Stevens' existing books, and
you will find the Table of Contents, the Preface and a sample
chapter of <span   class="emphasis"><em>UNIX Networking Programming, Volume 1, Second
Edition</em></span>. In addition, you will find the code for the
book and a README file describing the installation of the software,
as well as the typesetting and troff references. Finally, you will
find information about Volume 2 (<span   class="emphasis"><em>Interprocess
Communication</em></span>) and Volume 3
(<span   class="emphasis"><em>Applications</em></span>). Both these volumes were still
under construction at the time I wrote this review (February).
Together the three volumes comprise the second edition of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>UNIX Network Programming</em></span>.</p></div></div>
