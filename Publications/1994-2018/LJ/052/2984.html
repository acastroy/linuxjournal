cause but a law. It is not enough to do good; one must do it the
right way. No man can climb out beyond the limitations of his own
character.  &mdash;John, Viscount Morley of Blackburn</p></blockquote></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x173f580.0x1837768"></a></h2></div></div><p>Only two operating systems are growing in
market share today. The one we all know is Microsoft Windows (both
NT and 95). The one most of us don't know is Linux. After reading
the mainstream press (or listening to politicians like Orrin Hatch
or to professional haranguers like Ralph Nader and Gary Reback), it
seems clear that Microsoft, that evil monopoly, is making Windows
the requisite operating system for every computer-like device in
the known universe.
</p><p>But there is a constituency that won't let this happen. It's
the growing community of hard-core technologists, an increasing
number of whom now rely on Linux. A case could be made that the
only technologists who aren't into Linux remain with another OS for
practical or business reasons.</p><p>Today, Linux is the technologists' OS. It's a bad idea to bet
against them. It's a good idea to bet with them. That's exactly
what Netscape did when they released their source code to what
everyone suddenly calls the Open Source community, but for years
was the Free Software movement. Significantly, Linux is free. But
more significantly, Linux's source code is open. Anybody can look
at it, tweak it and share their tweaks with friends&mdash;which is
exactly why Linux is so popular with techies. Quite literally, it's
theirs. They made it.</p><p>&ldquo;All the significant trends start with technologists,&rdquo; Marc
Andreessen says.</p><p>Lest we forget, the Internet was created by technologists,
and its explosive growth is far more an expression of rampant
hackery than of commercial activity, personal expression, massive
archiving or whatever.</p><p>Consider this: over half of all the web pages on the Internet
today are produced by free web software&mdash;mostly Apache&mdash;running on
Linux operating systems. Windows NT is gaining, but not necessarily
at Linux's expense. In fact, Linux is gaining too, mostly at the
expense of commercial systems.</p><p>Even many commercial sites use Linux. According to a Commerce
Department report released today, the volume of information being
processed over the Web is doubling every sixty days. The mind
boggles.</p><p>If even half of that growth is happening on Linux, the
population of supportive techies is at critical mass or better.
Netscape knows this, which is why they're betting the farm on
Linux, just like they bet the farm on the Net four years earlier,
when they changed the whole software business forever by freely
releasing their first browser to anyone in the world with an FTP
client, and by making development partners out of a ubiquitous user
base.</p><p>In fact, the farm metaphor is an apt one, because releasing
the browser source code on March 31 amounts to a bet that spring is
here, the ground is tilled, the seeds will grow, and the crop will
be abundant. It's probably not a coincidence that Marc Andreessen
grew up on a farm.</p><p>He knew in his bones that releasing the Netscape browser
source was the &ldquo;Right Thing&rdquo; to do, so did many other farmers out
there in the hacker community. Chief among these was Eric Raymond,
who earned some notoriety when he edited <span   class="emphasis"><em>The New Hacker's
Dictionary</em></span> a couple of years ago, but whose fame really
caught fire when his essay &ldquo;The Cathedral and the Bazaar&rdquo;
(http://sagan.earthspace.net/esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar.html)
caught the attention of the Netscape folks, and spread from
there.</p><p>By Eric's metaphor, significant software was traditionally
built like a cathedral, &ldquo;carefully crafted by individual wizards
or small bands of magicians working in splendid isolation, with no
beta to be released before its time.&rdquo; But a new model was brought
to the world by Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux: &ldquo;release
early and often, delegate everything you can, be open to the point
of promiscuity.&rdquo; The result was a vast community of techies that
&ldquo;seemed to resemble a great babbling bazaar of differing agendas
and approaches (aptly symbolized by the Linux archive sites, which
would take submissions from anyone), out of which a coherent and
stable system could seemingly emerge only by a succession of
miracles.&rdquo;</p><p>The cathedral and bazaar metaphors seemed apt for the worlds
that surrounded the code. The corporate world was formal and
contained, while the open source world was informal and
open.</p><p>Not that the bazaar lacks formalities of its own. (A detailed
analysis of these formalities can be found in &ldquo;Homesteading the
Noosphere&rdquo; by Eric Raymond,
http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/homesteading/.) Every society has
its protocols, and the hacker community is no exception. The open
source world is a society of peers. &ldquo;You're not a hacker until
somebody else calls you one,&rdquo; Eric says. What you get out of this
society is not just great code written by the best programmers in
the world, but massive peer review and an equally abundant source
of support.</p><p>I found myself pulled into this world when (<i  >Linux Journal</i> publisher) Phil Hughes told me I ought to be
talking with Eric, since for years I've been a kind of Johnny
Talkyseed, spreading the notion that markets are conversations,
rather than battlefields. Phil thought the bazaar metaphor was at
worst a corollary and at best another way of saying the same
thing.</p><p>Over the next month, I got a lot of great hang-time with Eric
(he was a house guest for a week). I also intercepted Jim Barksdale
at an industry forum and turned that conversation into an interview
with Netscape co-founder Marc Andreessen and Mozilla.org's new
captain, Tom Paquin. I attended the Silicon Valley User's Group
(SVLUG) meeting where Marc and Tom together announced the open
source move and addressed the Linux community on their thinking for
the first time.</p><p>In brief, here's what Marc and Tom told that
community:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The timing is right, because both open source and
Linux energy have reached critical mass.</p></li><li><p>Releasing the browser source and joining the open
source community is a return to roots, both for Netscape and for
Marc personally.</p></li><li><p>There's an opportunity to catalyze open source
development, not only in the Linux community, but inside two
cathedrals: commercial software developers and their corporate
customers.</p></li><li><p>If Sun doesn't open Java's source code, it'll
happen anyway, outside Sun's cathedral. The open source community
should work to bring Sun to a &ldquo;more enlightened&rdquo; place.</p></li><li><p>Sun, Oracle and other mainstream developers need to
adopt Linux as a Tier One reference platform. Netscape already
has.</p></li><li><p>Linux has a couple of problems its development
community should address. One is scalability. The other is
mission-criticalness. In time, it should be able to run on
multi-processing servers and clusters and handle heavy-duty
transaction processing, for example.</p></li></ul></div><p>Marc also made some predictions:
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Linux will get discovered by the mainstream press
within a year.</p></li><li><p>Linux will consolidate the UNIX market and expand
beyond it.</p></li><li><p>Netscape will bundle Mozilla with Linux.</p></li><li><p>Mozilla will become the GUI of the future&mdash;&ldquo;the
user environment where people can live and work on the Net.&rdquo; Here
it will naturally go &ldquo;hand in hand, or hand in claw, with
Linux.&rdquo;</p></li><li><p>When mainstream vendors want to start adapting
Linux to their particular hardware, they're going to run up against
the Linux GPL. Something needs to be done about that, or Linux
adoption will be slowed down.</p></li></ul></div>

A few days later I was booked for a half-hour interview with Marc
and Tom at Netscape. The conversation quickly reached critical mass
and ran for an hour and a half. What it comes down to, it's clear,
is one line from Tom: &ldquo;We're betting on Darwin here.&rdquo; Let's hope
he's right.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x173f580.0x18386e0"></a>The Technologists and their OS</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: Why release the browser
source now?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marc</b></span>: Today we're at an
inflection point, a trigger point, when there's an alignment with
the energy of growth. Linux is hot. The technologists have adopted
it, and it's growing fast all through the open source community.
This gives us confidence that we couldn't screw it up if we tried.
And now we can't de-commit. This thing has been set in motion. Even
if we do nothing, there's no stopping what's going to happen. It's
going to be fun.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: A few years back,
somebody at Netscape called&mdash;maybe it was you&mdash;and said, without
meaning insult, that the OS is &ldquo;just a device driver.&rdquo; Is Linux
well suited to that role?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marc:</b></span> Yes. Linux is evolving
naturally to do what an OS does best, while Windows is constantly
adding non-OS functionalities as part of a vertical strategy to
take over layer after layer above the OS. This looks a lot like
what IBM did first and Apple did all over again on the IBM model.
It has made Microsoft much more vulnerable to a grass-roots
technology movement like Linux, and is one of the reasons Linux is
the only non-Microsoft OS that's gaining market share. It's amazing
that these companies make the same mistakes over and over again,
but they do.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: There is an irony here.
One of the reasons why PCs rather than Macintoshes were established
in companies, was that, although everybody agreed Macintoshes were
better, the technologists would rather work with DOS because they
could easily write DOS programs that addressed a specific problem.
In the same way today, the technologists would rather work with
Linux. What you said at SVLUG about customers using Macintoshes and
PCs at work and Linux boxes at home isn't just a joke. There's
something going on here.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marc</b></span>: Absolutely.
Technologists are driving progress, and it's easier to drive with
Linux than with anything else.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: Tell me more about your
role in the Linux movement.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Tom</b></span>: What we want to do is
give Linux critical mass so it hits a crossover point. There's a
huge development community that's growing bigger every day. And
it's an efficient one relying on massive peer review that you can't
replicate inside the corporate world, although the two overlap a
great deal. So we're betting on Darwin here&mdash;natural selection. All
we're doing with Mozilla.org is helping create conditions that give
evolution a hand.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marc</b></span>: It's the exact same
thing I saw with the Net. Before it hit critical mass, the Internet
had a million plus users. People were using it every day, and all
of them were technologists. But the Net was also unapproachable and
not understandable to people outside that community. They'd scratch
their heads and wouldn't get the point. The crossover point came
with e-mail and the Web&mdash;though I think e-mail was the bigger
driver. Suddenly it became relevant to everybody. But first it had
to reach a critical mass in the technologist community. Linux is
there today, and it's ready to cross over. But it requires specific
catalyzing events, just like the Internet did.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: And releasing the
Mozilla source may be just the event.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marc</b></span>: Right.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x173f580.0x1c31170"></a>Getting to Scalability</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: You say you are looking
for Linux to obtain a scalability to support a lot of database
transactions and large-scale information processing that Solaris,
AIX and those other UNIX variants perform. It seems to me the kind
of guys who hang around Linux are not the kind of guys who want to
do that kind of programming. Is that true?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Tom</b></span>: You mean put SMP
(symmetric multi-processing) into the kernel?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marc</b></span>: Right.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Tom</b></span>: All you need is a
couple or a few people who can steer and many other people who say
&ldquo;Oh, that's an issue? I'll deal with it.&rdquo; And competent
programmers will be all over it.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marc</b></span>: Especially since this
has already been done multiple times.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Tom</b></span>: That's my point. This
is not uncharted water. Companies have done it. They know where the
problems are.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: But it's uncharted
water outside of companies, and Linux is sort of this
extra-corporate thing. Does the Open Source community sit around
caring about this sort of issue?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Tom</b></span>: If you asked this
question six or seven years ago, then you'd have a hard time
finding a large and broad enough variety of people who have spent
time making, for example, SMP kernels work. In 1998, that's no
longer true. You can scoot up and down the street and find people
who have done it. A lot of those guys go to the Linux Users Group
meetings and are interested in getting SMP in the machine they've
got at home. It's just not that remote of a science anymore. So I
think your characterization is no longer valid. Marc, do you know
Linus's position on this? He thinks it's time to do it,
right?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marc</b></span>: Right.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: So then it's done. It's
going to happen.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Tom</b></span>: That's right.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: Would you dedicate any
internal resources to making it happen?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marc</b></span>: Not currently. If
there was something specific we could do to help, maybe. But I'm
not suggesting Netscape should take more of a leadership role in
determining the future of Linux. That seems to be working just
fine. Of course, in any case where we can help, we'd be interested
in figuring out how.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: I'm trying to figure
out how this larger community works. Some of these guys are working
at this on their day jobs and some aren't.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marc</b></span>: Typically they have
very relevant day jobs. At least one person in every technology
company on the planet is in this community; so again, this is the
same thing that happened with the Internet, and why it broke into
the mainstream. It infiltrated itself into all these companies
through resident technologists who were interested in it.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2984f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

browser conversation now, with Mozilla.org?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Tom</b></span>: We're hoping to steward
that conversation, but there's no compulsion here. They have the
source and can choose to go their merry way. We're all better off
if there's a lot of coordination and cooperation, and the community
recognizes that. So it's not that they're going to be dragged
kicking and screaming into it. We don't have to offer free donuts
to get them to come to the party. On the other hand, if they don't
like our stewardship, they don't have to cooperate. So we have to
act in the traditional open source responsible manner&mdash;in a way
that will make them want to play. Somebody will steward this,
whether it's us or not. If they don't like us, they'll find someone
else to do it.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marc</b></span>: Again, we can't
de-commit.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: I've always thought the
best kind of marketing amounts to arson. You set fires and stand
back and watch what happens.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marc</b></span>: (Laughing) Right. I'll
enjoy watching this one.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: The open source world,
it seems to me, is already a very active conversation. Great
kindling, as it were. Already the browser conversation has changed:
Whoosh, it's different.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marc</b></span>: Right.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: Yet the press will
still play this as a war over a battlefield, no matter how much it
looks like the Big Bang, and no matter how non-territorial it
is.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marc</b></span>: Exactly. What's really
happening is new vendors constantly opening up new spaces where new
things happen. Everybody gains. That's the real story.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: And, once you have a
firestorm of interest going on around Mozilla, it will do what LDAP
did two years ago.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marc</b></span>: Sure. Same
pattern.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x173f580.0x1c32668"></a>No Surprises</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: What has surprised you,
in just the week since the source went out?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marc</b></span>: A lot of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>our</em></span> programmers have been surprised by the
level of interest and activity. We've cured a lot of skepticism in
the last week.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Tom</b></span>: You're going to dislike
the things that surprised me, because in truth we expected this to
take off in exactly the way it has. We got a bunch of memory bug
fixes that I thought were great. I was a little surprised at how
strong the Macintosh community jumped on. They were really in
there. We got a localized version that happened fast: a crypto
plug-in from the crypto-weenies in Australia who hacked it together
in seven hours hacking time, fifteen hours real time. Speed was
impressive too. I expected people to spend more time digesting, but
they piled right in.</p><p>The skeptics are surprised, of course. &ldquo;Well, gee, we see
some evidence here that Netscape is serious about this and not
abandoning the browser business.&rdquo; <span   class="emphasis"><em>That</em></span> kind
of stuff is what's truly surprising.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marc</b></span>: There was skepticism
in engineering as to whether people would be able to understand it
enough to make changes. And they've absolutely been able to do so.
It hasn't been an issue.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Tom</b></span>: Yeah, the difficulties
haven't been difficult.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x173f580.0x1c32b90"></a>Hand in Claw</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: Marc, you said at the
SVLUG meeting that you could see Mozilla becoming the GUI for
Linux. What are you talking about there?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marc</b></span>: I don't want to
overreach and say Mozilla has to be <span   class="emphasis"><em>the</em></span> GUI
for Linux. It makes perfect sense for Mozilla to be in a window
running on an X desktop or anywhere else. But the thing we think is
happening&mdash;and has been steadily happening over the last five
years&mdash;is that we are all spending more and more of our time doing
things on the Net as opposed to doing things on the local system.
That should lead to a major interface change we're only beginning
to see, equivalent to the shift from text to GUI.</p><p>The next shift should be from a GUI-centric or
desktop-centered interface to a net-centered interface, one that
takes into account the virtues of the network. Because the
fundamental difference is that there's a million or a billion times
as much stuff out there that we have access to and therefore may
have to deal with at some level, than was ever on an individual
desktop system. And so, the interface has to change radically to
whatever the Net opens up. The scope of that means Mozilla is
positioned to become that GUI, that breakthrough, through community
effort.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: The network
interface?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marc</b></span>: Exactly, the network
interface. If you think of Mozilla as a full-screen environment
that is inherently a network interface, it is heavily oriented to
filtering and managing the huge amount of information out there,
and being extraordinarily personalized for the individual user.
There are all these resources to draw out of the Net, which
increasingly represent the needs of the user to the Net; thus,
resources become smarter in a sense, doing more useful stuff for
the user, and finally will, no doubt, include the contents of the
user's own machine.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: So your local machine
becomes a subset of what's in the networked universe, but your view
is through a Net-oriented interface.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marc</b></span>: Exactly. The local box
is a very, very small subset, but the Net is the context.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: We already see people
adapting the way they work to the Net context.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marc</b></span>: Now, we see lots of
documents, reports and messages are being typed in e-mail that
previously would have been typed in a word processor or on a
typewriter. You see the emergence of the navigation center in the
code that's up there now, providing a view of the Net. Maps of web
sites, plus bookmarks, plus directories, plus e-mail
messages&mdash;basically everything you have access to, in a single
place.</p><p>I can easily imagine Mozilla, within a year or two or even
sooner, will have an interface mode that gives you sort of a
full-screen experience that happens to provide everything you need
to manage your local desktop but is specifically focused on being a
very effective interface for the Net. This is going to be a very
fertile breeding ground for a lot of innovation in user interfaces.
There has been a huge amount of work in computer science labs and
in the larger community on next generation user interfaces.
Historically, it has taken decades for any of those innovations to
make it out. Windows and the Macintosh are known for technologies
invented 25 years ago. But while it takes a long time for this to
happen in the commercial marketplace, it can happen much faster in
the grass roots world that will grow around Mozilla. You will see
grad students doing radically advanced user interfaces as their
Ph.D. theses, implemented in Mozilla. One of those will be the
interface we'll all be using a few years from now.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: I have this notion that
who you are is more a matter of where you come from than any other
factor. It's the anchor point for the vector of your life. You can
change your name, your job, your whole r&eacute;sum&eacute;, but
you still come from the same place. And this is true of companies
as well as people. It's the source of character. Apple will always
come from Steve Jobs' aesthetic. Sun will always come from The
Network. Netscape will always come from wherever you, Marc, were at
when your team created Mosaic. Was that UNIX?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marc</b></span>: There were UNIX guys,
but a lot of PC and Macintosh guys as well. Essentially, where we
came from was a commitment to a heterogeneous universe. We also go
back a long way with this. We had connections in the open source
community before Linux really existed. Back then, the open source
community was a lot smaller. The projects they were focused on were
things like Emacs, FreeBSD, C compilers and so on. Now that
community is larger, more involved with the Web and growing very
fast. That's why the timing is so right for this move. It wouldn't
have been a few years ago.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2984f3_forcd.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Social Computing
</p></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: A
while back it seemed to me that the next stage beyond personal
computing would be social computing. It seemed a natural
progression, from the one to the many. But there is a difference in
kind between the personal and the social, between the user
interface to a personal computer and the user interface to the Net,
which is where we find computing's society. What you're talking
about is making Mozilla a social interface.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marc</b></span>: Right.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: Maybe it's a stretch,
but the Open Source society is very different than the company
that's trying to build the ultimate personal computer.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marc</b></span>: Right. Microsoft is
trying to put all this stuff back in the box, right? They're trying
to take this whole world and squeeze it down.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: If I look for analogous
concerns in the real world, my most personal space is maybe my
closet, because I know where my shoes are, and my shirts and belts
and so forth.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marc</b></span>: Same for your
bookshelf.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>:
Yet, society is nothing like my closet or my bookshelf. But the
presence of a computing society in my life means I don't write in a
word processor anymore. I write in e-mail and a text editor. I
wrote my questions today in BBEdit, saved it to the a42 server at
<i  >Linux Journal</i> in Seattle, reviewed them with Phil Hughes, wherever
he was, and printed it out in my office. The browser was there for
all of it, of course. And the interesting thing is that all this is
far less feature-rich than what I used to do on a word processor
and print out at home. But it's far more social, and far more
useful.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marc</b></span>: It's social
publishing.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: Right. Now, here's
where I'm going with this: we are each willing to yield a lot of
personal choice to get along with society. Hey, maybe I like to
race cars, but I won't do that on a highway. But I behave the way I
do on a highway because that's a social place.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Tom</b></span>: That's incredibly true
of your social life. All of your manners are necessary to get along
in society.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: The irony of personal
computing is that you can't see the social from the personal. I
can't abstract the organization of the world from the contents of
my closet. I can't understand traffic from the perspective of
racing a car. I can't see more in terms of less. Yet there are
concerns and functions inherent in social computing that don't show
up in personal computing. What I'm suggesting is that you guys live
at the social level and have lived there all along.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marc</b></span>: That's right.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: So you're coming from
the social, and Microsoft is coming from the personal. Which is why
I think you're not surprised, Tom, when the society you know best
acts just as you expected when you released the source code.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Tom</b></span>: Right. And somebody who
lived in the other world might be asking all these questions about,
&ldquo;Why would these people want to help you?&rdquo;</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marc</b></span>: Or &ldquo;Why isn't this
just going to fragment?&rdquo; That was the big question we got from the
press, and we had to carefully explain why there are tons of
reasons it won't fragment, not the least of which is the
centrifugal force where, if you want to fragment, you take upon
yourself the burden of pulling in all the changes everyone else is
making into your own version. There are always issues like this
that actually make things work. That's why Linux works.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Tom</b></span>: Who wants
incompatibility? The problem is, I could say this to a room full of
people and they'd all have the same answer. The guys up north want
to sell tools that are the only tools in the business that can
operate on the data...  Then I say &ldquo;Ah, okay, sorry, I wasn't
thinking about that. I think compatibility and open interfaces are
good things.&rdquo; So we don't communicate because we're not operating
at the same level.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x173f580.0x1b44a48"></a>Dealing with Java</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: Is Sun going to open
Java?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marc</b></span>: There are eerie
parallels here between what Sun did in 1982 and what Linux is doing
in 1998. In many ways it's the same technical community. It's a
community that's very focused on free versions of UNIX, running on
commodity hardware, appealing initially to a very technical
audience and eventually with a much broader relevance. Sun, in 1983
and 1984, totally and uniquely had an understanding that you could
harness all this energy around BSD and commodity hardware and just
get it out the door to this technical community. SGI and many other
companies didn't get it back then, but Sun did.</p><p>Now they've done a complete 180. If you think about it, they
are now a proprietary verticalized systems vendor: doing their own
chip, their own complete systems architecture, their own software,
their own operating system, their own applications in many cases,
their own storage devices and so on. When they think of Java, they
think, &ldquo;we really need to control this.&rdquo; Wrong answer. Because
the alternative is that there will absolutely be multiple
implementations. There need to be Javas defined to lead naturally
in the open direction. Sun is going to force them to emerge and to
flourish by not opening Java up.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Tom</b></span>: It's like what AT&amp;T
did in the UNIX market.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marc</b></span>: Right. If you think
about it, what's so 180 is&mdash;well, look&mdash;I like Alan Baritz a lot.
But Alan's from IBM. In 1982, Sun would not have put someone from
IBM in charge of something like this. Now they would, and that's a
mind-set change. And so that's one reason this is so fascinating.
They play a very strong marketing battle on the one hand about why
Java is open, and on the other hand, they're not open at
all.</p><p>For our part, we can make a practical observation that if we
can't build Java source code into Mozilla, there will be a Java
implementation that will end up in Mozilla. It'll be Sun's or
someone else's.</p><p>Tom, should I pre-announce something here?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Tom</b></span>: Go ahead.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marc</b></span>: We are at work on a
next-generation Java runtime, internally code-named Electrical
Fire. It should be on the Net shortly. There are multiple efforts
already launched here. This is not a complete Java runtime in and
of itself, but it's technology around which to build a very
high-performance Java runtime. And we're going to put it on under
MPL (the Mozilla license).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x173f580.0x1b45020"></a>Natural Selection</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: Are engineers starting
to beat your door down to work here? One of my hacker friends wants
to know that.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Tom</b></span>: We're seeing fewer
people saying &ldquo;Hire me, hire me&rdquo; than those who are saying, &ldquo;I
want to play.&rdquo;</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marc</b></span>: We're hearing from
people who want to do some particular project and ask if Netscape
would be willing to subsidize it. And we could potentially use some
number of those things, but I'm not sure it would be that good for
Netscape to try to fund some of this stuff because it gives the
wrong impression and offers the wrong incentives at that point. But
I don't know. It's complicated. Also, from a practical standpoint,
there's a limit to how much we can fund.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Tom</b></span>: I like the Darwinian
approach. Let natural selection occur.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: Say, &ldquo;If you've got
such a good idea, go get your own funding. Start a
business.&rdquo;</p><p>What is this going to do to the server side of your
business?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marc</b></span>: Indirectly, it
benefits. Let me explain why. The server side of the business is
strong and healthy to the extent that there is a competitive client
marketplace. If there were a noncompetitive client marketplace and
Microsoft had 100% client penetration, we would have a difficult
time in the server market for obvious reasons: Microsoft would use
its advantages. But now, because there is a competitive client
marketplace, not only does Microsoft lack a dominant share, or even
a majority share, they are forced to implement open interfaces and
open ABIs, such that our servers actually interoperate with their
clients. They are forced to do that by the market. As long as there
is a competitive client market, their customers will demand it or
they won't stay customers. If that market persists, our server
business does great. If that market collapsed down to where
Microsoft is the only competitor, our server business&mdash;and
everyone's server business&mdash;is in a lot of trouble. That's why, for
example, we're not going to try to get features built into Mozilla
that only work on our servers. Open browsers guarantee an open
server market.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: Do you have any concern
that this Open Source community will go create free server software
that competes with your commercial server software? Apache
equivalents for security, management and the rest of it?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marc</b></span>: Those exist now, in
most cases. Freely available mail servers, security solutions,
Kerberos, directory systems, University of Michigan LDAP. We're
comfortable competing with all that. We sell $75 million worth of
web servers every year, in a market where both Apache and IIS are
free.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: And you've got Caldera
bundling your stuff with Linux, and there's a market for
that.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marc</b></span>: Sure.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: So you're saying that
the world is exploding at a sufficiently rapid rate that it's going
to suck your stuff into it at least as fast as anyone
else's.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marc</b></span>: We'll sell more web
servers this time next year in spite of the fact that more free
ones will be out there. We sell software to businesses. Individuals
are fundamentally looking for a different set of things.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x173f580.0x1b45968"></a>What's the Object (Model)?</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: You've been trying to
establish an object model built around IIOP (Internet Inter-ORB
Protocol) and CORBA (Common Object Request Broker Architecture),
versus Microsoft's DCOM (Distributed Common Object Model). Does
this Open Source release play in that at all?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marc</b></span>: Good question. Tom, we
took the ORB (Object Request Broker) out, didn't we?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Tom</b></span>: I don't think it's
there.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marc</b></span>: That's interesting.
[We] made the client ORB-free in source form.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Tom</b></span>: It's going to have an
ORB; I can't tell you exactly when. I don't think the world is
going to tolerate a vacuum in this space for very long. I've seen a
few proposals. All the existing popular options have some kind of
fatal flaw in the eyes of part of the community. The DCOM guys have
a problem with this part of an ORB. And this CORBA group has a
fundamental problem with the portability or interoperability of
some part of DCOM. There are just wave after wave of these
concerns. We've had arguments within Netscape about the best way to
address the question. I'm looking for Darwin taking over on this
one, too. I think it might be a spirited debate, and educational
for me. I am not an objects guy.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: I was talking to Phil
Hughes about this and he said the same thing. But he added that it
all depends on your generation&mdash;when you grew up.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Tom</b></span>: It's true.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: He said, if you go to
the schools now, everybody's talking objects. Maybe not so for the
older guys.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Tom</b></span>: Some of those older
guys have evolved into objects people. Their arguments are very
interesting. I follow them, but I can't generate them. In any case,
I think it's going to be interesting to get this out in the
open.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marc</b></span>: I bet we'll have
native IIOP built into Mozilla in source code form within a year.
From somewhere.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: Meanwhile, there seems
to be faith that the world is going to be made of objects, and
there will be an enormous conversation in objects between clients
and servers all over the world. I don't know to what extent
evolution toward that state is constrained by the presence of two
rival object models.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marc</b></span>: As an issue, it's not
pragmatically useful or important to enough people yet. The results
may be what you describe, but the object people get confused
between the way the world's going to look in N years versus what
it's actually going to take for interest to pick up and carry us
there. This is why it was so hard to time the adoption of LANs. In
retrospect, it took time for all this technology to connect before
it made more sense to print over the LAN as opposed to carrying
floppy disks. To get to the current state of the Internet, we had
to get technology to a point where folks wanted e-mail accounts in
order to write to their kids in college. I think this applies to
programmers too. What's the trip-over point where all of a sudden
it really matters? Personally, I think it's going to happen when
people build more sophisticated multi-tier applications. Then
they're going to need smarter communication between clients and
servers than they're able to get today. And they're already going
to be developing a lot of their logic on the server in the form of
objects because they're using C++ or Java, and also off the client.
And so, they're just naturally going to start to interconnect those
two.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: Directory service is
going to play in a really huge way here. You've got a directory
server.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marc</b></span>: A damn good
one.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: That seems to be
optimized for this. Would you tweak it to match what's going on in
the outside world? Let's say you put the ORB in the browser, watch
what happens, see who's trafficking in objects, how it looks and
who needs a directory.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marc</b></span>: Absolutely. A lot of
what we do in the servers will be influenced by what happens with
Mozilla. It's sort of always been that way. Fundamentally, there's
a chicken and egg problem with some of these things that involve
all kinds of servers, and it usually requires you to get some
amount of user action or adoption going on before lots of stuff
starts to happen on the server. I'll bet that's exactly what's
going to happen in this case.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x173f580.0x1dc4478"></a>The Hot Dog Stand</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: I like your faith. But
your critics have said &ldquo;It's a desperate move, and they didn't
have any other choice.&rdquo;</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Tom</b></span>: That's driving me
crazy. Any business decision is going to look vague when the costs
and risks versus the opportunities and benefits are highly
balanced. The teeter-totter teeters. In this case, the cost of
releasing the source to the Navigator plummeted in the last nine
months or so. Now, it's a no-brainer&mdash;time to pursue a new
opportunity.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marc</b></span>: The flip-over point
was when we made the binaries free. After that, releasing the
source made perfect sense.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Tom</b></span>: The benefits and
opportunities have always been strong. It's just that the costs
have been high. Well, they have not always been strong. I have to
be fair. In 1994, there weren't many developers out there who
&ldquo;got&rdquo; the Web&mdash;whose heads operated in that space. And if you
invited everybody to come and play, the signal-to-noise ratio would
have been zero. Since then everybody has come to know about the
Web, and they have attitude and interest and ideas, so for some
time the opportunities and benefits have been on the strong side.
But when the costs plummeted, then suddenly it was a lot easier
decision to make, regardless.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marc</b></span>: Those statements
usually come from people who are typically not involved in
businesses. Or at least not businesses of scope. There's a natural
decision-making process businesses go through to try to maximize
their economic opportunity.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: I liked the way Jim
Barksdale put it when he said, &ldquo;We had to get revenues low enough,
so we could make this choice.&rdquo;</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marc</b></span>: Right! We had to walk
it all the way down to zero. Along the way, we used that revenue to
subsidize all these other products and services that now generate
revenue.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: Change goes on all the
time anyway. All products have a life. Either they change
completely in order to live, or they die.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marc</b></span>: Yep.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: That's true of Windows,
of browsers, of all kinds of things.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marc</b></span>: Which is why it's
ridiculous to criticize a company for changing.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Tom</b></span>: The criticism is, we're
in power and we have competitors, so we've got to be desperate to
give all this power to our competitors.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marc</b></span>: To some people it's
&ldquo;Aw, they're desperate.&rdquo; And it's obvious they haven't even
thought it through any more than that. It's a pointless comment.
Jim Barksdale abbreviates this to &ldquo;They haven't ever run a hot dog
stand. What do they know?&rdquo;</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: The problem with the
press is that when you're running a sportscast, you have to fill
the air with sounds of competition even when there's nothing going
on.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Tom</b></span>: You're really right
about them using war terminology, using that chest of war words,
and when things don't fit that model, the brains break. The
stunning thing is their unwillingness to put that box away and
break out a new box.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marc</b></span>: It's especially
interesting when you think about it, because there are so many
different sources of media now&mdash;so many different voices out there,
striving for unique coverage and unique angles. You've got an
inherent unwillingness by a large number of them to actually do
anything unique.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: Part of it is time
pressure: you have to say something. Another is the story
principle. Stories are the fundamental unit of consciousness.
Conflict is interesting, and most stories are about conflict. No
story starts with &ldquo;And they lived happily ever after.&rdquo; What keeps
them turning pages is the conflict that's going on, and it will
still be going on after they turn the page. That is inherently
interesting to human beings. The Great Harmony is not interesting.
A bunch of people hacking on something for the pure fun of it and
for peer review is not as interesting to the press as the &ldquo;Great
Browser War&rdquo;.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marc</b></span>: Right.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: Eric Raymond told me
today that you're not a hacker unless somebody else says you're a
hacker.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marc</b></span>: That's true. He's
absolutely right.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: There is also a peerage
among the Dilberts of the world that is invisible to those further
up the corporate hierarchy.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marc</b></span>: That's true.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: So there is all this
interesting stuff going on, but it doesn't involve conflict so it
isn't that interesting to the press.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marc</b></span>: Now there are more
people in the technologist community than there ever have been.
More people are comfortable with technology now at every level than
there were five to ten years ago&mdash;just a huge number more.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: Anything else you want
to add before we wrap this up?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marc</b></span>: I think over the next
six months we'll have an explosion of activity. What pops out of
this new system will be interesting. You can view it as an
amazingly complex system or organism or computational device on a
large scale, with its own set of rules and organizing principles.
Stuff is bound to pop out. By definition, what pops out will be the
right set of stuff. It will be self-fulfilling.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>:
This brings to mind John Seemly Brown's matrix, where he puts
social computing in context. He says there are some things that
only we know. They emerge in the social space, rather than the
personal. And most of the shared knowledge is tacit rather than
explicit. Tapping into this tacit dimension is what you have in
mind, I think.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marc</b></span>: Absolutely.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Tom</b></span>: Domestically, among the
people here at Netscape, I've been explicit, saying, &ldquo;Look, I'm
not going to explain to the Open Source world how open source
works. Build it; they will come.&rdquo; If they need to be sold, they're
too much work for me anyway. As long as I believe there is a large
community out there&mdash;that will come, based on tacit
communication&mdash;I'm in business. And the rest of the people can
learn how this thing works. For some people, however, I have to be
clear: &ldquo;I'm expecting this behavior.&rdquo; This allowed Mozilla to
say, &ldquo;We're just kind of doing this,&rdquo; and expect Open Source
behavior to run with it. Yeah, absolutely. At the tacit level, the
Open Source people totally get what's going on.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: In a way, you're saying
&ldquo;We have built it, now they'll come and rebuild it.&rdquo;</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Tom</b></span>: Oh yeah. We build the
place where source lives, and give them an opportunity to get in
there and get their fingers dirty, and no one will be able to keep
them away.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: Like a free Home Depot
for developers.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Tom</b></span>: Yeah!</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marc</b></span>: Right. We've got a few
things we think we can stock it with on top of Mozilla. I'd like to
see what the community does with Electrical Fire.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Tom</b></span>: The list of things like
Electrical Fire is about seven, eight, nine, ten items long, all of
which are majorly interesting. So, we've got some stuff. We can set
some fires.</p><p><a href="2984s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
