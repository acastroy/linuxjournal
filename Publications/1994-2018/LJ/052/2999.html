    Having trouble deciding which distribution to go for? Here's
    help.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x192d580.0x1a25450"></a></h2></div></div><p>Any current Linux distribution most
likely contains the software needed to do your job, including
kernel and drivers, libraries, utilities and applications programs.
Still, one of the most common questions I hear is &ldquo;which
distribution should I get?&rdquo; This question is answered by an
assortment of people, each proclaiming their favorite distribution
is better than all the rest.
</p><p>My new theory is that most people favor the first
distribution they successfully installed. Or, if they had problems
with the first, they favor the next distribution they install which
addresses the problems of the first.</p><p>Let's use me as an example. SLS was my first Linux
installation. Unfortunately, SLS had a few bugs&mdash;in both the
installation and the running system. This, of course, isn't a
surprise since this installation took place five years ago.</p><p>Now, about this time, Patrick Volkerding came along and
created Slackware. Pat took the SLS distribution and fixed some
problems. The result looked the same as SLS and worked the same,
but without bugs. To this day, I find Slackware the easiest
distribution to install.</p><p>I have, however, progressed beyond installation problems and
found some serious shortcomings in Slackware which have been
addressed by other distributions. Before I get into specifics, here
is a rough estimate of the number of times I have installed various
distributions, in order of first installation. I give you this
information to help you understand the basis of my opinions.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>100+ SLS/Slackware</p></li><li><p>5 MCC (a small distribution done for university
students)</p></li><li><p>5 Yggdrasil</p></li><li><p>20 Red Hat</p></li><li><p>10 Caldera</p></li><li><p>20 Debian</p></li><li><p>5 S.u.S.E.</p></li></ul></div><p>That said, here is my blow-by-blow analysis of what is right
and wrong with each distribution. Note that this is my personal
opinion&mdash;your mileage will vary.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x192d580.0x1a25c38"></a>SLS/Slackware/MCC</h2></div></div><p>All these distributions are easy to install and understand.
They were all designed to install from floppy disk, and packages
were in floppy-sized chunks. At one time, I could successfully
install Slackware without even having a monitor on the
computer.</p><p>There are, however, costs associated with this simplicity.
Software is saved in compressed tar files. There is no information
within the distribution that shows how files interrelate, no
dependencies and no good path for upgrades. Not a problem if you
just want to try something, but for a multi-computer shop with
long-term plans, this initial simplicity can have unforeseen costs
in the long run.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x192d580.0x1a25d98"></a>Yggdrasil</h2></div></div><p>Yggdrasil offered the most promise with a GUI-based
configuration. Unfortunately, development stopped (or at least
vanished from the public eye), and it no longer offers anything
vaguely current.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x192d580.0x1a25ea0"></a>Red Hat</h2></div></div><p>When I first looked at Marc Ewing's creation, I was
impressed. It had some GUI-based configuration tools and showed a
lot of promise. Over the years, Red Hat has continued to evolve and
is easy to install and configure. Red Hat introduced the RPM
packaging system that offers dependencies to help ensure loaded
applications work with each other and updating is easy. RPMs also
offer pre- and post-install and remove scripts which appear to be
underutilized.</p><p>Version 4.2 has proven to be quite stable. The current
release is 5.0, and a 5.1 release with bug fixes is expected to
again produce a stable product.</p><p>The install sequence is streamlined to make it easy to do a
standard install. I see two things missing that, while making the
install appear easier, detract from what is actually needed:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>The ability to save the desired configuration to
floppy disk during the installation process (something that both
Caldera and S.u.S.E. offer) would simplify subsequent installations
on the same or other machines.</p></li><li><p>The ability to create a boot floppy disk during
installation.</p></li></ol></div><p>Red Hat has evolved into the most &ldquo;retailed&rdquo; distribution.
First it was in books by O'Reilly, then MacMillan and now IDG Books
Worldwide. It also appears to have a large retail shrink-wrap
distribution in the U.S.
</p><p>Versions of Red Hat are available for Digital Alpha and
SunSPARC, as well as Intel.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x192d580.0x1a262c0"></a>Caldera</h2></div></div><p>The Caldera distribution was assembled by the Linux Support
Team (LST) in Germany&mdash;now a part of Caldera. Caldera, like Red
Hat, uses the RPM package format. Installation is similar to Red
Hat with the addition of the configuration save/restore
option.</p><p>Caldera is different from other distributions at this time in
that it offers a series of systems including various commercial
packages such as a secure web server and an office suite. Caldera
is also the most &ldquo;commercial feeling&rdquo; as far as packaging and
presentation.</p><p>One complaint I received from a reviewer of my original
version of this article is that you cannot perform an upgrade. That
is, you must save your configuration files and then
re-install.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x192d580.0x1a26478"></a>Debian</h2></div></div><p>Debian is one of the oldest distributions, but because
development is strictly by a team of volunteers, it has tended to
evolve more slowly. Since development is performed by a
geographically diverse group, the ability to manage and integrate
upgrades is of primary importance. To that end, you can always
upgrade a system by pointing it at an FTP site and instructing it
to get the latest versions of all the packages currently installed.
In some cases, a service needs to be stopped. (For example, to
upgrade <span   class="bold"><b>sendmail</b></span>, you would need
to stop it, replace the program and then restart it.) This is all
done automatically.</p><p>Debian deviates from the common RPM packaging format
(although it can install RPMs) by using its own .deb format. The
.deb format is the most versatile and includes dependency checking
as well as pre- and post-install and remove scripts. This is why
the sendmail example in the previous paragraph can be handled
automatically.</p><p>The most difficult thing about Debian is the initial
installation. Or, put another way, fear of
<span   class="bold"><b>dselect</b></span>, the installer program.
The design of dselect is old, and while it made sense when there
were only 50-100 packages in a Linux install, it is out of control
now that there are around 1000. A replacement for dselect is being
developed and will be available in Debian 2.1.</p><p>Versions of Debian (with limited applications/utilities) are
available for Digital Alpha and M68k.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x192d580.0x1a26738"></a>S.u.S.E.</h2></div></div><p>S.u.S.E. is a German distribution with an installation &ldquo;look
and feel&rdquo; similar to Caldera. It also uses the RPM package format
and offers a save/restore configuration option during
installation.</p><p>Two things make S.u.S.E. stand out from the others. First,
XFree86 support tends to be better than other distributions because
S.u.S.E. works closely with the XFree86 team. Second, there are
more applications and utility programs in this distribution. A full
installation takes over 2GB of disk space.</p><p>YAST, the install/administration tool, can handle .deb and
.tgz packages as well as RPMs. Also, upgrades are quite easy and
can be performed by putting in a new CD or pointing YAST at the
files and telling it to perform the upgrade.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x192d580.0x1a268f0"></a>Which Do I Choose?</h2></div></div><p>It depends. I have one system running Caldera, three running
Red Hat (a PC, a Digital Alpha and a SunSPARC), two running
Slackware, one running S.u.S.E. (a laptop) and quite a few running
Debian. (Yes, I personally own too many computers.)</p><p>Further, there are problems with all the distributions&mdash;not
the same problems, but problems nevertheless. As a result, I don't
see a perfect answer&mdash;yet. This is not to say they don't work&mdash;just
that each has its inconsistencies and limitations. They all suffer
from the lack of a common administration tool.</p><p>At USENIX in 1997, Caldera announced a project called COAS
(Caldera Open Administration System). The discussion at the
conference showed there were more concepts to consider and a lot of
implementation work before COAS could offer a uniform installation
system that would meet the needs of the majority of Linux
users.</p><p>Today, for a general-purpose system I tend to install Debian.
I do, however, install other systems for other purposes. For
example, I have S.u.S.E. on a new laptop because the volume of
software included makes a more impressive demo system.</p><p>A better question is, &ldquo;which one should you choose?&rdquo; The
answer is still, &ldquo;it depends.&rdquo; Here are some hints to help you
along the way:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>If everyone you know is running a particular
distribution and you are a newcomer, use the same one they
do.</p></li><li><p>If you like to roll your own&mdash;that is, you expect
to compile and install everything yourself&mdash;Slackware is probably
for you.</p></li><li><p>If you want to &ldquo;go with the crowd&rdquo; today, install
Red Hat.</p></li><li><p>If you want &ldquo;everything&rdquo;, install S.u.S.E.</p></li><li><p>If you need the most &ldquo;commercial&rdquo; looking product
or you are a VAR (value-added reseller), pick Caldera.</p></li><li><p>If the politics of free software is important to
you and/or you want to get involved in development of a
distribution, pick Debian.</p></li><li><p>If you have a bunch of systems you need to
interconnect and upgrade, pick Debian or hope Caldera gets COAS
completed.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x192d580.0x1a1d910"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>There is my input. Ask any other Linux user, and you will
probably get a different opinion from mine. If you are not sure you
have the right answer, there are some things you can do to make it
possible to change distributions in the future with minimal
impact.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Make /home a separate file system. Then, if you
change distributions, you don't have to save and restore your
files. This also means you could have multiple distributions on one
computer and share /home between them.</p></li><li><p>Select hardware supported by most
distributions.</p></li><li><p>If you need to add applications that don't come
with the Linux distribution, try to get ones that come with source
code so you can upgrade them and port them to different
distributions.</p></li><li><p>Start with a Linux archive CD set (such as
InfoMagic's Developer's Resource). That will give you at least
three distributions (Slackware, Debian and Red Hat) with which to
play.</p></li></ul></div><p>Good luck and happy Linuxing.
