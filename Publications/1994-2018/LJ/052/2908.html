was intrigued by the title. Could this possibly be a Kafkaesque
treatise on debugging? As I read it, I realized that such was not
the case. I found the style more Conradian, as in <span   class="emphasis"><em>Heart
of Darkness</em></span>.
</p><p>The book has three main sections. The first, comprising 9
chapters, is a response to an article in the September 1994 issue
of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Scientific American</em></span> titled &ldquo;Software's
Chronic Crisis&rdquo;. The author, William Beckett, is an experienced
systems designer/programmer who has used many programming languages
on many hardware platforms. The writer of the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Scientific
American</em></span> piece appeared to be without an extensive
computer background, so drew much of his article from management
apologetics and computer shock headlines in the popular
press.</p><p>Beckett responds section by section, paragraph by paragraph,
and even line by line in these nine chapters. His theme is common
sense or pragmatism. Non-entrepreneurial programmers will enjoy
this part of the book because it is the working stiff talking back
to &ldquo;Dilbert&rdquo;-style management.</p><p>Section 2 comprises chapters 10-15. Here, Beckett reprints
and discusses letters and responses from Paul Allen and from
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Wired</em></span>. He uses lots of personal anecdotes
illustrating points he wants to emphasize. This too is a good read,
particularly for the disenchanted.</p><p>Section 3, chapters 16-21, is where things become highly
speculative. One could say that here we have a melange of science
fiction, hermeneutics, New Age thoughts, etc. Section 3 should be
called &ldquo;the world according to Beckett, and how Beckett would make
it better&rdquo;. I found myself slogging through the final
section.</p><p>Overall, this book could provide useful reflection for
programmers who are not so overworked that they have time to
actually read and think about his controversial ideas. The avowed
purpose of the book &ldquo;is to provide professional men and women in
creative fields with a perspective on current Western ideology
which is capable of transforming it for the better&rdquo;. He supports
it with an eclectic bibliography of 54 items for further reading.
This book will not be everyone's cup of tea by any means, but some
might find a few good ideas or explanations.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Metamorphosis</em></span> can be purchased through
