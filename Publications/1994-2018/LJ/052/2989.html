made comments about commercial applications for Linux. Every time I
call a software manufacturer about an application, I ask if they
have a version to run on Linux. If not, I ask them to put in a
request.</p><p>I use Linux as my main operating system at work with Wabi so
that I can use MS Office. Now that MS has upgraded Office, I am
finding it hard to maintain this plan.</p><p>To convince more companies to build software applications for
Linux, it might help to run a survey on a web site. The survey
would find out how many people are running Linux, if they would be
willing to buy software applications, and what price they would be
willing to pay. The information garnered from the survey should be
made public.</p><p>&mdash;David Hepner dfh@svl.trw.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1895580.0x198d2f0"></a>X Display Fix for Lifebook</h2></div></div><p>In response to Michael Scott Shappe, &ldquo;Accelerated X Laptop
Display Server v4.1&rdquo;, March 1998 (Issue 47), there is a simple fix
to the problem of the rightward-shifted X display on the Fujitsu
Lifebook (and possibly other laptops with a Phoenix BIOS, where the
problem arises).</p><p>Go into the BIOS setup, select &ldquo;Advanced&rdquo;, then &ldquo;Video
Features&rdquo;, then &ldquo;Compensation: Enabled&rdquo;. The X display will now
fill the screen (using either XFree86 or Xi),
and you can run Linux in text mode. Windows (I
boot both 95 and NT 4.0) will still work with no problems (other
than the usual ones).</p><p>Some technical details of my laptop: Fujitsu Lifebook 435D,
NeoMagic video card and Phoenix NoteBIOS 4.0. It boots Linux
(2.0.30), Windows95, NT 4.0 workstation and the NT 4.0
server.</p><p>&mdash;Dr. Constance A.

&ldquo;Getting Rid of Spam&rdquo;, on using
<span   class="bold"><b>procmail</b></span> and the Alcor filters to
catch spam. However, I think I've found an easier way to filter
spam using procmail. I've observed that spammers seldom send mail
to your personal mailing address; instead, they use a mailing list.
So instead of seeing a header line like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
To: rsmit06@ibm.net
</pre><p>I'm seeing lines like:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
To: friend@foobar.list
</pre><p>Knowing this, it is easy to write a procmail rule to catch it:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
:0:
*! ^To:.*rsmit06@ibm.net
*! ^Cc:.*rsmit06@ibm.net
/home/rsmit06/.incoming-mail/junk-mail
</pre><p>
This rule catches virtually 100% of the spam I get. Unfortunately,
it also catches the mailing lists to which I subscribe. The
solution is to write rules that intercept the valid mailing lists
and put them  before the &ldquo;spam-interceptor&rdquo;
in your .procmailrc file. This has two advantages: all mailing
lists can be put in a separate folder, and virtually all spam is
caught. The only disadvantage is adding each valid mailing list to
your .procmailrc file. For me, this isn't a problem.

wrote in his article &ldquo;The Importance of the GUI in Cross Platform
Development&rdquo; (March 1998) regarding OpenStep. I have been a
professional consultant for 14 years and have worked on most
workstations, operating systems, languages and engineering
paradigms.</p><p>I have been staying with OpenStep/NeXT Step/Rhapsody for some
time now because it is, in my opinion, the best software
development and deployment platform.</p><p>OpenStep is not simply a &ldquo;GUI API (along with some non-GUI
functions)...&rdquo; as he puts it. The very use of the term &ldquo;API&rdquo; is
misleading. OpenStep is an operating system based on a MACH
microkernel, BSD UNIX and object-oriented frameworks, consisting of
other frameworks (of objects and classes) for everything from
graphics to distributed objects to enterprise computing. This is a
radical departure from &ldquo;APIs&rdquo; like the ones he discusses in the
article; they are not even in the same category.</p><p>OpenStep is a complete software solution that lets you write
programs using its objects, or extending its objects, and can run
on Intel, Motorola, SPARC and HP. Furthermore, the OpenStep OS and
development tools run on Windows95/NT, MACH native Intel, MACH
Motorola, MACH SPARC, Solaris and HP/UX. With Rhapsody around the
corner, we can add Power PC to that list, and most likely Macintosh
OS.</p><p>As for the complaint about learning ObjectiveC, I have to say
that it is much easier to learn than Java and has a smaller
linguistic requirement. The hardest thing to learn is that one
sends a message to an object with &ldquo;[object message:arg]&rdquo; rather
than &ldquo;object.message(arg)&rdquo;.</p><p>OpenStep has a lot of momentum behind it right now. Major
Fortune 500 companies and many others have been using it for years.
There is no need for &ldquo;hype&rdquo; in order to make this technology
mainstream. It is a well-established technology that in my opinion
could literally save Apple-NeXT. While I am prevented from
disclosing details about Rhapsody, suffice it to say this is truly
a next-generation technology. It is UNIX, too.</p><p>Finally, I wish to say that I applaud the efforts of the
GNUStep developers; it would be very useful to have a version that
is free, for which source code is available. My hope is that
Michael Babcock does indeed get an OpenStep box, so that he can
discover his vast underestimation of it for himself.</p><p>&mdash;Erik Scheirer, sonYx, Inc. boom@sonyx.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1895580.0x198dc38"></a>Open Source Editorial</h2></div></div><p>Phil, congratulations on a great magazine. Your editorial in
the May issue on Open Source is excellent as far as it goes. Using
the phrase &ldquo;Open Source&rdquo; in lieu of &ldquo;free&rdquo; should overcome many
of the negative perceptions and biases that business has with
&ldquo;free&rdquo;. In addition, &ldquo;Open&rdquo; has become a very positive buzzword
in IT.</p><p>However, there is a crucial element missing in all
discussions of Open Source. What is the underlying business model
that can allow a business to make money? Though primarily a
technology magazine (and a good one), <i  >Linux Journal</i> could make a major contribution to the Open
Source movement with a short article summarizing the business
argument for Open Source. This way, those of us in industry can
have a succinct response to &ldquo;Sounds good, but how do I make
money?&rdquo; Obviously, this short article should stay away from MBA
gobbledygook and concentrate on principles. A brief case history
would be desirable.</p><p>Unfortunately, I am not involved in the Open Source industry
and thus can't help with such an article. I can continue to
persuade mainstream industry to recognize Open Source as viable
software.</p><p>&mdash;David T. Kjellquist david.t.kjellquist@lmco.com</p><p>I agree, this is an issue that needs to be addressed. Russell
Nelson has written a guest editorial describing just such a
business model. See it on page 10 of this issue.</p><p>&mdash;Phil Hughes, Publisher info@linuxjournal.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1895580.0x198df50"></a>Summary: Dog eats
<i  >LJ</i>?</h2></div></div><p>Some time ago I wrote here, asking people if their
<i  >Linux Journal</i> magazines were arriving in the
mail as dog-eaten as mine. It seems some people get their
<i  >LJ</i> in pristine shape, and this is independent
of distance.</p><p>Others get theirs in the same shape I do; these people
frequently mention that this is puzzling, since they also receive
other magazines, which arrive okay. It seems to be only
<i  >LJ</i> that has problems. This, in fact, is true
for me.</p><p>Thus, I speculate that the size, page-count, binding method
or other variables causes <i  >LJ</i> to be susceptible
to mangling in the Post Office machinery. I wonder if
<i  >LJ</i> might consider putting small sticky tabs on
some edges of the Journal, to prevent them falling open in Fido
Machineries' &ldquo;Bow-Wow Special Mail Sorter&rdquo;?</p><p><i  >LJ</i> would probably rebel at the
suggestion that they send the magazine in an envelope, which, it
would seem to me, would be the best preventative measure.</p><p>Thanks to all who replied, some with very amusing posts or
e-mailed stories.</p><p>&mdash;Robert Lynch, Berkeley, CA rmlynch@best.com</p><p>Actually, we have been trying to find a solution to this
problem for some time. Our current printer is not able to polybag
domestic mail; foreign mail is outsourced and does go out in an
envelope. Our cover is now printed on heavier paper. When we find
an affordable solution that can be handled by the printer, our
readers will be the first to know &mdash;Editor</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1895580.0x198e4d0"></a>Latvian Police Archives</h2></div></div><p>I liked the use of Linux by the Latvian Police force to make
a legacy single-user Clipper application available to everyone,
although I think the use of DOSEMU is a bit dubious. In the first
place, you require a DOS license for each user logged into the
system, and second, it is certainly not the most efficient way to
run applications. There is a commercial Clipper engine available
for Linux (Flagship) which is available for a very modest fee.
Using this engine to run legacy Clipper applications instead of
DOSEMU should yield better performance with fewer resources and
make it easier to evolve the system into something better, perhaps
migrating to one of the Linux SQL engines (available both publicly
and privately).</p><p>&mdash;Roger Irwin irwin@trucco.it</p><p><a href="2989s2.html" target="_self">Corrections</a></p></div></div>
