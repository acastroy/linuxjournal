    Linux&mdash;not just for hackers anymore...
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25ae580.0x26a6558"></a></h2></div></div><p>Linux? That's just for hackers and
computer science students, right? Most experienced Linux users have
heard that one a time or two. Over the past year or so, I have
discovered that the answer is a resounding &ldquo;no&rdquo;&mdash;for Linux has
something to offer everyone. You see, about one year ago, I took my
first experimental plunge into the Linux world. I installed Linux
on my home office computer, dual booting with MS Windows 95. Now, I
run my home-based freelance business entirely from the Linux OS,
using both free software and commercial products to get my work
done.
</p><p>This is the first in a series of three articles about my
experiences migrating to Linux. I hope they will shed light on the
techniques, methods, benefits and perils of using Linux as the
primary OS in a small or home office (SOHO) environment. While
these articles are written primarily for the non-technical end user
who runs a very small business or works from home, hopefully
everyone will have something to gain, regardless of their level of
experience. In order to implement some of the specific suggestions
contained herein, you should have a working Linux installation and
a general understanding of Linux basics. If you are a complete
novice interested in how Linux could potentially work for you, read
on. Just one year ago, I was in your shoes. Now I'm running my
business from Linux.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25ae580.0x26a66b8"></a>Why Migrate to Linux?</h2></div></div><p>Just about every SOHO user would appreciate better
performance from their OS. Yet switching to a different OS for your
work is not a step to take lightly&mdash;you can expect a few growing
pains. If you are in need of a better OS and are aware of the
effort migrating may take, Linux is the first place to turn.</p><p>We'll now examine some of the pros and cons of Linux, based
on the needs of a SOHO user. Personally, I'm looking for stability,
ease of use and administration, low cost and a wide range of
available productivity applications. Gaming, Internet and network
services (other than dial-up PPP) and other capabilities don't fit
into my equation. Your requirements, of course, may differ. Here's
a more detailed view of each of these requirements.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25ae580.0x26a6818"></a>Stability</h2></div></div><p>What do SOHO users need from their OS? To put it simply,
we've got work to do and no time for a flaky OS. We don't have time
to reboot every half hour or to retype a document lost due to the
failures of an inadequate operating system.</p><p>That's why Linux is so attractive. Linux is far less likely
to suffer such frustrating failures. The underlying OS is more
stable and the Linux development model sees to it that bugs are
exterminated rapidly, with extreme prejudice. Commercial OS vendors
have already sold you their wares and cashed your check by the time
bugs are discovered. This means there is no pressing economic
incentive to resolve difficulties on a timely basis.</p><p>As far as viruses are concerned, they are not a problem in
Linux. The way Linux works, it is difficult, if not impossible, to
propagate a virus. So-called &ldquo;Trojan Horse&rdquo; programs are still an
issue, but viruses are not.</p><p>The combination of instability, viruses and bugs can make it
impossible to get your work done while working in some of the
mainstream commercial operating systems. Have you ever had MS
Windows inexplicably freeze in the middle of a budget calculation?
Have you ever lost two hours of work when a &ldquo;General Protection
Fault&rdquo; crashes your word-processing session? I have had bad
experiences ranging from mild frustration to major loss of income
due to system crashes.</p><p>However, I have never&mdash;<span   class="emphasis"><em>not once</em></span>&mdash;lost
data due to an OS failure in Linux. Well, once I completely hosed a
perfectly good Linux setup, but that was my own fault. We'll
discuss how to avoid and recover from such self-imposed disasters
in the next installment.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25ae580.0x26a6ad8"></a>Ease of Use</h2></div></div><p>The first time the login prompt came up after my first Linux
install, I was frozen like a deer in headlights. What, no GUI? No
little &ldquo;start here&rdquo; buttons? Yet in just a matter of hours, I was
cruising around the file system with no trouble and had the X
Window System up and running. Next came the ISP hookup, and soon I
was quite comfortable in Linux, learning more with each login
session.</p><p>You may be saying, &ldquo;That's great for you, but I expect
quality support for my OS installation.&rdquo; Veteran Linux users&mdash;as
well as <span   class="emphasis"><em>InfoWorld Magazine</em></span>&mdash;know that the
Linux community provides the best technical support currently
available for any OS. Yes, I have had many problems with my Linux
setup, most minor and some major. However, whenever I have posted a
message to the Linux newsgroups, 90% of the time I have received
several viable solutions and some good suggestions. Sometimes the
answers come in just a few hours. This beats my experience with MS
Windows NT by far (see sidebar). Even better, free Linux support
does not expire, as does the free support under commercial
operating systems.</p><p>Still, there is a long way to go towards making Linux more
user friendly and a lot less scary. Yes, commercial GUI operating
systems are prettier at first. Yes, on the surface they are a bit
more intuitive. And yes, they are far less daunting in the
beginning than Linux. Documentation and help systems for Linux
applications are famous for being poor or nonexistent. That's why
more and more Linux developers and vendors are rightly focusing
their efforts on making Linux more friendly for the new
user.</p><p>What I have discovered is that along with the very visible
support from the Linux community, there is a &ldquo;hidden&rdquo; advantage
to using Linux. To me, Linux exhibits a unique continuity to its
learning curve. For example, I have spent several working hours
learning to edit certain configuration files to my liking. Over
time, I realized that the same methods often applied to editing
files that pertain to a completely different part of the OS. When
you first start to pick up on Linux, you may find each new piece of
knowledge, each new skill, lends itself to easing the next task. In
my experience, MS Windows does not share this continuity. Sure, the
MS Windows learning curve is less steep, but there is a less
reliable pattern to learning it.</p><p>In terms of usability, documentation and the quality of the
user interface, Linux does need improvement. Still, the thousands
of Linux developers worldwide are making dramatic progress towards
putting Linux on par with many commercial operating systems in
terms of usability.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25ae580.0x26a6d98"></a>Costs</h2></div></div><p>How much does Linux cost? Of course, every introduction to
Linux points out that Linux is free to everyone. It costs nothing,
because no one &ldquo;owns&rdquo; Linux in the way Microsoft owns Windows or
MS-DOS. To simplify things, a basic installation CD can be
purchased from a vendor or retailer for $30 to $60 US. Plus, to get
off the ground, one should really own one of the several fantastic
books currently available for the novice Linux user for $20 to $60
US.</p><p>At the risk of being branded a heretic, I make the following
assertion for the SOHO Linux user: using Linux is <span   class="emphasis"><em>more
expensive</em></span> in the short term, but in the mid- to
long-term, Linux provides a dramatic cost savings and rewards you
with an attractive return on your investment of both money and
time.</p><p>How can it be more expensive when it is free? Simple&mdash;the
short-term opportunity costs are higher for the SOHO user who is
currently using a commercial OS and is heavily invested in software
made for that OS. This is one of the growing pains I mentioned
earlier. For a cost comparison and a true story, see the sidebar.
What's the moral to that story? For me, Linux is by no means free.
I have spent hours learning to use Linux and tweaking my system
when I could have been performing billable work. Remember, though,
I have yet to lose a client's work or to be forced into redoing
tedious tasks at my own expense while using Linux.</p><p>Plus, hardware can be used longer under Linux and quite often
works much better as well. My aging Pentium 90 with 32MB of RAM is
a bit sluggish when running current versions of MS Windows, but
chugs along quite spryly under Linux. Linux has given new life to
that computer, and I will be able to keep it up and running far
longer than with MS Windows.</p><p>With all of these considerations, the economic value of Linux
is clear. The mid to long-term return on investment more than pays
for the short-term opportunity costs of switching to Linux from a
commercial OS. Therefore, migrating to Linux is a sound business
decision.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25ae580.0x26a7058"></a>Available Applications</h2></div></div><p>Right now, I run my business with a mix of commercial and
free software. I am on my third Linux distribution, which I buy on
CD due to the high opportunity costs of downloading large package
files. I write direct marketing copy for my clients with a
commercially licensed copy of Applixware. I dial my ISP using a
dialing tool under the GPL. Right now my GUI environment is KDE. I
send e-mail and browse the Web with the recently freed Netscape
Communicator 4.04. All of these programs work as well, and often
better, than their counterparts designed for MS Windows.</p><p>So far with Linux, I am able to do almost everything I used
to do in MS Windows, with only a few high-profile exceptions. Right
now I lack a good WYSIWYG page-layout tool like PageMaker or
QuarkXPress, and I cannot get any of the freeware FAX managers to
work for me as well as my commercial FAX program works under MS
Windows. There are programs like WINE and Wabi that emulate MS
Windows and allow you to run 16-bit MS Windows applications on
Linux, but I have no experience using these emulators and cannot
comment on their use.</p><p>What's the bottom line? Are there as many high-quality
applications available for Linux as you will find for commercial
operating systems? No. Is this situation changing every day, with
more and more top quality freeware and Open Source software, as
well as commercial Linux applications, released all the time?
Emphatically, yes. Developing quality applications for Linux is a
consuming passion for many developers worldwide, and that fact
gives me the most hope for the future of Linux as a viable SOHO
computing environment. With the level of excitement surrounding
extremely high-quality programs like GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation
Program), commercial vendors are learning they can profit
handsomely from porting their products to Linux.</p><p>In short, migrating to Linux means more than just getting a
stable OS. It means access to a collection of top-quality free and
commercial applications, with more on the way each day.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25ae580.0x26a7268"></a>One SOHO User's Experience</h2></div></div><p>To summarize this first installment, I'll review the
practical impressions I've gained during my migration from MS
Windows to Linux:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Linux is more stable than commercial operating
systems, eliminating the time and expense of redoing lost
work.</p></li><li><p>Linux is more difficult to learn in the very short
term, but has a better support system in the long run.</p></li><li><p>Linux&mdash;while &ldquo;free&rdquo; in the absolute
sense&mdash;brings with it a host of opportunity costs in the short term but
pays for itself many times over in the long term.</p></li><li><p>Applications for Linux are growing in number and
quality each day.</p></li></ol></div><p>Now we have a basis for a continued and more detailed
exploration of migrating to Linux from a commercial OS for the SOHO
user. In the next installment, I'll get into the details of
migrating, discussing such vital matters as basic system
administration and making reliable backups. I'll get more specific
about some of the software that is available for Linux and compare
it to software available in the commercial OS world. I'll also
discuss how to interface and share work with our colleagues and
clients who are stuck with their commercial operating
systems.</p><p><a href="2585s1.html" target="_self">Comparing Costs for a SOHO Setup:
