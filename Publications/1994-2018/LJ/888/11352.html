Drupal is a powerful and very flexible, but often heavy, platform. In this
article, I 
show how to utilize all of its advantages and still make it perform fast.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x246e580.0x2566250"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Performance is one of the most important factors that should be considered
when building Web sites. Users expect sites to be
good-looking, feature-rich, loaded with multimedia and interactive. To
achieve all these things, you often need to build heavy Web applications, which are not
always performant by their nature. To achieve the best balance between
features and performance, there are various techniques to use, and caching
is one of the most popular.
</p><p>
It is relatively simple to build a small personal Web site or blog that
will perform well. Like most other Web platforms, Drupal also provides
built-in mechanisms that will allow you to achieve sufficient
performance for such a site in a relatively simple way. However, things
become much more interesting when you have to build a site with a few
hundred-thousand content items and tens of millions of visits per
month.
The solution definitely will not be straightforward, but it can
be done. Drupal and some of its contrib modules provide mechanisms that
are powerful and flexible enough to build sites of this
size successfully. I describe some of them here.
</p><p>
The solutions and techniques discussed in this article were tested while
building a relatively large media site, which was migrated to Drupal 7
in December 2012. It currently is the biggest Drupal site in the wider
Balkan region.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x246e580.0x2566510"></a>
What Is Cache?</h2></div></div><p>
Cache is a frequently used technique in computing, for both hardware and
software. The basic idea behind cache is to identify data that is 
used often and store it on a medium where it can be fetched as quickly as
possible. When building Web applications, you usually want to load as much
data as possible from memory (which is fast). On the other hand, you mostly
need permanent storage for it. Since RAM is not such a medium, you have
to keep the data on disk, which is very slow in most cases. This
leads to a typical architecture for Web applications that uses disk to
store data permanently and RAM as an efficient cache medium for the most-used
pieces of it.
</p><p>
There are many cases when you usually will want to use cache in Web
development, including the following:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Heavy database queries.
</p></li><li><p>
Output that is &ldquo;expensive&rdquo; to render.
</p></li><li><p>
Complex numerical calculations.
</p></li><li><p>
Code with substantial use of I/O (disk).
</p></li><li><p>
Data that was fetched from remote servers.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Two caches should be considered by every PHP+MySQL developer:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
APC (Alternative PHP Cache) is a PHP extension that implements op-code
cache. Op-code cache saves overhead that is caused by the fact
that PHP compiles its scripts on every request. Because most of the
scripts don't change often, APC saves time by saving compiled versions
of scripts into shared memory to be available for the next
requests.
</p></li><li><p>
MySQL query cache saves query results to be available the next time
the same query is executed. Substantial
savings can be achieved this way, because repeating queries happens a
lot in Web apps.
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x246e580.0x2566cf8"></a>
Cache in Drupal 7</h2></div></div><p>
Cache is implemented as a very flexible and pluggable framework in Drupal
7. Here are three of the most important concepts to understand:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
A cache item is a complete piece of data that is stored in
cache. A developer addresses each cache item with a key that
obviously should be unique.
</p></li><li><p>
Cache bin is a group of similar cache items. There are a lot of
different cache bins, as Drupal allows its modules to
create their own. Each cache item generally can be saved to any bin
available in the system.
</p></li><li><p>
Cache back end is a technology platform that is used to store cache. Each
cache bin generally can be stored in a different back end.
There is support for numerous back ends in Drupal's contrib ecosystem
(such as APC, Memcached, Redis and so on). It is not hard to implement support
for a new back end if your project requires something that has not
been supported yet.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
If you develop a Drupal module and you want to utilize the advantages of
Drupal's cache framework, you should do something like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;?php
if ($cache = cache_get('my_cache_item', 'cache')) {
  $data = $cache-&gt;data;
}
else {
  // some heavy calculations...
  
  cache_set('my_cache_item', $data, 'cache');
}

// Use $data
?&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
The cache item in the above snippet is keyed with
<tt  >my_cache_item</tt> and
stored in a bin called <tt  >cache</tt>, which is obviously Drupal's
default bin. Check Drupal's <tt  >cache_set()</tt> (<a href="http://dgo.to/a/cache_set" target="_self">dgo.to/a/cache_set</a>) and <tt  >cache_get()</tt>
(<a href="http://dgo.to/a/cache_get" target="_self">dgo.to/a/cache_get</a>) functions if you need more
information.
</p><p>
The following is a list of cache bins provided by Drupal
core:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
cache &mdash; default (generic) cache bin.
</p></li><li><p>
cache_block &mdash; storage for cached versions of built (rendered) blocks. 
</p></li><li><p>
cache_bootstrap &mdash; bin for data required to bootstrap Drupal. 
</p></li><li><p>
cache_field &mdash; storage for cached versions of Drupal's fields.
</p></li><li><p>
cache_filter &mdash; bin for the Filter module to store already filtered pieces of text. 
</p></li><li><p>
cache_form &mdash; bin for the form system to store recently built forms
and their storage data to be used in subsequent page requests.
</p></li><li><p>
cache_image &mdash; bin used to store information about image manipulations that are in progress.
</p></li><li><p>
cache_menu &mdash; storage for the menu system to store router information and menu link trees. 
</p></li><li><p>
cache_page &mdash; bin used to store compressed pages for anonymous users.
</p></li><li><p>
cache_path &mdash; bin for path alias lookup.
</p></li><li><p>
cache_update &mdash; bin for the Update module to store information about
available releases, fetched from the central server.
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x246e580.0x2567bc0"></a>
Cache Back Ends</h2></div></div><p>
A lot of different cache back ends can be used together with Drupal. I
describe some of the most popular ones here that also have support in
at least one Drupal module. Back ends that are most commonly used in
the Drupal ecosystem also are very popular in general Web development. Each
of them has its own advantages and disadvantages, and each will
satisfy different needs.
</p><p>
Some modules implement more than just cache support. They often
implement sessions and semaphore (locking) handlers too. That also
will speed up your site, as a typical Drupal Web site uses those mechanisms
frequently. Refer to each module's project page and README.txt file in
order to utilize their advantages.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x246e580.0x295ff70"></a>
Database Cache (Default)</h2></div></div><p>
Drupal's default cache implementation is obviously very easy to use, as
you get it &ldquo;for free&rdquo; when you install Drupal. It also doesn't add any
additional complexity to your server stack, because it uses a database (usually
MySQL). This back end should work totally fine for most smaller
sites. The problem is its speed, because it writes all data directly to
disk. Writes are especially very slow, as MySQL's query cache helps to
boost read performance. Another disadvantage is the fact that it
uses a database that already is under very heavy load on high-traffic
Web sites.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x246e580.0x29600d0"></a>
APC User Cache</h2></div></div><p>
I already mentioned APC (<a href="http://drupal.org/project/apc" target="_self">drupal.org/project/apc</a>). It provides a lot of performance
improvement, as PHP files generally do not change much. It is relatively
simple to install and very easy to configure. It should be used on
<span   class="emphasis"><em>every</em></span> Web server that runs PHP (production and development).
</p><p>
Another feature of APC that people are not always aware of is the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>user
cache</em></span>. The user cache uses APC's shared memory to store users'
(developers') custom data, and it definitely can be used for cache
purposes. It is <span   class="emphasis"><em>very</em></span> fast, because it stores data directly in PHP's
memory. Assuming that you already have APC installed on your server
(and you should), it also does not add further complexity to the
server stack. Data in APC is not stored permanently; you will lose
all your data if the power goes down. Another disadvantage is the fact that each server maintains its own version of cache. This will cause
cache warm-up to take longer in high-availability (more Web servers) setups. 
This also can lead to synchronization problems.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x246e580.0x2960390"></a>
Memcached</h2></div></div><p>
Memcached is an open-source, high-performance, distributed memory
object caching system (<a href="http://memcached.org" target="_self">memcached.org</a>). It is very
popular and is used on many well-known sites. It runs as a separate
d&aelig;mon, which means that it adds another level of complexity to the
server stack. It is very easy to configure and administer, so that
shouldn't be a problem. Applications communicate with it via
the network (TCP or UDP). You will have to install another PHP extension
in order to use it with PHP applications. It stores all data in memory,
which makes the data non-permanent. All Web servers will use the same
Memcached pool in high-availability environments, which is another big
advantage. See <a href="http://drupal.org/project/memcache" target="_self">drupal.org/project/memcache</a> for more
information.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x246e580.0x2960548"></a>
Redis</h2></div></div><p>
Redis is an open-source, advanced key-value store (<a href="http://redis.io" target="_self">redis.io</a>). It is very similar to Memcached. It is fast, centralized
and relatively easy to configure. It stores your data in memory, but
it sooner or later writes it to disk, which makes it permanent. Write
frequency can be configured, which gives you the power to balance between
performance and security of your data. It needs a PHP extension, just as
Memcached does. It also comes with a PHP library. Redis is very fast,
but sooner or later it will need access to I/O, which could cause some
performance overhead in environments that already are under heavy load.
See also <a href="http://drupal.org/project/redis" target="_self">drupal.org/project/redis</a>.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x246e580.0x2960700"></a>
MongoDB</h2></div></div><p>
MongoDB is a scalable, high-performance, open-source NoSQL
(document-oriented) database (<a href="http://www.mongodb.org" target="_self">www.mongodb.org</a>).
It is much faster than MySQL, and it stores data permanently. You will
need to install a PHP extension in order to use it. It is probably the most
complex to configure and administer of all the back ends I describe here.
MongoDB's
other advantage is its ability to store Drupal's content, which makes for
a really powerful content database in addition to a
powerful cache back end.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11352f1.large.jpg"><img src="11352f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. This performance overview of all the back ends described in this
article shows
that APC is the fastest and MySQL (DB) the slowest. Redis and
Memcached are relatively similar when it comes to performance, but
that could change if Redis would write its data to disk often. MongoDB
is very fast, especially when it comes to writes.
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x246e580.0x2960a18"></a>
How to Configure Cache Back Ends</h2></div></div><p>
You will need to do some configuration in Drupal's settings.php
in order to use different cache back ends. First, you need to
include cache back-end implementations:


<pre     class="programlisting">
# Memcache
include_once('./includes/cache.inc');
include_once('./sites/all/modules/memcache/memcache.inc');
$conf['memcache_key_prefix'] = 'drupal';

# Redis
$conf['cache_backends'][] = 
 &#8618;'sites/all/modules/redis/redis.autoload.inc';
$conf['redis_client_interface'] = 'PhpRedis';  //Library or extension

# APC
$conf['cache_backends'][] = 
 &#8618;'sites/all/modules/apc/drupal_apc_cache.inc';

# Mongo
$conf['cache_backends'][] = 
 &#8618;'sites/all/modules/mongodb/mongodb_cache/mongodb_cache.inc';
</pre>
</p><p>
The paths in the above example should be adjusted to your specific
installation. When you include cache back ends, you need to set the
default:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$conf['cache_default_class'] = 'MemCacheDrupal';
//$conf['cache_default_class'] = 'Redis_Cache';
//$conf['cache_default_class'] = 'DrupalAPCCache';
//$conf['cache_default_class'] = 'DrupalMongoDBCache';
//$conf['cache_default_class'] = 'DrupalDatabaseCache';
</pre>
</p><p>
In the above example, Memcached is configured as a default cache
back end. The appropriate line should be uncommented in order to select
a different option. Besides the default back end, where all bins will go,
you also can define per-bin back ends:

<pre     class="programlisting">
// cache_form bin
$conf['cache_cache_form'] = 'Redis_Cache';

// cache_menu bin
$conf['cache_cache_menu'] = 'DrupalMongoDBCache';

// etc....
</pre>
</p><p>
In the above example, the bin <tt  >cache_form</tt> is
configured to go into
Redis, and the bin <tt  >cache_menu</tt> is set to be stored in
MongoDB.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x246e580.0x2960e90"></a>
Cache Implementations in Drupal</h2></div></div><p>
Drupal core and some of its modules utilize the cache framework to implement
user-friendly, easy-to-configure caching.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x246e580.0x2960ff0"></a>
Page and Block Cache</h2></div></div><p>
Page and block cache are implemented in Drupal core, and you'll get
them with every Drupal installation. Page cache will save the HTML output
of the entire page for anonymous users and store it to the
<tt  >cache_page</tt>
bin. This HTML will be displayed to all anonymous users, which will bypass
most of the Drupal bootstrap and the entire page-generation process. This will
save a huge amount of time and server resources.
</p><p>
Block cache, on the other hand, will save HTML output of Drupal blocks
(parts of a page). Blocks also can be cached for registered users,
which will give you some performance improvement for non-anonymous
traffic. Blocks are stored in the <tt  >cache_block</tt> bin.
</p><p>
Both are very easy to enable and configure by 
navigating to admin/config/devel/performance.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11352f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Configuration for Page and Block Cache
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x246e580.0x2961410"></a>
Views Cache</h2></div></div><p>
Views is the most frequently used Drupal module (<a href="http://drupal.org/project/views" target="_self">drupal.org/project/views</a>). It provides a flexible
method for Drupal site designers to control how lists and tables of
content, users, taxonomy terms and other data are presented. There probably
aren't
many serious Drupal Web sites that don't use this module.
</p><p>
Views implement a cache mechanism that will save the result of a view's
query and its HTML output. Views will operate with its cache on a
timely basis, but you can implement your own plugin to achieve totally
customized behavior. The views cache can be configured per every view,
which gives you a lot of flexibility. Cache items will be stored in
the <tt  >views_cache_data</tt> bin.
</p><p>
Usage of the views cache should be considered as an option on every Drupal
Web site that uses the Views module.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11352f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Configuration for the Views Cache
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x246e580.0x2961830"></a>
Panels Cache</h2></div></div><p>
Panels is another powerful Drupal module (<a href="http://drupal.org/project/panels" target="_self">drupal.org/project/panels</a>). It allows you to
build complex page layouts and configure and control them in a really
intuitive way. Besides its many other features, it also has a powerful
cache implementation. Panels, by default, will allow you to cache almost
everything and configure granulation and lifetime. Again, this can
be completely customized with your own custom plugins, resulting in
even more flexibility.
</p><p>
The panels cache is configured on the configuration page for each panel. It is
usually configured on a per-pane (part of a page) basis.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11352f4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Configuration for the Panels Cache
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x246e580.0x2961ba0"></a>
How to Optimize Your Drupal Page for Performance</h2></div></div><p>
Cache is a very powerful tool in Drupal, but it won't help you much if
you don't optimize your queries and code first. Cache will just save you
from running them over and over again, but you still will have to execute
your slow queries and run your slow code from time to time. However, Drupal 
provides a lot of tools to optimize those things too.
</p><p>
The Devel module (<a href="http://drupal.org/project/devel" target="_self">drupal.org/project/devel</a>) implements a
handy query log, which will print the list of all queries that were
executed during a given request in the footer of your page. This
allows you to identify slow database queries and optimize them. Doing
some minor modifications of a query (view) or an index on a table will
help you a lot in most cases.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11352f5.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. Configuration of Devel's Query Cache
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11352f6.large.jpg"><img src="11352f6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. Example of a Displayed Query Log (with Slow Queries)
</p></div></div><p>
Another handy tool is the profiler 
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profiling_(computer_programming)" target="_self">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profiling_(computer_programming)</a>). It will
allow you to identify parts of your code that are slow or that use
an abnormal amount of memory. When it comes to PHP, I recommend XHProf
(<a href="https://github.com/facebook/xhprof" target="_self">https://github.com/facebook/xhprof</a>), which is really easy
to use. Once you install and configure it, the Devel module gives you
Drupal integration for it. You just have to enable it, and Devel will
run it automatically on every request and display a link to the profiling
information at the bottom of the page.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11352f7.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 7. XHProf Profiler
</p></div></div><p>
Once you have optimized your code, you can start using cache. Identify parts of
the page that are candidates for caching. When you have cached all parts of
the page,
enable page cache or use a reverse proxy. Reverse proxy does a similar job
as a page cache, but it is a separate d&aelig;mon that sits in front of the Web
server and is heavily optimized for this job. The most popular reverse proxy
in the Drupal community is Varnish (<a href="https://www.varnish-cache.org" target="_self">https://www.varnish-cache.org</a>), 
which also has a contrib module that integrates it with Drupal (<a href="http://drupal.org/project/varnish" target="_self">drupal.org/project/varnish</a>). Another module that does a similar
job is Boost (<a href="http://drupal.org/project/boost" target="_self">drupal.org/project/boost</a>). Boost will save
the HTML output of entire pages to ordinary HTML files, allowing the Web server
to serve static files for anonymous users.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x246e580.0x2872e50"></a>
Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Drupal has been known as a relatively slow platform, which is somewhat
true. But, it also is very flexible and provides a lot of room for
performance optimizations. This could make it even faster than its
better-optimized alternatives in the end, while still preserving its strength
and flexibility.
</p><p>
The performance optimization tools that come with Drupal core definitely
will work for small and medium Web sites. When you start dealing with larger
Web sites, you'll need to know your requirements and needs and use a more
customized approach. You will, however, find a lot of tools and best
practices even for large projects, which makes Drupal an excellent
platform for almost every type of Web project.
