Historically difficult to implement in Drupal, native CRM solutions
in Drupal 7 now allow site builders to craft more personalized user
experiences
for their Web site visitors by integrating their Drupal CMS with their
customer
relationship management system (CRM).
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x232b580.0x2423408"></a></h2></div></div><p>
One of Drupal's key value propositions is its ability to integrate
conventional content management features with other Web-based applications
and tools. More and more, Drupal is becoming a Web application platform
for building engaging Web sites that provide rich, personalized content
experiences for site visitors.

</p><p>
We often recommend that our clients begin crafting more personalized
user experiences for their Web site visitors by integrating their Drupal
CMS with their customer relationship management system (CRM).
</p><p>
The benefits of such integrations are many. You can present forms
for your site visitors to update their own CRM contact records or to
provide you with better data about their interests and communication
preferences. Based upon such information, you can serve up more pertinent
content, as well as offer premium access to special features.
</p><p>
In fact, the value of CRM/CMS integration is becoming so compelling that
most large CRM companies, such as Salesforce, Microsoft Dynamics, Oracle
and Blackbaud, are enhancing their Web-based products and adjusting their
marketing language to describe their offerings as &ldquo;social
enterprise&rdquo;
or &ldquo;customer engagement&rdquo; platforms. The pundits often use the
buzzwords
&ldquo;Social CRM&rdquo; to describe these retooled and rebranded CRM solutions.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x232b580.0x2423828"></a>
The State of Third-Party CRM Integration in Drupal</h2></div></div><p>
Drupal has long been ahead of the CRM integration curve because of its
open-source flexibility. Integration between Drupal and the open-source
CRM CiviCRM (<a href="http://civicrm.org" target="_self">civicrm.org</a>) historically has seen the widest
adoption. Like Drupal, CiviCRM runs on a LAMP stack (Linux, Apache,
MySQL and PHP) and can be configured to run as a component of a Drupal
Web site. CiviCRM is a mature solution with a number of great features
mostly geared toward the constituent relationship management needs of
nonprofit organizations.
</p><p>
While CiviCRM's integration with Drupal is robust, it's still not
perfectly seamless due to the fact that CiviCRM was engineered to work
with multiple CMS front ends. CiviCRM relies on its own database schema
and APIs. It also leverages its own templating engine that presents
different markup from that generated by Drupal. For Drupal developers
looking to build tightly integrated CMS/CRM solutions, CiviCRM integration
requires mastering more APIs and maintaining more code. For site builders
and Web site administrators, CiviCRM integration requires additional
training, because CiviCRM's administrative interfaces follow different
design patterns from those provided by Drupal. Further, given that
major releases of CiviCRM rely upon specific versions of Drupal core,
upgrading Drupal-CiviCRM solutions can present significant hurdles.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x232b580.0x24239e0"></a>
CRM Options Built Natively within Drupal</h2></div></div><p>
The Drupal community has long aspired for native
CRM functionality. The
most obvious benefits of native CRM in Drupal include:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
A more seamless user experience for site visitors registering
for events, making donations/payments or engaging in other Web site
transactions.
</p></li><li><p>
The opportunity to leverage Drupal's growing suite of mobile and
responsive tools and themes for CRM interfaces.
</p></li><li><p>
The ability to expose CRM data as content and display aggregate
CRM data on your site.
</p></li><li><p>
Increased opportunities to integrate CRM data with Drupal contributed
modules, such as data visualization and geo-mapping.
</p></li><li><p>
Reduced staff training costs by eliminating the need for staff training
on multiple platforms.
</p></li><li><p>
Potential reductions in technical risk since all your tools rely on
a single Drupal instance.
</p></li><li><p>
Potential reductions in hosting and IT costs.
</p></li><li><p>
The ability to do complex engagement scoring or engagement analytics
(more on this later).
</p></li><li><p>
And probably most important, the ability to customize fully your CRM
solution <span   class="emphasis"><em>&ldquo;the Drupal way&rdquo;</em></span>.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
The arrival of the <span   class="emphasis"><em>entity framework</em></span> in Drupal 7 core has
opened the door to the development of more robust CRM solutions built
natively in Drupal. So, after a year of scheming and more than 1,000 hours
of intense development, ThinkShout, Inc., recently announced the beta
release of RedHen CRM&mdash;a native CRM solution written <span   class="emphasis"><em>for Drupal
in Drupal</em></span>. And, we anticipate that RedHen will have a stable
release by the time this article is published.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x232b580.0x24243d8"></a>
RedHen CRM as a CRM &ldquo;Framework&rdquo;</h2></div></div><p>
ThinkShout initially designed RedHen CRM around the complex association
management (AMS) needs of nonprofits and trade associations. Based upon
a site visitor's affiliation with an organization that has purchased one
or more membership subscriptions, that site visitor is provided premium
access to content, e-commerce discounts and advanced Web site features
when logged in to a Web site built on top of RedHen CRM.
</p><p>
These association management requirements go well beyond the standard
needs of most CRM/CMS solutions. However, in building an abstract tool
with these needs at the forefront, our goal has been to future-proof
RedHen CRM as much as possible to ensure that its architecture can
accommodate a wide variety of use cases.
</p><p>
RedHen CRM is similar to Drupal Commerce
(<a href="http://drupal.org/project/commerce" target="_self">drupal.org/project/commerce</a>) in its modular structure. As with
Drupal Commerce, the core RedHen modules that can be downloaded on the
drupal.org project page won't provide you with a working CRM right out of
the box. RedHen is intended to provide developers and site builders with
the building blocks for quickly creating their own CRM data models that
map to their particular business requirements and workflow. Consequently,
setting up a new RedHen CRM instance does require configuration.
</p><p>
In the future, ThinkShout is likely to release RedHen
&ldquo;Features&rdquo;
or &ldquo;Apps&rdquo; that provide prepackaged CRM solutions for different use
cases. At the time of this writing, we know of
more than 96 RedHen CRM solutions built by other Drupal developers
and site builders, and we anticipate this number will increase by the time this
article is published.
</p><p>
In addition to its association management uses, we see RedHen CRM as an
ideal starting point for building custom sales pipeline management tools
and project management applications, as well as Drupal integration points
with third-party ERP (enterprise resource planning) tools and financial
accounting packages.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x232b580.0x24247a0"></a>
RedHen CRM Project Structure</h2></div></div><p>
RedHen CRM consists of a core module containing shared APIs and interfaces
and a collection of feature-specific sub-modules, including:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Contact (redhen_contact): contact entities and APIs, along with
integration with Drupal users.
</p></li><li><p>
Fields (redhen_fields): custom field types used by RedHen
entities. Currently this includes a unique e-mail field, which assigns
attributes to e-mails, such primary, bulk and custom labels (home,
work and so on).
</p></li><li><p>
Organization (redhen_org): organization entities and APIs.
</p></li><li><p>
Organization Group (redhen_group): lightweight group feature that turns
organizations into containers for private content with a broadcast system.
</p></li><li><p>
Relations (redhen_relation): the Relation module allows connections
between contacts and organizations.
</p></li><li><p>
Note (redhen_note): notes on contacts and organizations.
</p></li><li><p>
Engagement (redhen_engagement): engagement scoring system and
APIs. RedHen Note integration is included, as well as Rules integration
for popular modules, such as Comment, Registration and Webform.
</p></li><li><p>
Registration (redhen_registration): integration with the Entity
Registration module.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
We maintain other functionality that is not needed for all
uses cases in separate projects in order to keep the core
RedHen code base as lean as possible. The RedHen Membership system
(<a href="http://drupal.org/project/redhen_membership" target="_self">drupal.org/project/redhen_membership</a>) is our most widely
used RedHen component with its own project name space. It handles
individual and organizational membership subscriptions. As with Drupal
Commerce, key sub-modules will continue to be included with the main
module code base. However, we anticipate that as the RedHen CRM developer
community grows, we will see more and more contributed modules that
extend RedHen's core feature set.
</p><p>
The overall architecture of RedHen CRM consists of a set of minimalistic
building blocks that developers and site builders can use to develop
solutions tailored to specific use cases. Like Drupal Commerce, RedHen
relies on Drupal distributions and installation profiles for the heavy
lifting of fleshing out polished applications that serve specific needs.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x232b580.0x281d1d8"></a>
RedHen CRM Module Dependencies</h2></div></div><p>
RedHen has minimal dependencies on other Drupal contributed modules,
striving for a balance between relying on its own code base and
leveraging other contributed modules. Beyond Drupal core, RedHen CRM
currently depends only on Entity API, discussed in detail below and
the Relation module (<a href="http://drupal.org/project/relation" target="_self">drupal.org/project/relation</a>) for managing
connections. RedHen CRM <span   class="emphasis"><em>supports</em></span> integration with popular
contributed tools, like Views and Rules, but these modules are not
required. This makes RedHen a leaner and more stable application platform,
as it relies less on a shifting foundation of other contributed modules
over which we have little to no control.
</p><p>
This centrist approach helps assure other Drupal developers that their
customizations and extensions of RedHen won't break due to fragile module
interdependencies. At the same time, it provides less-technical site
builders with a known approach to extending RedHen CRM with standard
Drupal tools, such as Views, Rules and the Fields API.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x232b580.0x281d440"></a>
Custom Entities</h2></div></div><p>
RedHen CRM relies on custom Drupal entity types and bundles. It leans
heavily on Entity API (<a href="http://drupal.org/project/entity" target="_self">drupal.org/project/entity</a>), a wrapper
around Drupal's core entity system that eases developing entities in
several ways. The Entity API module:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Provides classes and controllers to streamline entity creation and
management. RedHen extends these base classes as needed.
</p></li><li><p>
Eases integration with key contributed modules,
namely Views (<a href="http://drupal.org/project/views" target="_self">drupal.org/project/views</a>) and Rules
(<a href="http://drupal.org/project/rules" target="_self">drupal.org/project/rules</a>).
</p></li><li><p>
Exposes standardized API hooks during CRUD operations providing a
consistent interface for other modules to interface with your custom
entities.
</p></li><li><p>
Provides hooks and data structures allowing for entities to be exported,
for example, using Features or CTools. RedHen leverages this feature to
make entity bundle definitions, such as types of contacts and organizations,
exportable.
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x232b580.0x281d968"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Note:</b></p><p>
At the time of this writing, Entity API has 138,685 reported installs all on Drupal 7 and is among
the top 20 modules on drupal.org. As Drupal dependencies go, it is highly
stable and reliable. 
</p></div><p>
RedHen ships with the following entity types, each of which comes bundled
with core properties and can be extended with additional user-defined
fields:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Contacts
</p></li><li><p>
Organizations
</p></li><li><p>
Notes
</p></li><li><p>
Memberships (part of RedHen Membership)
</p></li><li><p>
Engagements
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x232b580.0x281df98"></a>
Connections</h2></div></div><p>
A key feature of any CRM is managing connections between organizations and
contacts. RedHen features a very flexible connection system built on top
of the Relation module, which allows for bidirectional connections between
arbitrary types of entities. These relationships themselves can have
additional user-defined <span   class="emphasis"><em>fields</em></span>. RedHen ships with two types of
relationships: Affiliations, which are connections between an
organization and a contact, and Personal Connections, which
are connections between contacts. These relationships come bundled with
status and role properties, but fields can be added that are applicable
to a given relationship.
</p><p>
For example, imagine that you want to define a relationship between
a contact of the type &ldquo;Staff&rdquo; and an organization of the type
&ldquo;Company&rdquo;. Suppose you want to include information about the position
that contact has at that organization. This field value has meaning
only within the context of relationship, and therefore, this data is stored with
the relationship rather than on the contact record or the organization
record itself.

Building an Example Application with RedHen</h2></div></div><p>
Now that you've learned about RedHen, you most likely will want to know
the steps involved in building a useful application with
it. Below is a step-by-step tutorial for setting up an association
management system (AMS) for the National Association
of Pet Shelters, an fictional nonprofit organization. For
those who want to follow along, the complete demo application is
available for download as an installation profile called RedHen Demo
(<a href="http://drupal.org/project/redhen_demo" target="_self">drupal.org/project/redhen_demo</a>) on drupal.org.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x232b580.0x281e518"></a>
Installation</h2></div></div><p>
Here are the installation steps:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Download the latest version of Drupal 7, RedHen, RedHen Membership,
Entity API, Relation and Views.
</p></li><li><p>
Install Drupal using an installation profile of your choice.
</p></li><li><p>
Enable RedHen and its dependencies.
</p></li></ol></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x232b580.0x281e888"></a>
Structure</h2></div></div><p>
When RedHen is enabled by itself, it defines <span   class="emphasis"><em>types</em></span> of
entities, but it does not create <span   class="emphasis"><em>instances</em></span> of these entity
types. That is because, out of the box, RedHen doesn't presume to know
the types of contacts, organization, memberships and so on, that will be
needed for a given CRM deployment. In Drupal speak, these entity type
instances are called bundles. In the next step, you will define
bundles for each of your RedHen entity types.
</p><p>
First, navigate to /admin/structure/redhen to see the types of entities
that can be managed through RedHen. They are, again, contacts, engagement
scores, memberships, notes and organizations. For each of them, create the
following bundles, respectively:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Contacts: contacts have only a label and machine name. Create one for
Staff and Volunteers.
</p></li><li><p>
Organizations: aside from machine name and label, organization
bundles can be turned into content groups if the redhen_org_group
module is enabled. Checking the &ldquo;groupify&rdquo; box exposes two additional
settings: private and a list of content types that can be posted into
the group. Create two organizations, Foundation and Shelter, making the
latter a content group.
</p></li><li><p>
Notes: notes come with a default single bundle since there is only
one type of note.
</p></li><li><p>
Memberships: memberships have an additional user role property that
is inherited by linked Drupal users with a given membership. Create
Premium and Standard memberships.
</p></li><li><p>
Engagement Scores: engagement scores have an additional
&ldquo;score&rdquo;
property. Create High-value engagement and Standard-value engagement
with arbitrary scores.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Now that your bundles have been created, you can add
fields to them. Each bundle has a &ldquo;manage fields&rdquo; link. To
manage fields for your staff contact type, for example, visit
/admin/structure/redhen/contact_types/manage/staff/fields. You'll notice
the e-mail field, which RedHen adds automatically behind the scenes to each
contact bundle, because e-mail is required for several core components of
the system. Incidentally, we developed our own e-mail field that mimics
v-card structure allowing for multiple e-mail addresses per contact
that have different labels and flags for default, bulk and on-hold
statuses. In addition, the contact name is visible, although it doesn't
have any settings to manage. This is because name is a property on a
contact, which Drupal allows developers to expose as a &ldquo;pseudo
field&rdquo;,
so that its position can be managed along with other traditional fields.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11346f2.large.jpg"><img src="11346f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Managing the Fields Associated with a Contact Record
</p></div></div><p>
The interface for managing fields is part of Drupal core and is available
when the Field UI module is enabled. Any field type can be added
to your contact bundle, ranging from a simple text field to a complex
address field, to an image or file upload field. Once a field is added
to a bundle, it will be presented automatically when adding or editing
an instance of the entity bundle (that is, an individual contact record),
and it will be available to other components, such as Views or Rules. Fields
attached to RedHen entities do not get added to the default tabular
listings, but they are made available automatically as filters when
changing bundles. You can override the default listings by creating a
custom View with the same path and including any additional fields.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11346f3.large.jpg"><img src="11346f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Custom Fields Being Exposed as Filters on a Listing of Contacts
</p></div></div><p>
Relationships are another key component of RedHen and can connect
contacts to organizations and other contacts. As mentioned earlier,
RedHen installs two types of relations: Affiliations for connecting
contacts to organizations and Personal Connections for relating contacts
to each other. From the Relation types interface, you can add fields
to these default relation types&mdash;for example, a position field to
Affiliation&mdash;or create additional relation types, such as Employee.
</p><p>
When creating a relation, you must specify the types of source and target
entities and directionality of the relation. For the sake of this demo,
let's stick with the default relation types.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11346f4.large.jpg"><img src="11346f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Listing of Default RedHen Relation Types

Playing Well in the Drupal Sandbox</h2></div></div><p>
RedHen's default listings of contacts are a good start, but the fun really
starts if you want to create your own custom views. The venerable Views
module, a powerful graphical query builder, is the gold standard in Drupal
for creating custom &ldquo;lists of stuff&rdquo;, including RedHen entities. Much
of the heavy lifting involved in Views integration is handled by the Entity
API, but any module implementing the Entity API interfaces still needs
to clarify the data types of all entity properties and provide Views
handlers for any nonstandard data. For example, organization entities
have a primary contact associated with them, and it's up to RedHen to
explain to Views that the related contact ID within an organization
record is actually a RedHen contact. Let's create a new View, adding
additional fields and relationships to the standard list of contacts:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Create a new view at /admin/structure/views/add of Contacts.
</p></li><li><p>
Add relationships to Memberships and Organization affiliation.
</p></li><li><p>
Add the following fields: contact first and last name, contact e-mail
(change the format to primary e-mail), membership name and organization
name.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
You now have a View of all contacts that includes their membership
and organization. If you set the path of the View to /redhen/contact,
it simply will override the default contacts listing, or you can move
it elsewhere to maintain both interfaces.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11346f5.large.jpg"><img src="11346f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. Custom Contact View with an Address and Exposed Filters
</p></div></div><p>
Similarly, business rules can be extended using the Rules module, which
provides an interface for defining logic based upon a trigger&rarr;action
model. RedHen again leans on the Entity API to expose RedHen entities into
this model, so that you can, for example, send an e-mail to a contact when
a related membership entity is updated.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11346f6.large.jpg"><img src="11346f6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. Custom Rule That Demonstrates Sending an E-mail to New Contacts
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x232b580.0x2730798"></a>
Extending Core Functionality</h2></div></div><p>
RedHen also can be extended and customized the old-fashioned way&mdash;by writing custom code. All of RedHen's entity types feature APIs with
standard CRUD operations and wrappers around many common tasks, such as
getting all related entities. In addition, RedHen can be manipulated
using Drupal's hook system. Each entity can be altered using a hook
implementation when it's loaded, created, updated and deleted. Most
hooks are exposed through the Entity API's inherited controller classes,
but RedHen features some of its own unique hooks as explained in
redhen.api.php. For example, a module can dictate whether a contact
entity can be deleted by implementing hook_redhen_contact_can_delete():


<pre     class="programlisting">
function mymodule_redhen_contact_can_delete(RedhenContact $contact) {
  // prevent the deletion of active contacts
  if ($contact-&gt;redhen_state == REDHEN_STATE_ACTIVE) {
    return FALSE;
  }
}
</pre>
</p><p>
In addition, all of RedHen's main interfaces are wrapped in theme
functions so they can be overridden at the theme level. For example, to
alter the default list of contacts, implement theme_redhen_contact_list():


<pre     class="programlisting">
function mytheme_redhen_contact_list($variables) {
  $contacts = $variables['contacts'];
  $header = $variables['header'];
  if (!empty($contacts)) {
    $rows = array();
    foreach ($contacts as $contact) {
      $uri = entity_uri('redhen_contact', $contact);
      $actions = array(
        l(t('edit'), $uri['path'] . '/view/edit', 
        &#8618;array('query' =&gt; drupal_get_destination())),
        l(t('delete'), $uri['path'] . '/view/delete', 
        &#8618;array('query' =&gt; drupal_get_destination())),
      );

      $redhen_contact_type = redhen_contact_type_load($contact-&gt;type);
      $rows[] = array(
        'data' =&gt; array(
          $redhen_contact_type-&gt;label,
          l($contact-&gt;first_name, $uri['path']),
          l($contact-&gt;last_name, $uri['path']),
          l($contact-&gt;email, 'mailto:' . $contact-&gt;email),
          format_date($contact-&gt;updated, 'short'),
          implode(' | ', $actions)
        )
      );
    }

    $render['table'] = array(

In short, using RedHen's comprehensive APIs, hooks and theme wrappers,
a developer can build a complex, elegant solution to meet nearly any
use case requiring CRM functionality.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Although we think it's possible to build very robust, large-scale
CRM solutions natively in Drupal, ThinkShout's goal in releasing RedHen
CRM is not to compete with the enterprise CRM market. Platforms like
Salesforce almost inevitably will out-scale any CRM solution that we
can build with Drupal.
</p><p>
That said, enterprise CRM solutions often are overkill for small
to mid-size organizations and businesses. Moreover, even if your
organization does need an enterprise CRM solution, we see RedHen as a
natural integration point between your Web site and such a system.
RedHen CRM opens the door to the creation of highly innovative front-end
CRM tools. We anticipate that collecting and displaying data in RedHen
(and Drupal) often will be much more affordable and nimble than trying
to develop comparable features upon larger, more cumbersome enterprise
packages.
