Drupal is a transformational technology.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1542580.0x163a2a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
There's a lot we can say about Drupal and why you should choose to use it.
It is built and constantly improved by thousands of active developers, and
is adopted
by hundreds of thousands of users around the world from governments to
activists, NGOs to media conglomerates, universities to local schools, big
business, technology companies, publishers and beyond. Whether you are new to
Drupal, assessing using it for clients or for realizing your own
projects, or for a world-changing vision, you should know that there is a more
compelling reason: Drupal is changing business and the world.
</p><p>
This has happened before in other open-source projects. The first time I read
this
quote about Linux from Jim Whitehurst
(<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/08/17/red-hat-ceo-at-linuxcon-i-have-no-idea-whats-next" target="_self">techcrunch.com/2011/08/17/red-hat-ceo-at-linuxcon-i-have-no-idea-whats-next</a>), familiar to you as the CEO of Red
Hat, I immediately felt that we could say the same thing about Drupal. When you
read this now, try substituting the word &ldquo;Drupal&rdquo; for the word
&ldquo;Linux&rdquo;:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Linux is a transformational technology. The technology of Linux empowers
advancements and innovations that have nothing to do with the technology of
Linux. That is to say, Linux supports the development of new business models,
as well as new technologies.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
More than 3,000 people took the 2011 State-of-Drupal survey 
(<a href="http://groups.drupal.org/node/175624" target="_self">groups.drupal.org/node/175624</a>).
When asked to &ldquo;describe Drupal in one word&rdquo;, the
overwhelming favorite was &ldquo;flexible&rdquo;. This flexibility has given rise
to a plethora of innovative products built with Drupal.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1542580.0x163a7d0"></a>
What Are Drupal Products?</h2></div></div><p>
&ldquo;Products&rdquo; are collections of functionality that solve a given set of
problems; they are tools that get a job done. A tool that helps your average
person&mdash;or geek, in our case&mdash;get a job done better, cheaper, faster
or easier than other options has a chance of succeeding.
</p><p>
Drupal, my CMS of choice, is itself a product. As Zach Chandler from Stanford
Web Services said, Drupal is a tool-building tool
(<a href="https://www.acquia.com/resources/podcasts/acquia-podcast-44-drupal-at-stanford-and-beyond-zach-chandler" target="_self">https://www.acquia.com/resources/podcasts/acquia-podcast-44-drupal-at-stanford-and-beyond-zach-chandler</a>).
Drupal's enormous success is thanks to
the fact that it lets us build those tools&mdash;call them Web sites,
distributions or what have you&mdash;better and more efficiently than starting
from scratch. When you download and install Drupal, you're already taking
advantage of millions of hours of effort that the Drupal community has put into
it: coding, bug fixing, improvements of all kinds, user and menu systems,
database query engine, dynamic page building&mdash;all solved and much more.
</p><p>
Any of you who have installed plain-vanilla Drupal
(<a href="http://drupal.org/download" target="_self">drupal.org/download</a>) know,
however, that it still takes quite a lot of work to go from that to a polished,
finished Web site: UX and IA planning, configuration of Drupal core, adding and
configuring <span   class="emphasis"><em>N</em></span> modules, making it all look beautiful in the theme layer and so
on.
</p><p>
Drupal products take this a step further. They are solutions to business
problems, made by combining the world's best CMS (there, I said it!), with
the added value of specialist knowledge and best practices.
</p><p>
For the purposes of this article, I'm talking about Drupal
distros&mdash;instances of Drupal, preconfigured for a particular
purpose&mdash;but Drupal
plugin modules, themes and &ldquo;features&rdquo; (pluggable functionality and
configuration sets) can all be products too. 
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1542580.0x163ac48"></a>
Some Drupal Products</h2></div></div><p>
Here is a small selection of Drupal products, covering a fraction of the
solutions people are offering based on Drupal today.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>E-commerce</b></span> &mdash; Commerce Kickstart is built on the Drupal Commerce platform.
It's an on-line shop in a box
(<a href="http://commerceguys.com/blog/just-released-commerce-kickstart%E2%80%99s-first-beta" target="_self">commerceguys.com/blog/just-released-commerce-kickstart%E2%80%99s-first-beta</a>),
giving you access to the growing e-commerce market
while saving you weeks of time configuring the platform. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11336f1.large.jpg"><img src="11336f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Intranet</b></span> &mdash; Open Atruim (<a href="http://openatrium.com" target="_self">openatrium.com</a>) is an
intranet and team portal package. It comes with a blog, wiki, calendar, 
to-do list, shoutbox and dashboard to manage it all.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Collaboration</b></span> &mdash; Acquia Commons
(<a href="https://www.acquia.com/products-services/drupal-commons-social-business-software" target="_self">https://www.acquia.com/products-services/drupal-commons-social-business-software</a>) is a ready-to-use solution for building internal, external and
cross-over communities. It provides a complete social business software
solution for organizations to add &ldquo;the social layer in the
enterprise&rdquo;.

<span   class="bold"><b>Government</b></span> &mdash; OpenPublic (<a href="http://openpublicapp.com" target="_self">openpublicapp.com</a>) is a
Drupal distro for government and policy groups. Accessibility- and
security-compliant out of the box, it focuses on usability, transparency and public
participation needed in this day and age. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11336f4.large.jpg"><img src="11336f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Education</b></span> &mdash; Julio (<a href="http://julio.funnymonkey.com" target="_self">julio.funnymonkey.com</a>) is a
distribution targeted for schools, school districts, small colleges and
academic departments within universities. It features calendars, clubs, teams,
announcements, departments, staff directories and more.

SaaS</h2></div></div><p>
There's quite a lot going on in the Drupal Software as a Service (SaaS) area
too.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Webform</b></span> &mdash; one of the most powerful form-building and survey tools on
the Web, all built on Drupal, all open source (<a href="http://webform.com" target="_self">webform.com</a>). Pay to get simplicity, speed and
service. Or, because it's all based on Drupal GPL code
(<a href="http://drupal.org/project/webform" target="_self">drupal.org/project/webform</a>), you can
download and set something up yourself as well. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11336f8.large.jpg"><img src="11336f8.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>subhub</b></span>, <span   class="bold"><b>Drupal Gardens</b></span> and <span   class="bold"><b>Buzzr</b></span> &mdash; three different
Drupal-in-the-cloud providers, offering a range of services (maintenance,
design, support and so on)
and options for end users and other service providers (<a href="http://www.subhub.com" target="_self">www.subhub.com</a>, <a href="http://www.drupalgardens.com" target="_self">www.drupalgardens.com</a>
and <a href="http://www.buzzr.com" target="_self">www.buzzr.com</a>). Drupal Gardens and

Six Ways Drupal Products Can Help You</h2></div></div><p>
Here are some ways a Drupal product can help. Some of these might apply to you
more than others, depending on whether you work with and sell Drupal services,
are considering adopting Drupal or want to build your own Drupal product.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Efficiency! Experience! Expertise!</b></span> 
</p><p>
I already mentioned that using Drupal gives
you a big head start. Now add expert knowledge and experience to the mix. The
people who build Drupal products to fulfill the needs of a given segment have
gone the extra mile to give you their insight into it and solutions to its
problem spaces.
</p><p>
If you need a specialized site, one of the advantages of distributions is
that they
often are maintained by companies you can hire for support or customization.
</p><p>
If you are building a site based on a specialized distro, you get all that
experience at minute zero of your project too. Combined with everything Drupal
brings to the table, it all adds up to a huge head start that multiplies your
own knowledge, expertise and service offerings.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Customize to your heart's content!</b></span>
</p><p>
On top of all that a Drupal product
brings to the table, distributions are customizable, extensible and compatible
with all the rest Drupal has to offer. Drupal SaaS offerings are something of
an exception to this, but they have other benefits.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Common problems!</b></span> 
</p><p>
Until recently, Drupal didn't have an &ldquo;official&rdquo;
roadmap (the Drupal 8 initiatives, <a href="http://buytaert.net/mobile-for-drupal-8" target="_self">buytaert.net/mobile-for-drupal-8</a>, are a first for Drupal in this respect), relying on thousands
of geeks taking advantage of the &ldquo;scratch your own
itch&rdquo; principle
allowed by the four freedoms
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Freedoms_(Free_software)#definition" target="_self">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Freedoms_(Free_software)#definition</a>) to
add functionality and innovation. I call this the &ldquo;water
rolling downhill&rdquo; model of development: 99% or more of business problems
are non-unique, so the water flows where it is needed. In Drupal's large
repository of contributed modules 
(<a href="http://drupal.org/project/modules" target="_self">drupal.org/project/modules</a>), you are likely to find one or more modules that
provide any given functionality you're looking for. If the
&ldquo;contrib&rdquo; repo is a sunny day, the lenses that focus this potential
into fire-starters are Drupal products. They combine, test and refine
functionalities into solutions for common problems.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Help with demos!</b></span>
</p><p>
If you offer Drupal site-building services, not all of your
prospects have your vision and understanding of Drupal's massive potential
and power as a tool-building tool. Not every kid sees the castle, spaceship or
city in a giant tub of LEGO bricks. Instead of showing out-of-the-box Drupal
and promising &ldquo;There's a module for that&rdquo;, show them the picture on
the LEGO box! Drupal products look like what they do: Julio looks like a school
Web site; Drupal Commerce Kickstarter 2 looks like an on-line store. Reduce the
amount of effort needed to visualize the final result, and you will reduce the
amount of convincing you need to do to turn a prospect into a happy,
Drupal-using customer.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Specialize!</b></span> 
</p><p>
Hey, you know a lot about...something! Maybe it's hotel management
(<a href="http://drupal.org/project/rooms" target="_self">drupal.org/project/rooms</a>), real estate
(<a href="http://groups.drupal.org/real-estate" target="_self">groups.drupal.org/real-estate</a>) or
dentistry. Be the expert. Multiply all the value described above by your own
expertise. Build a Drupal product once; reuse it <span   class="emphasis"><em>N</em></span> times! This is a great
business model followed by many successful Drupal shops and other businesses
around the world, whether you sell services based on your distro or simply
want to accelerate your site-building business.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Don't pitch Drupal!</b></span> 
</p><p>
Finally, Drupal products allow you to avoid the biggest
mistake most Drupal business people make: selling the Drupal value proposition
as if others cared about Drupal. You should help them understand the advantages
of an open-source CMS that has reached critical mass resulting in innovation,
risk mitigation, cost reduction and future-friendliness
(<a href="http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1407" target="_self">www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1407</a>).
But, putting it bluntly, Drupal is just a means to an end, so: 
<span   class="emphasis"><em>don't pitch Drupal; sell solutions to real business
problems.</em></span>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1542580.0x1a35d00"></a>
Does a Focus on Solutions Work?</h2></div></div><p>
In 2001, one company had the vision to focus on selling solutions: Apple. Given
that Apple now has more money in the bank than most countries, we can say it
paid off.
</p><p>
Note: much of Apple's business model relies on being closed and
proprietary, which goes against the values we live by in the open-source world.
The point of this example is that it shows how successful <span   class="emphasis"><em>selling
solutions</em></span>
can be. I am convinced we can be even more successful, combining the collective
power and innovation of open source with solutions-based approaches. Red Hat is
a great example of this&mdash;doing a billion dollars of business in 2011 with an
open-source, solutions-based business.
</p><p>
Take a look at this video: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJtQeMHGrgc" target="_self">www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJtQeMHGrgc</a>.
That was Steve Jobs in the very first Apple store before it opened in 2001.
Here's what he said:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
The center half of the store...is devoted to solutions
because people don't just want to buy personal computers anymore, they want
to know what they can do with them, and we're going to show people exactly
that. We've got four sections, and the solutions we've chosen to feature
for now are music, movies, photos and kids....You can bring your kids into
our store and they can just sit a spell, play their favorite games, and...we
have the best selection of Mac education software that I've ever seen, and
you can buy the best educational titles for your kids.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Just like Jim Whitehurst's statement about Linux mentioned earlier in this
article, this inspired my thoughts 
about Drupal:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Our business is devoted to solutions because people don't
just want a CMS anymore, they want to know what they can do with it, and
we're going to show people exactly that. We've got four sections, the
Drupal solutions we've chosen to feature for now are e-commerce, social
business, government and education (etc.)....You can show your prospective
clients one or more Drupal products, and they can just sit a spell,
understanding
that Drupal can fulfill their needs....Today, we have the best selection of
Drupal products, distros and features that I've ever seen, and you can
implement and customize them to suit your needs.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Don't sell Drupal. Sell solutions to real business problems.
