As <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>'s resident Drupal nerd, I could not be more pleased to
bring you this special Drupal issue. Drupal really is
everywhere these days, and it's available in more &ldquo;flavors&rdquo; than most
people in the Open Source community are aware of. So in the interest
of spreading awareness about my favorite and ever-growing open-source
project, we hope you'll find this special issue both informative
and inspiring.
</p><p>
I see a lot of parallels between Drupal and Linux, and not just
because &ldquo;distributions&rdquo; are such a significant part of Drupal's
current landscape. Like Linux and the Linux community, I see both
the Drupal software and the Drupal community embracing the fact that
no one solution is right for everyone's problem. By
maintaining the flexibility of the platform, scratching one's own itch
can have tremendous benefits for all. To illustrate this, we've
put together an issue full of information about some products that have
come to fruition as a direct result of Drupal's flexibility, as well
as information on how you can take advantage of the same flexibility
to put Drupal to work for your specific use case.
</p><p>
Jeffrey McGuire starts off the issue with some opinions on selling
the solutions Drupal can provide rather than selling Drupal itself. In the
process, he describes some of the products that illustrate Drupal's
potential. Diana Dupuis continues by showing how
Drupal is much more than just a CMS, and she explains the hook
system that makes the magic happen.
</p><p>
Forest Mars walks through the evolution of Drupal distributions,
highlighting the struggles and breakthroughs that have led us to the current
set of development tools that make packaging specific configurations
possible and portable. He then describes the process of making a
distribution, so you can all dive in and get your hands dirty.
</p><p>
One of the most popular Drupal distributions is the friendly and useful
Open Atrium (<a href="http://www.openatrium.com" target="_self">www.openatrium.com</a>), which is a project management software
that, according to the Open Atrium Web site, provides &ldquo;an intranet
in a box with: a blog, a wiki, a calendar, a to-do list, a shoutbox
and a dashboard to manage it all&rdquo;. Patrick Settle's tutorial
shows off Open Atrium's best feature&mdash;the customization made possible
by using open-source software.
</p><p>
Readers who have struggled with their testing and deployment workflow
will find some comfort in learning from the struggles of others. Barry
Jaspan will help you follow continuous integration best practices with Drupal
development, a potentially resource- and time-intensive task that can be
made easier.
</p><p>
Continuing with the theme of showing off the many flavors of Drupal,
both new and old, be sure to take a look at RedHen CRM, a relative newcomer.
Offering a Drupal-native CRM solution, RedHen is worth checking out if
you are looking for a highly flexible and customizable CRM experience,
and Sean Larkin and Lev Tsypin are on hand to give you a tour.
</p><p>
Busy developers will appreciate Oliver Davies' tips on speeding up
development with Drupal distributions. He explains how to automate
some of the more repetitive tasks a lot of developers struggle with.
Then, Tim Loudon provides an in-depth look at the most intriguing
feature of the Trekk distribution, which is aimed at Universities.
Because many universities struggle with combining legacy content from
multiple sources, the team behind Trekk developed Flatfish, an HTML
scraping tool. Tim shows how it all works.
</p><p>
For those who are newer to Drupal, some basic tasks can be very
troublesome, but Danny Englander's tutorial on theming custom content types
will help a lot of beginners over an initial hurdle. He
walks through one of Drupal's best features and shows how to get
custom content laid out just right using some handy contributed
modules and a little CSS.
</p><p>
For more-advanced developers, Nedjo Rogers has some tips on making
Drupal distributions interoperable, which will ensure long-term
flexibility and ease of expansion. Janez Urevc demystifies the Drupal
cache system and shows how to speed up performance, which is a
universal struggle. Jody Hamilton, one of the participating developers, gives an in-depth look at the development
behind the popular Open Source community site USENIX.org. 
And finally, Kojo
Idrissa is your guide to the most important and most frequently
overlooked part of being a successful Drupaler, contributing to the
Drupal community.
</p><p>
I hope after reading this special issue, you'll be as enthusiastic
about working with Drupal as I am. As any Drupal user or developer
will tell you, Drupal's flexibility allows for almost infinite
possibilities, but also nearly infinite amounts of struggle. This
issue's aim is to help a lot with the latter and inspire much of the
former. Happy Drupaling!

Katherine Druckman is an HTML-flinging, PHP-hacking <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span>
Webmistress by day and a refined connoisseur of historic architecture
and fine Chinese ceramics by night. She usually can be found
surrounded by the charm of aging Texas buildings from the pioneer days
or appreciating ceramics of the Song and Qing dynasties. Well, either
that or sitting in a comfy chair with a laptop. Yeah, probably the
laptop thing. Now in her sixth year heading all things
LinuxJournal.com, Katherine's experiences in Web publishing for the
open-source audience have strengthened her stance as an impassioned
Drupal fangirl.
