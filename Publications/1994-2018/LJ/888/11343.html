Make the most of your content strategy by building and theming custom
content types using Drupal 7. In this article, I show how to design an Event content
type, leveraging some features with this content management framework.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2146580.0x223e300"></a></h2></div></div><p>
One of the great new things about Drupal 7 is that it's now easier
to customize your site content. In Drupal 6, you typically had to use
the CCK (Content Construction Kit) module for fine-grained control in
customizing content, but that has been folded into core for Drupal 7. Drupal
7 is now a true content management framework (CMF).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2146580.0x223e4b8"></a>
Drupal 7: It's All about Fields</h2></div></div><p>
When you customize content in Drupal 7, it involves creating or
modifying what's often referred to as a <span   class="emphasis"><em>content
type</em></span>. Drupal 7 comes with two defaults:
Page and Article. When building a site,
you often need additional content types. These might include events,
press releases, FAQ, staff, photo gallery and more. What makes these
unique? It's all about the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Fields</em></span> that you add to your
content type.
</p><p>
A Field is an attribute for the content type, and these
attributes are types of information associated with your content. If you
have an Event content type, you might need to add date,
location and link attributes. Each of those can be realized through
the use of Fields.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2146580.0x223e6c8"></a>
Theming and Nodes</h2></div></div><p>
A Drupal 7 Node is simply an individual page with content that's
rendered using a specific content type that contains all of your
fields. Fields are extremely flexible, and there are many possibilities
for display and theming them, depending on what you want to
do. Theming, in regard to Drupal, is the presentational
layer of the code and content, and there are various ways to achieve
theming from some simple changes in the Drupal Admin UI to more complex
custom node templates&mdash;for example, node--custom.tpl.php. In
this tutorial, I use the Display Suite module for theming our node.
It's a visual interface that allows for custom layouts without really
needing to know too much code. There also are other ways to theme a node,
including custom node templates and the Panels module.
</p><p>
Drupal 7 comes with basic default fields, such as Text, 
Long text, File, Image
and List. There also are many additional Field types
that can be added via contributed (contrib) modules.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2146580.0x223e880"></a>
Manage and Edit</h2></div></div><p>
To gain insight into existing content types and Fields on your
site, navigate to /admin/structure/types, or use the admin toolbar:
Structure&rarr;Content types. Figure 1 shows
the administrator toolbar at the top of the Admin Drupal UI in the
browser. You'll use this a lot to navigate the admin area for various
tasks. This assumes you have admin access to a Drupal site or at least
have been given the proper permissions by an admin to see and use the
toolbar.

Figure 1. Drupal 7 Administrator Toolbar
</p></div></div><p>
On the content type landing page, as shown in Figure 2,
you can see existing types, and you would add new ones here.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11343f2.large.jpg"><img src="11343f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. The content type landing page is where you can
edit your content types and manage their fields and display.
</p></div></div><p>
You also can edit a content type, add and edit Fields,
and manage its display from this page. Figure 3 shows
existing Fields and a select menu to add new ones for a
content type.

Tools Needed</h2></div></div><p>
Now that you have a basic overview of how content types work, let me
show you how to build a new one and theme it. For this example,
let's create and theme an Event content type. You will
need a few additional contrib modules available from
drupal.org. Ideally, to follow along with the tutorial, you'd want a fresh
install of a Drupal 7 site, and download and set the default theme to the
Professional Theme.
</p><p>
If you are not familiar with how to install Drupal, it's actually not that
hard, and you can install it in a LAMP environment. If you already have
a local development machine with LAMP, it's a matter of creating
a new MySQL database and following a point-and-click GUI install for
Drupal. There are links at the end of this article in the Resources section for some basic
Drupal install information. Note that Drupal has an entire command-line
utility of its own called drush where you can install
core and download contrib modules, but for the sake of
this tutorial, I'm using the Drupal Admin UI. If you really
decide to dive in head first to Drupal, drush can be
a huge time saver.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2146580.0x223f0c0"></a>
Mock It Up</h2></div></div><p>
When creating a new content type, I like to do a quick mock-up to get a
better picture of how I want the finished product to look. Figure
4 shows what I came up with for my Event.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11343f4.large.jpg"><img src="11343f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Mock-up of how an Event page will look.
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2146580.0x223f380"></a>
Essential Modules</h2></div></div><p>
The mock-up helps determine which modules I'll use. You can find links for
these in the Resources section. Contributed
modules and Theme (contrib) required the following:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Date
</p></li><li><p>
Get Locations
</p></li><li><p>
Geocoder
</p></li><li><p>
GeoPHP
</p></li><li><p>
Chaos tool suite (ctools)
</p></li><li><p>
Link
</p></li><li><p>
Libraries
</p></li><li><p>
Display Suite
</p></li><li><p>
Professional Theme
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Core Fields&mdash;included with Drupal 7 (no need to download):
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Image
</p></li><li><p>
Overview (Long Text/Textarea)
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Now that you know what modules and Theme you are going to use for building
your Event content type, download the latest stable
<span   class="emphasis"><em>recommended</em></span> release from drupal.org (highlighted in green
on its project page). The recommended release should be sufficient, but
there may be times when you run into a bug and need to use the latest
<span   class="emphasis"><em>dev</em></span> release.
Figure 5 shows an example of release information for a
contrib module on drupal.org.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11343f5.large.jpg"><img src="11343f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. The latest recommended release of a module
is shown highlighted in green (7.x-1.5 in this case). Dev
releases are red, and a new 2.x beta branch is yellow.
</p></div></div><p>
Download the modules, untar them, and put the resulting folders in the
/sites/all/modules folder from Drupal root. Although
you will see a Modules folder at root, never add
third-party modules to this one; it's a core folder that gets
updated or changed only when a core Drupal release comes out. Likewise,
download the Professional Theme, untar it, and put it in
/sites/all/themes.
</p><p>
You also need to download some map markers from the Get
Locations project page. The getlocations-markers.tar.gz
file should be sufficient. Untar this file, and put it in
sites/all/libraries/getlocations/markers. Most likely
you will have to create the Libraries folder on a new
Drupal install, but if it exists already, simply make a new folder within
that called getlocations, and then put the newly untarred
Markers folder within that.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2146580.0x26382e0"></a>
Activate Contrib Modules and Theme</h2></div></div><p>
Go to the Drupal Modules Admin page located at
/admin/modules, or from the admin toolbar, click on
Modules. Check the check boxes for Get Locations, Getlocations Fields,
geoPHP, Geocoder, Libraries, Chaos tools, Link, Date, Date API, Date popup
and Display Suite, and then
click Save configuration.
</p><p>
Using the admin toolbar, click on Appearance, and activate
the Professional Theme listed under Disabled
Themes. Use the Enable and set default setting
that will enable it and bring it up to the top under Enabled
Themes.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2146580.0x2638440"></a>
Get a Google API v3 Key</h2></div></div><p>
You'll need to add a Google Maps JavaScript API v3 Key to display a
map for an event location. Go to the Google API console and log in
with your Google account (or create a Google account if you haven't
already). See Resources for links. Once logged in, generate a new key, or
use an existing one from the API Access tab. Back in
Drupal, use the admin toolbar to go to Configuration,
and then under Web Services, click on Get
Locations. Expand Google API Key, enter your
key, and save the configuration.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2146580.0x2638548"></a>
Set Your Locale and Create a Custom Date and Time Format</h2></div></div><p>
Now is a good time to set your site's Locale
as well. From the toolbar, go to Configuration&rarr;Regional and
Language&rarr;Regional settings or
admin/config/regional/settings. Chances are your
default time zone already is set, but it's good to confirm or adjust
it. Accept all other defaults here and save. Also, from Regional
and Language, click on Date and time, located
at admin/config/regional/date-time, and then the
Formats tab. Let's create a custom date
format. It's pretty straightforward, and you'll use standard code from the
PHP Date Manual, (see Resources). Once on the Date and Time formats
page, click Add Format. In the Format
string text box, copy and paste (or type) in this string:

<pre     class="programlisting">
l F j, Y-  g:i a T
</pre>
</p><p>
You will see that it immediately renders as a nicely formatted date like this:
 
<pre     class="programlisting">
Sunday August 12, 2012- 11:00 am PDT
</pre>
</p><p>
Let's give this new format a name. Go back to the main Date
and Time page you were just on, and click Add date
type. Let's call it Full date with time zone
for Date type. For Date Format, choose
from the select menu, and most likely the new format you just created
will be the last item in the menu. Choose that, and save (Add
date type). The new Date Type is saved (you'll refer to it later).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2146580.0x26387b0"></a>
Create an Image Style</h2></div></div><p>
For the event image, you'll want a custom style. Using the
admin toolbar, click on Configuration
and then Media&rarr;Image Styles or
go to /admin/config/media/image-styles. Click Add
Style, type in <tt  >event_photo</tt>, and save. Under
Effects, choose Scale in the
Select New Effect select list. For width, choose
375, and save (Add effect). The new
effect is saved, and you will refer to it later.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2146580.0x2638910"></a>
Build It</h2></div></div><p>
Now, go to Structure&rarr;Content types from the admin
toolbar, and click Add content type. You now get a
new page with options. You can pretty much accept the defaults here,
but let's customize a little:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Name: Event.
</p></li><li><p>
Description: a custom content to display company events.
</p></li><li><p>
Publishing Options: uncheck Promoted to front page.
</p></li><li><p>
Display Settings: uncheck Display author and date information.
</p></li><li><p>
Comment Settings: set to Hidden under Default comments setting for new
content.
</p></li><li><p>
Menu settings: uncheck Main Menu.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Save the content type. Back on the content types landing page, you
now will see Event (Machine name: event), in addition to
Basic page and Article, as shown in
Figure 6.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11343f6.large.jpg"><img src="11343f6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2146580.0x26390a0"></a>
Add Fields</h2></div></div><p>
Now you're ready to add/edit your custom event fields. Click manage
fields for Event. You'll see that the Body Field already
exists. Click to edit on Body, and simply change the Label to Event
Overview, and save the settings.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Add a Date Field:</b></span>
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
On Event&rarr;Manage Fields under Add new field, type in <tt  >Event
Date</tt>.
</p></li><li><p>
Type &mdash; Date (ISO format).
</p></li><li><p>
Widget &mdash; Pop-up calendar.
</p></li><li><p>
Click Save.
</p></li><li><p>
Now on Field Settings, accept the defaults and save again.
</p></li><li><p>
On the next screen, check Required Field.
</p></li><li><p>
Click on More Settings and Values.
</p></li><li><p>
Now for Date Entry Options, choose a format from the select list. Ideally,
choose something that shows the day, month, year and time with the desired
time format (whether it's 24-hour time or am/pm)&mdash;for example, Aug 10 2012 - 3:30:13pm.
</p></li></ol></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Add a Location Field:</b></span>
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
On Event&rarr;Manage Fields under Add new field, type in Event Location.
</p></li><li><p>
Type &mdash; Geolocations Fields.
</p></li><li><p>
Widget &mdash; Geocoder.
</p></li><li><p>
Save, and on the next screen for Search options, choose No Search box.
</p></li><li><p>
Save, and on the next screen, check Required field.
</p></li><li><p>
Accept all other defaults here, and save again.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Add a Link Field:</b></span>
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
On Event&rarr;Manage Fields under Add new field, type in <tt  >Event
Link</tt>.
</p></li><li><p>
Type &mdash; Link.
</p></li><li><p>
Widget &mdash; Link.
</p></li><li><p>
Save, and on the next screen, simply save again.
</p></li><li><p>
On the next screen, make required and choose Required Title, and save.
</p></li></ol></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Add an Image Field:</b></span>
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
On Event&rarr;Manage Fields under Add new field, type in <tt  >Event
Image</tt>.
</p></li><li><p>
Type &mdash; Image.
</p></li><li><p>
Widget &mdash; Image.
</p></li><li><p>
Save, accept defaults, and save again.
</p></li><li><p>
On the next screen, check Required field.
</p></li><li><p>
Check the Alt and Title fields, and save.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
Figure 7 shows the finished Manage Fields
page. Note that you can drag the fields around to re-order them with the
little + icons, but when you do, you need to save the page again.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11343f7.large.jpg"><img src="11343f7.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 7. The finished Fields page for Event. You can
re-order the fields by dragging the little + icons under the label, but
you must save the page after doing so.
</p></div></div><p>
As you might have noticed when creating all these fields, there are dozens
of other options for customization, and for the most part, you accepted
many of the defaults. However, as you get more into Drupal site building,
you'll want to explore these options and experiment with them.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2146580.0x254b3d0"></a>
Manage Your Display</h2></div></div><p>
Now you just need to do a little theming using the Manage
Display tab for your Event content type. This
will be a two-part process. The first is to get some reasonable
defaults for your display. Using the admin toolbar, head back to
Structure&rarr;Content types&rarr;Event&rarr;manage display. Using
the &ldquo;select lists and drag&rdquo; icons, make your layout 
look like Figure 8. Note the Gear icons at the far right;
you can click on those to fine-tune your settings, but always remember
to choose Update, and then save the page after any
changes. You'll notice with the Date and Event photo, you now have the
respective format and style you created previously.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11343f8.large.jpg"><img src="11343f8.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 8. The Configured Layout after Adjusting Labels
and Settings
</p></div></div><p>
Let's add in a Display Suite layout; this is
where all the magic happens. At the bottom of Manage
Display, find the tab called Layout for event in
default. Click, and using the Select a layout
list, choose Two Column, and save the page. You'll
notice you have an updated UI showing Right, 
Left and Disabled. All Fields default
to Disabled, so position the Fields where you want them
in your new two-column node layout. You either can drag your Fields
up to the right or left area or use the Region select list
to choose. I find the latter to be easier. Figure 9
shows the layout after repositioning Fields and saving the page.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11343f9.large.jpg"><img src="11343f9.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2146580.0x254b950"></a>
Add CSS to the Theme</h2></div></div><p>
By default, the two-column Display Suite layout is split 50%, but let's add
some CSS to the theme to mirror the wireframe. Open
styles.css, located at sites/all/themes/professional_theme/, and add this code after the final closing brace at the end of
the file. You'll notice this CSS file has media queries in it, and for the
sake of this demo, let's
add our styles in after any media query,
but you also could theme this per media query:

<pre     class="programlisting">
.group-right { 
width: 36%; 
padding-left: 2%; 
float: right; 
}

.group-left { 
width: 62%; 
}

.field-name-field-event-image { 
margin-top: 20px; 
} 
.getlocations_map_canvas { 
max-width: 100%; 
}
</pre>
</p><p>
From the admin toolbar, click on Content, and then choose
Add content, and choose Event. You now
will see a blank node create form. Fill in a Title, choose your Date, and fill
in some Overview Text. Next, choose an address for your event, and once
it's filled in, click the Geocode this address button,
and your little map below will re-center itself on your address. Finally,
upload an image, choose a link/title, and save your node. Figure
10 shows the final themed layout.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11343f10.large.jpg"><img src="11343f10.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 10. The Final Themed Layout for the Event Content
Type
</p></div></div><p>
There's so much more you can do with custom content types and theming
in Drupal 7; this is just the tip of the iceberg. To enhance the content
editor experience, a nice addition would be to add a WYSIWYG editor to the
Overview Text area. If you want to get more hands-on with code, you could
dispense with Display Suite and add a node--event.tpl.php
file to your theme folder and theme the Fields individually.
