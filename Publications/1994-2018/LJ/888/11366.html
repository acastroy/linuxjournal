The ability to download and run a complete Drupal application easily is
being heralded as a new era that is completely transforming how people use
Drupal&mdash;and the Web. In this article, I discuss how Drupal distributions
are made, how you can use them, and how to add your own distribution to
drupal.org.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x142d580.0x1525250"></a></h2></div></div><p>
In the eight years since <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> switched over to Drupal (that
fateful Halloween morning in 2004), the Drupal project has undergone
explosive growth, maturing from a small but powerful content management
system into an enterprise-class development framework powering some of the
largest sites on the Web. This process has been driven by a highly
collaborative ecology later augmented by the ability to bundle up completed
sites and pass them around for use and further development. 
</p><p>
In this article, I look at the big picture of this Drupal evolution and
where it's going (so that <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> readers can better anticipate what's coming)
with an emphasis on how the underlying architecture is giving rise to a
distribution-based development ecology (in many ways reminiscent of the
heyday of Linux distros) and explain how to leverage existing Drupal
distributions as well as build your own. 
</p><p>
Drupal's evolutionary arc, in many ways, recapitulates the history of Linux
development, with the adoption of more automated build tools and package
management systems giving rise to a victory garden of different
distributions. Drupal distributions are based on installation profiles,
which date back to around the time <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> switched over
its site, and preceded the
existence of Drupal shell tools, such as drush and drush make. 
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x142d580.0x1525618"></a>
First, a Little History</h2></div></div><p>
Around the time of Drupal 4.5 (the version <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span> used when it
launched its Drupal Web site), the need was recognized for installation
profiles as a way to focus &ldquo;the highly configurable, but largely baffling
initial experience&rdquo; with Drupal into something that could be used
and adopted easily by both individuals and groups. Back in the day when the Drupal
learning curve was more like a learning brick wall, the idea was to make
Drupal make sense to first-time users and to allow it to be used to meet
their needs without all the unnecessary complication. 
</p><p>
CivicSpace was one of the very first &ldquo;distributions&rdquo;, although it wasn't
necessarily a distribution in the specific sense in which the term is used in Drupal
today. Aimed primarily at political campaigns, it was the one that started
it all, demonstrating how the Drupal CMS could be used to build an easily
expanded, complex distributed network of sites that all communicated with
each other. It even included integration with CiviCRM, which was considered
pretty advanced for the time.
</p><p>
It wasn't a distribution in the contemporary sense but more correctly an
installation profile. Back then, both terms had different meanings from
what they have today
(as the process has been greatly improved), but all along
there has been the goal of facilitating a way to share Drupal site
recipes and complete installations easily. 
</p><p>
In those days, an installation profile was more like a formula than a
completed thing. It included a list of sub-components that would be needed
in addition to Drupal core (which wasn't itself even included), such as
modules, themes and a profile file that contained scripts required to
execute predefined functions and configure the completed site. 
</p><p>
Building an installation profile required considerable knowledge of Drupal
APIs and a fair amount of time and dedication. In addition to merely having
to assemble manually the list of the modules that were needed for the
particular installation, you had to write your own custom installation
scripts. These scripts invoked PHP functions that could be fired in place
of Drupal's default installer and were needed to manage the additional
configuration at install time. Since this was before CTools and the
Features module allowed you to define exportables, there was no way to
prepackage the configuration; you had to do it by writing custom scripts
that built the configuration in real time, essentially
&ldquo;compiling&rdquo;
a working site, but from executable code, not configuration flags. 
</p><p>
The final step of using this install profile to generate a finished
site&mdash;although not involving code writing&mdash;was also a bit tedious. The
installation profile wasn't a complete distribution, but included a list of
everything you would need to get to put it together. You then had to 
download Drupal core separately, as well as the .profile itself, and then
individually download each and every one of the modules. Imagine if you had
to manage dependent libraries on a Linux server this way; it's not
surprising that it never took off as quickly as some had hoped. Then, you
still had to run the installation profile scripts to stitch it all
together, and, if all went well, you'd have an up-and-running custom-configured Drupal site. 
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x142d580.0x1525a90"></a>
Enter Drush (Drupal Shell)</h2></div></div><p>
The introduction of drush or drupal shell (<a href="http://drupal.org/project/drush" target="_self">drupal.org/project/drush</a>),
a command-line shell and scripting tool, completely changed all that and
more. At the very least, it made possible far-reaching changes in Drupal
development practices. By providing a set of tools that allowed nearly
every aspect of Drupal development to be done completely from within a
shell environment, it created a foundation for further advancements and
techniques&mdash;one that borrowed heavily from approaches to Linux
development. 
</p><p>
Drush is a tool that lives outside the Drupal installation. Installing
it on a Linux system is as easy as curling it to the right directory.
Drush also can be installed via Debian package management
(<a href="http://packages.debian.org/sid/drush" target="_self">packages.debian.org/sid/drush</a>) or by using its custom PEAR channel: 

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ pear channel-discover pear.drush.org
$ pear install drush/drush
</pre>
</p><p>
Drush can interact with nearly every aspect of the Drupal API and has
rapidly grown in popularity, expanding to be able to do more and more using
succinct and direct invocations and arguments. Using drush to download
every module needed for a given profile meant speeding things up a little,
but the giant leap forward was made possible by the release of drush
make&mdash;essentially a build script that accepts a structured manifest with
instructions for &ldquo;compiling&rdquo; a specific working Drupal installation. (Of
course, it isn't strictly compiled in the technical sense, but the metaphor
holds.) This makefile (or &ldquo;dot makefile&rdquo;) is a text-based configuration
file using Drupal's .info format (derived from PHP's .ini format) that's
essentially a list of all the required/needed subcomponents. This file
describes all the components needed to assemble a full Drupal installation
profile, where to get them, how to get them and even what patches need to
be applied. 
</p><p>
Just a few short months after the first version of drush make was
released in mid-2009, it was used to create a Drupal distribution called
Managing News, which prior to that had been a downloadable package, but was
not based on any universal package management framework. With the adoption
of drush, it became the first install profile to include a makefile. This
was somewhat of a watershed moment for Drupal, as it was the first Drupal
installation profile that automated the build process, instead of requiring
you to go fetch all the components yourself. After this, the genie was out
of the bottle. Drush make allowed installation profiles to be assembled and
served up as a single downloadable tarball, instead of requiring the user
to go fetch all the pieces individually from different locations and put
them
all together. 
</p><p>
The next important milestone was Pressflow, which wasn't technically a
distribution, or even an profile, but a retooling of Drupal 6 to make its
HTTP headers compatible with the Varnish reverse proxy server. Pressflow
was important in that it wasn't just a collection of Drupal features aimed
at a specific interest group (in fact, it included no bundled modules at
all) but was purely a technical distribution that allowed you to use Drupal
to do something that wasn't strictly possible with vanilla core: running it
on a reverse proxy server to be able to scale site performance. This
advancement ushered in a whole new era of highly performant Drupal sites
able to serve up content at Web scale, and was later included by default in
Drupal 7. 
</p><p>
Pressflow also diverged in the sense of being a completely packaged Drupal
install containing all components, as opposed to a manifest that you had to
build with drush, anticipating the Drupal distribution era. A full
distribution doesn't need anything to be fetched over the network but
includes all components in a single bundle, vastly simplifying the
process of circulating finished Drupal sites with complex sophisticated
functionality. 
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x142d580.0x1525f08"></a>
Distributions on Drupal.org</h2></div></div><p>
In December 2009, drupal.org updated its infrastructure to integrate the
drush make tool as a packaging system (in large part due to the work of
Derek Wright). Up until that point, there were no distributions on the main
site, but only installation profiles. The integration of drush make turned
drupal.org into an on-line package management system that automated the
process of turning a Drupal site manifest into a finished Drupal tarball
ready for download. 
</p><p>
Internationalism blazed the trail, providing one of the first true
distributions to be made available there, with the stated goal of making it
easy just to install a language-localized version of Drupal with no manual
intervention or additional configuration whatsoever. Since then, the
Internationalism distro (aka &ldquo;i10n&rdquo;) has continued to surf the
edge; the latest version can be found at
<a href="http://drupal.org/project/l10n_install" target="_self">drupal.org/project/l10n_install</a>.
</p><p>
Note: one important distinction between distributions and installation
profiles (in the older sense of the term) is that not all distributions can
be made directly available on drupal.org, because there is no third-party code
hosted there. Those distributions bundling third-party code will have
to be content with having only their manifests there and/or making a full
tarball (or zip file) available elsewhere. 
</p><p>
It's also important to note that the terms &ldquo;installation
profile&rdquo; and
&ldquo;distribution&rdquo; have morphed in meaning as the development process has
become more defined. Originally, an installation profile was a list of
dependencies the user had to retrieve manually with a script or set of
scripts that ran ancillary to the default installer script (install.php),
which provided a number of places for them to hook into or override the
standard behavior. Nowadays, an install profile is thought of as a
specifically formatted set of manifests that are executed by the Drupal 7
installer that can optionally invoke ancillary scripts, which may be less
necessary for distros that are mainly bundled features. 
</p><p>
Thus, an install profile technically has essentially the same meaning it did
originally; however, the way it's used has changed as the packaging system
and drupal.org infrastructure has evolved. Install profiles come packaged
with distributions in the sense that every distribution has at least one
install profile, but an install profile by itself is not a
distribution.
Drupal 7 is the first version to ship with more than one installation
profile from which to choose.
</p><p>
Properly speaking, a distribution is a full copy of Drupal packaged
together with the additional modules, themes and scripts that give you
everything you need to produce a complete and complex Drupal Web site in a
single downloadable file. It's a ready-made tarball (or zip) that's
completely self-contained. 
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x142d580.0x1526380"></a>
The Distribution Advantage</h2></div></div><p>
The now outmoded method of assembling all these components manually was a
tedious process and one that required you to know a good bit about
Drupal's terminology and file structure, not to mention having to
implement all the required function calls yourself. The process was
repetitive and predictable, which made it a great target for automation. In
addition to the main benefit of automation and ease, distributions can
provide: 
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Increased development speed.
</p></li><li><p>
A clean way to install your site and be able to hand it
off to others.
</p></li><li><p>
The increased ability to compete with commercial
&ldquo;turnkey&rdquo; solutions.
</p></li><li><p>
An ecology that encourages collaborative development and
community involvement. 
</p></li><li><p>
A platform to invent new markets heretofore unthought of.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Drupal distributions improve the factory model when you need to able to
spin up or deliver Drupal solutions quickly and
efficiently, and like the
original installation profiles that gave rise to them, they are especially
effective at meeting a widespread use case (just as they are much more
efficient at meeting it). Essentially, distributions finally realize the
vision of install profiles both in terms of vastly improving the Drupal
experience and facilitating an ecosystem now heavily populated with
hundreds of distros of every stripe and color, such as the Spark distro,
which brings in-place editing to WYSIWYG content management; Open Atrium, an
extremely popular groupware/intranet (the Whitehouse uses it as an internal
collaboration tool); DataPublic, for creating open data portals; a
paste-bin distro; a port of Joomla called GLORilla; and the official TedX
Web site, just to mention a few of the hundreds of freely available distros,
from educational to &ldquo;corporative&rdquo;, from scientific to religious,
all of which can be downloaded directly from
<a href="http://drupal.org/project/distributions" target="_self">drupal.org/project/distributions</a>.
</p><p>
Note, however, that Drupal doesn't have a defined way to separate upstream
and local configuration and settings. There's no &ldquo;/usr/local&rdquo;, and
apart from workflow-based solutions, it's a missing piece that arguably
would be of great benefit to making Drupal distributions even better. 
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x142d580.0x1526a60"></a>
What's Included in a Drupal Distribution?</h2></div></div><p>
Distributions are essentially finished installation profiles. The basic
components of a distribution are Drupal core plus any of the following
additional components: 
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Installation profiles. 
</p></li><li><p>
Contributed modules and themes.
</p></li><li><p>
Distro-specific features, modules and themes.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Just to be clear, a distribution is an install profile, packaged with
Drupal core and any required contrib modules. The install profile that
comes with a distribution may in fact have additional scripts that run at
installation time in its .profile file. Although distributions and
installation profiles seem very straightforward once you understand how
they work, you may find the terminology seemingly inconsistent, both in the
official documentation and elsewhere. Building your own Drupal
distribution, however, and showcasing it on Drupal, isn't too complicated.
The following is a short guide on how to roll your own drupal distro and submit it. 
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x142d580.0x191f0d0"></a>
How to Make Your Own Drupal Distribution</h2></div></div><p>
The first step is, of course, to make an awesome Drupal site that
other people would be interested in downloading and using. You can use an
existing distribution as your starting point, building on the work of
others. For example, Panopoly (<a href="http://drupal.org/project/panopoly" target="_self">drupal.org/project/panopoly</a>) is an
Apps-enabled distribution of Drupal designed to be both a general
foundation for site building and a base framework upon which to build other
Drupal distributions. After you have a completed site, you're ready to
package it up for sharing. The site from which you're making a distribution could
be a clean install of the architecture you've built (meaning it could have
no created content yet), or it could be a full site with content that's been
created by multiple users. The distribution build process will pack up
only the modules, not any of the configuration, content or users. To include
configuration, you'll need to write a .profile with bundled scripts (or
capture it all in Features). To provide default content or even users
&ldquo;out of the box&rdquo;, you'll have to use the Profiler module
(<a href="http://drupal.org/project/profiler" target="_self">drupal.org/project/profiler</a>).
</p><p>
The second step is to generate the makefile. This file is a manifest
specifying the version of Drupal core that is needed to build the site (if
none is given, the latest stable release will be used) along with a list of
all contributed and custom modules. Contrib modules optionally may be given
a version number, and custom modules generally will need to have a path to a
repository to download them from, such as GitHub. (You also can use a
repository other than drupal.org for contrib modules, such as running your
own local repository to speed up package retrieval.) The easiest way to
generate the basic site manifest is to use:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ drush make-generate my-site-name.make
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x142d580.0x191f390"></a></h2></div></div><p>
which will auto-generate the drush makefile based on your current site
configuration. For any information it can't find (the path to a custom
repository, for example, which isn't stored anywhere else in
configuration),
it will insert placeholders reminding you to fill this in manually. And, of
course, if you're using alternate or dev versions of any contrib modules,
they will be included too. Inspect the file it created for you and make
sure any placeholders are replaced with corrected paths. (Covering
the exact syntax for each of these entries is outside the scope of this
article.)
</p><p>
Note that drush make handles only modules and libraries (downloadable code)
and not the configuration stored in the database (including content types
and so on) for which you'll need a manually built install .profile or bundled
&ldquo;features&rdquo; (using the Features module).
</p><p>
The next step is to execute your makefile to prepare your distribution
using the prepare-install command: 

 
<pre     class="programlisting">
$ drush make --prepare-install --tar my-site-name.make my-site-name
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x142d580.0x191f650"></a></h2></div></div><p>
(Note: this step can take several minutes depending on the size of your
site.)
</p><p>
At the completion of this step, you will have a finished Drupal distribution
that anyone can use to spin up an instance of the kind of Drupal site
you've built, without downloading anything additional over the Internet.
You could offer it for download at the site of your choosing, or you could put
it on a site specifically dedicated to showing off your distribution and
making it available for download. 
</p><p>
You even could add your custom distro to the growing number available for
download directly from the drupal.org Web site. However, to do this, you
won't submit a full package made with the
<tt  >prepare-install</tt> command, but
instead generate the makefile only: 

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ drush make --generate-makefile drupal-org.make
</pre>
</p><p>
(Note: at the time of this writing, you do have to make one manual edit to this
file. See <a href="http://drupal.org/node/642116" target="_self">drupal.org/node/642116</a> for instructions.)
</p><p>
Then, verify that your makefile is ready using:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ drush verify-makefile
</pre>
</p><p>
Finally, you'll want to execute the makefile locally (just to confirm it's
working) and then commit the manifest only (that is, the drush makefile,
not the fully packaged distribution) to the distribution's repository
using Git, the version control system used on drupal.org (and created to
manage the Linux kernel). To release a distro on drupal.org, you will need
the ability to create full projects there, which involves a one-time
approval process. This approval is not instantaneous, so if you don't have
it, don't plan for an &ldquo;immediate&rdquo; release of your distro. 
</p><p>
After you've successfully created and tested your distribution, and
uploaded the make manifest, the drupal.org packaging scripts will handle
all the rest for you. 
</p><p>
