Drupal developers want to follow best practices in software
development, testing and deployment, known as Continuous Integration.
However, they often do not have the time, resources or management support
to invest in the necessary infrastructure.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x196a580.0x1a621f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
In the early 1990s, my first job out of college was as a software
engineer at a startup company. We were building a commercial product
using a well-known open-source network security project. In
those days, Agile software development practices (not to mention the World
Wide Web, or even widespread public awareness of the Internet) still
were in the future. My fellow engineers on that project (who had just graduated
with me and to this day are the best programmers I know) and I were taught
what we now call the Waterfall method. We thought we were invincible.
</p><p>
We had no idea what was coming. After consultation with potential
customers, we wrote a Requirements document describing what the product
needed to do, a Functional Specification that described how the product
would look and behave, a Design document that described the technical
architecture and internals of how we would build it, and even a Test Plan
that described the automated tests we would build to ensure the product
worked. We had a release deadline, declared by management, of &ldquo;before
Christmas&rdquo;. Good thing we were so young! We engaged in our Death March.
The local Chinese delivery place got to know us well. I got home around
1am every morning for months. We finally finished and shipped version 1.0 of
the product on December 18. It took me a few weeks to remember what normal
humans did when they were not at work.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x196a580.0x1a62460"></a>
What Did I Learn from This Experience?</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>What we did wrong:</em></span> basically, everything about the software engineering
methodology we used was completely stupid. We shipped a working product on
time, but we started with the benefit of a working open-source project. We
made essentially every mistake that Agile development was invented to
prevent.
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>What we did right:</em></span> we actually implemented our Test Plan. Since the tests
were automated, the build process had to be automated. It certainly added a
lot of &ldquo;extra work&rdquo; to the project, but the payoff was huge. Before
we left for the day, we would kick off the build script. When we came in
the next morning, if the last line of output said PASSED, we felt confident
and ready to ship. We didn't know it at the time, but we were on the
path of what eventually would be called Continuous Integration (CI).
</p><p>
Fast-forward 20 years. I'm now at Acquia, which produces commercial
products for companies using the open-source project Drupal. Drupal is a
LAMP-stack application for building Web sites and services. We realized
early on that everyone using Drupal needs to host it somewhere, and that
most people building sites with Drupal do not also want to have to become
experts in building a reliable, scalable infrastructure for hosting it.
More than that, they also want to be able to follow best practices in
software development, testing and deployment; they want to use Continuous
Integration. However, they often do not have the time, resources or
management support to invest in the necessary infrastructure. I've
spent the last three years addressing that problem.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x196a580.0x1a62720"></a>
What Is Continuous Integration?</h2></div></div><p>
Many excellent and persuasive resources on the Web talk
about the principles of CI in detail. In this article, I discuss 
a simplified list of the most meaningful best practices for Drupal Web site
development:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Use a source code repository.</em></span> This is step zero for good software
development. Most people are doing this, using Git, SVN or other systems;
if you are not, start now.
</p></li><li><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Make small, frequent changes.</em></span> All developers should commit their changes
frequently. This reduces the inevitable conflicts and lets problems surface
sooner. Also, small, frequent changes enable small, frequent releases,
making all the rest of the principles more valuable.
</p></li><li><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Automate testing.</em></span> Have your repository automatically integrated with a
testing environment, so that every commit triggers a test run. This way,
you know immediately if something broke.
</p></li><li><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Test in a clone of the production environment.</em></span> It does no good to test your
software under different conditions from those that it will run in production; doing
so is a recipe for taking down your site when you deploy. Never hear
someone say &ldquo;But it worked on my machine!&rdquo; again.
</p></li><li><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Make all versions easily accessible.</em></span> Despite best efforts, production
releases still will break, so you need an easy way to re-deploy a prior
version. Then, you'll want to compare the working and broken versions to
figure out what went wrong. To do this, you'll need a reference copy of
past releases.
</p></li><li><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Have an audit trail (that is, a blame list).</em></span> This helps you not just in the
source control of who made this commit, but who deployed the commit as
well. This can provide rationale as well as potential fixes.
</p></li><li><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Automate site deployment.</em></span> In order to tolerate small, frequent releases,
pushing a release needs to be an automated process so it's very quick
and easy. If it's a big chore to push one release, the whole process
falls apart.
</p></li><li><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Measure results and iterate rapidly.</em></span> Are the changes helping? Is the site
faster? Did the usability enhancement yield more sales? If it's not,
you can iterate again.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
Achieving Continuous Integration requires some amount of infrastructure,
the culture and discipline of the engineering team to use it, and
management's understanding and commitment so that it supports the
necessary investment. This is an article about technology, not management
and culture, so I focus primarily on the infrastructure here.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x196a580.0x1a63170"></a>
Building It Yourself</h2></div></div><p>
Many shops build their own CI systems that are perfectly tailored to their
own needs. Doing so is perfectly reasonable if you have the time and
resources to get there. The biggest danger of doing it yourself, of course,
is deciding to&mdash;and then not getting around to it. You end up doing things
the manual, slow and error-prone way &ldquo;until we have time to fix
it&rdquo;, which often turns out to be &ldquo;never&rdquo;. When you do get
started, it probably will end up being a permanent side project, which may
lead you to cut corners that will end up causing problems at the worst
possible time later.
</p><p>
Here are some of the things you should keep in mind.
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Use a source code repository.</em></span> You probably already are (right?). You will
need to be familiar with its &ldquo;post-commit hook&rdquo; capability to
script actions based on it. If you are using a hosted repository (such as GitHub), you will have to integrate with its Web-based hooks.
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Make small, frequent changes.</em></span> All of your developers will be making
frequent commits, resolving conflicts locally as best they can. To keep
things moving forward, you need to have a constantly available running copy of
everyone's latest code. One way to do this is to deploy
the tip of your main development branch automatically to a shared development
environment, so everyone always can see it. You can script this yourself
using your repo's post-commit hooks. A build automation tool like
Jenkins will help, but you still need to write the deployment script
yourself.
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Automate testing.</em></span> Assuming you write automated tests for your site, you
will want to run them every time someone makes what they believe is a
release-ready commit. Lots of tools exist for doing this. One
popular choice is Jenkins (formerly called Hudson), and it is excellent. It
can integrate directly with your code repository and trigger a
&ldquo;job&rdquo; on every commit, or run a job on a schedule.
</p><p>
The tests themselves are not the whole story though. Because your
application is a Drupal site, you need to test it in a Web environment.
You'll certainly need a running database server. If you want to test
actual page loads like a browser would see, you'll need a running Web
server too. You probably want to test your application along with a
reasonably current production database; if you don't automate that, one
day you'll find yourself testing against year-old data. However, you
also probably want to &ldquo;scrub&rdquo; your current production database
before running tests against it, lest you accidentally spam all your
customers from your test servers, or worse. This is all the responsibility
of your test harness script, run by Jenkins.
</p><p>
If you fool yourself that you can &ldquo;mock out&rdquo; these dependencies
and have purely standalone unit tests that can run anywhere, reality will
mock you back. You will discover that tests are not accurately simulating
your live environment, and you will have to roll back a release that
&ldquo;passed all of its tests&rdquo; but failed in production.
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Test in a clone of the production environment.</em></span> This is where things really
get interesting. I've already talked about needing a running Web and
database server. If your site uses additional services like memcached,
Varnish or Apache Solr, you need to make sure those are in place too. If
your production site uses SSL, you either need SSL running in your testing
environment, or you need to turn off the checks or redirection that
enforces it. Ultimately, it is as much work to maintain your test
environment as it is your production environment.
</p><p>
Where do you run all this stuff? The &ldquo;simple&rdquo; answer is to run it
on the same server as Jenkins. However, Jenkins probably is not running on
your production servers, so immediately your test environment is different
from production. Do you <span   class="emphasis"><em>know</em></span> that when you install Jenkins via your
distro's package manager that it does not pull in some other package
that your site might end up using in testing but then fail because it is
missing in production?
</p><p>
This points to an even deeper issue. You cannot create a clone of your
production environment unless you know exactly what your production
environment really is. What packages are installed? What configuration
files are in place? What d&aelig;mons are running? What security updates have
been installed? Running a production Web site leads to all kinds of
unexpected issues and surprises, and even the best-intentioned,
well-meaning sysadmins are likely to solve a crisis by changing some
configuration on the server by hand. You have to make sure those changes
always get propagated to your test environment. For that matter, you have
to make sure they are permanently maintained in your production
environment too.
</p><p>
This leads directly to the topic of DevOps and server configuration
management. The only way to be sure your production environment is the way
you expect is to automate its configuration, and the only way to ensure
that your test environment is a clone of your production environment is to
use exactly the same automated configuration to build it. There are good
open-source tools for doing this; Puppet and Chef are the two I am familiar
with. However, Puppet and Chef are programming languages in their own
right. Once you go down this path, you are now maintaining two completely
different pieces of software: your Web application and the infrastructure
automation to run it. At this point, you need to make a recursive call to
start reading this article over at the beginning, because you will need to
use Continuous Integration on your infrastructure automation just like you
do for your Web app. So, your Web app needs a production and test
environment, all of which is running in your production infrastructure
environment; now you need a test infrastructure environment in which to test
updates to your infrastructure code before rolling them out to production.
If you are using Jenkins to run your CI process, and Jenkins is deployed as
part of the infrastructure you are developing, then...your brain just hit
a stack overflow and exploded. Ooops.
</p><p>
To be clear, this is all doable, and there may be simplifying assumptions
you can make to reduce the effort. However, if you make the mistake of
thinking of your server configuration as something you can just build once
and forget about, your Web site is eventually going to suffer for it.
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Make all versions easily accessible.</em></span> When it's time to push to
production, you want to create a symbolic tag in your version control system
that says what you released when. If you release frequently, you'll end
up with a lot of tags, but that's okay; they're cheap. You 
probably will end up creating these tags in the script you create to automate
deployment.
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Maintain an audit trail.</em></span> Your VCS gives you a commit history for your
source code, but you need more than that. When something goes wrong, you
easily should be able to point to the date/time/individual that played a
part and quickly get the information you need. Who pushed the release to
production earlier today? Who added a new domain name to Apache virtual
host configuration? Can you verify that the SSH key for the employee that
left last week has been removed? Most changes will be in your Web site
source code, but some will be in your infrastructure configuration code, so
you will want a unified view of the changes.
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Automate site deployment.</em></span> Okay, so you are working in small batches with
frequent commits, testing every time in a clone of the production
environment. Now it needs to be easy to push your new application to the
live environment. If you've automated your infrastructure as described
and already have a system in place for deploying new code commits to your
testing environment, this should be a pretty small additional step. It has
to be simple, fast and reliable; you want to be able to push a release and
go have lunch five minutes later without worrying about it.
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Measure results and iterate rapidly.</em></span> There are many great monitoring and
measurement tools available that check for things, such as error logs, page
load performance, server performance, A/B testing and more. Because
you've automated your infrastructure configuration, integrating these
onto your servers is not that much additional work, but you still have to
decide which ones to use, how best to install them, and how to 
get the data you need out of them most efficiently.

Use an Existing System</h2></div></div><p>
Whew! Okay, be honest. How likely is your company actually to make the
investment to build and deploy an automated CI infrastructure as described
above? I thought so. The fact is that infrastructure is not your specialty.
(If it is, can we hire you?) You build exceptional Web sites, and you should
not spend so much time and effort also building the servers to run it.
</p><p>
Your alternative is to use a system someone else built for you. 
Several exist, each with different properties, and with more arriving
all the time. I happen to be the lead engineer for Acquia Cloud, so
let me quickly demonstrate how Acquia Cloud provides everything you need
to implement CI for your Web site.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11358f1.large.jpg"><img src="11358f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. The Workflow page is the centerpiece of Acquia Cloud's CI system.
</p></div></div><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Use a source code repository.</em></span> Acquia Cloud provides both Git and SVN
repositories. The URL is displayed right at the top.
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Make small, frequent changes.</em></span> Acquia Cloud provides a development, staging
and production environment for your site. You can deploy any branch or tag
from your repository in any of them. When you deploy a branch in an
environment, every commit to that branch is deployed to that environment.
This makes the Dev environment perfect for initial integration testing. Set
it to deploy the &ldquo;master&rdquo; (Git) or &ldquo;trunk&rdquo; (SVN) branch,
and every developer's commits are available immediately for initial
experimentation.
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Automate testing.</em></span> Every time you deploy code or perform various other
actions, Acquia Cloud runs &ldquo;Cloud Hooks&rdquo;. These are simple scripts
that you put into your code repository to perform any actions you want.
Each hook is tied to specific actions in a specific environment&mdash;for
example, all scripts in the hooks/post-code-deploy/prod directory of your
repository run when you deploy code to the Production environment. The hook
scripts run in sorted order until the first one fails, and the output from
all hook scripts is available at the end. This is the perfect way to run
your test scripts, scrub a database, perform a load test or anything else.
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Test in a clone of the production environment.</em></span> This is the biggest payoff
with Acquia Cloud. We maintain each of these environments&mdash;Dev, Stage
and Prod&mdash;for you. You can choose whether they are on the same or
different servers, and whether they are redundant and load balanced or running
on a single VM, but we ensure that as far as your Web application is
concerned, the configuration is identical. Of course, we also provide 24/7
monitoring, backups, security updates and critical fixes&mdash;all the things
you would have to do on your servers yourself.
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Make all versions easily accessible.</em></span> As you can see in
Figure 2,
you can always revert back to any specific tagged version or branch in any
environment.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11358f2.large.jpg"><img src="11358f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. The Code selector lets you deploy any branch or prior release
version to any environment.
</p></div></div><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Have an audit trail (that is, a blame list).</em></span> Our task log is your audit trail. It
shows code commits, but also all changes to your Web environment: domain
names, SSH keys, server launches and so on. It shows you exactly what date and
time each action took place, with the option to show the full detail for
the command.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11358f3.large.jpg"><img src="11358f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. The Task log shows all changes to any of your site's
environments.
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11358f4.large.jpg"><img src="11358f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Details are available for every task.
</p></div></div><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Automate site deployment.</em></span> To deploy a release from one environment to
another, simply drag and drop on the UI (or use our API or Drush CLI to do
the same thing). If you drag code from an environment deploying a branch, it
creates a symbolic tag at the tip of that branch and deploys the tag in the
target environment. If you drag an environment deploying a tag, it just
deploys the same tag in the same environment. You always can deploy any
branch or any previous tag in any environment just by selecting it from the
drop-down list (or, again, via our API or CLI).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11358f5.large.jpg"><img src="11358f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. Deploying code is a simple drag-and-drop operation (API and CLI
also available).
</p></div></div><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Measure results and iterate rapidly.</em></span> This article
mostly been has about
Acquia Cloud, but Acquia Cloud is itself just a feature of the Acquia
Network that provides a wide variety of tools to improve your site, such
as expert Drupal configuration advice, SEO optimization, faceted search,
performance monitoring, load testing and spam blocking, plus services like
education, training and support. The Acquia Network is part of every
Cloud subscription and includes all of these tools, most for free.
