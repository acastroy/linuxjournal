Drupal's contribution process is open and straightforward.
It's also the fastest route to mastering this CMF.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb6d580.0xc65300"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Drupal is an open-source Content Management Framework (CMF) that
allows you to build a Content Management System (CMS) that fits your
needs. This article doesn't go into detail about the differences between a
CMS and a CMF. The article &ldquo;Drupal Is Not a CMS&rdquo; (<a href="http://www.palantir.net/blog/drupal-not-cms" target="_self">www.palantir.net/blog/drupal-not-cms</a>) by Larry Garfield of
Palantir (known as &ldquo;crell&rdquo;
on Twitter and IRC) does an excellent job of explaining this distinction.
What's important to readers of this article is the basic structure that
makes Drupal a framework. There's a core (analogous to the Linux kernel in
many ways) that contains the basic Drupal functionality. This is what you
get when you download Drupal. The additional functions come from
contributed modules, which add capabilities to Drupal's core.
</p><p>
This article focuses on Drupal's core, how you can contribute to the
project and why you'd want to. I'll start with the why, and then move on to
the various methods of how.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb6d580.0xc65618"></a>
What Is Drupal and What Makes Up Its &ldquo;Core&rdquo;?</h2></div></div><p>
Drupal core is the basic functionality common to any Drupal-based CMS. Like
the Linux kernel, it's not Drupal without core. When you download Drupal,
you're downloading core. In addition to core, there are several optional
pieces of software (called Modules in Drupal-speak) that add useful
functions to the core. These range from the nearly critical modules like
Views and CCK, used on <span   class="emphasis"><em>most</em></span> Drupal projects, to modules meant for very
specific use cases. 
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb6d580.0xc657d0"></a>
Why Would I Contribute to Core?</h2></div></div><p>
If you already <span   class="emphasis"><em>know</em></span> you want to contribute to Drupal core, skip ahead
to the &ldquo;How&rdquo; section of this article. There are several reasons you would want to
contribute to Drupal core, mostly related to how you use Drupal or
plan to use it. 
</p><p>
As mentioned earlier, Drupal is a CMF, allowing you to build a
custom CMS that suits your needs more easily. In some cases, that may mean combining
pre-existing contributed modules. If you're someone who's using Drupal to
build Web sites or a custom CMS (perhaps an intranet), but you're not
planning to make any <span   class="emphasis"><em>changes</em></span> to Drupal (such as adding new code to a
module), making contributions to core can give you a better understanding
of how the system works under the hood. This, in turn, can help you make
more educated decisions about which contributed modules to use as you build
your project. As an example, you may have a scenario where site speed is
critical. There may be two modules that perform a similar function, but
one may have been built with an emphasis on ease of use/configuration
(which we all like), while the other may have been built for performance.
A better understanding of how Drupal core works can help you decide what's
best for your use case and what to do when your needs change&mdash;and, you know
they'll change.
</p><p>
In some cases, there may be certain, specific functionality you need or
want that doesn't already exist in Drupal. In that case, you can add
functions to an existing module or create a module of your own. Please,
don't hack core. Drupal is written in PHP, and core is designed in a
modular fashion to accept these new functions. Contributing to core will
give you stronger understanding of the best ways to create your new modules
to best work with what core or other existing modules already provide. You
may not need to create a complex new module&mdash;perhaps all that's needed is a
small extra bit of functionality. The more you know about what core
provides and how it provides it, the less you'll have to create. Remember,
as Eric Raymond says, &ldquo;No problem should ever have to be solved
twice&rdquo; (<a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html#believe2" target="_self">www.catb.org/esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html#believe2</a>).
</p><p>
The above examples assume you're someone who's already using Drupal but
not making contributions to core. If that's the case, consider
this: Drupal is a growing and evolving system. By contributing to core,
you're in a great position to learn more about where Drupal is going in the
future. As an example, the current version of Drupal is Drupal 7. Drupal 8
is going to be <span   class="emphasis"><em>awesome</em></span>! How do I know that? Making small contributions
to core keeps me in the loop about what's happening. But, what about people
just starting with Drupal?
</p><p>
Say you're a system/network/database admin who's had Drupal &ldquo;thrust upon
you&rdquo; by someone higher up. <span   class="emphasis"><em>That</em></span> never happens, right? I had a sysadmin
friend recently tell me that someone in her organization was
&ldquo;excited&rdquo;
about using Drupal. What's that going to mean for my friend? You probably
don't care, but you <span   class="emphasis"><em>do</em></span> care about what it would mean
for you, don't you? Contributing to core can help you get a much better
understanding of how a Drupal system may impact the system/network/database
resources you administer. This is especially true once you figure out what
your organization wants to do with Drupal. I look at specifics
regarding that in the &ldquo;How&rdquo; section of this article.
</p><p>
What if you're the &ldquo;Web person&rdquo; for your organization who's had Drupal
&ldquo;thrust upon you&rdquo;, but with a mandate to make it usable,
&ldquo;pretty&rdquo; and
accesible or to &ldquo;look like <span   class="emphasis"><em>our</em></span> company, not
every other Drupal site&rdquo;?
First, realize how lucky you are to have higher-ups who are enlightened
enough to choose Drupal. They could have thought Flash was &ldquo;the next big
thing&rdquo;. Second, realize that contributing to core can help you learn the
best ways to do that. Again, more details on that in the &ldquo;How&rdquo; section.
</p><p>
If you're someone new to Drupal, you'll probably want all the help you can
get. The people best positioned to help you <span   class="emphasis"><em>use</em></span> Drupal are the people
who <span   class="emphasis"><em>built</em></span> Drupal. How can you meet these people? By contributing to core.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb6d580.0xc66220"></a>
How Can I Contribute to Core?</h2></div></div><p>
The first thing you have to do to before you can make a contribution to
Drupal core is register for an account at drupal.org. This allows
you to do all sorts of small things immediately, such as update
documentation. You can contribute in several different ways.
For the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> audience, I'll first focus on
the &ldquo;standard&rdquo; approach, which
is more developer-centric and involves using the Drupal Issue Queue. After
that, I'll go into some ways even a &ldquo;non-coder&rdquo; or
&ldquo;non-technical&rdquo;
person can contribute.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb6d580.0xc66488"></a>
Code Monkey Climb Ladder, Help Drupal!</h2></div></div><p>
The approach most developers (but not <span   class="emphasis"><em>just</em></span> developers) will be
comfortable with can be seen on the Drupal Ladder (<a href="http://drupalladder.org/ladder/ee503327-50be-1904-8d04-9499098cad64" target="_self">drupalladder.org/ladder/ee503327-50be-1904-8d04-9499098cad64</a>). The Drupal
Ladder is the result of an effort to get more people involved in
contributing to Drupal core. It is made up of &ldquo;lessons and materials to
help people learn about and contribute to Drupal&rdquo; (<a href="http://drupalladder.org/node/1" target="_self">drupalladder.org/node/1</a>). It's also worth noting
that Drupalize.me, an on-line repository for Drupal training videos created
by Lullabot, has a free &ldquo;Learn the Drupal Ladder&rdquo; (<a href="http://drupalize.me/series/learn-drupal-ladder" target="_self">drupalize.me/series/learn-drupal-ladder</a>)
series of videos available for viewing. At the time of this writing (August
2012), four videos are available, going through the &ldquo;Getting Started in
the Issue Queue&rdquo; rung of the ladder, with at least two more in the works.
Those are excellent resources as well. The first two steps are basic
setup. If you've already got a local Web development environment and Git
setup, feel free to skip ahead to step 3.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb6d580.0xc667f8"></a>
Step 1: Get Drupal Installed Locally</h2></div></div><p>
This involves setting up a local *AMP stack (with the &ldquo;P&rdquo; being PHP) and
downloading/installing the latest version of Drupal. For most
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> readers,
this shouldn't be a problem, as most Linux distros already
include this software. If you're not running Linux, you've got a couple
options. You can use WAMP (<a href="http://www.wampserver.com/en" target="_self">www.wampserver.com/en</a>) for
Windows or MAMP (<a href="http://www.mamp.info/en/index.html" target="_self">www.mamp.info/en/index.html</a>) for OS X.
Drupalize.me has free videos to help with installing WAMP (<a href="http://drupalize.me/videos/installing-wampserver" target="_self">drupalize.me/videos/installing-wampserver</a>) or
MAMP (<a href="http://drupalize.me/videos/installing-mamp-web-server" target="_self">drupalize.me/videos/installing-mamp-web-server</a>) for those needing help. A second option, for both
platforms, is the Acquia Dev Desktop. This is an *AMP package created by
Acquia, a Drupal company started by Drupal project founder and lead, Dries
Buytaert. Instructions for installing the Acquia Dev Desktop can be found
in the second video in the &ldquo;Learn Drupal Ladder&rdquo; series mentioned earlier.
</p><p>
After you've got your *AMP stack going, it's just a matter of downloading
the latest version of Drupal. If you're happy with the Linux command line,
the &ldquo;Quick install for developers (command line)&rdquo; (<a href="http://drupal.org/documentation/install/developers" target="_self">drupal.org/documentation/install/developers</a>) approach
should work just fine, starting with:


<pre     class="programlisting">
wget http://drupal.org/files/projects/drupal-x.x.tar.gz
tar -zxvf drupal-x.x.tar.gz
</pre>
</p><p>
Otherwise, you can go to <a href="http://drupal.org/download" target="_self">drupal.org/download</a> for the latest version
of Drupal 7 (which is the current version of Drupal as of August 2012), or
you can go to the releases page (<a href="http://drupal.org/node/3060/release" target="_self">drupal.org/node/3060/release</a>) to find anything from
Drupal 4.7 to the latest update to Drupal 8 (under development now).
Refer to Drupal's Installation Guide for further
details.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb6d580.0xc5d6b8"></a>
Step 2: Install Git</h2></div></div><p>
Drupal uses Git for version control, and if you're going to be helping with
the Issue Queue, you'll need it installed locally as well. Instructions for
installing Git are beyond the scope of this article, but once you've got it
installed, there is a set of instructions specific to working with Drupal
core (<a href="http://drupal.org/project/drupal/git-instructions" target="_self">drupal.org/project/drupal/git-instructions</a>) available for those new to Git or Drupal. Don't forget,
there's also a lesson at the Drupal Ladder site (<a href="http://drupalladder.org/lesson/027b5839-7a74-af04-6905-fee2d01c7ef4" target="_self">drupalladder.org/lesson/027b5839-7a74-af04-6905-fee2d01c7ef4</a>) and a
video at Drupalize.me. With the first two setup steps out of the way,
you're ready to dive into the Issue Queue and start meeting Drupal Folks.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb6d580.0xc5d8c8"></a>
Steps 3&ndash;5: Using the Issue Queue and Interacting with the Drupal
Community</h2></div></div><p>
Now, I'm going to depart a bit from following the Drupal Ladder, by
outlining
the basic steps for dealing with a bug in Drupal core, which 
probably are similar across open-source projects.
What's important to note is that you're helping by taking part in
<span   class="emphasis"><em>any</em></span>
of these steps. 
Please note, this is <span   class="emphasis"><em>my</em></span> &ldquo;broad strokes&rdquo; overview of the process. It's not
an &ldquo;official&rdquo; outline or process document. I'm sure I'm
leaving out some details,
but this will more than suffice for an introduction:
</p><p>
1. Someone has a problem and adds an issue to the Drupal Core Issue
Queue (<a href="https://drupal.org/project/issues/drupal?categories=All" target="_self">https://drupal.org/project/issues/drupal?categories=All</a>). When doing this, be as detailed as possible about the
conditions that cause the bug to appear. People will need to be able to
reproduce it. Screenshots help. You need to have an account on drupal.org
to post an issue. 
</p><p>
2. Someone working on the issue queue tests an issue to see if they can
reproduce it. If they can't reproduce it, they'll post a comment for that
issue, probably asking for more information. This will alert the original
poster and anyone else who may be &ldquo;following&rdquo; that issue. If they can,
they'll add a comment noting this and perhaps move on to the next step.
</p><p>
3. Someone sees an issue they know how to fix. They may 
explain what needs to be done (this is often done by more
experienced developers when they encounter &ldquo;easier&rdquo; problems)
or create the patch they think will fix the issue. When a patch is
created, it's submitted by attaching it to a new comment in the
issue queue. Drupal's automated testing system (SimpleTest) will do basic
testing on the patch.
</p><p>
4. Someone sees a patch that has passed automated testing and will
test it manually on their own local Drupal install. They'll include
before-and-after screenshots of the behavior that created the bug and how it's
been fixed (or not fixed).
</p><p>
5. Someone with commit access (a small group of
people, <a href="https://drupal.org/node/3060/committers" target="_self">https://drupal.org/node/3060/committers</a>) will commit the
successful patch to Drupal core after it's been successfully
Reviewed and Tested By the Community (RTBC) 
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb6d580.0xc5de48"></a>
Focus on Your Strengths</h2></div></div><p>
My use of the word &ldquo;someone&rdquo; in the steps above was important
because <span   class="emphasis"><em>you</em></span>
could be the &ldquo;someone&rdquo; in <span   class="emphasis"><em>each</em></span> or
<span   class="emphasis"><em>any</em></span> of those steps (except the last
one) in the process, but for a different issue. It all depends on the issue
and your abilities. As an example, if you know how to download a file from
the Web, take screenshots of what's on your computer screen and upload a
picture to the Web, you can do step 4 above. You just need to learn
the first two &ldquo;rungs&rdquo; of the Drupal Ladder (install Drupal
locally and install Git&mdash;remember, there are free videos to show you
how),
and you're ready to go. If you don't know how to create or apply a patch
with Git, the Git instructions for working with Drupal core (<a href="http://drupal.org/project/drupal/git-instructions" target="_self">drupal.org/project/drupal/git-instructions</a>)
tell you how. This step is a critical step, and if that's all you
<span   class="emphasis"><em>ever</em></span>
do to contribute to Drupal core, you'll be appreciated more than you know.
But, it also could be a great entry point to other types of contributions.
</p><p>
Similarly, step 3 above provides an opportunity to focus on your areas
of expertise. There's more to Drupal than just PHP. There's a lot of
markup (<a href="https://drupal.org/project/issues/drupal?categories=bug&amp;component=markup" target="_self">https://drupal.org/project/issues/drupal?categories=bug&amp;component=markup</a>),
including HTML5,
CSS (<a href="https://drupal.org/project/issues/drupal?categories=bug&amp;component=CSS" target="_self">https://drupal.org/project/issues/drupal?categories=bug&amp;component=CSS</a>)
and JavaScript (<a href="https://drupal.org/project/issues/drupal?categories=bug&amp;component=javascript" target="_self">https://drupal.org/project/issues/drupal?categories=bug&amp;component=javascript</a>)
in Drupal core. Each category has issues. The Drupal community is heavy on
&ldquo;back-end&rdquo; developers, but if you're good with the
&ldquo;front-end&rdquo; stuff, you may
be able to point out, suggest or create patches to core issues quickly,
without ever leaving your comfort zone. Again, once you've climbed those
first two rungs of the Drupal Ladder, you can go to town.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb6d580.0xc5e478"></a>
Strength in Numbers: Core Mentoring Hours</h2></div></div><p>
One of the best benefits of working with Drupal is the great community.
It's honestly one of the biggest reasons I've spent so much time learning
more about Drupal. More than just a CMF, Drupal, like Soylent Green, is
made of people&mdash;great people. You can leverage those great people as you
learn to contribute by participating in Core Mentoring Hours (<a href="http://drupal.org/core-office-hours" target="_self">drupal.org/core-office-hours</a>).
</p><p>
Core Mentoring Hours (which you may sometimes hear called &ldquo;Office
Hours&rdquo;&mdash;it was originally called Core Office Hours) got started
in August 2011 as an effort to get more of the Drupal community involved in
helping with contributions to core. As with many projects, you find a
small group of people carrying a lot of the weight. If more people could be
recruited to help with some of the tasks (like steps 3 and 4 above), that
would create two benefits. First, it would leave the Drupal architects free to
focus on higher-level stuff (instead of fixing typos in text strings, an
actual issue I've worked on). Second, it would help &ldquo;build&rdquo;
<span   class="emphasis"><em>new</em></span> Drupal
architects by letting members of the community learn more about the inner
workings of Drupal. The benefit for new contributors is that there's now
an official, well-formed (and constantly evolving) &ldquo;on-ramp&rdquo; for new
contributors.
</p><p>
Currently, Core Mentoring Hours happen twice each week, Tuesday,
02:00&ndash;04:00 UTC, and Wednesday, 16:00&ndash;18:00 UTC. Here in Texas,
that's 9&ndash;11pm
Mondays and 11am&ndash;1pm Wednesdays. The Core Mentoring page has
time-zone converters so you can find your local times. If you can make
yourself available during one of those time slots, go into the #drupal
IRC channel on freenode.net and announce that you're there for Core
Mentoring Hours (<a href="http://drupal.org/irc" target="_self">drupal.org/irc</a>). You promptly will be put to work and/or assisted with
questions you have about how to contribute. I participated in the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>first</em></span>
COH/CMH last August, and I've learned quite a bit.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb6d580.0xc5e898"></a>
Step 6: Pick Your Spots, Call Your Shots</h2></div></div><p>
Remember those examples I mentioned about the people who had Drupal &ldquo;thrust
upon them&rdquo;? Remember when I said you'd be able to find ways to contribute that would
benefit your specific functions? This is where the various Drupal core
subsystems come into play. My sysadmin friend may be more concerned with
the
cache (<a href="https://drupal.org/project/issues/drupal?categories=bug&amp;component=cache+system" target="_self">https://drupal.org/project/issues/drupal?categories=bug&amp;component=cache+system</a>)
or
database (<a href="https://drupal.org/project/issues/drupal?categories=bug&amp;component=database+system" target="_self">https://drupal.org/project/issues/drupal?categories=bug&amp;component=database+system</a>)
systems and how they work. Looking at bugs related to those systems can
help expand her understanding of how they function. If her organization is
using
MySQL (<a href="https://drupal.org/project/issues/drupal?categories=bug&amp;component=mysql+database" target="_self">https://drupal.org/project/issues/drupal?categories=bug&amp;component=mysql+database</a>)
or
PostgreSQL (<a href="https://drupal.org/project/issues/drupal?categories=bug&amp;component=postgresql+database" target="_self">https://drupal.org/project/issues/drupal?categories=bug&amp;component=postgresql+database</a>), 
she may want to focus more on those. The &ldquo;Web person&rdquo; may want to focus
more on things like the markup, CSS or JavaScript subsystems I mentioned
earlier. Or, if the site has a lot of community activity, maybe looking
at the Comment
module (<a href="https://drupal.org/project/issues/drupal?categories=bug&amp;component=comment.module" target="_self">https://drupal.org/project/issues/drupal?categories=bug&amp;component=comment.module</a>)
would be helpful.
</p><p>
If you know what parts of Drupal you're more interested in, point that out
while you're in Core Mentoring Hours, and you can work on those
areas. Or, work on it on your own. Another option is to look at the
various Drupal 8 Core
Initiatives (<a href="http://drupal.org/community-initiatives/drupal-core" target="_self">drupal.org/community-initiatives/drupal-core</a>), which
focus almost exclusively on specific areas, such as configuration
management, Web services or mobile. Discussion of those topics deserves its own
article, but take a look at the Initiatives page and see what looks good.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb6d580.0xc5ecb8"></a>
I'm No Code Monkey Genius, So I Can't Contribute</h2></div></div><p>
There are a number of ways non-coders can contribute.
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Every</em></span> issue in the
core queue <span   class="emphasis"><em>should</em></span> have a clear, concise summary. They don't. The Issue
Summary Initiative (<a href="http://groups.drupal.org/node/167534" target="_self">groups.drupal.org/node/167534</a>) looks to fix
this. If you can read and write English, you can help here. Change
notices (<a href="http://drupal.org/node/1314040" target="_self">drupal.org/node/1314040</a>), although slightly more technical,
involve documenting changes that already have been made. So, if there's a
patch that changes an API or adds/removes a function, a Change Notice is
needed. Here's an example of one I worked on for a new function that
themes (styles) date/time information (<a href="http://drupal.org/node/1441334" target="_self">drupal.org/node/1441334</a>). I
didn't write the patch, just the Change Notice. Finally, as a member of
drupal.org, you can update most of the documentation on the site, and there
is a lot! As an example, while I was writing the paragraph on Core
Mentoring Hours, I updated the time-zone conversion link for 02:00 UTC
Tuesday. It was going to 02:00 UTC Monday, probably because the Mentoring
Hours <span   class="emphasis"><em>started</em></span> on Monday/Wednesday. It was a simple fix, but each bit helps.
</p><p>
I've done all three of the things mentioned above. If you're curious about
any of them, you can take a look at the docs I've linked to or ask in
Core Mentoring Hours.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Drupal is an excellent CMF that offers a lot of
functionality out of the box, as well as for people wanting to build
something custom. In a more general sense, Drupal is also an open-source
project with a very welcoming and supportive community. In the words of
Angela &ldquo;webchick&rdquo; Byron, open-source evangelist, a Drupal core co-maintiner
and April 2011 <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> cover girl (<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/interview-angie-byron-drupal" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/content/interview-angie-byron-drupal</a>),
&ldquo;Drupal is a
Do-ocracy&rdquo;. It's not about who you are; it's about what you do. My own
experiences have confirmed this. There's very little cliquishness, and
anyone who's willing to learn about the community standards is welcome to
contribute. This article exists only because I've come across so many
smart and helpful people contributing to the Drupal community. Join us!

Kojo Idrissa is not an MBA. He has an MBA. There's an important
difference. A holistic mixture of tech guy, business guy, China guy
and educator, he fits into more than one space. When he's not being
&ldquo;that guy&rdquo;, he's learning new ways to build things and solve problems
with technology, improving his Chinese or honing his teaching skills.
He's co-SIG Leader (and resident &ldquo;Drupal Guy&rdquo;) of the HAL-PC Web
Design SIG and a member of the Houston Drupal User Group. He's
&ldquo;Transition&rdquo; in the Drupal IRC channels and on drupal.org.
