web site owner that it will use your private information only for
certain stated purposes. You are expected to review the privacy
policies of the web sites you visit and to avoid those web sites
that won't safeguard your private information according to your
preferences.</p><p>Failure by web site owners to comply with their own published
privacy policy may be actionable under the law, for example, as
negligence or fraud. Gross recklessness or intentional
misrepresentation regarding privacy promises also may result in a
web site owner having to pay substantial punitive damages.</p><p>Most of us ignore on-line privacy, though. In our
interactions on the Internet, for example, we no longer even bother
to read the &ldquo;Privacy Policy&rdquo; statement that is a link on almost
every page. We either assume that data about us is not being
collected and disseminated by the web site owner without our
express approval, or we no longer care that our private information
is being shared.</p><p>As for me, I had concluded that the battle for my privacy was
lost because I didn't have the energy any more to do what it takes
to secure it. I stopped reading privacy policies. I even ignored
the notices from my banks giving me the option to prevent the
sharing of private financial data they held about me. (I bet the
vast majority of readers of this article are just like me in this
regard!) There is so much data gathering and sharing going on that
protecting privacy seems to be impossible to worry about.</p><p>Then a friend of mine brought the P3P standard to my
attention. Promulgated by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), the
&ldquo;Platform for Privacy Policy&rdquo; standard empowers users to control
their on-line privacy in a simple and effective way.</p><p>Danny Weitzner, the technology and society domain leader of
W3C and the chairman of the P3P committee, described the new
standard this way in his testimony before the United States Senate
Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>W3C and its members became concerned about
privacy on the Web because people won't use the Web to its full
potential if they have to face such uncertainty. The majority of
users are perfectly willing to share some information on the Web.
At the same time, basic human dignity demands that we have
meaningful control over which information we chose to expose to the
public. Our goal is to include in the basic infrastructure of the
Web the building blocks of tools that can provide each user this
basic control.</p></blockquote></div><p>All you have to do for P3P to work is to instruct your
browser to check whether web sites you visit support the P3P
standard. You can elect to avoid those that do not support the
standard, or you simply can be more vigilant about sharing your
personal information with such web sites.
</p><p>Your browser automatically retrieves, from P3P-enabled web
sites, machine-readable XML information that encapsulates the web
site's privacy policy. Thus your browser can determine whether the
web site owner promises to safeguard your private information or
whether it shares your information with others.</p><p>You can set your browser to refuse to visit, or you can
refuse to share data with, web sites that don't satisfy your
privacy preferences.</p><p>You no longer will have to read lengthy (and boring) privacy
policies on each web site you visit. Instead, software built into
your web browser, plugins or other tools can enforce your privacy
rights automatically and effectively by exchanging XML data with
the web site before you even get there.</p><p>Many of the major proprietary software companies, including
Microsoft of course, participated in the W3C P3P committee. The
resulting standard also has been supported by consumer-focused
organizations, including the Electronic Frontier Foundation.</p><p>Our privacy rights have become so fundamental to us that they
usually are taken for granted. But privacy must be hard won through
diligence. The software tools we create have the potential to help
us secure our privacy rights&mdash;and the P3P standard is one kind of
software tool that does just that.</p><p>Legal advice must be provided in the course of an
attorney-client relationship specifically with reference to all the
facts of a particular situation and the law of your jurisdiction.
