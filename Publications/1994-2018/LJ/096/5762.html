carry out with efficiency whatever it takes to make their buck.
This is evidenced not only in the office buildings, but in the
numerous clubs, restaurants and stores that take only cash; the
race-car taxi drivers (like racers not so much in speed as in skill
and disregard for lanes and turn signals); and in the high number
of suits in attendance at LinuxWorld Expo, New York.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="5762f1.jpg"></div>
</p><p>That number was reflected by the many vendors exhibiting
&ldquo;enterprise-level&rdquo; hardware and applications. The big players on
the tradeshow floor were no longer so much trying to convince a
community of hackers of their commitment to Linux as proving to a
community of businesses the viability of Linux for all of their
computing needs. Judging from some of my discussions with vendors,
much of that community needs no convincing. Many vendors from 1mage
to Egenera to CA report that the number of customers coming to them
asking for Linux-only solutions is mushrooming.</p><p>While the fact that use of Linux is growing rapidly is
certainly not news, it's heartening to see that it's not only in
the server market. For example, the new HP X4000 workstation was
designed for Linux with use in the Hollywood GFX/animation market
in mind, and Hancom's office suite seems the answer to certain MS
products that StarOffice has never quite delivered.</p><p>Some old-timers at the show expressed concern that the heavy
business migration of the open-source OS would change the face of
Linux&mdash;and that even Tux might be replaced with some corporate
logo-like logo thing.</p><p>Certainly the fear is understandable. We hate to see
tradition sacrificed to business&mdash;as does any New Yorker old enough
to remember the days when vast herds of strong roomy reliable
Checker A11 taxis roamed the wild streets of the city before being
decimated by rising oil prices. The turn to more economical cars by
taxi companies caused Checker Motors to retire from the auto
manufacturing business, but the final blow was delivered in 1999 by
the New York Taxi and Limousine Commission when they failed to
grant any allowance regarding the standard technical inspection to
the last remaining Checkers, thus making the city's symbol a symbol
of the past. (As a Checker owner, I'm glad to see their collector
value soar as a result, but as a Checker lover I'd rather see them
in their natural environs.)</p><p>But I don't think Tux will go the way of the Checker (but if
he did, think of the fortune you'd make on eBay with all your Tux
paraphernalia). Like Doc Searls, I'm convinced that the mix of
business and Linux is a good thing&mdash;and for the same reasons. After
all, as long as there is Linux, there will be Linux developers and
Linux will remain a hackers' OS.</p></div></div>
