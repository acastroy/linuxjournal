    Author will  write an article discussing m4, and
    illustrating it's use in two
    domains: building dynamic web pages, and using it to build a
    simple &ldquo;database&rdquo;.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2498580.0x2590558"></a></h2></div></div><p>When you installed Linux, you installed a
lot of cool programs, many of which you use every day. At the same
time hundreds of little utilities also got installed, simply
because they were required by the bigger, more elaborate
applications. However, many of these little utilities are extremely
useful in their own right. This article describes one of these
second-class utilities: m4.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>m4</b></span> is a macro processor,
meaning that it copies its input to the output, expanding macros
along the way. In this regard it's similar to another macro
processor you're probably already familiar with: cpp (C
Pre-Processor). Like cpp, m4 originally was written as the
pre-processor for a programming language (Rational FORTRAN);
however, m4 is much more powerful and feature-rich than cpp, which
makes it much more useful than just defining constants in
programs.</p><p>Being a macro processor, m4 certainly provides the ability to
define simple macros, but it goes much further. You also can define
parameterized macros (macros with arguments), conditionally include
text into the output stream, do looping via recursion, run a shell
command and insert its output into the output stream, include a
file, perform simple string operations (length, substring search,
regexp search, etc.), perform simple integer arithmetic and much
more.</p><p>The examples that follow illustrate many of the features of
m4, but this article can't do justice to everything m4 can do for
you. Take a look at the info page (see Resources) for a complete
description. Also, the examples below are abbreviated versions of
m4 macros that I actually use. You can find the full source at my
web page listed in Resources.</p><p>A word of warning from the m4 info page:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Some people [find] m4 to be fairly
addictive...learning how to write complex m4 sets of macros....Once
really addicted, users pursue writing of sophisticated m4
applications even to solve simple problems....Beware that m4 may be
dangerous for the health of compulsive programmers.</p></blockquote></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2498580.0x25908c8"></a>Defining and Using Macros</h2></div></div><p>The basic tool of m4 is the macro. Macros are defined with
the define command. For example, <b  >define(`hello', `Hello,
World')</b> defines a macro called hello. Notice the quote
characters ` and '. These group words together to form phrases, and
when they surround a single word they inhibit macro expansion.
Usually, m4 will expand macros within both the macro name and the
macro body unless you tell it not to by quoting.</p><p>Like cpp, you don't need any special commands or prefix
characters to use macros. Everywhere the macro name appears in the
input stream, m4 will substitute the macro body.</p><p>To run m4, simply give it the name of the file(s) to use as
input. It reads through the input, expanding macros as it goes, and
generates text on the standard output.</p><p>Assume we have the following file called sample.m4:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
define(`hello', `Hello, World')
hello, welcome to m4!
</pre><p>If we run this file through m4 with the command
<pre     class="programlisting">
m4 sample.m4 &gt; sample.txt
</pre>


it produces the following output:
<pre     class="programlisting">
Hello, World, welcome to m4!
</pre>


</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2498580.0x2590c90"></a>HTML Example</h2></div></div><p>As I said above, m4 goes beyond simple macros. This example
demonstrates some of m4's advanced features by defining some macros
to ensure that HTML pages all have the same look and feel. HTML
purists probably could do this with JavaScript and CSS, but it's so
easy with m4 and doesn't require anything special from the
browser.</p><p>Four macros are defined: one to produce the HTML header, a
second to create a banner at the top of the HTML page, a third to
create banners within an HTML page (like section headers) and a
final one to do some housekeeping at the end of the page. We put
these macros into a file called html.m4 and use it as a macro
package later.</p><p>First, the macro to start an HTML page:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
define(`START_HTML',
`&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;
   charset=iso-8859-1"&gt;
  &lt;meta name="Author" content="D. Robert Adams"&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;$1&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body text="#000000"
  ifdef(`BACKGROUND_IMAGE',
        `background="BACKGROUND_IMAGE"')
  bgcolor="#e5e5e5" link="#3333ff"
vlink="#000099"
  alink="#ffffff"&gt;
')
</pre><p>Line one defines a macro called START_HTML that expands to
all the text that follows. Note the use of $1 on line seven. This
expands to the first macro argument, which will become the page's
title (see the next section for how these macros are used). Also
note the use of m4's ifdef macro on line 11.
<span   class="bold"><b>ifdef</b></span> checks if a macro has been
defined. If it has, it includes the text given in the second
argument. In this case, ifdef checks if BACKGROUND_IMAGE has been
defined. If it has, we include the HTML code to use the image as
the web page's background.
</p><p>Next comes the page header macro:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
define(`PAGE_HEADER',
`&lt;table border="0" background="steel.jpg"
width="100%"&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td align="left"&gt;$1&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td align="right"&gt;$2&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;div align=right&gt;
  Last Modified: esyscmd(`date')
&lt;/div&gt;
')
</pre><p>Again, note the use of $1 and $2 on lines four and five that
get expanded with macro arguments. Further, note the esyscmd()
macro on line nine. <span   class="bold"><b>esyscmd()</b></span>
tells m4 to run the given shell command and insert its output at
the given location. In this case, we run &ldquo;date&rdquo; to produce a
timestamp in our document.
</p><p>Next, we create the macro to make a section banner within the
page. This uses nothing you haven't seen before:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
define(`HTML_BANNER',
`&lt;table border="0"
background="steel.jpg"
width="100%"&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;
      &lt;img src="$2"&gt;
      &lt;h2&gt;$1&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
')
</pre><p>The final piece necessary is the macro to close the HTML
&ldquo;body&rdquo; and &ldquo;html&rdquo; tags:
<pre     class="programlisting">
define(`END_HTML', `&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;')
</pre>


Given the above four macros, creating a web page is extraordinarily
easy. Create a file (index.m4) that contains calls to our HTML
macros. The only thing new is the include macro that inserts our
HTML macros:
<pre     class="programlisting">
include(`html.m4')
define(`BACKGROUND_IMAGE', `bg.jpg')
START_HTML(`Sample Page')
PAGE_HEADER(`computer.jpg', `Sample HTML
Page')
HTML_BANNER(`img1.jpg', `News')
HTML_BANNER(`img2.jpg', `Downloads')
END_HTML
</pre>


Once we've declared the macros and a file that uses them, the final
step is to run m4 to create the HTML page. The command is:
<pre     class="programlisting">
m4 index.m4 &gt; index.html
</pre>


That's it! With just seven lines of code we create a fully
functional HTML document. By using the macros to create other HTML
pages, every page will have the same look and feel. Furthermore, we
can change the look by simply changing the macro definitions and
re-creating the HTML files.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2498580.0x25912c0"></a>A Simple Database Example</h2></div></div><p>In this second example, we create a &ldquo;database&rdquo; of exam
questions for a course. The goals are 1) to manage exam questions
in a single repository, 2) to be able to create a LaTeX-format exam
by simply choosing which questions to include and 3) to produce an
answer key with equally little effort.</p><p>The question database consists of an m4 macro for each
question. We store the macros in a file called questions.m4. For
example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
define(`QUESTION_1',
  `Why did the chicken cross the road?
  ANSWER(1in, `To get to the other side')
')
</pre><p>Obviously, this macro will be expanded with the question
itself, but note the use of the embedded macro ANSWER. It expands
to one inch of vertical space if we're producing the exam,
otherwise it expands to the answer if we're producing an answer
key. ANSWER is defined as:
<pre     class="programlisting">
define(ANSWER, ifdef(`ANSWER_KEY', `Answer: $2',
`\vspace*{$1}'))
</pre>


If ANSWER_KEY is defined, we include the answer ($2), otherwise we
include some vertical space ($1) so the student can write in the
answer.
</p><p>Using the question macros is as easy as using the HTML
macros. The complete exam code is stored in a file called
exam.m4:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
include(examMacros.m4)
EXAM_HEADER(`JOKE 101', `Fall 2001',
`First Exam')
include(questions.m4)
QUESTION_1
QUESTION_2
EXAM_TRAILER
</pre><p>The &ldquo;include&rdquo; on line one includes the code for EXAM_HEADER
and EXAM_TRAILER that generate boilerplate LaTeX at the top and
bottom of the exam. Line three includes the question macros we just
created. Lines four and five include two questions from the
database.
</p><p>To create an exam, we run the command <b  >m4 exam.m4
&gt; exam.tex</b>. Because ANSWER_KEY was never defined, each
question will include space for an answer. To create an answer key,
we use m4's command-line options to temporarily define an
ANSWER_KEY macro:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
m4 -DANSWER_KEY exam.m4 &gt; exam.key.tex
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2498580.0x2591738"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>m4</b></span> is a tool that has
applications in an endless number of domains. Anywhere you want to
reduce duplication of effort, m4 can help. It is feature-rich
enough that you can do almost anything and produce any kind of
content you may wish. I hope I've given you enough to whet your
appetite for m4 and to give you an appreciation for what m4 can do
for you. Happy macro writing!</p><p><a href="5594s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
