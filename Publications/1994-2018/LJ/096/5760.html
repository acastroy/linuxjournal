It does look like
something from the 1980s. That's because it is. You are right,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>mon ami</em></span>. It is true that I am still running on
my Linux system, but the effect is wonderfully nostalgic,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>non</em></span>? <span   class="emphasis"><em>Oui</em></span>, there are
several examples on tonight's menu, and I think our friends will be
delighted. What did you say, Fran&ccedil;ois? Ah, they are already
here!</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Bonjour, mes amis</em></span>. Welcome to
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Chez Marcel</em></span>, home of the Linux world's
greatest wine cellar and the finest Linux cooking. Your tastebuds
are tingling in anticipation, is it not true? Then allow my
faithful waiter to show you to your chairs, and we will have a look
at the menu <span   class="emphasis"><em>imm&eacute;diatement</em></span>.
Fran&ccedil;ois, please, to the wine cellar. Bring up the 1989
Pessac-L&eacute;ognan&mdash;it will be a perfect match for what is to
come.</p><p>By definiton, interoperability implies the ability of some
technology to work easily with some other technology or some piece
of software with another piece of software. I tell you now,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, that this concern for the machine
side of things makes me want to drown my sorrows in a rich
cr&egrave;me caramel. Come to think of it, I may do that regardless
of how things turn out, <span   class="emphasis"><em>non</em></span>?</p><p>What was I saying, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>?
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Ah, oui</em></span>. What about the software working with
the wetware as they say&mdash;the person working with the machine. What
makes Linux so wonderful to work with is that it gives us choices
that other environments do not provide. Those choices are so
exceptional that we even can choose to run our Linux systems with
the friendly face and flavor of an earlier operating system we knew
and felt comfortable with. After all, it is what is inside that
counts, <span   class="emphasis"><em>non</em></span>?</p><p>You probably are running a flashy new GNOME or KDE desktop
environment, and yet you long for a foray into the desktops of your
youth, whether it be Amiga, an old Macintosh or even that
particular ubiquitous desktop from circa 1995. Under no
circumstances do you wish to give up the power of your Linux
desktop, but the appearance is another matter.</p><p>When you start your GNOME or KDE desktop, you are running a
window manager on top of the X Window System graphical manager (or
simply X). On most Linux systems, this is the XFree86 server. If
your system starts out at a text login and you start X with
<b  >startx</b>, then you are ready to experiment. If
your desktop starts at a graphical login, you may want to switch
back to a text login for a taste of these recipes. Log out from
your desktop, switch to one of your virtual consoles (with
Ctrl-Alt-<span   class="emphasis"><em>Fn</em></span>, where <span   class="emphasis"><em>Fn</em></span> is
a function key from 2 to 6) and log in as root. Now type
<b  >init 3</b>, and the graphical login manager will
exit. There are numerous ways to do this. Your graphical login
screen even may have an option to switch to console mode.</p><p>The master program that starts all desktops is xinit. The
startx program is just a script that calls xinit (with a few flags
and parameters). Still, you could restart your KDE window manager
like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
xinit /usr/bin/startkde
</pre><p>If you do it this way, make sure you always specify the full
path to the window manager. Another thing you can do is create a
.xinitrc file in your home directory with a single line in it:
<pre     class="programlisting">
exec startkde
</pre>


Doing it this way, you can start your window manager with the
classic startx command. And indeed, classics is what we were
talking about, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>--this 1989 red is most
certainly a classic. Fran&ccedil;ois, please pour for our guests.
While you enjoy your drinks, let me show you the first of our
desktop classics, Takashi Hasegawa's MLVWM, which stands for
Macintosh-Like Virtual Window Manager. Start by visiting his site,
pick up the latest source and build it:
<pre     class="programlisting">
tar -xzvf mlvwm091.tar.gz
cd mlvwm091
xmkmf -a
make
make install
</pre>


While you are there, you also may want to download the mini-icon
set (which actually comes from the FVWM desktop) and extract those:
<pre     class="programlisting">
cd /home/natika/pixmaps
tar -xzvf mini-icons.tar.gz
</pre>


Before you start up your new (or old) Macintosh look-alike desktop,
you must first create a .mlvwmrc file. In the distribution
directory (where you built mlvwm), you'll see a sample_rc
directory. Simply copy all these files over to the user directory,
then rename the mlvwmrc file. Let's continue with our friendly
user, natika:
<pre     class="programlisting">
cd /home/natika
cp /pathto/mlvwm091/sample_rc/* .
mv Mlvwmrc .mlvwmrc
</pre>


We are almost there. The default configuration file is a good place
to start, but you will want to edit the path to those pixmaps. Look
for the following line and change it to reflect the path of your
system icons (or the mini-icons you just installed):
<pre     class="programlisting">
IconPath /usr/local/include/X11/pixmaps:/home2/tak
/bin/pixmap
</pre>


Now, fire it up with <b  >xinit /usr/bin/X11/mlvwm</b>.
Figure 1 shows MLVWM in action. It is all coming back to you now,
eh, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>?
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="5760f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. MLVWM in Action
</p></div></div>


</p><p>For those who desperately need a dose of something
friendlier, there was always the Amiga. Did I say &ldquo;was&rdquo;?
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Mais non</em></span>, if not the Amiga itself, certainly
the spirit lives in Marcus Comstedt's AMIWM. Start by visiting his
web site and downloading the source. Then, as many times in the
past, we build <span   class="emphasis"><em>comme &ccedil;a</em></span>:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
tar -xzvf amiwm0.20pl48.tar.gz
cd amiwm0.20pl48
./configure
make
make install
</pre><p>Check the included README for configuration file options.
These runtime options come from either a local .amiwmrc file or the
global system.amiwmrc. By default, you will find the global file in
the /usr/local/lib/amiwm directory. Have a look at Figure 2 to see
the AMIWM desktop.
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="5760f2.large.jpg"><img src="5760f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div>


</p><p>Those desktop alternatives provide a means to experience the
tastes of the past. KDE and GNOME are the present. But what about
the future-uture-uture? Do any of you hear an echo? Anyhow, Niklas
Elmqvist, Robert Karlsson, Steve Houston, Antony Suter and others
are working on providing us a glimpse of the future. Enter 3Dwm, a
three-dimensional desktop that takes us out of window manager
flatland and transports us into a world of depth. In fact, the 3Dwm
team would like us to forget about the wm part of the name and
think of 3Dwm as an environment for developing three-dimensional
user interfaces rather than a window manager.</p><p>Have a look at Figure 3 for a sample of what is to come. Are
you ready to step into the third dimension? Let's go then.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="5760f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Desktops Enter the Third Dimension with 3Dwm
</p></div></div><p>Since this is a 3-D application, you'll need your Mesa or
OpenGL libraries. You'll need the expat libraries for the XML parts
of the project, and the SDL libraries also are required. Pay
attention to the release number of the SDL package (which you can
get at <a href="http://www.libsdl.org" target="_self">www.libsdl.org</a>).
It must be version 1.2 or better for this to work properly. This
seems like a lot just to get started, but luckily, most modern
Linux distributions will have all these things already
installed.</p><p>In order to build 3Dwm, you will need a few additional
things. The biggest of these is the OmniORB package from AT&amp;T's
UK Labs, the same people who brought you VNC (an excellent remote
control package). I will make a strange suggestion here. For the
most part, I have little trouble recommending source packages for
installs, but this is one place where it might make more sense to
pick up one of the binary packages. Since dependencies are
certainly a concern, those of you running an RPM-based system also
might consider grabbing the source RPM and rebuilding it for your
release and architecture. That is what I did. Then, I rebuilt a new
binary RPM package in this way:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
rpm --rebuild omniORB-3.0.4-0.src.rpm
</pre><p>This ticks along for quite some time. When it is complete,
you should have both a complete omniORB and omniORB-devel package
sitting in your build directory (which will vary from system to
system). On my Red Hat test system, the finished RPMs were in
/usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386. Debian users will find prebuilt packages
as well.
</p><p>You could continue with the 3Dwm build now and do this
process later, but let's start it now so that we don't forget.
Modify your /etc/profile to include the following lines:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
OMNIORB_CONFIG=/etc/onmiORB.cfg
OMNIORB_LOGDIR=/var/omninames
</pre><p>The omniORB.cfg file doesn't exist yet, so you must now
create it. Here's what you need there:
<pre     class="programlisting">
ORBInitialHost localhost
ORBInitialPort 8088
</pre>


Note that the &ldquo;localhost&rdquo; designation may not work depending on
your hostname configuration. Because I start my desktop as a host
within my domain, I had to use the fully qualified domain name
here. You may have to do the same. Now, start the omniNames server
like this:
<pre     class="programlisting">
omniNames --start 8088 &amp;
</pre>


On the dowload page for 3Dwm, you'll also find the source for
meshio, a library for loading the 3-D model files. Yes, there are
several pieces involved in this recipe, but the result will be
worth it, I assure you. It is time now to compile meshio. You'll be
happy to know that this is a quick process:
<pre     class="programlisting">
tar -xzvf meshio-0.2.0.tar.gz
cd meshio-0.2.0
make
make install
</pre>


Now, it's time to build 3Dwm itself. At the time of this writing,
the release level was 0.3.1, which technically still qualifies as
alpha software, but we Linux-types, we love to live on the edge
<span   class="emphasis"><em>non</em></span>? For the compile to go through properly,
you will need to set the PYTHONPATH variable:
<pre     class="programlisting">
export PYTHONPATH=/usr/lib/python2-1/site-packages
</pre>


And now, we build:
<pre     class="programlisting">
tar -xzvf 3dwm-0.3.1.tar.gz
cd 3dwm-0.3.1
./configure
make
</pre>


When this is all complete, copy the configuration file tdwmrc
(which you'll find under /etc in your build directory) to
~/.tdwmrc. Open it with your favorite text editor and make sure
that the path to the default.zorn is correct. Remember that this
will vary depending on the path to your install directory. Now,
start the display server:
<pre     class="programlisting">
cd server
./tdwm-server
</pre>


If everything went well, you should see a black display box appear
on your screen. That is success. This may not sound interesting,
but 3Dwm is a client-server application, and the 3-D client will
run in this window. To jump into your 3-D world, you must now run a
client. The 3Dwm site has a 3dwm-data.tar.gz file that you should
download. It contains some sample 3-D models and textures. All you
have to do is extract the file; there is no compiling to do here:
<pre     class="programlisting">
cd clients/geoclient
./geoclient office.3ds
</pre>


A three-dimentional representation of an office (complete with
desk, monitor, keyboard and mouse) will appear in the 3Dwm server
window. If it looks a bit strange, try navigating through it like
this.
</p><p>Moving around includes some combination of the keyboard Ctrl
key and mouse buttons. These combinations, by the way, are defined
in that default.zorn file I mentioned earlier. If you hold the Ctrl
key and click the left mouse button (while moving the mouse), you
change the orbit around the focal point. Pressing Ctrl and the
right mouse button zooms your focal point in or out. Ctrl and the
center mouse button pans your focal point. Ctrl, Shift and the left
button rotates left and right, while Ctrl, Shift and the right
button changes your field of view.</p><p>There are other clients besides the geoclient, but I'm going
to leave that exploration to you. Included with your 3Dwm package
is a 3-D virtual clock, and as you can see from our 3Dwm virtual
clock, the hour for closing time, she approaches once again,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>non</em></span>? Fran&ccedil;ois, if you would be so kind
as to refill our guests' glasses a final time. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Merci, mon
ami</em></span>.</p><p>Whether you find your ideal work environment in the desktops
of the past, the present or even the future, rest assured that when
you cook with Linux, interoperability isn't a fancy technological
catch phrase&mdash;it's the way we work each and every day.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>A votre sant&eacute;</em></span>! <span   class="emphasis"><em>Bon
