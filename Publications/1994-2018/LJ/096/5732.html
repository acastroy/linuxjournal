included, Perl is the scripting language of choice. Perl is nearly
ubiquitous, available for most operating systems in popular use
today. Thanks to the free availability of its source code, hundreds
of modules extending its capabilities have been developed. Quite
noteworthy among Perl modules is Tim Bunce's DBI (database
independent). The Perl DBI provides an API for interfacing with any
database, at least any database for which a corresponding DBD (yes,
database dependent) module is available.</p><p>A quick scan of Perl modules listed on
<a href="http://cpan.org" target="_self">cpan.org</a>, Perl HQ, shows DBD
modules for Informix, Oracle, Sybase, IBM's DB2 and many more.
Glaringly absent from this list is a DBD module for connecting to a
Microsoft SQL server. A DBD::ODBC module has been developed, but
using this requires a separate driver manager and suitable drivers.
To the best of my knowledge, these are only available for
Microsoft's SQL 2000 from third-party vendors, a solution that of
course brings the benefits of professional development and support.
As it turns out, there is another way.</p><p>Thanks to an arrangement with Sybase, Microsoft's SQL server
products were developed with the same network communications
protocol that Sybase used, namely Tabular Data Stream, or TDS.
Through the release of SQL 7.0, Microsoft officially supported
Sybase client software with a caveat that such support was at its
end. Thus the Perl DBD::Sybase module, compiled with Sybase's
freely downloadable client libraries, was able to connect to any
Microsoft SQL server until the release of SQL 2000.</p><p>With the introduction of TDS 8.0 and legacy support for TDS
7.0 in SQL 2000, compatibility with the Sybase client, using TDS
4.2, is broken. However, the DBD::Sybase module can be built with
the TDS libraries from
<a href="http://freetds.org" target="_self">freetds.org</a>, which does
support TDS version 7.0, and is used to connect to SQL 2000. Here's
how.</p><p>I have tested this on Red Hat Linux 7.1 and 7.2. Because this
project requires working with source code, you'll need a compiler.
GCC, the GNU C compiler, is very conveniently supplied with Red
Hat's Linux distribution. Perl and the DBI module are likewise
available in RPM form on Red Hat CDs.</p><p>First, download DBD-Sybase-0.94.tar.gz to a convenient
location on your machine. This is available at
<a href="http://cpan.org" target="_self">cpan.org</a> and also from the
author's download page at
<a href="http://www.mbay.net/~mpeppler" target="_self">www.mbay.net/~mpeppler</a>.
The FreeTDS source code is available on
<a href="http://www.freetds.org" target="_self">www.freetds.org</a>. Get
freetds-0.53.tgz, the latest revision as of this writing. I
strongly recommend reading all the helpful documentation available
on these respective sites.</p><p>Next, gunzip and untar these downloaded files, then
<b  >cd</b> to the newly created freetds-0.53 directory
and run <b  >./configure --with-tdsver=7.0</b>, which
writes a Makefile suitable for compiling FreeTDS on your machine
and specifies tds 7.0 as the default protocol.</p><p>Now run <b  >make</b>:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
make
Making all in include
make[1]: Entering directory
         `/home/atrice/freetds-0.53/include'
Making tds_configs.h
</pre><p>and so forth.
</p><p>Then run <b  >make install</b> to install your
freshly compiled FreeTDS. By default, it installs to
/usr/local/freetds, though you can change this when running
configure with the -prefix=(PATH) switch. You must be root to
install:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
make install
Making install in include
make[1]: Entering directory
         `/home/atrice/freetds-0.53/include'
make[2]: Entering directory
         `/home/atrice/freetds-0.53/include'
</pre><p>and so on. The final comments from <b  >make
install</b> will be something like:
<pre     class="programlisting">
if [ -f /usr/local/freetds/etc/freetds.conf ]; \
then :; \
else \
/usr/bin/install -c -m 644 freetds.conf
/usr/local/freetds/etc/freetds.conf;
\
fi
make[2]: Leaving directory `/home/atrice/freetds-0.53'
make[1]: Leaving directory `/home/atrice/freetds-0.53'
</pre>


You have now compiled and installed FreeTDS.
</p><p>Next, we perform a very similar set of commands to configure
and build the DBD:Sybase module. First, however (very important),
we must set up an environment variable called SYBASE. This variable
will be set to the path of the FreeTDS installation. I am using the
bash shell:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
export SYBASE=/usr/local/freetds
</pre><p>Confirm the proper setting of the variable:
<pre     class="programlisting">
echo $SYBASE
/usr/local/freetds
</pre>


Then <b  >cd</b> into the DBD-Sybase directory and run
Makefile.PL:
<pre     class="programlisting">
perl Makefile.PL
Sybase OpenClient found.
The DBD::Sybase module needs access to a Sybase server
  to run the tests.
To clear an entry please enter 'undef'
Sybase server to use (default: undef):
User ID to log in to Sybase (default: sa):
Password (default: undef):
Note (probably harmless): No library found for -lcs
Note (probably harmless): No library found for -lsybtcl
Note (probably harmless): No library found for -lcomn
Note (probably harmless): No library found for -lintl
Using DBI 1.20 installed in
  /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.6.0/i386-linux/auto/DBI
Writing Makefile for DBD::Sybase
</pre>


Notice that the Makefile.PL script asks you for information about
your Sybase server. It uses this information to write a file called
PWD that is used by the test utilities provided with the module.
These were designed to run against a Sybase server, not Microsoft,
and I did not have much success with the tests. The messages
regarding the libraries not found are due to compiling DBD::Sybase
with the FreeTDS libraries instead of Sybase's.
</p><p>Run <b  >make</b>, then <b  >make
install</b>. The last few messages from make install should
read as follows:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Installing /usr/share/man/man3/DBD::Sybase.3
Writing /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.6.0/i386-linux/
auto/DBD/Sybase/.packlist
Appending installation info to /usr/lib/perl5/5.6.0/
i386-linux/perllocal.pod
</pre><p>You are done installing DBD::Sybase. Next we'll configure
FreeTDS to talk to your SQL 2000 database.
</p><p>FreeTDS has a configuration file quite logically called
freetds.conf. It resides in the freetds installation directory
under /etc, so in my case the full path is
/usr/local/freetds/etc/freetds.conf. There is a sample Microsoft
server configuration already present in this file, and you only
need modify it to reflect your server's information. Mine looks
like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# A typical Microsoft SQL Server 7.0 configuration
[file1]
        host = file1
        port = 1433
        tds version = 7.0
</pre><p>My SQL server is called file1; it runs its database service
on the default port of 1433, and I have specified the tds version
7.0. There is a global configuration section in the beginning of
this file where you also can set the tds version. Make sure your
client machine can resolve the hostname of your database server, or
simply use its IP address.
</p><p>Now we're ready to attempt a connection. Listing 1 is a Perl
script written by my colleague Trevor Price that queries the sample
database called Northwind. This database is included with a typical
SQL 2000 installation. It makes use of a stored procedure called
sp_help, which returns information about all the tables in that
database. Copy this code into a file called something like
testsql.pl, then edit $user and $password to reflect a database
account with access to your server.</p><p><a href="5732l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1. Trevor Price's Perl
Script that Queries the Sample Database Called
Northwind</a></p><p>Run the script and you should get an output looking like
this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
perl testsql.pl

Invoices        dbo     view
Order Details Extended  dbo     view
</pre><p>If you've gotten this far, congratulations! I hope you find
this as helpful as we have.
