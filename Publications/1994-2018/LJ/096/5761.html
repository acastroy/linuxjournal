Lerner</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #96, April 2002</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x185a580.0x1952348"></a></h2></div></div><p>Last month, we continued our discussion
of the Zope web development environment by installing and examining
Zope products. As we saw, each product is actually a Python object
module that can be instantiated one or more times on a Zope server.
Hundreds of products are available for Zope, ranging from a small
and lightweight fortune-teller to the large and impressive content
management framework (CMF).</p><p>Many Zope administrators are content to install and use the
products that they can download from the Web. And indeed, there are
enough products to satisfy most basic sites; whatever you cannot do
with an existing product is often simple enough to create in DTML,
Zope's Dynamic Template Markup Language (described in the February
2002 issue of <i  >LJ</i>).</p><p>But as easy and straightforward as it may be to do many tasks
in DTML, it is neither as complete nor as flexible as Python. And
while the addition of PythonScripts (and PerlScripts!) in Zope has
certainly reduced the need to write products for many medium-sized
tasks, most Zope hackers eventually find themselves writing a
product of some sort.</p><p>This month, we look at how to build a simple Zope product
that we can then integrate into our site. As you will see, it is
quite easy to create a Zope product that integrates well into the
rest of this environment.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x185a580.0x19525b0"></a>A Trivially Simple Product</h2></div></div><p>At its core, a Zope product is a Python module. The product
(as we saw last month) is installed into the lib/python/Products
directory under the main Zope directory. Zope looks for products
when it is started (or restarted), which means that you must start
or restart Zope after installing a new product.</p><p>We can instantiate an installed product as many times as we
like, placing each instance somewhere in the web hierarchy. Each
instance has a unique &ldquo;id&rdquo; attribute that both uniquely
identifies it within a folder and allows us to invoke methods on
the object.</p><p>If this already sounds confusing, remember that the URL
/foo/bar normally means that a web server should retrieve the file
&ldquo;bar&rdquo; within the directory &ldquo;foo&rdquo;. But in Zope, the URL foo/bar
means that the system should invoke the method &ldquo;bar&rdquo; on the
object &ldquo;foo&rdquo;. In other words, foo/bar gets turned into foo.bar.
And when we say &ldquo;the object foo&rdquo;, we really mean to say, &ldquo;the
object whose ID is foo&rdquo;. Setting the ID is essential if we are
going to invoke methods on our object successfully.</p><p>We also will need to define a meta_type for our product. The
meta_type name is the text string that will appear in the Add
pull-down list of Zope products in the upper-right corner of the
/manage screen. In general, you can name the meta_type the same as
your class or perhaps something a bit easier to understand.
Remember that items in the Add menu are displayed in ASCII order,
which means that capital &ldquo;Z&rdquo; comes before lowercase &ldquo;a&rdquo;.</p><p>To create our own product, we need to do the
following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Define a class in its own module and install it in
lib/python/Products.</p></li><li><p>Define an __init__ method in which we assign the
&ldquo;id&rdquo; instance variable a value.</p></li><li><p>Define one or more methods whose return value is a
text string containing HTML.</p></li><li><p>Define a meta_type class variable, which sets the
meta_type for all instances of our product.</p></li></ul></div><p>This turns out to be surprisingly simple to do, as you can
see in Listing 1, which defines helloworld.py, a simple Zope
product that you can install and almost instantiate in your site.
(We'll soon see how to get around these limitations.)</p><p><a href="5761l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1. helloworld.py, a Simple
Zope Product</a></p><p>There are several important items to notice in our helloworld
class. For starters, the class and its methods contain
documentation strings. It's always a good idea to write docstrings,
and Python's inclusion of such a feature is a rare and refreshing
reminder that programmers can and should include documentation
along with the source code. Zope enforces this restriction by
mandating that classes and methods must include docstrings if you
want them to be used in the system.</p><p>Our class also defines two methods, __init__ and index_html.
The __init__ method is invoked automatically by Zope when it
creates an instance of our object and typically is used to
initialize instance variables and define other behaviors that will
be needed later on. In this particular case, __init__ defines a
single instance variable (self.id) that allows our object to keep
track of its identity. As you might expect, __init__ is not meant
to be invoked from the outside world, but rather from within Zope
itself.</p><p>The index_html method, by contrast, is designed to be invoked
via a URL. If we place an instance of &ldquo;helloworld&rdquo; in the root
(/) directory of our Zope server, we can invoke the index_html
method on it with a URL of /helloworld/index_html. But index_html
is special; like the index.html file on many Apache servers, it is
invoked by default if no other method is named explicitly.</p><p>Finally, notice that index_html returns HTML to its caller.
It does not return a status code or anything other than the
HTML.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x185a580.0x1952d98"></a>What's Missing?</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>helloworld.py</b></span> is a perfectly
legal Zope product; we can install it in lib/python/Products, and
Zope will not mind. Unfortunately, Zope also will fail to notice
that helloworld.py is there at all, will not add it to the Add
selection list and generally will ignore the work we did in writing
our product. It's clear that we will need to beef up our skeletal
product if we want it to interact with Zope. We will call this
enhanced version the &ldquo;smallhello&rdquo; product.</p><p>For starters, we must change the structure of our product
from a single standalone module file (helloworld.py) into a
full-fledged Python package. A package is a directory (smallhello)
within the Python search path (defined by the variable sys.path)
containing one or more Python source files. In our case, the
smallhello directory will contain two files: a smallhello.py file
that is quite similar to helloworld.py (see Listing 2) and
__init__.py (see Listing 3), which initializes and helps to
register our object.</p><p><a href="5761l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2.
smallhello/smallhello.py</a></p><p><a href="5761l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3.
smallhello/__init__.py</a></p><p>The __init__.py file first imports smallhello.smallhello,
defining the module's methods and attributes. But the crucial part
of __init__.py, at least as far as Zope is concerned, is the
initialize method. After Zope discovers and imports smallhello, it
invokes smallhello.initialize, passing it a ProductContext object
(called &ldquo;context&rdquo;). In other words, initializing an object
results in that object registering itself with the server.</p><p>The initialize routine itself is pretty straightforward,
although our version does some rudimentary error trapping (using
try/except) to ensure that things work correctly. Our smallhello
product only passes two arguments to context.registerClass: the
finalhello.finalhello object that we want to add and then a tuple
of constructors that should be invoked when we want to create a new
instance of our product. Remember to include a trailing comma if
you pass a single item to constructors; otherwise, Zope will fail
to load the product.</p><p>The constructors parameter is just one of a number of named
parameters that we can pass to context.registerClass to customize
the way in which our object is registered with Zope. For example,
we also can pass an icon parameter that tells Zope which graphic (a
filename inside of our package directory) should be placed next to
instances of our package within Zope.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x185a580.0x19531b8"></a>Changes to Our Object</h2></div></div><p>Turning helloworld.py into smallhello.py (see Listing 2)
requires some small changes. We start by adding a method that
allows Zope to create new instances of our product. By convention,
such management-related methods begin with manage_, so our method
is called manage_smallhello. This is the same method that was named
in the constructors tuple passed to context.registerClass.</p><p>The most significant change to our smallhello class is also
one of the least obvious: we have made it a subclass of
OFS.SimpleItem.SimpleItem, one of the Zope product base classes
provided as part of the Zope package (in the OFS.SimpleItem
package). Without inheriting from SimpleItem, many things&mdash;from
cutting and pasting of objects to acquisition&mdash;would fail to work
as we expect, if at all. There are several possible base classes
from which your products can inherit; SimpleItem, as its name
implies, is designed to be the simplest and most straightforward of
the bunch.</p><p>While modifying smallhello.py, I decided to add two other
methods that produce content. One of them, other_html, produces
output that is similar to index_html&mdash;except, of course, index_html
is displayed by default when no other method is specified, while
other_html only is called when explicitly named in the URL.</p><p>I also added a foo_file method that demonstrates how to
return the contents of an HTML (or DTML) file from disk. It can be
annoying and frustrating to put all of your HTML inside a Python
module file; this way, you can keep the DTML files inside of the
package directory but modify them independently of the program
itself. Note that we had to import the HTMLFile method from the
Globals package in order for this to work.</p><p>I modified the __init__ function in smallhello.py to take
three arguments: self, id and title. (Previously, it only accepted
self and id.) The __init__ function is invoked each time a new
instance of smallhello.py is created, which is done through a call
to manage_smallhello. Inside of manage_smallhello, our call to
self._setObject sets the object ID to a generic smallhello_id, with
a title of smallhello_title. Because we hard code the ID in our
example, and because IDs must be unique within a folder, this means
that we only can have one instance of our smallhello product in a
given folder. There isn't enough space here to describe how to read
and write parameters, but a quick look at the examples mentioned in
the Resources section should make it obvious how to do this.</p><p>After the call to self._setObject, manage_smallhello then
redirects the user's browser to the main (index_html) method. We
could display some output instead, redirecting the user's browser
to another method in our object, but I took the easy way out and
decided to send users to /index.html on our site.</p><p>After you have installed the smallhello product, you can stop
Zope and restart it again. You should see &ldquo;smallhello&rdquo; near the
bottom of the Add menu; selecting it will send you to the
index.html page on your Zope site. Because we haven't made our
product as user-friendly as it could be, you will have to enter the
URL manually (index_html, other_html or foo_file) in your browser.
But there isn't any reason why these pages cannot contain links to
each other or why other pages on the site cannot link to
them.</p><p>What do you know? We've created a Zope product!</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x185a580.0x1953528"></a>What's Missing Now?</h2></div></div><p>If we were to release our simplehello project as it currently
stands, no one would really want to use it. In addition to the
problems mentioned above (e.g., the lack of unique ids for
individual instances), our product lacks the management tabs that
make Zope so user-friendly for administrators. It also fails to
handle security permissions in a standard or easy way.</p><p>It is almost as easy to install these features as the others
we have seen so far. For example, each tab is represented by a
dictionary containing two name-value pairs, label and action. The
value associated with label is what the user sees on the screen,
while the value associated with action tells Zope which method
should be invoked when someone clicks on the appropriate tab. To
install your tabs in Zope, define a manage_options tuple in your
object, the members of which are the dictionaries describing the
tabs.</p><p>One of the most important items that we haven't addressed so
far is user input. This is actually a pretty easy issue to address
because Zope treats HTML form inputs as if they were standard
parameters to a method. For example, consider the following HTML
form:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;form action="manage_edit" method="POST"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;id: &lt;input type="text"
name="id"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Title: &lt;input type="text"
name="title"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;input type="submit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</pre><p>Clicking on the &ldquo;submit&rdquo; button will submit the name-value
pairs for id and title to our product's manage_edit method. We can
define that method with a signature like the following:
<pre     class="programlisting">
def manage_edit(self, id, title):
</pre>


Within this method, we can retrieve the values of the id and title
HTML form elements using the variables of the same names.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x185a580.0x19537e8"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>Zope products are a more advanced and sophisticated way to
build Zope applications than DTML files, giving greater flexibility
but also requiring greater discipline and understanding of the
underlying mechanisms. Knowing how to write Zope products is
something like knowing how to write mod_perl modules for Apache; it
means that the underlying system is completely at your
disposal.</p><p>Unfortunately, while programmers can take advantage of a rich
API for creating their own Zope products, the lack of good
introductory documentation has scared many people from trying. Our
simplehello product demonstrates that with just a little code, you
can get impressive and useful applications working in a short
period of time.</p><p><a href="5761s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
