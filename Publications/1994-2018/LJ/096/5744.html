    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25a0580.0x26985b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>The Internet is great. But, connecting a
computer&mdash;or a computer network&mdash;directly to a broadband access
device, like a cable modem or DSL router, is asking for trouble.
Crackers prey on small-office or home computer users. Indeed, a
friend's computer was cracked less than a day after it was
connected to his new cable modem last September. When I heard, I
immediately advised my friend to purchase a hardware firewall.
That's my advice for you, too. If you're not using some sort of
firewall, it's only a matter of time before a cracker finds you.
You need protection, and with due respect to my programmer friends,
the best simple protection is a hardware firewall.</p><p>That's where SnapGear's Lite firewall appliance comes in. It
plugs in to your broadband access device and your computer (or your
home or office network), then plugs in to the Lite box. I didn't
know about this particular device when my friend had those problems
last fall, but had I known about the Lite, I would have told my
friend about it.</p><p>The Lite appliance has two additional benefits beyond the
anti-cracker firewall: network address translation (NAT) and a
virtual private network (VPN) client.</p><p>Network address translation lets you put more than one
computer onto the Internet. Normally, you need one public IP
(Internet Protocol) address for each computer, like 123.45.67.89 or
65.11.11.11. That number, which is analogous to a telephone number,
is assigned by your internet service provider. When you use NAT,
one device (in this case the Lite box) is assigned the public IP
address, and it acts as the IP gateway. Meanwhile, computers on
your home or business LAN have private IP addresses that are for
use only on the LAN. Those private IP addresses are generally in
the range of 192.168.x.x or 10.x.x.x, which are reserved for that
purpose.</p><p>Let's say one of your computers, with a private IP address of
192.168.0.14, wants to check a web site. It asks the Lite, as the
internet gateway, to get the information. The Lite translates the
request to make it look like it came from 123.45.67.89 and forwards
it to the web site. The web site responds to 123.45.67.89&mdash;that is,
to the Lite. The Lite box then retranslates the request back to
192.168.0.14 and puts the packets onto your private LAN, so that
your PC can receive the data and display the web page. With the
Lite, the network address functionality works very well; you can
put as many computers onto a single internet connection as you'd
like, without an arbitrary limit.</p><p>Virtual private networking uses authentication and encryption
to provide a secure link between two computer networks over the
public internet. VPNs often are used to give telecommuters or
branch offices direct access to a large corporate network, without
exposing that network to crackers. Think of it as a secured tunnel
between two buildings. To set up that tunnel, you need VPN
functionality at both ends; one end acts as the host or server, and
the other as a client that logs in to the VPN server.</p><p>VPN clients can be either in software, which enables a single
computer to use the VPN, or in a hardware access device, so that it
can bridge two networks and all the computers on those networks.
The SnapGear Lite is a hardware-based VPN client, which can not
only log in to most corporate networks using the IPSec protocol
(which is the most common), but it also can emulate Microsoft's own
PPTP (Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol), which is the
software-based VPN system built into Windows servers and Windows
workstations. The Lite thus lets you use non-Windows PCs, such as
Linux workstations or servers, to access a Microsoft-based VPN.
That's an important benefit, if your employer uses Windows NT/2000
to host remote access.</p><p>Before we look at the Lite in detail, it's important to point
out that none of these basic features&mdash;a hardware firewall, network
address translation or a VPN client&mdash;is new. I've been using a
similar hardware appliance from SonicWall for more than two years,
and with the exception of the PPTP client, it's nearly identical.
At least half a dozen other companies also make devices like this.
What makes the Lite noteworthy is its driver support for Linux and
its low price, which at $249 is a few hundred dollars less than
other similar devices that I've used.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25a0580.0x2698920"></a>The Lite in Detail</h2></div></div><p>About the size of an external Iomega Zip drive, the SnapGear
Lite is a small box with a few LEDs, a jack for an AC adaptor and
two RJ-45 connectors, one a 10Mbps Ethernet jack for hooking to
your DSL or cable modem, the other a 10/100 Mbps Fast Ethernet jack
for hooking up directly to a PC's network card or to your LAN
switch or hub. The necessary cables are included.</p><p>The Lite also has an RS-232 serial port for configuring the
Lite to work with a regular telephone modem. I didn't test the
serial-port modem connection but rather used the device with my
cable modem, in place of the SonicWall firewall appliance mentioned
above, for about three weeks. On the LAN side, the Lite was hooked
into a Linksys 16-port 10/100 Ethernet switch, which generally had
between three and ten active computers at any time.</p><p>Also, as a matter of interest to <i  >Linux Journal</i> readers, the Lite uses Linux internally,
embedded into a 66MHz Motorola ColdFire XFC5272 microprocessor. A
recent firmware upgrade, which came out during our review, gave the
device the 2.4 kernel. Bear in mind that the Linux kernel is hidden
in the device; you won't ever see or work with it directly.</p><p>Initial setup was simplicity itself; all you have to do is
run a setup program on a local PC, which tracks down the Lite on
the network and configures its private IP address (in my case,
192.168.0.14) and related information. That only has to be done
once. Then, you browse to that IP address via Netscape or Opera,
for example, and use that to configure the public IP address (so
you can have internet connectivity) and then set up the firewall
and VPN options.</p><p>The good news is that the Lite has a configuration program
for Linux. The bad news is that it's not included on the CD-ROM
that ships with the box&mdash;it only has the Windows version of the
client. That's naughty and is a rather needless extra step for
Linux users, considering that the compact disk only has 14.8MB of
stuff on it. Be sure to download the Linux package from
<a href="http://www.snapgear.com/downloads.html" target="_self">www.snapgear.com/downloads.html</a>
before you start tearing your network apart.</p><p>Setting up the Lite to provide network address translation
and to use the proper public IP address was also straightforward
using Netscape; my cable modem has a static IP address, issued by
the ISP. In some cases those ISP IP addresses are issued
automatically and dynamically, and according to the Lite's
documentation, it can accommodate that type of network.</p><p>The Lite also can act as a DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration
Protocol), where Lite can assign private IP addresses automatically
to the computers on your networks. I didn't use this setting, as my
computers already had fixed IP addresses. Business networks
wouldn't need that feature, as they likely would use fixed IP
addresses or have a separate DHCP server, but this will be a useful
feature for small-office or home networks.</p><p>One of the resources on my network is a web server. If you
are expecting incoming traffic from the Internet, you have to
configure the firewall to pass the appropriate type of data packets
from the Internet to the appropriate private IP address, and thus
to the right computer on your LAN. It was easy to redirect traffic
on IP port 80 (HTTP) and port 23 (FTP) to my web server. The
firewall appeared to do a good job of filtering bad packets; from
outside my network, I launched Sub-Seven and Ping-of-Death attacks
against the firewall and also attempted a port scan, and it blocked
those attempts. Those are common crack attempts made against
cable-modem users, and the firewall worked admirably.</p><p>My only reservation with the SnapGear Lite firewall is that
it is not certified by a major firewall tester. Every other
firewall I've tested, including SonicWall SOHO+, WatchGuard's
Firebox and Check Point's best-selling (but expensive) Firewall-1
are certified by ICSA Labs
(<a href="http://www.icsalabs.com" target="_self">www.icsalabs.com</a>),
which puts firewalls through a pounding with a well-established and
industry-standard test suite. The Lite isn't certified, and
SnapGear doesn't even mention ICSA on its web site. However,
according to a company spokesperson, SnapGear began working toward
certification in January 2002 and hopes to have achieved it by the
end of the second quarter.</p><p>The final tests involved making two virtual private network
connections over the Internet. The first was to a Check Point VPN-1
device, which was configured for IPSec-based access. The second was
a PPTP-based link to a Windows 2000 server. I had no trouble making
either connection, though I would judge the process somewhat
complex.</p><p>Someone with experience and good understanding of VPNs should
have no trouble making it work. Someone without that experience
will find the sketchy documentation (a 12-page booklet and a
73-page PDF electronic manual, with 20 pages devoted to VPNs)
confusing and likely will need assistance from SnapGear or a
knowledgeable system administrator. Once the VPN is set up,
however, it appears to be reliable and sufficient for a typical
small-office or home computer user. By the way, there is also an
ICSA certification for IPSec compatibility that most major VPN
product manufacturers use and promote; the Lite doesn't have that
either.</p><p>So, here's the bottom line. If you're looking for hardware
protection for your internet connection, the Lite is inexpensive
and relatively easy to use. It also has the VPN functionality, and
as far as I can tell, is unique in acting as a PPTP client, which
is a real plus for Linux users. On the other hand, the firewall is
not yet certified and the VPN functions aren't easy to set up. If
you're okay with that, it's a good solution and certainly worth the
price.</p><p><a href="5744s1.html" target="_self">Product Information/The Good/The
