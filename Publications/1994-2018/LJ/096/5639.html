    Use a low-cost, scalable Linux server to share CD-ROM image
    files to Windows clients.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2243580.0x233b660"></a></h2></div></div><p>This article describes how to set up a
virtual CD-ROM jukebox (VCDJ) using Samba and Linux. A VCDJ is a
network server that provides access to the contents of a large
number of CD-ROM disks, without the need for more than one CD-ROM
drive. In addition, it simultaneously provides access to the ISO
9660 CD-ROM images in a format suitable for burning copies of the
CD-ROMs using a CD-RW drive.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2243580.0x233b768"></a>Why Would You Want This?</h2></div></div><p>A CD-ROM jukebox is usually a file server (or file server
appliance) connected to a CD-ROM drive tower. It is able to share
(often via SMB/Windows Networking) the contents of a number of
CD-ROMs to clients on the network. It's valuable because users of
the network do not have to locate a particular CD-ROM physically
when they wish to install software or access data.</p><p>However, this approach suffers from some drawbacks. The
number of CD-ROMs it can serve is limited to the number of CD-ROM
drives in its tower(s). To add more CD-ROMs, more drives must be
obtained and installed. The CD-ROMs must be in the drives at all
times, making them unavailable for other purposes. Also, there is
no easy way to make copies of the CD-ROMs (especially bootable
copies) without removing them from the server, which makes them
unavailable for network users.</p><p>A VCDJ surmounts all of these limitations. It is different
from a regular file server because, while a regular file server
might contain the contents of a number of CD-ROMs, the VCDJ
contains an ISO 9660 image of the CD-ROMs. When we're done, it will
serve both the images and the contents of the images efficiently
(on a file-by-file basis) at the same time. Additionally, the
original CD-ROM disks can be stored away where they won't get
lost.</p><p>Whereas traditional CD-ROM servers are limited by the amount
of CD-ROM drives they contain, the VCDJ is limited by the amount of
disk space it contains. Hard drives are an order of magnitude
cheaper than CD-ROM towers, and they scale better. One 40GB hard
drive occupies one spot on an IDE or SCSI controller. It can
contain the equivalent of 57 full-sized CD-ROMs (at 700MB each). We
would need 57 CD-ROM drives attached to the server to get the
equivalent functionality, which is a practical
impossibility.</p><p>At my place of work, we have found the VCDJ invaluable for
publishing the contents of regularly updated software
subscriptions. We used to lose track of CD-ROM disks as we loaned
them out to others; now we just give them access via their Windows
Domain credentials. And, we easily can burn new copies of any
bootable CD-ROMs we need. The original disks remain locked
away.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2243580.0x233b9d0"></a>The Pieces</h2></div></div><p>To create our VCDJ, we'll need the following pieces:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>One CD-ROM drive in a computer running a recent
version of Linux. The drive will be used to create ISO 9660 CD-ROM
images. (ISO 9660 is the format of the filesystem usually used on
CD-ROM disks. So we refer to a soft copy of a CD-ROM disk as an ISO
9660 image.)</p></li><li><p>Enough hard drive space to hold all of the CD-ROM
images we want to serve.</p></li><li><p>A loopback device, to allow access to the files
contained within the ISO 9660 images.</p></li><li><p>The automounter, to mount the ISO 9660 CD-ROM
images automatically.</p></li><li><p>Samba set up to serve network shares.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2243580.0x233bea0"></a>Make ISO 9660 Images of the CD-ROMs</h2></div></div><p>The first task is to obtain the ISO 9660 images of the CD-ROM
disks. Any tool you can use to, say, make duplicates of CD-ROMs can
generate proper images. You also can download ISO images of your
favorite Linux distribution.</p><p>On Linux, the simplest way to make an image is with
<span   class="bold"><b>cat</b></span>. Put the desired CD-ROM disk
into the CD-ROM drive. Make sure the directory /mnt/images/ exists.
If your CD-ROM disk block device is hdc, the image is created like
this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cat /dev/hdc &gt; /mnt/images/image1.iso
</pre><p>You'll want to give the image file a more descriptive name.
Reading the image may take awhile. Repeat this process for each
CD-ROM disk of which you want an image.
</p><p>Now that we have the CD-ROM images, we'd like to access the
contents of the images. The normal method for accessing the
contents of the image is to use a loopback device, like
this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
mount -t iso9660 -o loop,ro /mnt/images/image1.iso
        /mnt/isosrv/image1/
</pre><p>This mount command says that we are going to mount some data
that uses the ISO 9660 filesystem format. It also says to use the
loopback device. The loopback device is a nifty kernel feature that
allows you to designate a file, in this case
/mnt/images/image1.iso, to be used as if it were a character
device, like a hard disk or CD-ROM drive. This command mounts the
image file in a read-only format. The contents of the CD-ROM image
can be seen in /mnt/isosrv/image1/.
</p><p><a href="5639s1.html" target="_self">How Do We Know That the Image Is
Correct?</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2243580.0x233c2c0"></a>Configure the Automounter</h2></div></div><p>If our VCDJ has a lot of ISO 9660 images, it won't be
possible to mount all of them statically. The next step is to
configure the automounter. The automounter will mount an ISO 9660
image only when it is accessed. It will unmount it after a time of
inactivity. We need this because there is a limit to how many
filesystems can be mounted via the loopback device at one time.
It's unlikely that all of the CD-ROMs will be in use
simultaneously, so it's the automounter to our rescue. (See &ldquo;Tux
Knows It's Nice to Share, Part 4&rdquo; by Marcel Gagn&eacute; at
<a href="../000/5298.html" target="_self">/article/5298</a>
for instructions to install and initially set up the
automounter.)</p><p>First, edit /etc/auto.master, and append to it the following
line:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/mnt/isosrv_auto   /etc/auto.isosrv    --timeout=60
</pre><p>Make sure the directory /mnt/isosrv_auto exists. Restart the
automounter for this change to take effect.
</p><p>Create the file /etc/auto.isosrv, and append to it the
following line:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
image1  -fstype=iso9660,ro,loop :/mnt/images/image1.iso
</pre><p>Create a similar line for every ISO 9660 CD-ROM image that is
to be automounted.
</p><p>If you mount on your VCDJ, you should see a line like
this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
automount(pid782) on /mnt/isosrv_auto type autofs
(rw,fd=5,pgrp=782,minproto=2,maxproto=3)
</pre><p>(The various numeric values will likely be different on your
system.)
</p><p>The automounter does <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> have to be
restarted when changes are made to /etc/auto.isosrv. So far we've
told the automounter that when some process tries to access a file
or directory somewhere in /mnt/isosrv_auto/image1/, it will mount
image1.iso. After a period of time of no access to the directory,
the image will be unmounted.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2243580.0x233c7e8"></a>Laying Out the Filesystem</h2></div></div><p>There's one last problem. List the contents of
/mnt/isosrv_auto/</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ls /mnt/isosrv_auto/
</pre><p>If nothing has accessed the contents of the CD-ROM image
recently, this directory will appear to be empty.
</p><p>If you explicitly list the contents of the CD-ROM,</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ls /mnt/isosrv_auto/image1/
</pre><p>you will see the contents. Now go back and list the contents
of /mnt/isosrv_auto/ again, and you will see image1. Eventually,
the automounter will unmount the image, and once again the
directory will be empty.
</p><p>This is a problem because it means the users will have to
know the names of all the CD-ROMs that they want to access.
Directory browsing won't work, which is clearly not
acceptable.</p><p>The solution is to create another directory called
/mnt/isosrv/. Enter that directory and perform the following
commands:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
mkdir image1
cd image1
ln -s ../../isosrv_auto/image1 disc
</pre><p>Repeat this for every ISO 9660 CD-ROM image.
</p><p>Listing the contents of /mnt/isosrv/ will show all the
available images, regardless of whether the automounter has mounted
them.</p><p><a href="5639s2.html" target="_self">Further Explanation of the
Filesystem Layout</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2243580.0x23335a0"></a>Configure Samba</h2></div></div><p>See &ldquo;Tux Knows It's Nice to Share, Part 5&rdquo; by Marcel
Gagn&eacute;
(<a href="../000/5297.html" target="_self">/article/5297</a>)
for instructions on installation and initial setup of Samba. Be
sure that you have authentication set up to protect the CD-ROM
contents properly, according to their licensing agreements. (Not a
problem if everything is open source!)</p><p>Recall that one goal is to provide access to the ISO 9660
images and their contents simultaneously via Samba. To do this,
edit /etc/smb.conf (or maybe /etc/samba/smb.conf), and append the
following lines:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
[isoimages]
        comment = ISO9660 CD ROM images
        path = /mnt/images/
[cdroms]
        comment = Contents of CD ROMs
        path = /mnt/isosrv/
</pre><p>Restart Samba. Now go to a Windows client (or any other
computer that can be an SMB client) and browse your VCDJ. You
should see two new shares: isoimages and cdroms. In the isoimages
share are all the ISO 9660 images, and in the cdroms share are the
contents of the images. Browse the contents of the directory image1
in the cdroms share. If you <b  >mount</b> on your VCDJ,
you should see a line like this:
<pre     class="programlisting">
/mnt/images/image1.iso on /mnt/isosrv_auto/image1
        type iso9660 (ro,loop=/dev/loop0)
</pre>


</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2243580.0x23338b8"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>Figure 1 shows a diagram of the order of things when a
network client accesses data in the cdroms share. Note that if the
client accessed an ISO 9660 image directly, the Samba process would
directly read from /mnt/images/, bypassing all symlinks and the
automounter.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="5639f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Network Client Accesses Data in the cdroms Share
</p></div></div><p>As you add more ISO 9660 images, you'll come to appreciate
the value of a VCDJ. You're only limited by available disk space,
and the cost and degree of effort to add more capacity is much less
than trying to add more physical CD-ROM drives. Now you can make
all your CD-ROMs available across your enterprise, whether in your
office or in your home, and you'll never have to worry about people
not returning borrowed CD-ROM disks.</p></div></div>
