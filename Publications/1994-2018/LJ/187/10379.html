AMQP is an open standard for enterprise messaging, designed to support messaging for almost any distributed
or business application.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c43580.0x1d3b250"></a></h2></div></div><p>
What if, using a single service call, you easily could ask a computing
cloud to give you the readings from thermometers in 100 different
locations? Or, perhaps you'd like to know the status of the 89 servers
under your control. In the past, you might have accomplished
those things by writing a server d&aelig;mon. Your d&aelig;mon might have managed each
of hundreds of connections, conducting specific operations on each
connection. However, with the advent of AMQP and the Apache Qpid Project,
it's possible to concentrate on the data processing and let another
program handle the messaging.
</p><p>
AMQP is an innovative open messaging protocol. Created by John O'Hara and
others at JPMorgan to replace proprietary products, the AMQ protocol
defines both the wire-level formats and the behavior of messaging
server and client software. Using the above example, you could send a
single message to the AMQP server with a topic such as server_stats
or thermometer_readings. The AMQP server listens for messages with
those topics and routes the messages to the applications connected to
the AMQP server.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c43580.0x1d3b460"></a>
A Bit of History</h2></div></div><p>
AMQP began in 2003 with John O'Hara at JPMorgan-Chase. O'Hara
was looking for a messaging solution that provided high durability,
extremely high volume and a high degree of interoperability. In the
types of environments addressed with AMQP, there is an economic impact if
a message is lost, arrives late or is processed improperly. With volumes
greater than 500,000 messages per second, the requirements were high.
The commercial products that were available at the time could not deliver
the level of service required, and banks were known to develop their
own enterprise middleware to fill in the gaps. However, developing
enterprise middleware is complex and difficult, and bank middleware
would come and go.
</p><p>
As he reflected on other highly successful protocols, such as Ethernet,
TCP/IP and HTTP, O'Hara noted several similarities. Namely, each
protocol was royalty-free and not encumbered by patents. Furthermore,
the protocols had a strong specification created by an independent body.
Freely available implementations of the protocol specifications allowed
developers to pick them up and find interesting uses for them quickly.
Strong governance and user-driven design made these protocols a technical
and economic success.
</p><p>
With AMQP, O'Hara wanted to have a freely available implementation
of the AMQ protocol in use in a mission-critical place at JPMorgan.
With this goal in mind, he contracted with the iMatix Corporation to
create the first implementation, OpenAMQ. This implementation then
was put into production in a trading application with more than 2,000 users.
</p><p>
Today, many companies collaborate on AMQ. Several
brokers are available, including RabbitMQ, OpenAMQ and Apache Qpid (also
known as Red Hat MRG Messaging). In this article, I describe
the Apache Qpid server. Up for discussion is the Qpid M4 release,
and you can download it via the link in the Resources for this article. I also demonstrate
how to compile and install the C++ version of the server and write
example applications in Python.

Anatomy of a Server</h2></div></div><p>
Figure 1 depicts the anatomy of a Qpid server. It is important to know
about three components of an AMQP server: local queues, server queues
and exchanges.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10379f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Anatomy of a Qpid Server Work Flow
</p></div></div><p>
The exchange determines message delivery based on the message
header. Exchanges can provide different delivery schemes, such as
direct (deliver this message to queue XYZ),
publish-subscribe (deliver this message to all queues
subscribed to topic spring.flowers) and XML (all
messages that match XPath query Z go to Queue Y). A server queue is a
queue that resides on the server and receives messages from the exchange.
A local queue is a queue associated with an instance of an application.
Local queues are bound to server queues, so any message delivered to the
server queue appears on the local queue. More than one local queue can be
bound to a server queue. This is handy when you have a farm of machines
(or processes) responding to requests. In this case, messages will be
delivered from the server queue to the local queue on a round-robin basis.
</p><p>
In addition to the server terms, note that programs reading from queues
are called consumers, and those writing to exchanges are producers.
This can become confusing when you have applications that act as both
consumers and producers. Therefore, it makes sense to use standard
terminology for clients and servers, where a client sends a request and
expects a response on a reply queue, and a server listens for messages
and responds as requested.
</p><p>
The Qpid broker discussed here comes with XML files describing the
AMQP specification. These files define the formats used by the server
and clients. The server and libraries use these specifications to
formalize parameters, such as wire format, server commands and error
messages. Managing these specifications outside the server allows
you to maintain compatibility across different server vendors and
different server versions. In theory, you should be able to replace a
Qpid server with OpenAMQ, RabbitMQ or any other AMQP-compliant server
and have it work out of the box. In practice, different servers support
different versions of the specification or require different options.
For example, the Qpid Java Client supports three versions of the protocol:
0-8, 0-9 and 0-10. However, the C++ client supports only 0-10 in its
latest release. RabbitMQ, a competing AMQP broker, supports only 0-8
and 0-9 of the specification. Because of this, the best results are
when using clients and brokers from the same product line.
</p><p>
Apache Qpid and its commercial counterpart, Red Hat MRG Messaging,
are versatile products. They offer many features not covered here.
For example, you can use SSL and InfiniBand fabric as interconnects,
and you can control how clients connect to your server via ACLs and
authentication. I highly recommend the Red Hat MRG documentation for
further reference on these features.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c43580.0x1d3bae8"></a>
Installing the Server</h2></div></div><p>
First, a word about prerequisites. These examples were created on CentOS
5.2 with the standard development packages as well as Ruby. Also, note
that certain versions of PyXML present conflicts that will break the
tests run after installation.
</p><p>
To install the server, simply download the full M4 release from the
URL noted in the Resources section of this article to your preferred development directory and
un-archive the package. Once you have a directory structure, go to the
server's directory by typing:

<pre     class="programlisting">
cd qpid-M4/cpp
</pre>
</p><p>
Initially, there is no configure script; create it by running the
<tt  >bootstrap</tt> command. Once bootstrap
completes, do the standard <tt  >configure</tt>,
<tt  >make</tt> and <tt  >make install</tt>.
</p><p>
One step the installation process does not perform is installing
the AMQP specification files. These specification files
are contained in the specs directory under qpid-M4. Copy the files
found there to /usr/local/share/qpid/specs.
</p><p>
After installation, it's a good idea to run tests to ensure that all
prerequisites have been satisfied. Start a new shell, change
directories to /usr/local and <tt  >su</tt> to root. Then, run
the Qpid d&aelig;mon
with the command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sbin/qpidd -t --auth no
</pre>
</p><p>
Once the broker is running, return to the original shell. Move from
the cpp directory to the python directory contained within qpid-M4.
Run the Python tests using:

<pre     class="programlisting">
run-tests -s 0-10-errata -I cpp_failing_0-10.txt
</pre>
</p><p>
If the tests run and return no errors, proceed to install the Python
modules by running this command as root:

<pre     class="programlisting">
python setup.py install
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c43580.0x1d3c118"></a>
Writing Applications&mdash;A Simple Model</h2></div></div><p>
This example demonstrates a simple application used to query server
status. The server script runs rpm to query the packages stored on the
system and returns the list, with its PID, to the client. The program
generating the requests is the client, and the server is a d&aelig;mon running
on a &ldquo;remote server&rdquo;. It has an event loop that waits for requests.
</p><p>
In this example, the scripts use a combination of two message-routing
methods: publish-subscribe (pubsub) to deliver the
requests to all listening servers and direct to route
the replies directly to the calling client.
</p><p>
Listing 1 describes the client, which is fairly straightforward. First,
the client reads the spec file and then creates the Qpid connection.
The connection is made by creating a standard Python socket object
and passing that object to the connection's constructor. The connection,
in turn, provides a session object when the session() method is called.

connection.start()
session = connection.session(str(uuid4()))

# Declare the reply queue:
replyQueueName = "producerReply_" + session.name
replyQueue = session.queue_declare(queue=replyQueueName,

                      binding_key=replyQueueName)

localQueueName = "producerLocalQueue_" + session.name
localQueue = session.incoming(localQueueName)
session.message_subscribe(queue=replyQueueName,
                          destination=localQueueName)
localQueue.start()

# Now, create a message with a request.
message_properties = session.message_properties()
message_properties.reply_to = session.reply_to("amq.direct",
                                               replyQueueName)
delivery_properties =
    session.delivery_properties(routing_key="SERVER_STATUS")
requestMsgText = "RPM_STATUS"

# Send the message and wait for a response.
session.message_transfer(destination="amq.topic",
                         message=Message(message_properties,
                                         delivery_properties,
                                         requestMsgText))

while True:
    try:
        message = localQueue.get(timeout=60)
        content = message.body
        session.message_accept(RangedSet(message.id))
        print content
    except Empty:
        print "No more messages!"
        break
</pre></div><p>
Next, the client creates the reply-to server queue. Note that the
reply-to server queue name contains the session ID. This gives each
client a unique server queue. The queue then is bound to the amq.direct
exchange, which uses queue names as its routing keys. Using the queue
name for the server queue and delivering replies to the amq-direct
exchange ensures that multiple copies of the server receive only their
own replies.
</p><p>
After the server queue is declared, the program creates a local queue and
subscribes it to the server queue. Once the local queue is subscribed,
the program is ready to transmit a message.
</p><p>
The client then creates the request message. Because the program is using
publish-subscribe, the routing key is set to the topic. In this case,
the topic is SERVER_STATUS. Any server that is subscribed to the topic
SERVER_STATUS will receive this particular message. The client also
supplies the exchange type and the routing key for the reply-to fields.
For this message, it is the amq-direct exchange and the name of the
server queue that was created previously.
</p><p>
Finally, the client creates the message itself (the text
&ldquo;RPM_STATUS&rdquo;)
and delivers it to the exchange. After the message is delivered,
the client waits for a reply and prints the contents of the reply to
the screen.
</p><p>
Listing 2 defines the server. This application will listen for messages
with the topic SERVER_STATUS, run rpm to query the package contents of
the system and send a reply. The first steps are similar to Listing 1
in that the server starts a connection and uses the connection to get a
session and create a server queue. The server then subscribes the local
queue, starts the queue, and the program is ready to respond to requests.

In the event loop, the server first receives a request from the local
queue. If there is no request within the timeout value (60 seconds),
the get() method will raise an Empty exception. Because the server needs
to serve requests continually, the program catches the Empty exception
and simply continues. When a message arrives, the server runs the
processRequest method and constructs data with the method's return values.
The reply message takes exchange and routing key information from the
original message's reply-to field and then is delivered to the exchange.

A Slightly More Complex Model</h2></div></div><p>
With AMQP, it is possible to construct a queuing system that allows
a server farm to respond to multiple different kinds of requests.
This example considers weather prediction models. Here,
there are different server clusters, with one cluster serving each state.
In such a case, it would be extremely handy to be able to send requests
to each farm from an arbitrary location.
</p><p>
This example requires three processes. The first process (the client)
delivers requests, and it is fundamentally the same as the client in the
previous example. It is different only in that it loops over a list
to deliver ten weather requests for Ohio and ten requests for Virginia.
On the receiving end, there are two servers: one for Ohio and one for
Virginia. Each server subscribes to the amq.topic exchange with the
routing key #.ohio or #.virginia. Furthermore, each server
has the ability to subscribe to existing server queues or create those
that do not exist.
</p><p>
These routing keys contain wild cards. When the routing key contains a
hash mark in place of text, the exchange will match any text where the
hash mark resides. In this way, the weather predicting d&aelig;mons using
#.ohio also would respond to requests for topic news.ohio and
sports.ohio. Likewise, if a sports reporting d&aelig;mon had invaded
the cluster and was listening for sports.#, the subscriptions
for both the sports d&aelig;mon and the weather reporting d&aelig;mon for Ohio
would match sports.ohio.
</p><p>
Listing 3 contains the client, and Listing 4 contains the server for Ohio.
Create the server for Virginia by duplicating the server for Ohio and
replacing all occurrences of Ohio with Virginia. (When you
do so, make sure all routing keys have all lowercase characters.)

When you run this demonstration, run several copies each of the Ohio
and Virginia servers. The messages for each state will be picked up in
a round-robin manner by the respective instances of the server script.
In turn, the client will print a listing of the weather forecasts with
the server PIDs.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
The AMQ protocol and its open-source implementations provide a solution
for anyone requiring high-performance, versatile message communications.
As I demonstrate here, using the Apache Qpid message broker is an easy
way to achieve these goals. See my blog at <a href="http://www.globalherald.net/jb01" target="_self">www.globalherald.net/jb01</a> for further discussion regarding
this article.
