Thousands of hackers in the same Las Vegas hotel? Sounds like a party to
Mick!
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2203580.0x22fb460"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Last month, I wrote a case study on Linux desktop system hardening, in
the form of a step-by-step walk-through of how I prepared my Ubuntu laptop
for DEFCON 17, the annual hacker's convention in Las Vegas that features
one of the world's most hostile public wireless LANs. Well, you'll be happy
and perhaps surprised to learn that my laptop came through unscathed.
</p><p>
But, you may wonder, was Mick exposed to cutting-edge developments in
information security?
Did he get invited to any elite skybox parties? And,
doesn't this sort of reporting normally belong on a blog instead of
languishing for a few months through the lengthy print process to which magazines
are subject?
</p><p>
I'll answer the last question first. In the past, I've covered DEFCON on
LinuxJournal.com under my hacker pseudonym Darth Elmo. (No, I'm no more
scary as a hacker than my handle implies, although I'm working on it.) But
this time, I thought it might be interesting to cover DEFCON, which really
is one of the most important annual events in my field, in a little more
depth. I wanted not merely to <span   class="emphasis"><em>report</em></span> on DEFCON, but
also to touch just a
bit on some ongoing paradoxes and conflicts in information security that
always seem to leap out at me at DEFCON.
</p><p>
In short, I wanted to write a DEFCON article that people still would find
relevant and interesting a few months after the actual event. You be the
judge!
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2203580.0x22fb778"></a>
Background</h2></div></div><p>
DEFCON, in case you aren't familiar with it, is an annual conference for
the &ldquo;security underground&rdquo; held by Jeff Moss, aka The Dark Tangent (aided
by scores of volunteers) in Las Vegas, Nevada, every summer since 1993 in
late July or early August. It's run for and by self-identified
&ldquo;hackers&rdquo;,
which is to say, technology's more creatively minded researchers, problem
solvers and boundary pushers.
</p><p>
The term hacker, of course, has a lot of baggage. In mainstream English
usage, it typically means &ldquo;computer criminal&rdquo;. However, in the original
meaning of the term, hackers are simply people who explore the limits of
what is possible in computer systems, networks and other complex systems.
Hackers are technologists who are driven to understand the full truth of
what a given network, software application, device or operating system is
really capable of doing (or being made to do), regardless of what its
manuals, specifications or even its creators say.
</p><p>
Penetration testing, the art of breaking into systems or networks in order
to document and demonstrate their various vulnerabilities, is one of the
most visible and interesting applications of that kind of exploration,
although it represents only a subset of what hacking is about. But
penetration testing, and the skills involved in its practice, is somewhat
problematic. Some hackers can and do cave in to the temptation to use their
skills illegally or unethically, and even those who don't tend to be
treated with suspicion by more conventionally minded IT professionals (not
to mention law-enforcement representatives).
</p><p>
DEFCON has represented, for nearly two decades, an attempt to build some
sort of understanding between the hacker community (in the broadest sense),
law enforcement and the IT professions (certainly IT security). It isn't
the oldest hacker conference, but according to longtime DEFCON insider
Dead Addict, it probably was the first hacker convention to 
invite law-enforcement representatives and journalists to attend
deliberately, and to
encourage them to give presentations too.
</p><p>
In this column, I discuss my own perspective on DEFCON. DEFCON has changed a lot even just in the eight years I've been going (and
even more over the past 16), but in my opinion, it remains the single-most important event in my profession, imperfect though it unquestionably
is.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2203580.0x22fbb40"></a>
Presentation Highlights</h2></div></div><p>
To start off, a bit of reporting is in order. At DEFCON, you really
can't discuss culture separately from technology, since the whole point of
the exercise is to celebrate their convergence. Furthermore, as always, I
saw some very cool and interesting things.
</p><p>
In &ldquo;Is Your iPhone Pwned?&rdquo;, Kevin Mahaffey, John Hering and Anthony
Lineberry (whom I interviewed in the August 2009 issue) described a WAP push
attack that, although easily detected and traced by carriers, can be used to
open arbitrary links and windows on mobile browsers. They gave an excellent
overview of mobile device security, highlighting difficulties caused by
incompatibilities between different providers' implementations of mobile
platforms and devices.
</p><p>
Moxie Marlinspike, in his talk &ldquo;More Tricks for Defeating
SSL&rdquo;, described a
new &ldquo;null prefix&rdquo; attack that can be used to create fraudulent certificate
signing requests (CSRs) that could result in attackers obtaining
legitimately signed certificates for domains they don't own. Moxie's talk
created a lot of buzz, and at least two other presentations referred to his
work, including Dan Kaminsky's and Sam Bowne's.
</p><p>
Moxie is also author of the SSLstrip tool, which is sort of an HTTPS-to-HTTP proxy
that can be used to capture SSL-encrypted data via man-in-the-middle
attacks. He had presented on SSLstrip just a few days earlier at Black Hat
Briefings 2009, a large commercial security conference that always precedes
DEFCON. Sam Bowne gave a chilling but engaging demonstration of SSLstrip
in his presentation &ldquo;Hijacking Web 2.0 Sites with SSLstrip&rdquo;, also
demonstrating Rsnake's &ldquo;Slowloris&rdquo; tool for denial-of-service-attacking
Apache Web servers.
</p><p>
While we're on the topic of SSL attacks, Mike Zusman gave a talk called
&ldquo;Criminal Charges Are Not Pursued: Hacking PKI&rdquo;, in which he demonstrated a
way to use ordinary Domain Validation (DV) SSL certificates in
man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks against sites that use Extended Validation
(EV) certificates. It was easy to see how Zusman's attack could be combined
with SSLstrip and the null prefix attack.
</p><p>
As you can see, man-in-the-middle attacks against SSL were a very hot topic
at DEFCON 17. At this point you may be wondering, &ldquo;oh great screaming goats,
can I ever use eBay safely again?&rdquo; The good news is, yes, probably. 
</p><p>
MitM attacks work only when attackers can insert themselves logically 
upstream of the victim and downstream of the Web site the victim is trying to
reach. In some contexts, this is relatively easy&mdash;on a public
Ethernet,
like at a hotel or on some kinds of Wi-Fi hotspots (never mind exactly how for
right now, although I may write a future column on ARP spoofing). But the
chances of someone doing this on your home DSL network or at your workplace
are probably fairly slim.
</p><p>
Still, I hope this cluster of presentation topics serves as a wake-up call to Web
developers who mix clear text (HTTP) and encrypted (HTTPS) content, which
makes this sort of attack much harder for end users to detect, and to
Certificate Authorities who need to figure out better ways of screening
certificate signing requests.
</p><p>
It may, of course, simply be that somebody needs to figure out a better way
of securing Web traffic than SSL (or TLS) as we know it. Even without
attempting MitM attacks, phishers frequently are successful in luring users
who don't even notice that their fake e-commerce and on-line banking
look-alike sites lack any SSL at all. SSL and TLS represent an important
enabling technology for making the WWW useful for shopping, banking and
other sensitive transactions. We wouldn't be using the Web for those things
today had it not been for SSL/TLS. But, it isn't at all certain whether SSL
can evolve to address emerging threats satisfactorily.
</p><p>
As is so frequently the case with DEFCON, some of the best talks I attended
weren't explicitly technical. In &ldquo;The Year in Computer Crime
Cases&rdquo;,
Jennifer Stisa Granick of the Electronic Frontier Foundation used two
recent court cases to illustrate a rash of recent attempts to
widen inappropriately the definition of &ldquo;unauthorized access&rdquo;
in the US
Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. Jason Scott, in his talk &ldquo;That Awesome Time I
Was Sued For Two Billion Dollars&rdquo;, gave a breathtakingly profane and funny
account of a spurious lawsuit filed against him over an electronic book
archived on his site <a href="http://www.textfiles.com" target="_self">www.textfiles.com</a>.
</p><p>
And, in a conference characterized by very large venues filled to capacity,
Adam Savage of the TV show <span   class="emphasis"><em>MythBusters</em></span> really packed the house,
giving an entertaining and inspiring account of the role of failure in his
career. Savage, an expert in special effects and industrial design, may not
be as obvious a candidate for speaking at a hacker conference as 
Ms Granick, a longtime legal advocate in criminal cases involving hackers, or
Mr Scott, a noted hacker historian and archivist. But with his highly
creative approach to problem solving and his eloquence and empathy in
describing the challenges faced by everyone who works with complicated
systems, Savage connected convincingly and resoundingly to the DEFCON
crowd and received a very warm welcome (and a standing ovation).
</p><p>
I also saw good presentations on security challenges in cloud computing,
techniques and patterns of stock-scam spammers, quirks of the credit
reporting system and on Metasploit's new WMAP module for attacking Web
applications. And, I was very pleased to attend a talk by my old friend
and former employer Richard Thieme, hackerdom's most prominent cultural
attach&eacute;.
</p><p>
Some of the presentations I attended weren't very good&mdash;sad to say, I even
walked out on a couple. DEFCON always has been somewhat hit and miss with
regard to consistency of presentation quality. But the good ones were
<span   class="emphasis"><em>very</em></span> good, and they easily outnumbered the less-good ones. In all my
years attending DEFCON, I've <span   class="emphasis"><em>never</em></span> felt it was a wasted trip.
Besides, prematurely exiting one or two presentations is usually the only
way I can find time to check out the DEFCON vendor area, which provides
one-stop shopping for all your hacker-fashion, lockpicking and wireless
hardware needs.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2203580.0x22fc5e8"></a>
A Couple Dissonances</h2></div></div><p>
Maybe because DEFCON invites such high expectations, a few
things bothered me. Some are peculiar to DEFCON; others probably
are characteristic of hacker culture as a whole. Either way, these observations
are offered in a wholly constructive spirit. Nothing worthwhile is
worth being complacent about.
</p><p>
The thing that bothered me most consistently about DEFCON this year was the
behavior and attitude of many (emphatically not all) of the &ldquo;red shirt
goons&rdquo;. In case you're unfamiliar with them, all members of DEFCON's
volunteer staff are called goons, whether they're serving as actual
physical-security goons like the red shirts, manning the information desk
or running the massive DEFCON LAN infrastructure. All goons have T-shirts
proclaiming their DEFCON goon status, but only the physical security crew's
shirts are red.
</p><p>
I'm privileged to call many of these goons friends. In fact, it was the
&ldquo;original goon&rdquo;, Conal Garrity, who first urged me to give DEFCON a try
many years ago. I've seen my goon friends work incredibly long hours with
little sleep, irregular meals and little else in the way of extrinsic
rewards for their efforts. They're an amazing group of people.
</p><p>
So maybe I was disproportionately bothered by seeing a small number of the
red shirts being disrespectful to the point of being counterproductive, in
their efforts to manage the large crowds that attended DEFCON 17. At
various times I saw some of these guys yelling at attendees, calling them
names, insulting their intelligence and making vague threats (though their
preferred punishment seemed to be &ldquo;more yelling&rdquo;). 
</p><p>
One prominent goon even interrupted a presentation I was enjoying to
harangue the crowd because there had been an incident concerning one person
trying to bungee jump off the hotel's roof and another involving someone
with a concealed handgun on the casino floor. The only problem was I'm
pretty sure none of the hundreds of people who had up until this point been
respectfully listening to Sam Bowne's talk had even
<span   class="emphasis"><em>heard</em></span> of these
incidents, let alone contributed to them in any way. I understand the goon
was frustrated and stressed, but he took it out on the wrong people.
</p><p>
The crowds I saw at DEFCON this year were certainly large, but not unruly
nor even particularly uncooperative. Certain goon antics seemed
disproportionate. When I described some of them to a nonhacker friend
later, his reaction was &ldquo;sounds like Barney Fife syndrome&rdquo;. I had to
reluctantly agree that yes, it did seem as though authority had
gotten to some of these guys' heads just a tiny bit.
</p><p>
Another thing that occasionally struck me was the paradox of DEFCON
elitism. On the one hand, in many ways DEFCON represents one of the most
inclusive, accepting and open atmospheres I experience in any context.
Everybody is welcome: hackers, cops, feds, nerds, script kiddies, lawyers,
teachers, students, reporters&mdash;even vendors. Boundaries of race,
nationality, socioeconomics, creed or sartorial style generally do not
apply at DEFCON.
</p><p>
And yet, there's definitely an in-crowd. DEFCON parties abound, which are,
as with parties the world over, frequently about who is
<span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> invited
as much as who <span   class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span>. This shows up in all sorts of contexts, including
the speaking schedule itself, but it's subtle, and over the years I've had
trouble putting my finger on the real shape, extent and nature of DEFCON
elitism. To talk of elitism at such an essentially inclusive event as
DEFCON really is a bit of a paradox.
</p><p>
Obviously nepotism figures into practically any human endeavor, so maybe
it's no big mystery. But I've observed that many if not most of those who
seem to be in the DEFCON in-crowd are more oriented toward attacking
things than defending them. I suppose this isn't very surprising, given the
way DEFCON markets itself&mdash;one of the official DEFCON T-shirts this year
featured the slogan &ldquo;hack everything!&rdquo;
</p><p>
Why wouldn't a hacker conference concern itself primarily with new attack
techniques? After all, as I've just described, much of the content that
made the biggest impression on me this year involved attacks. Exposure to
new attacks and vulnerabilities provides valuable insights to those of us
who defend networks and systems for a living.
</p><p>
So, I don't mean to suggest DEFCON should set some sort of quota on
attack-oriented material. However, I do think it's a shame that there's
<span   class="emphasis"><em>less</em></span> of a focus on defense at DEFCON nowadays than there used to be.
For example, both times I presented at DEFCON (in 2002 and 2003), my talk
was included in the &ldquo;Defense&rdquo; track&mdash;a track that was phased out years
ago. Maybe it's time to bring it back. Maybe more people need to submit
DEFCON proposals involving compelling, cutting-edge defensive techniques.
</p><p>
And maybe, if we hackers want the world to give us more credit for the
constructive things we do, and if we want people ever to accept the broader
definition of hacker as creative problem solver, we need to do a
little more to avoid giving the impression that we're almost exclusively
creative problem <span   class="emphasis"><em>makers</em></span>.
</p><p>
So perhaps I'm less worried about nepotism per se&mdash;which in one form or
another is inevitable in <span   class="emphasis"><em>anything</em></span> that relies so heavily on
volunteers&mdash;than I am about its particular effects and ramifications. DEFCON
simply needs more defense-oriented people it its in crowd. And I'm
prepared to serve in that capacity myself, even if that means having to
present at DEFCON year after year in multiple tracks, schmooze at all hours
with prominent feds and attractive celebrity lawyers and accept one free
beer after another at crowded, hot parties. You know where to find me,
guys!

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
In all seriousness, DEFCON already is remarkably good, even incomparable. I
can't over emphasize that for my friends and I who attended it, volunteered
at it and presented at it, DEFCON 17 was a tremendous success&mdash;educational, thought-provoking, relevant, unpredictable, exhilarating at
least as often as it was frustrating and, above all, fun. 
</p><p>
In the words of Richard Thieme, who at the time wasn't sure whether he was
quoting Simple Nomad or Bruce Potter, &ldquo;For the system to work, it must never
grow up and it must make us smile.&rdquo; Here's to the scene's never growing up.
I hope to see you at DEFCON 18!
