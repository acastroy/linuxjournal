I often say geeks rule the world, and we could take over if we wanted
to&mdash;we just have better things to do with our time. This issue, we explore that
notion and show Linus we're well on our way to world domination. I could
go on and on, but I think regular folk might get scared if they realized
the degree of access we have to
information&mdash;<span   class="emphasis"><em>mwahahahaa</em></span>. Putting aside my
aspirations to be a modern-day Lex Luthor, this month, we talk about
infrastructure. Let's face it, Linux rules the roost when it comes to
infrastructure. Heck, even a large percentage of Windows servers are
really just virtual machines running on top of a Linux hypervisor.
</p><p>
Bill Childers gets us going with that very topic. If you're planning to
virtualize much of your existing server room, picking a hypervisor can be
the hardest step. Bill compares and contrasts VMware Server, VirtualBox
and KVM. In my own server room, I have only one Windows server, and the
fact that it runs on top of a Linux hypervisor makes me smile. Bill
doesn't stop there, however; he also argues again this month with Kyle
Rankin. Kyle seems to think XFS is the best filesystem to use, while Bill
is convinced ext3 is still king. I try to stay out of their little spats,
but their discussion is enlightening to read.
</p><p>
Every server room needs storage. For many of us, that's just a few hard
drives in a RAID array. As needs grow, however, single-server storage
solutions don't scale that well&mdash;enter SAN. Usually, that means lots of
money to an already expensive infrastructure, but Michael Nugent shows us
how to create a Linux-based SAN for a fraction of the cost. Along with the
need for large storage solutions, comes the need for redundancy. We also
have an article on IPv4 Anycast, where Philip Martin explains how to add
availability for mission-critical services. (Anyone that has experienced
the &ldquo;network hang&rdquo; of a downed DNS server will appreciate the notion of
high availability!)
</p><p>
Infrastructure extends outside our precious server closets though, and sits
on our desks, in our backpacks and even our pockets. When traveling from
location to location, changing networks can be frustrating. Abhinav
Pathak, Andrei Gurtov and Miika Komu
show us a bit about Host Identity Protocol for Linux and how we can keep
our identity no matter where we go. In a similar vein, Joshua Kramer
demonstrates the Advanced Message Queueing Protocol, which allows
applications to communicate with each other regardless of location. Even
if you are telecommuting from the &ldquo;clouds&rdquo;, it's important to be connected.
A good infrastructure knows no geographical limits&mdash;which brings us to an
interview I conducted this month....
</p><p>
Linus may be happy with Linux dominating the world, but quite frankly, some
people have bigger goals in mind. The IBM InfoSphere Streams Project aims a
bit higher, and using Linux as its underlying base, it gathers information
about space weather. The amount of data is so great, it has to be analyzed
in real time. I like the sound of &ldquo;Interplanetary Domination&rdquo; quite a
bit, so Mitch Frazier and I took the bull by the horns and interviewed the
folks at IBM. I enjoyed the interview; hopefully, you will too.
</p><p>
What about our regular cast of columnists? They're all here this month
too. Reuven M. Lerner continues telling us about RSpec, Dave Taylor shows us
how to manage latitude and longitude from inside a shell script, and Mick
Bauer describes the ultimate conference for hackers, DEFCON.
Speaking of hackers, Kyle Rankin tries to explain why arrow keys have no
place in our lives as Linux users and strives to turn us all into
die-hard vim users. I'm already mostly with him, but I'll admit I use
arrow keys. I guess that makes me a n00b.
</p><p>
So although your coffeepot might not be running a Linux kernel and your
dishwasher doesn't instant message you when the cleaning cycle is complete,
that time is coming sooner than you think. What will our intergalactic
infrastructure be based on? My guess is Linux. This month, you can get a
jump start on that transition and perhaps have a say on whether your
refrigerator will have an ext3 or XFS filesystem&mdash;at least, that's what
Bill and Kyle are hoping for.
