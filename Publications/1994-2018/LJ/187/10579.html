<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #187, November 2009</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Transcendent memory</b></span>, called <span   class="bold"><b>tmem</b></span>, is a virtual form of RAM that can be
given to user programs in copious amounts, provided those programs are
okay with the fact that the tmem may vanish without warning. The <span   class="bold"><b>Xen</b></span>
folks have implemented tmem for Xen, and now they want to provide a
generic API for the kernel to make tmem available to any program that
wants it. <span   class="bold"><b>Dan Magenheimer</b></span> and other Xen folks have been working on
some patches, and it looks as though the kernel people are open to the
tmem concept, so long as certain security issues are addressed.
Security concerns actually drown out most other discussions, so it
remains to be seen what technical problems remain before tmem could be
included in the kernel tree.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Andrew Morton</b></span> has taken over temporary
maintainership of the <span   class="bold"><b>MMC</b></span> code.
<span   class="bold"><b>Pierre Ossman</b></span> has stepped down as maintainer, and no one stepped up,
so Andrew said he'd do it for now. <span   class="bold"><b>Ian
Molton</b></span>, <span   class="bold"><b>Matt Fleming</b></span>, <span   class="bold"><b>Roberto
A. Foglietta</b></span> and <span   class="bold"><b>Philip Langdale</b></span> all stopped just short of actually
volunteering to be the new maintainer, though they all said they'd
like to be CCed on all MMC patches. One benefit of the maintainership
change over was that a bunch of MMC patches bubbled up that had been
lying dormant for too long. <span   class="bold"><b>Paul Mundt</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>Ohad Ben-Cohen</b></span> and <span   class="bold"><b>Adrian
Bunk</b></span> all submitted or pointed to MMC patches to be considered.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>kernel.org</b></span> may be getting some new <span   class="bold"><b>mailing-list software</b></span>, written by
one of the kernel.org admins, <span   class="bold"><b>Matti Aarnio</b></span>. Aside from the fact that
this is clearly a very fun project for him, the reasons behind it are
not so clear. His code improves on majordomo security, and there are
various other enhancements, but he also could have fed those features
as patches to majordomo or one of the other popular list-handling
tools around. One thing is clear. If kernel.org adopts a brand-new
list-handling tool, a lot of other places will use it too.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>PramFS</b></span>, the nonvolatile RAM-based filesystem, keeps state across
reboots, just like a normal filesystem. <span   class="bold"><b>MontaVista</b></span> tried to get it in
the kernel back in 2004, but it was rejected because MontaVista was
trying to get a patent on the algorithms. Now <span   class="bold"><b>Marco
Stornelli</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>Daniel Walker</b></span> have said that MontaVista has abandoned its patent
effort, and Marco wants to submit the code for inclusion again. But,
it turns out that this is not a full-featured filesystem. There's
no support for symbolic links, and there are other technical questions
as well. One obvious question that was asked during the discussion
was why PramFS was necessary at all. Why not just extend an existing
filesystem to support nonvolatile RAM? <span   class="bold"><b>Pavel
Machek</b></span> led the charge
against PramFS and argued vehemently against accepting the PramFS
code as is. He saw no justification for the project and said that
before it even could be considered, it would have to implement modern
features, such as journaling and other features that come standard with
many newer filesystems today.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Microsoft</b></span> has GPLed its <span   class="bold"><b>Hyper-V</b></span> drivers, and it will allow the
in-kernel versions of that code to be the canonical versions. Future
Microsoft contributions will be made as patches to those kernel
drivers, rather than as full releases of their own. <span   class="bold"><b>Greg Kroah-Hartman</b></span>
announced the occasion, praising Microsoft's <span   class="bold"><b>Hank
Janssen</b></span>, <span   class="bold"><b>Haiyang
Zhang</b></span> and <span   class="bold"><b>Sam Ramji</b></span>, as well as numerous non-Microsoft people, for
helping get this done. Some of the Microsoft people, including
Hank, said they intend to continue their work on these drivers as
community contributors.

<h2 class="title">People, Research, Excellence</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Joey Bernard</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #187, November 2009</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
The past few months in this space, I've covered specific utilities and how they can be used,
sometimes in quite interesting ways. This month, I instead look at a task and
see what utilities are available to accomplish it. People who do scientific
computational work tend to use several pieces of software in series. This software
could span the entire computer age in terms of how old it might be. The usual
work flow involves taking some initial data and feeding it as input to a
program, in
order to do the first computational step. The output then is fed as input to
another program, in order to complete the second computational step. This process
continues until the final results are reached. The problem with this method is that the
programs used at each computational step probably were written by completely
different groups, possibly decades apart. This means the researcher may need to do some
kind of transformation to get the output from one computational step into
the proper format to be used as input for the next computational step.
</p><p>
One simple yet common problem is the use of different field separators in
a data file. In some cases, fields may be separated by commas. In other cases, they
may be separated by tab characters. If you have to change from one to the other,
you can use the tr utility:

<pre     class="programlisting">

tr "," "\t" &lt;data_file_1 &gt;data_file_2

</pre>
</p><p>
The above replaces every comma in data_file_1 with a tab and writes the results
into data_file_2. This works well for replacing single characters or even
classes of characters. Say you had a really old piece of FORTRAN code that expected
all letters to be uppercase. You could accomplish that with the
following:

<pre     class="programlisting">

tr "[:lower:]" "[:upper:]" &lt;data_file_1 &gt;data_file_2

</pre>
</p><p>
But, what if you have some more-complicated translation to make? A more
general-purpose utility to use for this is sed, the Stream EDitor. With sed, you
can make substitutions with the s command. For example, you can achieve the
same result as above, converting commas to tabs, by running:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sed -e "s/,/    /g" data_file_1 &gt;data_file_2
</pre>
</p><p>
(The blank space after the second forward slash is a tab character.)
Remember:
to type a tab character in the bash shell, you need to type C-v TAB.
Using this command, you can translate any kind of separator into any other kind of
separator. And don't think it can't happen to you. I personally have seen
separators like |*| or %*% in the wild. You never know what some previous
person is going to think is a good idea.
</p><p>
So, now you have your data fields separated with the correct separator, but what if
you need only some of this data? The output file you are massaging may have more
data than you need for the next computational step. What can you do? The cut
and paste utilities
can be used for this purpose. You can cut selected columns out of the
data file with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
cut -f1,3 data_file_1 &gt;data_file_2
</pre>
</p><p>
This cuts columns 1 and 3 and dumps them into data_file_2. It
assumes that the field separator is a tab character. If you've used a different
separator character, you can use the -d option. For example, the following
cuts the file up using comma separators:

<pre     class="programlisting">
cut -f1,3 -d "," data_file_1 &gt;data_file_2
</pre>
</p><p>
If you have the opposite
problem, you can use the paste utility to glue together data from multiple files.
Say you have two data files containing the parts required for the next
computational step. You can glue them together with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
paste data_file_1 data_file_2 &gt;data_file_3
</pre>
</p><p>
This assumes that you want to use a tab character as the field separator. If you
want to use another character, such as a comma, you can use the -d option,
like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
paste -d "," data_file_1 data_file_2 &gt;data_file_3
</pre>
</p><p>
Another very useful utility can be used to do this type of job, awk.
With awk, you can pull out only the data you need. For example, say 
your output file has three columns of data, but the next computational step
requires only columns 1 and 3. With awk, this becomes a very simple task by
executing the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
awk '{print $1,$3}' data_file_1 &gt;data_file_2
</pre>
</p><p>
This example assumes that the initial field separator in the data_file_1 is a
tab character. You get columns 1 and 3, with a comma as the field separator, dumped
into the data_file_2. If you want to keep the tab character, use the
following instead:

<pre     class="programlisting">
awk '{print $1"\t"$2}' data_file_1 &gt;data_file_2
</pre>
</p><p>
If your initial data file, data_file_1, uses a comma as a field separator,
you can tell awk this with the -F option:

<pre     class="programlisting">
awk -F "," '{print $1,$2}' data_file_1 &gt;data_file_2
</pre>
</p><p>
With these options, you can do the field separator translation and the cut function
both in one step.
</p><p>
With awk, you can do even more impressive data massaging. Say 
you need to use the average of the three columns as input to the next
computational step. Do the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
awk '{print ($1+$2+$3)/3}' data_file_1 &gt;data_file_2
</pre>
</p><p>
awk makes an entire programming language available, and it can be used for
very complex data massaging. Hopefully, this short introduction shows some of the
possibilities available for your data management tasks and helps smooth the work flow
between computational steps.

<h2 class="title">Non-Linux FOSS</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Mitch Frazier</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #187, November 2009</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Haiku is a free and open-source operating system designed
to be compatible with BeOS.
BeOS was the operating system that ran
on computers built and sold by Be, Inc., in the 1990s
and also on Apple's PowerPC reference platform.
BeOS was designed for working with digital media and took advantage
of modern hardware. It worked on multiprocessor systems
and extensively used multitasking and multithreading.
BeOS was not built to look like another *nix system
and neither is Haiku. It is not based on Linux nor does it use
the X Window System or GNOME or KDE.
</p><p>
Haiku is written in C++, as was BeOS before it, and the operating
system API is object-oriented.
As of 2008, Haiku can be compiled from within Haiku itself.
As of 2009, there is a native GCC4 port that now allows numerous applications
to be ported to Haiku.
A Java port for Haiku also is in progress.
</p><p>
Haiku began in 2001 and was named OpenBeOS until 2004,
when the name was changed to avoid problems with the original trademarks
(and also because the original name required too many Shift-key presses).
Haiku is released under the MIT license.
Haiku currently is bootable and usable, but it has not reached
version 1.0 yet (R1 in Haiku speak).

<h2 class="title">Netbooks Only: Operating Systems for the Little Guys</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #187, November 2009</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
I have a love/hate relationship with Netbooks. On the upside, they
are inexpensive, portable and beefy enough to run most applications.
On the downside, they have small screens and small keyboards. Although I'm
not normally a fan of nonstandard desktops, a few Netbook-specific Linux
distributions make a valid case for their existence&mdash;especially on small screens.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>
Ubuntu Netbook Remix</b></span>
</p><p>
Although not the first, UNR is one of the most &ldquo;open&rdquo; of the
Netbook-specific
interfaces. Underneath it is running (of course) Ubuntu, but the
interface is designed for tiny screens (Figure 1). Its large icons and
lack of tiny menus make it easy to navigate, even from low resolutions.
Some of the applications still are awkward at small screen sizes, but
UNR does a nice job of making the most of screen real estate. Check it
out at <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/GetUbuntu/download-netbook" target="_self">www.ubuntu.com/GetUbuntu/download-netbook</a>.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10579netf1.large.jpg"><img src="10579netf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Ubuntu Netbook Remix runs Ubuntu underneath this Netbook-friendly
interface.
</p></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Moblin</b></span>
</p><p>
Although still in beta, Moblin is a Linux distribution built from the ground
up designed for mobile devices (Figure 2). More than merely a wrapper
around an underlying operating system, Moblin offers an entirely unique
user experience. I personally had a difficult time figuring out how
to use Moblin, but it's early in development and available to try out.
To download a current live image, visit <a href="http://moblin.org/downloads" target="_self">moblin.org/downloads</a>.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10579netf2.large.jpg"><img src="10579netf2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Moblin is designed to work on a variety of handheld devices,
but Netbooks are one of the current foci.
</p></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Jolicloud</b></span>
</p><p>
Jolicloud is not only early in development, but is actually in a closed
beta program. I heard about the operating system on Twitter, and when
I checked it out, it was rather impressive (Figure 3). Although
the interface does appear to be very user-friendly, and it's designed for a
cramped screen size, the real difference with Jolicloud is its goal to
move all your information to the &ldquo;cloud&rdquo;. Operating systems like gOS have
attempted to do the same, without much success. Hopefully, Jolicloud's
sync/cache method to switch between Netbooks and desktops will be able
to move us effectively to Web-based applications without sacrificing
the need for off-line usability. You can sign up for the closed testing
phase at <a href="http://my.jolicloud.com/account/invitation" target="_self">my.jolicloud.com/account/invitation</a>.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10579netf3.large.jpg"><img src="10579netf3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Jolicloud looks impressive. Only time will tell whether it
will provide a dependable Web-immersed environment.
</p></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Chrome OS: the Future, or Too Little Too Late?</b></span>
</p><p>
A while back, Google announced its upcoming operating system Chrome.
It remains to be seen whether the Chrome OS will be a dominant force
in the Netbook market or whether it will face the same limited fanfare
that the Chrome browser receives. It also begs the question of whether 
Google waited too long for such an endeavor. With options like UNR,
Moblin and soon Jolicloud, Netbooks finally might become more than
a novelty. I just hope hardware manufacturers can make some decent
keyboards for them!

<h2 class="title">A Bit of Welcomed Scumm on Your Linux Machine</h2>

This might make me sound like an old fogey, but I really do miss the old
games like <span   class="emphasis"><em>Space Quest</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Curse of Monkey
Island</em></span> and <span   class="emphasis"><em>Return
to Zork</em></span>. The problem isn't that I don't have the games anymore,
but rather that they were designed for my 386 computer running DOS.
Thankfully, I'm not alone in my fits of nostalgia. The developers
over at <a href="http://www.scummvm.org" target="_self">www.scummvm.org</a> have reproduced the &ldquo;Script Creation Utility
for Maniac Mansion&rdquo; developed by Lucas Arts and packaged it into a
virtual machine (thus, ScummVM). That virtual machine is open source
and available for just about any platform you can imagine.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10579scumf1.large.jpg"><img src="10579scumf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. If you wonder what the mustached car could possibly be
saying, you'll have to play <span  class="emphasis"><em>Putt Putt Joins the Parade</em></span>. Thankfully,
it's installable on ScummVM.
</p></div></div><p>
It's important to note that ScummVM doesn't come with any actual games.
You either need to purchase the old games it supports from eBay or
look in your closet for those stacks of old game disks you used to play
as a kid (or as an adult, for some of us). What ScummVM does provide is a
platform for playing those old games and even introducing your kids to games
they'll probably never have a chance to play otherwise. At OSCON
in July 2009, ScummVM was announced as SourceForge's Community Award winner
in the category of &ldquo;Best Project for Gamers&rdquo;. If you've never checked
it out, now is a good time.
</p><p>
As for me? I think it's about time I introduced <span   class="emphasis"><em>Putt Putt &amp;
Fatty Bear</em></span>
to my kids. Hopefully, they enjoy the games as much as my brother-in-law did
when he was growing up. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Monkey Island</em></span>? Yeah, I think I'll play
that one myself.

I admit, I'm one of those people who dual-boots so I can play
video games. I've tried running programs like CrossOver Games in order
to feed my need for fragging, but in the end, it seems I always have to
install Windows to enjoy some real gaming fun. Thankfully,
I'm not the guy in charge of things worldwide, because the folks over

<div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Don't worry about what anybody else is going to do.
The best way to predict the future is to invent it.

&mdash;Alan Kay
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Premature optimization is the root of all evil
(or at least most of it) in programming.

&mdash;Donald Knuth
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
We're even wrong about which mistakes we're making.

&mdash;Carl Winfeld

<tt  >filter(P, S)</tt> is almost always written clearer as

&mdash;Guido van Rossum on Python
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Lisp has jokingly been called &ldquo;the most intelligent way to misuse a
computer&rdquo;.
I think that description is a great compliment because it transmits the full
flavor of liberation: it has assisted a number of our most gifted fellow humans
in thinking previously impossible thoughts.

&mdash;Edsger Dijkstra, CACM, 15:10

A government big enough to give you everything you want,
is big enough to take away everything you have.
