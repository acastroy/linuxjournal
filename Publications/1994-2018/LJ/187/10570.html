Pidgin Is Not a GNOME App
</h4><p>
In reading the Cooking with Linux column in the September 2009 issue, I
ran across mention of Pidgin, a relatively popular instant-messaging
client. I'd like to point out that referring to Pidgin as a GNOME
application is wrong. Pidgin is not a GNOME application and not a part of
the GNOME Project, nor does it have any GNOME dependencies. Using GTK+
does not make something a GNOME application. Empathy is the blessed GNOME
IM application.
</p><p>
I find it disappointing that people insist on referring to Pidgin as a
GNOME application, when we have no involvement with GNOME. [Note, the author of
this letter is a Pidgin developer.]

<span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> Videos Rock
</h4><p>
I have really been enjoying the Tech Tips and other videos on the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span> Web site. I discovered these gems after adding the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> feed to my
home page. To me, these videos are the most exciting and useful addition
<span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>
has made in years.
</p><p>
My question is this: what video capture and editing tools/devices do the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> staff use to create these videos? I see that Shawn and Mitch contribute
videos quite frequently, so I'm curious what recommendations the folks at
<span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> have for us readers to create video tutorials of our own. I know this
would be a great way to document things at work or share some useful tips
with the community.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Tom H  <br><br>
</p><p>
If you go back in the archives, both Mitch and I show our screencasting
methods. I must admit, however, I've adjusted the way I do videos quite a
bit and still vary from day to day. If I'm showing something that isn't
graphic-intensive, I'll use a VM and capture with either xvidcap on
my Linux machine or with SnapzProX on my Macintosh. Then, I'll 
do final edits with Final Cut or Kino. I also usually voiceover after
recording the videos to avoid &ldquo;Ums&rdquo;.
</p><p>
One of the things I want to check out soon is the idea of Web-based
screen-capture tools. As I'm usually on different computers and different
platforms all the time, it would be nice to have a consistent interface.
Although I haven't tried them yet, sites like <a href="http://www.screentoaster.com" target="_self">www.screentoaster.com</a> look
promising.&mdash;Ed.

Autoconf, Automake, Libtool
</h4><p>
Almost every Linux build from source uses the familiar:

<pre     class="programlisting">
tar -xvf ...
./configure
make
</pre>
</p><p>
However, getting started with the magic tools (autoconf, automake and
libtool) is similar to finding yourself lost in the &ldquo;maze of twisty little
passages, all alike&rdquo;.
</p><p>
How about a tutorial series on getting started with the tools? I realize
there is a complexity that cannot be satisfied with a brief tutorial,
but some hints, tips and examples (samples of good practice) would be very
helpful in shining light on the right path.
</p><p>
If the mention of the &ldquo;twisty little maze&rdquo; didn't give it away, let's just
say I'm not exactly new to programming and system administration.
I <span   class="emphasis"><em>can</em></span> use the source, Luke.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
BRWms   <br><br>
</p><p>
That's not a bad idea. Perhaps we can get someone to contribute a few tech
tips for the Web on the process. Thanks for the suggestion!&mdash;Ed.

KDE 4 Does Not Disappoint 
</h4><p>
In regard to the September 2009 letter to the editor titled &ldquo;Disappointed
with KDE 4&rdquo; from Christian H., I must clarify some points and make some
corrections to Christian's initial view of KDE 4.
</p><p>
I too was &ldquo;raised&rdquo; on KDE 3.x. I installed it in Debian&mdash;3.5.5 I think it
was. So I saw some of his same points when I first decided to switch to
KDE 4. Fortunately, most of them are simply false or non-issues.
</p><p>
First, Christian writes that KDE 4 has lost the ability to put icons on the
desktop; this is simply false. There are, in essence, three ways to do so: 1) a
folder view widget, 2) by dragging the application icons to your desktop and
3) by right-clicking the desktop, going to appearance settings, and
changing from a widget desktop to folder view.
True, this is &ldquo;confusing&rdquo; for new users, but the KDE 4 desktop is as robust
and feature-filled as previous releases. If you read the documentation,
this does indeed exist though. Pressing Alt-F1 shows the KDE handbook at any
time.
</p><p>
Although the argument of a widget-based desktop will continue to be fought,
widget-based desktops are an exciting and new take on the desktop, and KDE
4 has managed to push the development of the desktop in directions that
<span   class="emphasis"><em>no
one</em></span> has gone before.
</p><p>
You can autohide the kicker, which is now called simply a panel, in KDE
4. Click on the configuration cashew on the panel (you may have to unlock
your widgets first) and click more options. There is your autohiding
panel. In KDE 4.3 there is also &ldquo;Windows can go above&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Windows can go
below&rdquo;, the latter of which I have never seen any other desktop do. Saying KDE 4 is less configurable than KDE 3 is simply not
true.
There are many more options and ways to configure the KDE 4 panel than
there ever was for the KDE 3 kicker.
</p><p>
You say that Konqueror is no longer included in the desktop. This 
also is untrue. Konqueror is, indeed, no longer the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>default</em></span> file manager, but
that was so its role could be more fine-tuned as simply a Web
browser. KDE 4.2 and 4.3's (which was released last week) Konqueror is simply ages
ahead of KDE 3's Konqueror, and it is faster and renders most of the sites
that Firefox does. The only time I ever have to use Firefox is when
working with the Fedora Koji Build System (which 99.9% of users won't have
to do). And, if you really want Konqueror back as your file manager, you can
change it in the System Settings dialog Default Applications. This is
where you would have changed it in KDE 3, so why not look there in KDE 4?
</p><p>
You say you are waiting for KDE 5, and that could still be years away. The
head KDE developers say that KDE 4 is the track we are on for a while, and
in my opinion, it is a very exciting track. Take a look at KDE 4.3; it
should be in most distributions right now. The best way to make KDE 4 the
best desktop for users is by participating. You can do so
<span   class="emphasis"><em>very</em></span> easily&mdash;by contributing art, contributing to user base and, most important, filing
bugs on <a href="http://bugs.kde.org" target="_self">bugs.kde.org</a> when you find them, so they can be
fixed.
</p><p>
Also, KRunner is absolutely an amazing tool that is, in my opinion, like
GNOME Do on steroids, and with a better interface, too. [Note: the author of
this letter is a KDE contributor and member of the Fedora KDE Special
Interests Group.]

<span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> Tech Tips
</h4><p>
Hey all, your site is great. I use Miro to catch the tech tips&mdash;wonderful.
I was hoping that maybe sometime you might do a bit on putting your
/home/username folder under some type of revision control. I am using
Dropbox to copy my dot files over to a backup manually, but it is not very
handy. Anyway, love the show and this site. Great work making Linux more
accessible.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Shawn Bright  <br><br>
</p><p>
Thanks for the compliments! As to /home directory revision controls, I
basically handle that with backuppc. Although a bit longer than a video tech tip
could handle, setting up backuppc isn't too painful, and it keeps snapshots
for as long as you have space. My favorite feature is how fast you can
restore older versions of a file. It has a great Web interface and
&ldquo;one-click restore&rdquo;.&mdash;Ed.

Re: Linux on the Desktop, Part II
</h4><p>
In the September 2009 issue, Cary's letter to the editor was very good, and
I realized that when confronted with the positions that Windows works
better out of the box for the computer-user masses than does Linux, I need
to counter that a Linux-based machine purchased from a commercial source,
such as Linux Certified, EmperorLinux or even Dell (and so on), is going to
provide just as painless of an initial experience as would Windows from a
commercial source such as Dell, HP or Acer (and so on). One caveat in the
experience difference is in arcane peripherals, such as limited-production
film-strip scanners, thermal printers and other specialty products. The
manufacturer's lack of incentive to produce Linux drivers creates an
experience void that scares away many a member of the computer masses.
Nonetheless, Cary's letter was enlightening. 

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Edward Comer  <br><br>
</p><p>
I tend to ramble about things like this in length, so I'll try to
restrain myself. I still think Linux supports <span   class="emphasis"><em>so much</em></span> hardware out
of the box, that it makes Windows look silly in comparison. That said,
there are some areas where the Linux end user suffers, like you mention,
due to manufacturers' lack of support. As geeks, we see the problem.
End users just see it as a limitation (which it is).
</p><p>
Another big problem is familiarity. Computers aren't &ldquo;new and
cool&rdquo;
anymore; everyone knows how to use them. Most people are familiar with
Windows, and other stuff is scary because it's different. Apple has
the same problem. Although I think OS X provides a much better user experience
than Windows, Apple still suffers with low percentages in spite of
its enormous marketing budget. I think people like me need to keep getting
Linux into schools, where next-generation purchasers will gain
familiarity with it.&mdash;Ed.

Cross-Platforming Teachers!
</h4><p>
Shawn Powers' column on the pairing of open-source software and Windows [see
Shawn's Current_Issue.tar.gz in the September 2009 issue]
could not have been more perfectly timed for me. I am a high-school teacher
who is a longtime Linux user. For years, I have advocated open-source
programs and the Linux OS as viable alternatives to the Windows software my
school district spends so much money to license each year. Just two days
before I read Shawn's column, I taught a workshop for other teachers in my
district of Florida. The subject of this workshop? Open-source software. We
covered OpenOffice.org 3, Firefox and a plethora of other open-source
programs that are available in Windows versions. The response from my
teacher-students was overwhelmingly positive. I actually saw jaws drop open
as these teachers realized that programs like OpenOffice.org give them
functionality as good and often better than the commercial software they
were accustomed to using. They also were impressed with Linux itself, because
I chose to run the programs on a bootable version of Ubuntu I'd customized
for the class with the programs I wanted to showcase.
</p><p>
For those of us who have been advocates for Linux for a long time now,
perhaps the current recession has a bright side. My school district, which
always has been disinclined to consider the merits of open-source software,
soon will be switching from Windows server software to Apache servers and
from Microsoft Office 2007 to OpenOffice.org 3. Why? Like many school systems
in America, we are operating with less money than ever, so open-source
software is suddenly appealing to the higher-ups in our district who are
trying to save every cent. I'm hoping that once our teachers move to
OpenOffice.org and see the quality and usability of open-source software, some
of them also will be receptive to the idea of an open-source operating
system. Since I taught my workshop two days ago, I have had several e-mail
messages
from teachers who tell me they've downloaded Ubuntu 9.04 and are trying it
out. As Shawn Powers' column suggests, the road to converting others to
Linux might very well begin by showing them the merits of open-source
software in Windows or on the Mac. Who knows where they might go from
there?

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Mike Creamer  <br><br>
</p><p>
That's great news! I'm still trying similar things here at our school, but
I made some horrible mistakes that burned a lot of bridges in the past.
Unfortunately, there are many teachers who think &ldquo;Linux&rdquo; is that stupid thing
Mr Powers likes so much. Stories like yours are very encouraging. I hope
everyone reads it and is motivated to try something similar. This year,
I'm rolling out LTSP5 on Ubuntu 9.04. I'm hoping the shiny factor helps with
more people falling in love.&mdash;Ed.

Really?
</h4><p>
Hello from sunny Sweden.
In your They Said It column on page 17 of the August 2009 issue, you claim
that IBM's Chairman Thomas Watson said, &ldquo;I think there is a world market
for maybe five computers.&rdquo;
But, did he?
</p><p>
Wikipedia calls it: &ldquo;Although Watson is well known for his alleged 1943
statement: 'I think there is a world market for maybe five computers',
there is scant evidence he made it.&rdquo; The author Kevin Maney tried to find
the origin of the quote, but has been unable to locate any speeches or
documents of Watson's that contain this, nor are the words present in any
contemporary articles about IBM.
And, there's more here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_J._Watson#Famous_misquote" target="_self">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_J._Watson#Famous_misquote</a>.
It's a fun quote to be sure, but I don't think it has the ring of truth.
Anyway, love the magazine!

Transcripts Please?
</h4><p>
Please provide transcripts of the videos; this'll save on loading time
(besides, Flash is pretty buggy on many 64-bit platforms), and make search
easier and
command copy &amp; paste a cinch.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Jaco   <br><br>
</p><p>
This isn't the first time someone has asked for transcripts. The problem is
that often the transcripts would be, &ldquo;See this does that, and then see what
happens here&rdquo;, which isn't terribly useful without the video.
</p><p>
We have tried to address the problem a bit by having more tech tips on the
site in text format as opposed to all video. Hopefully, between the two,
everyone will get a bit of something.&mdash;Ed.
