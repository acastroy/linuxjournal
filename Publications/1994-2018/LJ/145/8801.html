Is VMware a compelling purchase in the face of free virtualization competition?
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x190b580.0x1a033a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Few virtual computer environments are as stable, popular and rich in
features as VMware. I've been a fan and user of VMware Workstation since
version 2.0. I use it for testing network applications, illicitly running
Linux in Windows-only environments and, most recently, for testing the
sample code in my book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Server Security</em></span>, 2nd
ed., across different Linux
distributions. (I also wrote most of that edition using MS Word running
on a virtual Windows XP machine!) [Do you really want to admit
that?  &mdash;Ed.]
</p><p>
VMware has some serious competition nowadays in the Open Source
community. Xen, FAUmachine and user-mode Linux are promising and 100%-free PC virtualization environments. Nevertheless, VMware Workstation
5.5 remains a compelling purchase in the face of all this competition.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x190b580.0x1a03558"></a>
Overview and Specifications</h2></div></div><p>
VMware Workstation is a user-space application (aided by a couple of
proprietary kernel modules) that creates virtual x86-based computers on
top of your physical 32-bit or 64-bit x86-based &ldquo;host&rdquo; computer.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x190b580.0x1a03660"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Terms</b></p><p>
In VMware parlance, host refers to the system running VMware
software. Guest systems are virtual machines running on the VMware
host. For the remainder of this review, I use the terms guest system
and virtual machine interchangeably.
</p></div><p>
VMware Workstation 5.5 runs on the following host operating systems:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Mandrake Linux 10 and 9.0.
</p></li><li><p>
Red Hat Enterprise Linux AS/ES/WS 4.0, 3.0 and 2.1, 32- and 64-bit.
</p></li><li><p>

</p></li></ul></div><p>
Practically any reasonably modern x-86-compatible or x-86-64-compatible
PC works as a host platform. VMware supports most Intel processors since
Pentium II, and AMD processors (Athlon or better), provided they
run at least 400MHz (500MHz or faster is recommended). VMware also
supports multiprocessor systems. VMware Workstation 5.5 lets you create
virtual machines that use Two-Way Virtual Symmetric Multiprocessing,
an experimental feature.
</p><p>
If you need a virtual machine with more than two virtual processors,
this is supported in VMware ESX Server, but if you create one and
copy it to a VMware Workstation 5.5 host, it won't run unless you
change its Number of CPUs setting to 2. You also can
create virtual machines with the Two-Way Virtual Symmetric Multiprocessing
feature on a uniprocessor host system, if it has either a dual-core CPU
or hyperthreading enabled. However, according to the VMware Workstation
User Manual, virtual machine performance will be subpar. And, while I'm
still on the subject of CPUs, although you can't have more than two CPUs in a
virtual (guest) machine, the underlying host can have as many as you like.
</p><p>
Besides a fast CPU (or CPUs), you need plenty of RAM. This is a simple
enough equation. You need enough RAM for your host OS, for VMware itself
and enough RAM for as many host OSes you intend to run concurrently. For
example, my laptop has 1GB of RAM, of which SUSE 9.3 running KDE, a
few Konsole shells, the usual assortment of panel applets and VMware
itself use a total of about 200MB. That leaves me 800MB for virtual
machines. I can comfortably (that is, without hitting swap too much)
run three virtual machines that each has 256MB of RAM and so forth.
</p><p>
Officially, VMware requires your host system to have a minimum of 128MB
of RAM (256MB is recommended), with no maximum per se, but only a total of
4GB can be used between all guest VMs.
</p><p>
You also need enough hard disk space both for VMware itself and for as
many virtual machines as you anticipate maintaining. Both IDE and SCSI
disks are supported, both on the underlying host OS and on virtual hosts.
</p><p>
As with RAM, the more disk space on your host system, the better. As
a general rule of thumb, you need 172MB for VMware and at least
2GB per virtual machine. By using VMware shared volumes
(actually Samba shares), you can share data volumes between virtual
machines. This allows you to use the minimum necessary disk space for
virtual machines' guest OS software and one big shared volume for
application data. This is also a handy means of sharing data between
virtual machines and the underlying host OS.
</p><p>
VMware Workstation 5.5 supports a long list of operating systems for
guest/virtual machines. These include:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Most versions of MS Windows (fully supported), including Vista
(experimental support).
</p></li><li><p>
Mandrake Linux, versions since 8.2.
</p></li><li><p>
Red Hat Linux, versions since 7.0.
</p></li><li><p>
SUSE Linux, versions since 7.3.
</p></li><li><p>
Solaris x86 (experimental support), versions 9 and 10.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
In practice, non-officially supported x86 operating systems often
work fine as guest OSes. For example, in researching my article
&ldquo;Security Features in Debian GNU/Linux 3.1&rdquo; (see page 36),
I successfully installed Debian 3.1 on a virtual machine, despite
the fact that it's not officially supported (the X Window System didn't work, but
everything else I tried did, including networking).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x190b580.0x1a04a50"></a>
Installing VMware Workstation</h2></div></div><p>
Installing VMware Workstation on a supported Linux system is a breeze.
You install the RPM version either by executing a single command
or by unpacking the .tgz version and manually running the installer
script vmware-install.pl (which is executed automatically if
you install the RPM). Then, you run the configuration script
vmware-config.pl. That's it! The installer scripts and the configuration
script do all the work for you.
</p><p>
For example, to install the RPM version of VMware, I executed the
commands:

<pre     class="programlisting">

rpm -Uvh ./VMware-workstation-5.5.1-19175.i386.rpm

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x190b580.0x1a04c08"></a></h2></div></div><p>
and:

<pre     class="programlisting">

vmware-config.pl

</pre>
</p><p>
The configuration script asks you a number of questions, regarding things
like how to set up networking. For most users, the default values are
fine; otherwise, the Workstation 5 User Manual provides clear and
comprehensive descriptions of the various options presented by the
installer script.
</p><p>
Speaking of which, the user manual is, in my opinion, a model of effective
technical writing&mdash;everything you need to know about VMware is
included, explained in plain English and organized in a logical manner. It's
accessible from within VMware's Help menu in HTML format, and it also
can be downloaded as one big (490-page) PDF file from <a href="http://vmware.com" target="_self">vmware.com</a>.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x190b580.0x19fb700"></a>
Creating Guest Systems</h2></div></div><p>
Once VMware Workstation is installed and configured, you can run the
vmware executable in the X Window System to start creating and using virtual
machines. Figure 1 shows the New Virtual Machine Wizard.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8801f1.large.jpg"><img src="8801f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. New Virtual Machine Wizard
</p></div></div><p>
To create a Typical virtual machine with this wizard (as opposed to a
Custom virtual system), you need to make only four decisions:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
In which OS will the guest machine run?
</p></li><li><p>
Where on your host machine's filesystem will the virtual machine's files
go?
</p></li><li><p>
Which flavor of VMware networking will the guest machine use?
</p></li><li><p>
What type and size of virtual disk to use?
</p></li></ol></div><p>
Because this article is a review and not a how-to, I forego explaining
all the different options available at this point. A few words about
virtual machine hard disks and networking options, however, might help illustrate
VMware's flexibility and power.
</p><p>
A virtual machine's hard drive is usually a virtual disk&mdash;that is,
a regular file that essentially is mounted by VMware as a loopback
filesystem. The beauty of this approach is that the virtual disk file
doesn't need to reflect its capacity; if you install only 300MB worth
of system software, applications and files on your virtual machine, its
disk file will be only 300MB or so. The size you specify when setting
up the virtual machine therefore will be its maximum size, not its actual
size (unless you check the Allocate all disk space now option).
</p><p>
If you run the New Virtual Machine Wizard in Custom rather than Typical
mode, you additionally can choose whether to create a virtual SCSI disk
(the default) or a virtual IDE disk. You also can choose whether to use
a virtual disk at all. If you prefer, and if your intended guest OS is
supported in this mode, you alternatively can designate a physical disk
partition on your host system as the virtual machine's root. This is handy
if you have a dual-boot system on which you'd like to run both (or more)
local OSes simultaneously, but support for this feature is limited and
comes with some caveats. Tread lightly with this feature, and be sure
to read the user manual carefully before you attempt to use it.
</p><p>
You can network your virtual machines using one of three methods. In bridged
networking, the default, your virtual machine is given a virtual Ethernet
interface connected to the same LAN as your host machine's physical
network card (or wireless card&mdash;in VMware 5 you can now bridge WLAN
interfaces on Linux hosts). In other words, your virtual machine
appears on your local LAN as though it were sitting side by side with
your host machine.
</p><p>
With Network Address Translation (NAT), your host system acts like
a NAT firewall. Your virtual machine is given a fake IP address,
and when it connects to other resources on your LAN or beyond, VMware
translates the source IP address on all its packets to that of the host
system's physical network interface. In other words, your virtual machine
is hidden from the rest of your LAN by your host system. This
is handled strictly by VMware; you don't need to configure iptables on
your host OS to achieve this.
</p><p>
The third option is host-only networking. This is similar to the NAT mode in
that your virtual machine is assigned a fake IP address on a virtual LAN
separated from your physical/actual LAN by your VMware host system. The
difference is that none of the virtual machines on your host-only
(virtual) LAN will be able to interact with the real LAN unless you
explicitly configure the underlying host OS to forward and route those
packets. In other words, with host-only networking, you
<span   class="emphasis"><em>will</em></span> need
to configure your host OS to route or bridge your virtual machines'
packets. This mode, therefore, is most useful when you
<span   class="emphasis"><em>don't</em></span> want to
connect your virtual and physical LANs&mdash;for example, if you're testing
potentially dangerous network applications on your virtual LAN.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x190b580.0x19fbff0"></a>
Other Virtual Devices</h2></div></div><p>
Besides virtual CPU, RAM, hard disks and network interfaces, virtual
machines also can have virtual floppy disks, CD-ROM/DVD-ROM drives (data
only, not movies), USB controllers, SCSI controllers, parallel ports,
serial ports, sound cards and mice. Both floppy and CD/DVD drives can
use either your host system's actual hardware, or disk-image or ISO files,
respectively. In all cases, VMware mounts the real or virtual media for
you; you don't need to run the mount command separately.
</p><p>
VMware's SCSI and USB support is similarly transparent. By default,
if you plug in a SCSI or USB device to your host system while a virtual
machine is running in the foreground (has focus), the virtual machine
responds as though you plugged the device in to it. Whether this will
actually <span   class="emphasis"><em>work</em></span> in a given situation depends both on
VMware&mdash;the
virtual USB controller supports only USB 1.1&mdash;and on the capabilities
of the guest system. (Does it support USB? Have you installed the correct
drivers for your device onto your virtual machine?)
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x190b580.0x19fc1a8"></a>
Running Host Systems</h2></div></div><p>
Once you've created a virtual machine and installed its operating
system, actually using the virtual machine is very, very similar to
the real thing. Figure 2 shows the Debian 3.1 installer running on a
virtual machine.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8801f2.large.jpg"><img src="8801f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. A Virtual Debian Machine
</p></div></div><p>
You can even, if you like, run the virtual machine in full-screen mode
rather than within the VMware window. Installing the VMware Tools
package on the guest system adds additional features, such as enhanced
virtual-display-adapter support for your guest system and the ability
to move your mouse pointer in and out of the VM window without having to
click in and escape out.
</p><p>
A number of VMware features make the virtual machine experience
<span   class="emphasis"><em>better</em></span> than using a real machine, especially for research/test
scenarios. One is the ability to take snapshots of virtual machines. A
snapshot captures a virtual machine's memory state, disk state and
virtual machine settings at a given point, allowing you to
roll back to that point later&mdash;for example, after losing control
of a virus you were examining on the guest system.
</p><p>
Another feature is the ability to create teams of virtual machines. A team
is a group of virtual machines with shared networking and startup
characteristics. This lets you create, for example, a farm of
database servers all connected to the same virtual LANs that
all can be started simultaneously with a single-mouse click or command
(VMware now has a command-line utility, vmrun, for operating virtual
machines and teams).
</p><p>
As you'd probably expect, given that a virtual machine is nothing more
than files in a directory, VMware also makes it easy to clone
virtual machines. A full clone is simply a copy of the parent VM,
identical to it except for having a new MAC address and UUID. A full
clone, therefore, is highly portable, and it easily can be copied to other
host systems.
</p><p>
Another option is to create a linked clone, which actually is made from
a snapshot of the parent. Changes to the parent don't affect the clone,
and vice versa, but the clone must have access to the parent's files at
all times.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x190b580.0x19fc678"></a>
Conclusions</h2></div></div><p>
So, what are the downsides to VMware? Honestly, I've been a very happy
user of this product over the years. I have no laundry list of gripes
or bugs to share with you, other than one hardware-specific problem
with VMware 4.0 on a ThinkPad T42 running Windows XP (which I solved
by switching to the Linux version). VMware Workstation 5.5 is a stable,
well-documented and easy-to-use product with a rich set of features
that is particularly useful to information systems professionals and
researchers.
</p><p>
None of that comes for free, of course. The downloadable version of VMware
Workstation 5.5 for Linux costs $189 US, and the boxed version is $199 US. I think
you'd be hard pressed though to assemble a very good physical computer
for that little money, let alone an entire LAN's worth. If in doubt,
you can download the full version for a 30-day evaluation (after which
you must purchase and install a license to continue using VMware).
</p><p>
Or, you can opt for VMware Server, which is now completely free. Formerly
known as VMware GSX Server, the current version of VMware Server was
still in beta at the time of this writing, but it will remain a free product
even when it reaches production status. Presumably, VMware Server lacks
many of VMware Workstation's developer/researcher-oriented
features&mdash;the server versions of VMware are targeted more for production server
applications. Compare and decide for yourself. More information about
all VMware products is available at <a href="http://www.vmware.com" target="_self">www.vmware.com</a>.
