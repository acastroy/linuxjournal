The &ldquo;Readers Digest&rdquo; version of the Linux Torvalds vs. GPLv3
controversy.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1be2580.0x1cda348"></a></h2></div></div><p>
In January 2006, the Free Software Foundation (FSF) released in draft
form (<a href="http://gplv3.fsf.org/draft" target="_self">gplv3.fsf.org/draft</a>) a revised and updated version of the
GNU General Public License (GPL). Linux has grown for 14 years under version
2 of the GPL. Naturally, there was immediate interest in how the new
draft would go down with Linus Torvalds, who created Linux and chose the
original license.
</p><p>
Linus chose to keep Linux licensed under GPLv2.
</p><p>
How and why Linus made that choice is made clear by exchanges on the
Linux-Kernel Mailing List (LKML) between January 25, 2006 and February 2,
2006, mostly on the thread &ldquo;GPL V3 and Linux&mdash;Dead Copyright
Holders&rdquo;. It's
such an interesting read, I decided to excerpt and quote the most
relevant sections here.
</p><p>On Wednesday, January 25, 2006, Chase Venters wrote:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
This means that when the code went GPLv1--&gt;GPLv2, the transition was
permissible. Linux v1.0 shipped with the GPLv2. It did not ship with
a separate clause specifying that &ldquo;You may only use
<span   class="emphasis"><em>this</em></span> version of
the GPL&rdquo; as it now does. (I haven't done any research to find out when
this clause was added, but it was after the transition to v2.)
</p></blockquote></div><p>Here's how Linus first weighed in:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Bzzt. Look closer.
</p><p>
The Linux kernel has <span   class="emphasis"><em>always</em></span> been under the GPLv2. Nothing else
has ever been valid.
</p><p>
The &ldquo;version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later
version&rdquo; language in the GPL copying file is not&mdash;and has never
been&mdash;part of the actual License itself. It's part of the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>explanatory</em></span> text that talks about how to apply the license to your
program, and it says that <span   class="emphasis"><em>if</em></span> you want to accept any later versions
of the GPL, you can state so in your source code.
</p><p>
The Linux kernel has never stated that in general. Some authors have
chosen to use the suggested FSF boilerplate (including the &ldquo;any
later version&rdquo; language), but the kernel in general never has.
</p><p>
In other words: the <span   class="emphasis"><em>default</em></span> license strategy is always just the
particular version of the GPL that accompanies a project. If you
want to license a program under <span   class="emphasis"><em>any</em></span> later version of the GPL, you
have to state so explicitly. Linux never did.
</p><p>
So, the extra blurb at the top of the COPYING file in the kernel
source tree was added not to <span   class="emphasis"><em>change</em></span> the license, but
to <span   class="emphasis"><em>clarify</em></span>
these points so that there wouldn't be any confusion.
</p><p>
The Linux kernel is under the GPL version 2. Not anything else. Some
individual files are licensable under v3, but not the kernel in
general.
</p><p>
And quite frankly, I don't see that changing. I think it's insane to
require people to make their private signing keys available, for
example. I wouldn't do it. So I don't think the GPLv3 conversion is
going to happen for the kernel, since I personally don't want to
convert any of my code.
</p></blockquote></div><p>The thread then continued:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
If a migration to v3 were to occur, the only potential hairball I
see is if
someone objected on the grounds that they contributed code to a
version of the
kernel Linus had marked as &ldquo;GPLv2 Only&rdquo;. IANAL.
</p></blockquote></div><p>And, Linus responded:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
No. You think &ldquo;v2 or later&rdquo; is the default. It's not. The
<span   class="emphasis"><em>default</em></span>
is to not allow conversion.
</p><p>
Conversion isn't going to happen.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Here's how Linus put it in a summary posting on January 27, 2006:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Linux has been v2-only for a <span   class="emphasis"><em>long</em></span> time, long before there
was even any choice of licenses. That explicit &ldquo;v2 only&rdquo; thing
was there at least for 2.4.0, which is more than five years ago.
So this is not some sudden reaction to the current release of
GPLv3. This has been there quite <span   class="emphasis"><em>independently</em></span> of the current
GPLv3 discussion.
</p><p>
If you disagree with code you write, you can (and always have
been able to) say so, and dual-license in many different ways,
including using the &ldquo;or later version&rdquo; language. But that
doesn't change the fact that others (a <span   class="emphasis"><em>lot</em></span> of others) have
been very much aware of the &ldquo;v2 only&rdquo; rule for the kernel, and
that most of the Linux kernel sources are under that rule.
</p><p>
People argue that Linux hasn't specified a version, and that
by virtue of paragraph 9, you'd be able to choose any version
you like. I disagree. Linux has always specified the version: I
don't put the license in the source code, the source code just says:
&ldquo;Copyright (C) 1991-2002 Linus Torvalds&rdquo;,
and the license is in the COPYING file, which has ALWAYS been
v2. Even before (for clarification reasons) it explicitly said so.
</p><p>
In other words, that &ldquo;if no version is mentioned&rdquo; simply isn't
even an argument. That's like arguing that &ldquo;if no license is
mentioned, it's under any license you want&rdquo;, which is crap. If
no license is mentioned, you don't have any license at all to
use it. The license AND VERSION has always been very much
explicit: linux/COPYING has been there since 1992, and it's been
the <span   class="emphasis"><em>version_2</em></span> of the license since day 1.
</p><p>
People can argue against that any way they like. In the end, the
only way you can <span   class="emphasis"><em>really</em></span> argue against it is in court. Last I
saw, intentions mattered more than any legalistic sophistry. The
fact that Linux has been distributed with a specific version of
the GPL is a big damn clue, and the fact that I have made my
intentions very clear over several years is another HUGE clue.
</p><p>
I don't see any real upsides to GPLv3, and I do see potential
downsides. Things that have been valid under v2 are no longer
valid under v3, so changing the license has real downsides.
</p><p>
Quite frankly, <span   class="emphasis"><em>if</em></span> we ever change to GPLv3, it's going to be
because somebody convinces me and other copyright holders to add the
&ldquo;or any later license&rdquo; to all files, just because v3 really is so
much better. It doesn't seem likely, but hey, if somebody shows that
the GPLv2 is unconstitutional (hah!), maybe something like that happens.
</p><p>
So I'm not <span   class="emphasis"><em>entirely</em></span> dismissing an upgrade, but quite frankly, to
upgrade would be a huge issue. Not just I, but others that have
worked on Linux during the last five to ten years would have to agree
on it. In contrast, staying with GPLv2 is a no-brainer: we've used
it for almost 15 years, and it's worked fine, and nobody needs any
convincing.
</p><p>
And that really is a big issue: GPLv2 is a perfectly fine license.
It has worked well for us for 14 years; nothing really changed
with the introduction of GPLv3. The fact that there is a newer
license to choose from doesn't detract from the older ones.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
A major sticking point for Linus is fresh language in GPLv3 that, to
quote the license draft, &ldquo;intrinsically disfavors technical attempts to
restrict users' freedom to copy, modify, and share copyrighted
works&rdquo;.
</p><p>
Returning to the thread, on Wednesday, February 1, 2006, Karim Yaghmour
wrote:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
DRM is something worth fighting, but we need something that

</p></blockquote></div><p>Linus responded:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Side note: the reason GPLv2 is so successful at fighting the root
problem of using copyright to fight restrictive copyrights is that
it makes &ldquo;interesting material&rdquo; available under a license that
forbids further restricting it.
</p><p>
I would suggest that anybody who wants to fight DRM practices
seriously look at the equivalent angle. If you create interesting
content, you can forbid that <span   class="emphasis"><em>content</em></span> ever be encrypted or limited.
</p><p>
In other words, I personally think that the anti-DRM clause is much
more sensible in the context of the Creative Commons licenses, than it is
in software licenses. If you create valuable and useful content that
other people want to be able to use (catchy tunes, funny animation,
good icons), I would suggest you protect that
<span   class="emphasis"><em>content</em></span> by saying
that it cannot be used in any content-protection schemes.
</p><p>
Afaik, all the Creative Commons licenses already require that you
can't use technological measures to restrict the rights you give
with the CC licenses. The &ldquo;Share Alike&rdquo; license in particular
requires all work based on it also to be shared alike&mdash;that is, it has the
&ldquo;GPL feel&rdquo; to it.
</p><p>
If enough interesting content is licensed that way, DRM eventually
becomes marginalized. Yes, it takes decades, but that's really no
different at all from how the GPL works. The GPL has taken decades,
and it hasn't &ldquo;marginalized&rdquo; commercial proprietary software yet,
but it's gotten to the point where fewer people at least
<span   class="emphasis"><em>worry</em></span>
about it.
</p><p>
As long as you expect Disney to feed your brain and just sit there
on your couch, Disney &amp; Co. will always be able to control the
content you see. DRM is the smallest part of it&mdash;the crap we see
and hear every day (regardless of any protection) is a much bigger
issue.
</p><p>
The GPL already requires source code (that is, non-protected content). So
the GPL already <span   class="emphasis"><em>does</em></span> have an anti-DRM clause as far as the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>software</em></span> is concerned. If you want to fight DRM on non-software
fronts, you need to create non-software content, and fight it
<span   class="emphasis"><em>there</em></span>.
</p><p>
I realize that programmers are bad at content creation. So many
programmers feel that they can't fight DRM that way. Tough. Spread
the word instead. Don't try to fight DRM the wrong way.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
In a February 2, 2006 post, Linus replied to a suggestion that GPLv2 is itself
deficient at fighting DRM. Here's the suggestion:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
The point is not only getting access to the source code, but also
being able
to change it. Being able to freely study the code is only half of
the beauty
of the GPL. The other half, being able to change it, can be very
effectively
stopped using DRM.
</p></blockquote></div><p>And, Linus' reply:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
No it cannot.
</p><p>
Sure, DRM may mean that you cannot <span   class="emphasis"><em>install</em></span> or
<span   class="emphasis"><em>run</em></span> your changes
on other people's hardware. But, it in no way changes the fact that
you got all the source code, and you can make changes (and use their
changes) to it. That requirement has always been there, even with
plain GPLv2. You have the source.
</p><p>
The difference? The hardware may run only signed kernels. The fact
that the hardware is closed is a <span   class="emphasis"><em>hardware</em></span> license issue. Not a
software license issue. I'd suggest you take it up with your
hardware vendor, and quite possibly just decide not to buy the
hardware. Vote with your feet. Join the OpenCores groups. Make your
own FPGAs.
</p><p>
And it's important to realize that signed kernels that you can't run
in modified form under certain circumstances is not at all a bad
idea in many cases.
</p><p>
For example, distributions signing the kernel modules (that are
distributed under the GPL) that <span   class="emphasis"><em>they</em></span> have compiled, and having
their kernels either refuse to load them entirely (under a &ldquo;secure
policy&rdquo;) or marking the resulting kernel as &ldquo;tainted&rdquo;
(under a &ldquo;less
secure&rdquo; policy) is a GOOD THING.
</p><p>
Notice how the current GPLv3 draft pretty clearly says that Red Hat
would have to distribute its private keys so that people sign
their own versions of the modules they recompile, in order to
re-create their own versions of the signed binaries that Red Hat
creates. That's INSANE.
</p><p>
Btw, what about signed RPM archives? How well do you think a secure
auto-updater would work if it cannot trust digital signatures?
</p><p>
I think a lot of people may find that the GPLv3 &ldquo;anti-DRM&rdquo; measures
aren't all that wonderful after all.
</p><p>
Because digital signatures and cryptography aren't just &ldquo;bad
DRM&rdquo;.
They very much are &ldquo;good security&rdquo; too.
</p><p>
Babies and bathwater....

Then, also on February 2, 2006, Pierre Ossman wrote:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
So taking open software and closed hardware and combining it into
something
that I cannot modify is okay by you?
</p></blockquote></div><p>Linus responded:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
But you CAN modify the software part of it. You can run it on other
hardware.
It boils down to this: we wrote the software. That's the only part
<span   class="emphasis"><em>I</em></span> care about, and perhaps (at least to me) more importantly,
because it's the only part we created, it's the only part I
feel we have a moral right to control.
</p><p>
I <span   class="emphasis"><em>literally</em></span> feel that we do not&mdash;as software
developers&mdash;have
the moral right to enforce our rules on hardware manufacturers. We
are not crusaders, trying to force people to bow to our superior
God. We are trying to show others that cooperation and openness
works better.
</p><p>
That's my standpoint, at least. Always has been. It's the reason I
chose the GPL in the first place (and it's the exact same reason
that I wrote the original Linux copyright license). I do
<span   class="emphasis"><em>software</em></span>,
and I license <span   class="emphasis"><em>software</em></span>.
</p><p>
And I realize that others don't always agree with me. That's fine.
You don't have to. But I licensed my project under a license
<span   class="emphasis"><em>I</em></span>
agreed with, which is the GPLv2. Others who feel differently can
license under their own licenses. Including, very much, the GPLv3.
</p><p>
I'm not arguing against the GPLv3.
</p><p>
I'm arguing that the GPLv3 is wrong for <span   class="emphasis"><em>me</em></span>, and it's not the
license I ever chose.
</p></blockquote></div><p>And, also on February 2, 2006, Pierre Ossman continued:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Then I have to ask, why GPL and not a BSD license? GPL is after all,
forcing our beliefs onto anyone who wishes to benefit from our work.
</p></blockquote></div><p>In response to this post, his last post on this thread, Linus unpacked his differences with the
Free Software Foundation:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Yes, a lot of people see the GPL as a &ldquo;crusading&rdquo; license, and I
think that's partly because the FSF really has been acting like a
crusader.
</p><p>
But I think that one of the main reasons Linux has been successful
is that I don't think the Linux community really is into
crusading (some small parts of it are, but it's not the main
reason). I think Linux has made the GPL more &ldquo;socially
acceptable&rdquo;,
by being a hell of a lot less religious about it than the FSF was.
</p><p>
So to me, the point of the GPL is not the &ldquo;convert the
infidels&rdquo; logic,
but something totally different&mdash;&ldquo;quid pro quo&rdquo;.
</p><p>
This is where I started out. My initial reason for my original
license (which was also &ldquo;you must make changes available under the
same license&rdquo;) was not crusading, but simple reciprocity. I give out
source code&mdash;you can use it if you reciprocate.
</p><p>
In other words, to me, the GPL &ldquo;give back source&rdquo; is an issue of
fairness. I don't ask for anything more than I give. I ask for
source code and the ability to incorporate your changes back into
<span   class="emphasis"><em>my</em></span> use, but I don't want to limit
<span   class="emphasis"><em>your</em></span> use in any way.
</p><p>
So in my world view&mdash;not as a crusader&mdash;the GPLv2 is
<span   class="emphasis"><em>fair</em></span>. It
asks others to give back exactly what I myself offer: the source
code to play with. I don't ask for control over their other projects
(be they hardware or software), and I don't ask for control over
copyrights (in the kernel, people are <span   class="emphasis"><em>encouraged</em></span> to keep their
copyrights, rather than sign them over to me).
</p><p>
I only ask for exact reciprocity of what I give: the license for me
to use freely the changes to source code that I initiated.
</p><p>
The GPLv3 fundamentally changes that balance, in my opinion. It asks
for more than it gives. It no longer asks for just source back, it
asks for <span   class="emphasis"><em>control</em></span> over whatever system you used the source in.
</p><p>
See? I think the GPLv3 makes <span   class="emphasis"><em>perfect</em></span> sense as a conversion tool.
But as a &ldquo;please reciprocate in kind&rdquo; tool, the GPLv2 is better.
</p><p>
Now, my very earliest original license (and the GPLv2) fit my notion
of reciprocity, and as mentioned, that was the reason I
&ldquo;originally&rdquo;
selected that over the BSD license. However, over time, having seen
how things evolve, I've come to appreciate another aspect of the
GPLv2, which is why I would never put a project I personally really
cared about under the BSD license&mdash;encouraging merging.
</p><p>
I've come to believe that the BSD license is not a
&ldquo;sustainable&rdquo;
license, because while it encourages (and allows) forking even more
than the GPL does, it does not encourage merging the forks back.
</p><p>
And I've come to the private conclusion that the real value of a
fork is lost if you don't have the ability to merge back the end
result. Not that all forks should be merged back&mdash;most forks are
dead ends&mdash;but the firm ability to merge back
<span   class="emphasis"><em>if</em></span> it turns out to
be something other than a dead end.
</p><p>
The GPL guarantees you the right to both fork <span   class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span> merge the result
back&mdash;equally, and on both sides. That makes it sustainable. In
contrast, the BSD license encourages forking, but also allows for
not merging back, and that means that if the project ever gets to
the point where there are economic or political reasons to diverge,
it <span   class="emphasis"><em>will</em></span> eventually diverge, and there is no counteracting force
at all.
</p><p>
Now, not all projects have any economic incentives to diverge. There
are good reasons to stay on one base, and the costs of forking are
bigger than the advantages. So projects like Apache and Sendmail
have worked fine&mdash;the pain of being different (when you're
&ldquo;just&rdquo; a
network service) is generally much higher than the gain of
differentiation.
</p><p>
But just about anywhere else, the &ldquo;cohesion&rdquo; of a BSD-licensed
project is just lower. You'll have people make a commercial
release of it, and they'll spend a bit more effort on it, and
eventually the original freely licensed project will become immaterial.
</p><p>
So long-term, I believe that a GPL'd project is stabler. I believe,
for example, the fact that Wine switched over to the LGPL
(which shares a lot of the cohesion argument) was a very important
decision for the project, and that it would eventually have
otherwise become irrelevant, and the commercial users of the
BSD-licensed code would have taken over. But note that my second
reason is not why I <span   class="emphasis"><em>began</em></span> using the GPLv2, and that it's also
equally true of the GPLv3 and LGPL. Anyway, there are other reasons
I like the GPLv2. It's a &ldquo;known entity&rdquo; and it's been around for a
long time.
</p><p>
In fact, even in -92, when I switched to the GPL, that &ldquo;known
factor&rdquo; part was a major secondary reason for switching. I could
have tried to just change my own license&mdash;but I felt it was an
advantage to be something that people knew about, and not have to
explain it and check it with lawyers. The fact that the GPLv2 was
still &ldquo;young&rdquo; back then was nothing compared to how wet behind the
ears my <span   class="emphasis"><em>own</em></span> license was.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
What we have here is an excellent look at just how conservative and
practical Linus, Linux and open-source development all are.
