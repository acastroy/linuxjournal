Fran&ccedil;ois, what are you looking for on Freshmeat?
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Quoi?</em></span> A program
to digitize you so you can go inside the computer? Yes, I know what it
looks like in the movies, but virtual reality hasn't quite made it there yet. I
thought you understood that when we discussed lightcycles months ago. No,
Fran&ccedil;ois, I don't think people are going to be living inside computers
anytime soon. I'm not laughing at you, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mon ami</em></span>. I am just amused,
that's all. No, I'm sorry to disappoint you, but I don't think there
are cities or people in your Linux system either. We will discuss this
later. Our guests will be here any moment, and we must be ready for them.
</p><p>
What did you say, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mon ami?</em></span> They are already here? Quickly,
Fran&ccedil;ois, help our guests to their tables. Welcome, everyone, to
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Chez
Marcel</em></span>, where fine wine meets exceptional Linux fare and the most superb
clientele. When you have finished seating our guests, Fran&ccedil;ois, head down
to the wine cellar and bring back the 2002 Ct&ocirc;es du Roussillon Villages.
</p><p>
Fran&ccedil;ois and I were just discussing the possibility of virtual worlds
inside our computers, a truly amazing prospect but one that is still
fantasy. It's true that amazing things have happened in the time I've been
working with computers. Your Linux system is one of those things,
and its open nature means a freedom to explore that simply doesn't exist
elsewhere. Still, I keep thinking that the computing model in general
is still in its infancy. Maybe it's because I watched too much science
fiction and as a result, my expectations are a bit high. Think
back to the movie <span   class="emphasis"><em>Tron</em></span>, for instance. In the opening sequence, Flynn
the hero of the show, sends a program named CLU into the system to locate
some missing files. CLU, the program, looks like Flynn and moves around
in a 3-D tank while a companion bit offers yes or no advice. There are
towering skyscraper-like structures all around as he navigates his tank
down digital streets. That's the virtual computer world I wanted
to experience in my younger days.
</p><p>
Ah, Fran&ccedil;ois, you have returned with the wine. Please, pour for our
guests. May I suggest, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, that you enjoy the many hidden
flavors in this excellent red.
</p><p>
Although there may be no hidden worlds inside the system, plenty
of things are otherwise hidden from view. Virtual consoles, for
instance, scroll information that is hidden from view once your graphical
desktop starts up. Sure, you could jump out of your graphical session with
a Ctrl-Alt-F1 to see what is happening out there, but there is
a better way. To view the hidden contents of that virtual console, type
the following at a shell prompt (you will need root permissions for
this):

<pre     class="programlisting">
cat /dev/vcs1
</pre>
</p><p>
You see, what you may not know is that your system keeps track of the
contents of those virtual consoles (1-6) in a special device file,
/dev/sdaX, where X is the number of your virtual
console. For example, here is a sample of the output of the first VT on my Ubuntu
test system:

<pre     class="programlisting">
* Starting OpenBSD Secure Shell server...
[ ok ]  * Starting Bluetooth services...  hcid sdpd
[ ok ]  * Starting RAID monitoring services...
[ ok ]  * Starting anac(h)ronistic cron: anacron
[ ok ]  * Starting deferred execution scheduler...
[ ok ]  * Starting periodic command scheduler...
[ ok ]  * Checking battery state...
[ ok ]  * Starting TiMidity++ ALSA midi emulation...
[ ok ]
Ubuntu 6.04 "Dapper Drake" Development Branch francois tty1
</pre>
</p><p>
This is interesting stuff, but it hardly qualifies as a hidden world,
and it just doesn't have the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Wow!</em></span> factor my humble waiter
is looking for. Yet, despite what I said to Fran&ccedil;ois, there are ways to
see cities inside your Linux system. It's a bit of a stretch, but
some fascinating visualization programs exist&mdash;experimental
in nature&mdash;that try to create a real-world view of the virtual world
of processes, memory and, of course, programs. One of these is Rudolf
Hersen's ps3 (see the on-line Resources), and to take full advantage of ps3, you need
a 3-D video card with acceleration.
</p><p>
Compiling the program is fairly simple, but it does require that you have
the SDL development libraries:

<pre     class="programlisting">
tar -xjvf ps3-0.3.0.tar.bz2
cd ps3-0.3.0
make
</pre>
</p><p>
To run the program, type <tt  >./ps3</tt> from the same
directory, and you
should see a 3-D representation of your process table. When it
starts, you may get something other than an ideal view, but that's the
whole point of ps3. You can rotate the views in all three axes and look at
the process table from above or below. If the processes are too high at
the beginning, simply scale them down to something more reasonable. Each
process is identified by its program name and its process ID.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8868f1.large.jpg"><img src="8868f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Navigating system processes with ps3 is like flying down into a virtual city.
</p></div></div><p>
Navigating the ps3 display is done entirely with the mouse. Click the
left-mouse button and drag to rotate and adjust the height and speed of horizontal
rotation. Click and and drag using the right-mouse button to rotate the
view horizontally and vertically. The wheel on your mouse lets you zoom
in and out. To quit the ps3 viewer, press the letter Q on the keyboard.
</p><p>
ps3 is in no way a scientifically accurate means of viewing system
processes, but it is enlightening and entertaining. So now we have
virtual buildings and the makings of a virtual city somewhere
inside your system. All we're missing now are tanks. Well, I may have
an answer to that one as well. It's called <span   class="emphasis"><em>BZFlag</em></span>, and this certainly
calls for Fran&ccedil;ois to refill our glasses. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Mon ami</em></span>, if you please.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xac6580.0xbbeea0"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Note:</b></p><p>
If you find yourself missing the lightcycles, check out Marcel's &ldquo;Battles
Inside the Computer&rdquo; on our Web site at <a href="../109/6638.html" target="_self">/article/6638</a>.
</p></div><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>BZFlag</em></span> is a multiplayer 3-D tank battle game you can play with others
across the Internet (Tim Riker is the current maintainer of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>BZFlag</em></span>, but
the original author is Chris Schoeneman). The name,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>BZFlag</em></span>, actually
stands for <span   class="emphasis"><em>Battle Zone capture Flag</em></span>. It is, in
essence, a capture-the-flag game. To get in on the action, look no further
than your distribution's CDs for starters. <span   class="emphasis"><em>BZFlag</em></span>'s popularity means it
is often included with distros. Should you want to run the latest and
greatest version, however, visit the <span   class="emphasis"><em>BZFlag</em></span> site
(see Resources). You'll
find binaries, source and even packages for other operating systems. That
way, you can get everyone in on the action.
</p><p>
Unless you specify otherwise, <span   class="emphasis"><em>BZFlag</em></span> starts in
full-screen mode, but
you can override this by starting the program with the -window
option. The game begins at the Join Game screen. Before finding a server
(the first option on the screen), you may want to change your Callsign (or
nickname). We'll look at some of these other options after we've selected
a server. For now, move your cursor to the Find Server label and press Enter.
</p><p>
You won't have any trouble finding people to play with&mdash;you'll get
a list of dozens of servers currently hosting games (Figure 2). Scroll
down the list of names to find one that suits you. Your criteria might
be the number of players, how busy a server is or how many teams are
involved. When you look at the server list, make sure you pay attention
to the type of game being hosted on the server. Some have team-oriented
capture-the-flag play, and others host free-style action. You
also may be limited by the number of shots at your disposal, so aim carefully.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8868f2.large.jpg"><img src="8868f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. At any given time, dozens of <span  class="emphasis"><em>BZFlag</em></span>
servers are running worldwide and hundreds of people are playing.
</p></div></div><p>
When you have made your choice, press Enter, and you'll find yourself
back at the Join screen (Figure 3) with a server selected. You could
simply start the game, but you
may want to fine-tune a few more things before you start up your tank. Cursor down to
the Team label, and press your left or right arrow keys. By default, you
will be assigned to a team automatically, but you can change that here
if you prefer. One of the roles you can play instead of joining a team
is that of Observer. This is not a bad idea if you are new to the game,
because it lets you watch how others are handling themselves.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8868f3.large.jpg"><img src="8868f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. The Join screen lets you define your callsign as well as your
team.
</p></div></div><p>
The Join screen also lets you enter the name of a server manually,
rather than search for it. This is useful for hosting private games on
a local LAN. Speaking of hosting games, I'm sure you noticed the Start
Server option at the bottom of that list. Let's go ahead and join the
game. Scroll back up to Connect and press Enter.
</p><p>
I hope you are ready, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, because the action starts
immediately, and some of these players are, well,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>seasoned</em></span>. Move
your tank using your mouse, and fire by clicking with the left-mouse
button. These tanks are highly maneuverable and
even can jump in
some games (you do this by pressing the Tab key). To learn all
the
keystrokes, by the way, press Esc at any time, and select Help. During play,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>BZFlag</em></span> provides an extensive heads-up display with stats on players,
kills, personal scores, team scores and more (Figure 4). Keep an eye
on the map to your lower left, as it can alert you to enemy tanks. If
you can drive, fire and type at the same time, press N to send a chat
message to the group, or M to send one only to your teammates. If you see the boss
coming, press F12 to exit the game in a hurry. Just a little joke,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>. I would never suggest that you play this at work.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8868f4.large.jpg"><img src="8868f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. The action is fast and tense, with tanks blowing up everywhere you turn. Be careful not to be one of them.
</p></div></div><p>
The hour is getting late, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, but I don't want to leave
you with the impression that all the virtual worlds that may exist in
our systems are built entirely on destruction and mayhem. You can,
in fact, build an entire civilization, including a city, its farms,
factories, markets and every other trapping of modern (or premodern)
civilization. Download <span   class="emphasis"><em>Lincity</em></span> (or check your distribution CDs)
and start building. The idea of this highly addictive and time-consuming
game is for you to build a city, and in the process, feed and clothe your
people, and create jobs so you can build and sustain an economy. Invest in
renewable energy as you strive to build a civic Utopia (Figure 5).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8868f5.large.jpg"><img src="8868f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. <span  class="emphasis"><em>Lincity</em></span> is a computerized city simulation that makes you wonder why creating a Utopia is so darn difficult.
</p></div></div><p>
As things get better and better, you can save your game and get back to
creating this ideal world of yours. Okay, you're right, it's not as easy
at it sounds. The clock is ticking, and the months go by fast. Without
careful attention, your world may wither away in its own poisons. I
should warn you that starting from scratch may be a bit of a confidence
destroyer. Why not start when things are good? When the game begins, click
the Menu button in the upper left. The main window then provides you
with some choices, including one to Load a saved game. The game comes with
two: one is called Good Times and the other (you guessed it), Bad Times. I
recommend Good Times to get your virtual flippers wet. When you get so
good at this that you feel you can fix anything, go for the Bad Times,
and see if you can pull your city back from being $25 million in debt.
</p><p>
The clock, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, it is telling us that closing time is upon
us. With all these sounds of artillery and explosions coming from your
workstations, it seems obvious that we will have to stay open just a
little longer. Fran&ccedil;ois will happily refill your glasses one final time
before we say, &ldquo;<span   class="emphasis"><em>Au revoir</em></span>&rdquo;. The games may be all virtual,
but the wine is real. It's a good thing too, but I'd hate to have it spilled
every time someone fired a shot. On that note, please raise your glasses,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, and let us all drink to one another's health.
<span   class="emphasis"><em>A votre sant&eacute; Bon app&eacute;tit!</em></span>
