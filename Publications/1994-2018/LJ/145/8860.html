Here are some <span   class="emphasis"><em>Blackjack</em></span> card-handling routines you can count on.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1241580.0x1339450"></a></h2></div></div><p>
In my last few columns, we've had a good stab at starting to build
a <span   class="emphasis"><em>Blackjack</em></span> game within the confines and capabilities of the shell. The
last column wrapped up the discussion of how to shuffle an array of 52
integer values and how to unwrap a given card to identify suit and rank
so it can be displayed attractively.
</p><p>
This column goes further into the mathematics of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Blackjack</em></span>, with a
routine that can be given an array of cards and return the numeric value
of the hand. If you're a <span   class="emphasis"><em>Blackjack</em></span> player though, you'll instantly catch
something we're skipping for now. In <span   class="emphasis"><em>Blackjack</em></span>, an Ace can be scored
as having one point or 11 points, which is how the hand of Ace +
King can be a blackjack (that is, worth 21 points).
</p><p>
We'll just count the Ace as being worth 11 points for this first pass
through the game, and perhaps later we'll come back and add
the nuance of having the Ace be worth one or 11. Note, by the way,
that this adds significant complexity, because there are then four ways to
score the hand of Ace + Ace (as 2, 12, 12 or 22), so theoretically, the
routine that returns the numeric value of a given hand actually
should return an array of values.
</p><p>
But, let's start with the straightforward case. Last month, I showed how
to extract the rank of a given card with the equation:

<pre     class="programlisting">

rank=$(( $card % 13 ))

</pre>
</p><p>
In a typically UNIX way, rank actually ranges from 0-12, rather than the
expected 1-13, so because we'd like to leave cards #2-10 in each suit to
be the corresponding value, that means we have the rather odd situation
where rank 0 = King, rank 1 = Ace, rank 11 = Jack and rank 12 = Queen.
No matter, really, because we're going to have to map card rank into
numeric values anyway for one or more of the cards&mdash;however we slice it.
</p><p>
With that in mind, here's a function that can turn a set of card values
into a point value, remembering that all face cards are worth ten points
and that, for now, the Ace is worth only 11 points:

<pre     class="programlisting">

function handValue
{
   # feed this as many cards as are in the hand
   handvalue=0  # initialize
   for cardvalue
   do
     rankvalue=$(( $cardvalue % 13 ))
     case $rankvalue in
       0|11|12 ) rankvalue=10   ;;
       1       ) rankvalue=11   ;;
     esac

     handvalue=$(( $handvalue + $rankvalue ))
    done
}

</pre>
</p><p>
Let's examine some nuances to this before we go
much further. First, notice that the conditional case statements can
be pretty sophisticated, so we catch the three situations of rankvalue =
0 (King), rankvalue = 11 (Jack) and rankvalue = 12 (Queen) with a succinct
0|11|12 notation.
</p><p>
What I like even better with this function is that by using the for
loop without specifying a looping constraint, the shell automatically
steps through all values given to the function and then terminates,
meaning we have a nice, flexible function that will work just as
well with four or five cards as it would with only two. (It turns out
that you can't have more than five cards in a
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Blackjack</em></span> hand,
because if you get five cards and haven't gone over a point value of 21,
you have a &ldquo;five card monty&rdquo;, and it's rather a good hand!)
</p><p>
Invoking this is typically awkward, as are all functions in the shell,
because you can't actually return a value and assign it to a variable
or include it in an echo statement or something similar. Here's how we can easily
calculate the initial point values of the player's hand and the dealer's:

<pre     class="programlisting">

handValue ${player[1]} ${player[2]}
echo "Player's hand is worth $handvalue points"

handValue ${dealer[1]} ${dealer[2]}
echo "Dealer's hand is worth $handvalue points"

</pre>
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Blackjack</em></span> is a game that's very much in the dealer's
favor, because the player has to take cards and play through the hand
before the dealer has to take a single card. There's a significant
house advantage for this reason, but in this case, we now can have a
loop where we ask players if they want to receive another card (a
&ldquo;hit&rdquo;) or stick with the hand they have (a
&ldquo;stand&rdquo;) by simply keeping
track of their cards and invoking handValue after each hit to ensure
they haven't exceeded 21 points (a &ldquo;bust&rdquo;).
</p><p>
To get this working though, we have to restructure some of the code (not
an uncommon occurrence as a program evolves). Instead of simply referencing
the deck itself, we now have a pair of arrays, one for the player
and one for the dealer. To initialize them, we drop the value -1 into
each slot (in the initialization function). Then, we deal the hands with:

<pre     class="programlisting">

player[1]=${newdeck[1]}
player[2]=${newdeck[3]}
nextplayercard=3           # player starts with two cards

dealer[1]=${newdeck[2]}
dealer[2]=${newdeck[4]}
nextdealercard=3           # dealer also has two cards

nextcard=5                 # we've dealt the first four cards already

</pre>
</p><p>
You can see the tracking variables we need to use to remember how far down
the deck we've moved. We don't want to give two players the same card!
</p><p>
With that loop in mind, here's the main player loop:

<pre     class="programlisting">

while [ $handvalue -lt 22 ]
do

  echo -n "H)it or S)tand? "

  read answer
  if [ $answer = "stand" -o $answer = "s" ] ; then
     break
  fi

  player[$nextplayercard]=${newdeck[$nextcard]}

  showCard ${player[$nextplayercard]}

  echo "** You've been dealt: $cardname"

  handValue ${player[1]} ${player[2]} ${player[3]} ${player[4]} ${player[5]}

  nextcard=$(( $nextcard + 1 ))
  nextplayercard=$(( $nextplayercard + 1 ))
done

</pre>
</p><p>
That's the simplified version of this loop. The more sophisticated
version can be found on the <i  >Linux Journal</i> FTP site
(<a href="../listings/145/8860.tgz" target="_self">ftp.linuxjournal.com/pub/lj/listings/issue145/8860.tgz</a>).
Notice that it's
pretty straightforward. As long as the hand value is less than 22
points, the player can add cards or opt to stand. In the latter case,
the break statement pulls you out of the while loop, ready to proceed
with the program.
</p><p>
Because nextcard is the pointer into the deck that keeps track of how many
cards have been dealt, it needs to be incremented each time a card is dealt, but
as we're using nextplayercard to keep track of the individual player
array, we also need to increment that each time through the loop too.
</p><p>
Let's look at one simple tweak before we wrap up, however. Instead of
merely asking whether the player wants to hit or stand, we can recommend
a move by calculating whether the hand value is less than 16:

<pre     class="programlisting">

if [ $handvalue -lt 16 ] ; then
   echo -n "H)it or S)tand? (recommended: hit) "
else
  	  echo -n "H)it or S)tand? (recommended: stand) "
fi

</pre>
</p><p>
Generally, we'll have a quick demo, but notice that we do have
some bugs in this script that need to be dealt with first, though:

<pre     class="programlisting">

$ blackjack.sh
** You've been dealt: 3 of Clubs, Queen of Clubs
H)it or S)tand? (recommended: hit) h
** You've been dealt: 8 of Hearts
H)it or S)tand? (recommended: stand) s
You stand with a hand value of 21

</pre>
</p><p>
Perfect. And here's another run:

<pre     class="programlisting">

$ blackjack.sh
** You've been dealt: 4 of Clubs, Jack of Hearts
H)it or S)tand? (recommended: hit) h
** You've been dealt: 10 of Diamonds

*** Busted!  Your hand is worth 24 **

</pre>
</p><p>
Ah, tough luck on that last one!
</p><p>
Rather than point out specific problems, let me note here that being
dealt either of the following two sequences is quite a problem: A A or
2 2 2 2 3 4. Can you see why?
</p><p>
Next month, we'll look at solving these problems!
