How to use RTNETLINK to develop applications that control networking.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24cc580.0x25c42f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
NETLINK is a facility in the Linux operating system for user-space
applications to communicate with the kernel. NETLINK is an extension
of the standard socket implementation. Using NETLINK, an application
can send/receive information to/from different kernel features, such as
networking, to check current status and control them.
</p><p>
In this article, I describe how a programmer can use the networking
environment manipulation capability of NETLINK known as RTNETLINK.
I discuss some areas of use of RTNETLINK, the relevant
socket operations, the functionality, how RTNETLINK messages are formed
and finally, provide a set of sample code that uses RTNETLINK. RTNETLINK for the
IP version 4 environment is referred to as NETLINK_ROUTE, and for the IP
version 6 environment, it is referred to as NETLINK_ROUTE6. The
explanations given here are applicable for both
IP versions 4 and 6.
</p><p>
Developers of network layer protocol handlers can use RTNETLINK to
modify and monitor different components of networking, such as
the routing table and network interfaces. There are many existing and
upcoming protocol standards at the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)
that can be implemented in user space. These implementations will
require manipulating the routing and knowing what is being modified by
other processes. Some of these protocol categories are as follows:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Dynamic routing protocols: protocols of this category, including the Routing
Information Protocol (RIP), Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) and Exterior
Gateway Protocol (EGP) actively manage the routing environment of a
host while communicating with other equally capable hosts or routers in
the network or Internet.
</p></li><li><p>
Mobility protocols: hosts that are mobile and connect to different
networks at different times use protocols such as Mobile IP (MIP),
Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and Network Mobility (NEMO) to manage
routing to maintain connectivity and continuity of communications.
</p></li><li><p>
Ad hoc networking protocols: hosts that are mobile and located in
places where there is no networking infrastructure, such as routers
and WLAN access points, require peer-to-peer communications with
differently configured hosts. Mobile computers of rescue workers in an
earthquake-struck area or other such emergencies can use ad hoc networking
protocols. These protocols, such as the Ad hoc On-demand Distance Vector
(AODV) and Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR), require managing the
routing to find and communicate with other hosts using neighboring hosts
as routers and gateways.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
It helps reduce the complexity of the kernel code if you implement these
protocols in user space. Further, it simplifies the development and
testing of these protocols because of the availability of many user-space
development tools. Problems, such as kernel crashes, that are likely
with kernel-based code when testing or when used by end users will
not occur in a user-space protocol handler.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24cc580.0x25c4768"></a>
Socket Operations</h2></div></div><p>
The socket implementation of Linux allows two end points to
communicate. The socket API provides a standard set of functions and data
structures. With RTNETLINK, the two end points in communication are
user space and kernel space. The following sequence of socket calls have
to be made when manipulating the networking environment through
RTNETLINK:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Open socket.
</p></li><li><p>
Bind socket to local address (using process ID).
</p></li><li><p>
Send message to the other end point.
</p></li><li><p>
Receive message from the other end point.
</p></li><li><p>
Close socket.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
The socket() function opens an unattached end point to communicate with
the kernel. The function prototype of this call is as follows:

<pre     class="programlisting">

int socket(int domain, int type, int protocol);

</pre>
</p><p>
The domain refers to what type of socket is being used. For RTNETLINK,
we use AF_NETLINK (PF_NETLINK). type refers to the type of protocol
used when communicating. This can be raw (SOCK_RAW) or datagram
(SOCK_DGRAM). This is not relevant for RTNETLINK sockets and either can be
used. protocol refers to the exact NETLINK capability that we use;
in our case, it is NETLINK_ROUTE. This function returns an integer with a
positive number called the socket descriptor, if the socket opening was
successful. This descriptor will be used in all the future RTNETLINK calls
until the socket is closed. If there was a failure, a negative value is
returned, and the system error variable errno included in errno.h is set
to the appropriate error code.
</p><p>
The following is an example of a call to open an RTNETLINK socket:

<pre     class="programlisting">

int fd;
...
fd = socket(AF_NETLINK, SOCK_RAW, NETLINK_ROUTE);

</pre>
</p><p>
Once the socket is opened, it has to be bound to a local address. The user
application can use a unique 32-bit ID to identify the local address. The
function prototype of bind is as follows:

<pre     class="programlisting">

int bind(int fd, struct sockaddr *my_addr,
                              socklen_t addrlen);

</pre>
</p><p>
To bind, the caller must provide a local address using the sockaddr_nl
structure. This structure in the linux/netlink.h #include file has the
following format:

<pre     class="programlisting">

struct sockaddr_nl
{
  sa_family_t     nl_family; // AF_NETLINK
  unsigned short  nl_pad;    // zero
  __u32           nl_pid;    // process pid
  __u32           nl_groups; // multicast grps mask
};

</pre>
</p><p>
The nl_pid must contain a unique ID, which can be created using the
return of the getpid() function. This function returns the process ID of
the current user process that opened the RTNETLINK socket. But, if our
process consists of multiple threads with each thread opening different
RTNETLINK sockets, a modified process ID can be used.
</p><p>
Once this structure is filled, the binding can be done. The bind function
returns zero if the operation succeeded. A negative number is returned in
the case of failure, and the system error variable is set. The following
is an example of calling bind:

<pre     class="programlisting">

struct sockaddr_nl la;
...
bzero(&amp;la, sizeof(la));
la.nl_family = AF_NETLINK;
la.nl_pad = 0;
la.nl_pid = getpid();
la.nl_groups = 0;
rtn = bind(fd, (struct sockaddr*) &amp;la, sizeof(la));

</pre>
</p><p>
If the operation you require is multicast-based, you must set
nl_groups to join the multicast group associated with the required
RTNETLINK operation. For example, if you want to be notified of the
changes to the routing table by other processes, you must OR (|) the
RTMGRP_IPV4_ROUTE and RTMGRP_NOTIFY.
</p><p>
Sending routing RTNETLINK messages to the kernel is done through the use
of the standard sendmsg() function of the socket interface. The following
is the prototype of this function:

<pre     class="programlisting">

ssize_t sendmsg(int fd, const struct msghdr *msg,
                                      int flags);

</pre>
</p><p>
msg is a pointer to a msghdr structure. The following is the format of
this structure:

<pre     class="programlisting">

struct msghdr
{
  void *msg_name;        //Address to send to
  socklen_t msg_namelen; //Length of address data

  struct iovec *msg_iov; //Vector of data to send
  size_t msg_iovlen;     //Number of iovec entries

  void *msg_control;     //Ancillary data
  size_t msg_controllen; //Ancillary data buf len

  int msg_flags;         //Flags on received msg
};

</pre>
</p><p>
The msg_name is a pointer to a variable of the type struct
sockaddr_nl. This is the destination address of the sendmsg()
function. Because this message is directed to the kernel, all variables of
sockaddr_nl will be initialized to zero, except the nl_family member
variable. The field msg_namelen should contain the size of a struct
sockaddr_nl.
</p><p>
msg_iov should contain a pointer to a struct iovec, which is filled with
the RTNETLINK message relevant to the request being made. The caller is
allowed to place multiple RTNETLINK requests, if required. msg_iovlen
points to the number of struct iovec structures that were placed in
msg_iov. The rest of the variables are initialized to zero.
</p><p>
To receive RTNETLINK messages, the recv() function is used. Here is the
prototype of this function:

<pre     class="programlisting">

ssize_t recv(int fd, void *buf, size_t len,
                                      int flags);

</pre>
</p><p>
The second and third variables are a pointer to a buffer to place the
bytes read and the length of this buffer, respectively. For RTNETLINK, the buffer will
contain a set of RTNETLINK messages that have to be read one after
the other using a set of macros provided in the netlink.h and rtnetlink.h
#include files. flags is a set of flags to indicate how the receive
should be performed. For RTNETLINK, this simply can be initialized to zero.
</p><p>
Once the socket communications are complete, the socket has to be closed
using the close() function. Here's the prototype of this function:

<pre     class="programlisting">

int close(int fd);

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24cc580.0x25c5478"></a>
RTNETLINK Functionality</h2></div></div><p>
A programmer who develops applications that use RTNETLINK must include
the following #include files at a minimum:

<pre     class="programlisting">

#include &lt;bits/sockaddr.h&gt;
#include &lt;asm/types.h&gt;
#include &lt;linux/rtnetlink.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
These files contain the different definitions, such as data types and
structures, required to make RTNETLINK calls. Here is a short explanation
of what is defined in these files relevant to RTNETLINK:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
bits/sockaddr.h: provides the definitions for the addresses used by
socket functions.
</p></li><li><p>
asm/types.h: provides the definitions of the data types used in the
header files related to NETLINK and RTNETLINK.
</p></li><li><p>
linux/rtnetlink.h: provides the macros and data structures that are used
in RTNETLINK. Because RTNETLINK is based on NETLINK, this also includes
the linux/netlink.h. netlink.h defines the general macros and structures
that are used in all the NETLINK-based capabilities.
</p></li><li><p>
sys/socket.h: provides the function prototypes and the different data
structures related to the socket implementation.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
The operations that can be invoked using RTNETLINK are defined in the
rtnetlink.h file. Each of the operations provides three possibilities of
manipulation: add/update, delete or query. These three possibilities are
identified by NEW, DEL and GET. Following are the manipulation operations
allowed by RTNETLINK.
</p><p>
General networking environment manipulation services:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Link layer interface settings: identified by RTM_NEWLINK, RTM_DELLINK and
RTM_GETLINK.
</p></li><li><p>
Network layer (IP) interface settings: RTM_NEWADDR, RTM_DELADDR and
RTM_GETADDR.
</p></li><li><p>
Network layer routing tables: RTM_NEWROUTE, RTM_DELROUTE and
RTM_GETROUTE.
</p></li><li><p>
Neighbor cache that associates network layer and link layer
addressing: RTM_NEWNEIGH, RTM_DELNEIGH and RTM_GETNEIGH.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Traffic shaping (management) services:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Routing rules to direct network layer packets: RTM_NEWRULE,
RTM_DELRULE and RTM_GETRULE.
</p></li><li><p>
Queuing discipline settings associated with network interfaces:
RTM_NEWQDISC, RTM_DELQDISC and RTM_GETQDISC.
</p></li><li><p>
Traffic classes used together with queues: RTM_NEWTCLASS,
RTM_DELTCLASS and RTM_GETTCLASS.
</p></li><li><p>
Traffic filters associated with a queuing: RTM_NEWTFILTER,
RTM_DELTFILTER and RTM_GETTFILTER.
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24cc580.0x25bc910"></a>
Forming and Reading RTNETLINK Messages</h2></div></div><p>
RTNETLINK employs a request-response mechanism to send and receive
information to manipulate the networking environment. A request or a
response of RTNETLINK consists of a stream of message structures. These
structures are filled by the caller, in the case of a request, or filled
by the kernel, in the case of a response. To place information into these
structures or to retrieve information, RTNETLINK provides a set of macros
(using #define statements). Every request must contain the following
structure at the beginning:

<pre     class="programlisting">

struct nlmsghdr
{
  __u32  nlmsg_len;   //Length of msg incl. hdr
  __u16  nlmsg_type;  //Message content
  __u16  nlmsg_flags; //Additional flags
  __u32  nlmsg_seq;   //Sequence number
  __u32  nlmsg_pid;   //Sending process PID
}

</pre>
</p><p>
This structure provides information about what type of RTNETLINK message
is specified in the rest of the request. It is also called the NETLINK
header. Here is a brief explanation of these fields:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
nlmsg_len: should contain the length of the whole RTNETLINK message,
including the length of the nlmsghdr structure. This field can be filled
using the macro NLMSG_ALIGN(len), where len is the length of the message
that follows this structure.
</p></li><li><p>
nlmsg_type: a 16-bit flag to indicate what is contained in the message,
such as RTM_NEWROUTE.
</p></li><li><p>
nlmsg_flags: another 16-bit flag that further clarifies the operation
specified in nlmsg_type, such as NLM_F_REQUEST.
</p></li><li><p>
nlmsg_seq and nlmsg_pid: these two fields are used to identify
an RTNETLINK request uniquely. The caller can place the process ID and a sequence
number in these fields.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Following the nlmsghdr structure are the structures relevant to the
operation being requested. Depending on the type of RTNETLINK operation,
the caller must include one or more of the following structures. These
are called the RTNETLINK operation headers:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
struct rtmsg: retrieving or modifying entries of the routing table
requires the use of this structure.
</p></li><li><p>
struct rtnexthop: a next hop in a routing entry is the next host to
consider on the way to the destination. A single routing entry can have
multiple next hops. Each next hop entry has many types of attributes,
such as the network interface in addition to the next hop IP address.
</p></li><li><p>
struct rta_cacheinfo: each route entry consists of status information
that the kernel updates regularly, mainly usage information. Using
this structure, a user can retrieve this information.
</p></li><li><p>
struct ifaddrmsg: retrieving or modifying network layer attributes
associated with a network interface requires the use of this structure.
</p></li><li><p>
struct ifa_cacheinfo: similar to a route entry, a network interface
also consists of information about its status, which is updated by the
kernel. This structure is used to retrieve this information.
</p></li><li><p>
struct ndmsg: retrieving or modifying the association information between
link layer addressing and network layer addressing of neighbors, referred
to as neighbor discovery, is specified through this structure.
</p></li><li><p>
struct nda_cacheinfo: holds the kernel updated information related to
each neighbor discovery entry.
</p></li><li><p>
struct ifinfomsg: retrieving or modifying the link layer attributes
related to a network interface requires the use of this structure.
</p></li><li><p>
struct tcmsg: retrieving or modifying traffic shaping attributes is
supplied using this structure.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Following the RTNETLINK operation header are the attributes related to the
operation, such as an interface number and IP address. These attributes
are specified using the struct rtattr. There is one structure for each
attribute. This structure has the following format:

<pre     class="programlisting">

struct rtattr
{
  unsigned short  rta_len;
  unsigned short  rta_type;
};

</pre>
</p><p>
Immediately following this structure is the value of the attribute. An
attribute such as an IP version 4 address will occupy a 4-byte area. The
variable rta_len should contain the size of this structure plus the
size of the attribute. rta_type should contain the value identifying
the attribute, which are given in the enumerations defined in
rtnetlink.h. enum rtattr_type_t and other enumerations provide the
attribute identifiers, such as IFA_ADDRESS and NDA_DST, to be used in this
field. The maximum number of attributes that you can attach is up to
only the macro RTATTR_MAX. An example of attaching an attribute is as follows:

<pre     class="programlisting">

rtap-&gt;rta_type = RTA_DST;
rtap-&gt;rta_len = sizeof(struct rtattr) + 4;
inet_pton(AF_INET, dsts,
     ((char *)rtap) + sizeof(struct rtattr));

</pre>
</p><p>
Information that is received from an RTNETLINK socket is again a stream
of structures. A programmer has to identify and extract information
by moving a pointer along this byte stream. To simplify this process,
RTNETLINK provides a set of macros to make the buffer positioning easier:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
NLMSG_NEXT(nlh, len): returns the pointer to the next NETLINK header. nlh
is the header returned previously, and len is the total length of the
message. This will be called in a loop to read every message.
</p></li><li><p>
NLMSG_DATA(nlh): returns the pointer to the RTNETLINK header related to
the requested operation given the NETLINK header. If a route entry is
being manipulated, this will return a pointer to a struct rtmsg.
</p></li><li><p>
RTM_RTA(r), IFA_RTA(r), NDA_RTA(r), IFLA_RTA(r) and TCA_RTA(r): return
a pointer to the start of the attributes of the respective RTNETLINK
operation given the header of the RTNETLINK message (r).
</p></li><li><p>
RTM_PAYLOAD(n), IFA_PAYLOAD(n), NDA_PAYLOAD(n), IFLA_PAYLOAD(n) and TCA_PAYLOAD(n): return the total length of the attributes that follow
the RTNETLINK operation header given the pointer to the NETLINK header
(n).
</p></li><li><p>
RTA_NEXT(rta, attrlen): returns a pointer to the start of the next
attribute given the last returned attribute (rta) and the remaining size
(attrlen) of the attributes.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Considering a simple example where an RTNETLINK request to retrieve the
routing table was sent, the reply is processed in the following manner:

<pre     class="programlisting">

char *buf; // ptr to RTNETLINK data
int nll; // byte length of all data
struct nlmsghdr *nlp;
struct rtmsg *rtp;
int rtl;
struct rtattr *rtap;

nlp = (struct nlmsghdr *) buf;
for(;NLMSG_OK(nlp, nll); nlp=NLMSG_NEXT(nlp, nll))
{

  // get RTNETLINK message header
  rtp = (struct rtmsg *) NLMSG_DATA(nlp);

  // get start of attributes
  rtap = (struct rtattr *) RTM_RTA(rtp);

  // get length of attributes
  rtl = RTM_PAYLOAD(nlp);

  // loop &amp; get every attribute
  for(;RTA_OK(rtap, rtl); rtap=RTA_NEXT(rtap, rtl))
  {

    // check and process every attribute

  }
}

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24cc580.0x25bdaf0"></a>
RTNETLINK Sample Walk-Through</h2></div></div><p>
The sample code presented here focuses on three of the operations that
can be performed on the routing table:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
get_routing_table: reads the main routing table in the system.
</p></li><li><p>
set_routing_table: inserts a new routing entry to the table.
</p></li><li><p>
mon_routing_table: monitors the routing table changes.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
All three samples use a similar main() function that calls a set of
subfunctions to form RTNETLINK messages and send, receive and process
the received messages. To simplify the explanation, no error handling
is considered. These samples perform on the IP version 4 environment of
the system (AF_INET). Here is the main() function:

<pre     class="programlisting">

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{

  // open socket
  fd = socket(AF_NETLINK, SOCK_RAW, NETLINK_ROUTE);

  // setup local address &amp; bind using
  // this address
  bzero(&amp;la, sizeof(la));
  la.nl_family = AF_NETLINK;
  la.nl_pid = getpid();
  bind(fd, (struct sockaddr*) &amp;la, sizeof(la));


  // sub functions to create RTNETLINK message,
  // send over socket, receive reply &amp; process
  // message
  form_request();
  send_request();
  recv_reply();
  read_reply();

  // close socket
  close(fd);
}

</pre>
</p><p>
Similar to the above function, the two functions that perform the
socket communications are almost common to all the samples. These
two functions simply send a formed message to the kernel and receive
messages sent by the kernel. Exceptions here are the set_routing_table
and mon_routing_table samples. In set_routing_table, a receive phase is
not considered. In the mon_routing_table, a send phase is not present
as it attempts to monitor only the state of the routing environment to
see what is being changed. This information is mulitcast by the kernel
to all the RTNETLINK sockets that are in the appropriate receiving state.
</p><p>
First, here's the code for send_request():

<pre     class="programlisting">

void send_request()
{
  // create the remote address
  // to communicate
  bzero(&amp;pa, sizeof(pa));
  pa.nl_family = AF_NETLINK;

  // initialize &amp; create the struct msghdr supplied
  // to the sendmsg() function
  bzero(&amp;msg, sizeof(msg));
  msg.msg_name = (void *) &amp;pa;
  msg.msg_namelen = sizeof(pa);

  // place the pointer &amp; size of the RTNETLINK
  // message in the struct msghdr
  iov.iov_base = (void *) &amp;req.nl;
  iov.iov_len = req.nl.nlmsg_len;
  msg.msg_iov = &amp;iov;
  msg.msg_iovlen = 1;

  // send the RTNETLINK message to kernel
  rtn = sendmsg(fd, &amp;msg, 0);
}

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24cc580.0x25be018"></a></h2></div></div><p>
And, here's the recv_reply():

<pre     class="programlisting">

void recv_reply()
{
  char *p;

  // initialize the socket read buffer
  bzero(buf, sizeof(buf));

  p = buf;
  nll = 0;

  // read from the socket until the NLMSG_DONE is
  // returned in the type of the RTNETLINK message
  // or if it was a monitoring socket
  while(1) {
    rtn = recv(fd, p, sizeof(buf) - nll, 0);

    nlp = (struct nlmsghdr *) p;

    if(nlp-&gt;nlmsg_type == NLMSG_DONE)
      break;

    // increment the buffer pointer to place
    // next message
    p += rtn;

    // increment the total size by the size of
    // the last received message
    nll += rtn;

    if((la.nl_groups &amp; RTMGRP_IPV4_ROUTE)
                      == RTMGRP_IPV4_ROUTE)
      break;
  }
}

</pre>
</p><p>
The above functions and the following ones use a set of globally defined
variables. These are used for all the socket operations as well as for
forming and processing RTNETLINK messages:

<pre     class="programlisting">

// buffer to hold the RTNETLINK request
struct {
  struct nlmsghdr nl;
  struct rtmsg    rt;
  char            buf[8192];
} req;

The get_routing_table sample retrieves the main routing table of the
IPv4 environment. The form_request() function is as follows:

<pre     class="programlisting">

void form_request()
{
  // initialize the request buffer
  bzero(&amp;req, sizeof(req));

  // set the NETLINK header
  req.nl.nlmsg_len
             = NLMSG_LENGTH(sizeof(struct rtmsg));
  req.nl.nlmsg_flags = NLM_F_REQUEST | NLM_F_DUMP;
  req.nl.nlmsg_type = RTM_GETROUTE;

  // set the routing message header
  req.rt.rtm_family = AF_INET;
  req.rt.rtm_table = RT_TABLE_MAIN;
}

</pre>
</p><p>
The received message for the RTNETLINK request in the buf variable to
retrieve the routing table is processed by the read_reply() function. Here
is the code of this function:

<pre     class="programlisting">

void read_reply()
{
  // string to hold content of the route
  // table (i.e. one entry)
  char dsts[24], gws[24], ifs[16], ms[24];

  // outer loop: loops thru all the NETLINK
  // headers that also include the route entry
  // header
  nlp = (struct nlmsghdr *) buf;
  for(;NLMSG_OK(nlp, nll);nlp=NLMSG_NEXT(nlp, nll))
  {

    // get route entry header
    rtp = (struct rtmsg *) NLMSG_DATA(nlp);

    // we are only concerned about the
    // main route table
    if(rtp-&gt;rtm_table != RT_TABLE_MAIN)
      continue;

    // init all the strings
    bzero(dsts, sizeof(dsts));
    bzero(gws, sizeof(gws));
    bzero(ifs, sizeof(ifs));
    bzero(ms, sizeof(ms));

    // inner loop: loop thru all the attributes of
    // one route entry
    rtap = (struct rtattr *) RTM_RTA(rtp);
    rtl = RTM_PAYLOAD(nlp);
    for(;RTA_OK(rtap, rtl);rtap=RTA_NEXT(rtap,rtl))
    {
      switch(rtap-&gt;rta_type)
      {
        // destination IPv4 address
        case RTA_DST:
          inet_ntop(AF_INET, RTA_DATA(rtap),
                                     dsts, 24);
          break;

        // next hop IPv4 address
        case RTA_GATEWAY:
          inet_ntop(AF_INET, RTA_DATA(rtap),
                                     gws, 24);
          break;

        // unique ID associated with the network
        // interface
        case RTA_OIF:
          sprintf(ifs, "%d",
                   *((int *) RTA_DATA(rtap)));
        default:
          break;
      }
    }
    sprintf(ms, "%d", rtp-&gt;rtm_dst_len);

    printf("dst %s/%s gw %s if %s\n",
                          dsts, ms, gws, ifs);
  }
}

</pre>
</p><p>
The set_routing_table sample sends an RTNETLINK request to insert an
entry to the routing table. The route entry that is inserted is a host
route (32-bit network prefix) to a private IP address (192.168.0.100)
through interface number 2. These values are defined in the variables
dsts (destination IP address), ifcn (interface number) and pn (prefix
length). You can run the get_routing_table sample to get an idea about
the interface numbers and the IP network in your system. Here's the
form_request():

<pre     class="programlisting">

void form_request()
{
  // attributes of the route entry
  char dsts[24] = "192.168.0.100";
  int ifcn = 2, pn = 32;

  // initialize RTNETLINK request buffer
  bzero(&amp;req, sizeof(req));

  // compute the initial length of the
  // service request
  rtl = sizeof(struct rtmsg);

  // add first attrib:
  // set destination IP addr and increment the
  // RTNETLINK buffer size
  rtap = (struct rtattr *) req.buf;
  rtap-&gt;rta_type = RTA_DST;
  rtap-&gt;rta_len = sizeof(struct rtattr) + 4;
  inet_pton(AF_INET, dsts,
     ((char *)rtap) + sizeof(struct rtattr));
  rtl += rtap-&gt;rta_len;

  // add second attrib:
  // set ifc index and increment the size
  rtap = (struct rtattr *) (((char *)rtap)
            + rtap-&gt;rta_len);
  rtap-&gt;rta_type = RTA_OIF;
  rtap-&gt;rta_len = sizeof(struct rtattr) + 4;
  memcpy(((char *)rtap) + sizeof(struct rtattr),
           &amp;ifcn, 4);
  rtl += rtap-&gt;rta_len;

  // setup the NETLINK header
  req.nl.nlmsg_len = NLMSG_LENGTH(rtl);
  req.nl.nlmsg_flags = NLM_F_REQUEST | NLM_F_CREATE;
  req.nl.nlmsg_type = RTM_NEWROUTE;

  // setup the service header (struct rtmsg)
  req.rt.rtm_family = AF_INET;
  req.rt.rtm_table = RT_TABLE_MAIN;
  req.rt.rtm_protocol = RTPROT_STATIC;
  req.rt.rtm_scope = RT_SCOPE_UNIVERSE;
  req.rt.rtm_type = RTN_UNICAST;
  // set the network prefix size
  req.rt.rtm_dst_len = pn;
}

</pre>
</p><p>
The mon_routing_table sample reads the RTNETLINK messages received when
other processes change the system's main routing table. This function
will use the same read_reply() function to process the messages. The
main() function requires a slight change. Because this operation involves
listening to multicast messages of the kernel, the local address
to which we bind, it also must include the two flags RTMGRP_IPV4_ROUTE and
RTMGRP_NOTIFY. Here is the required change:

<pre     class="programlisting">

la.nl_groups = RTMGRP_IPV4_ROUTE | RTMGRP_NOTIFY;

</pre>
</p><p>
Once mon_routing_table is executed, run a <tt  >route
add</tt> or a <tt  >route del</tt>
command from another shell prompt to see the results.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
RTNETLINK is a simple, yet versatile way of manipulating the networking
environment of a Linux host. User-space network protocol handlers are
ideal candidates for using RTNETLINK. The advanced IP routing command
suite, referred to as IPROUTE2, is based on RTNETLINK. More information
about the different operations and flags of RTNETLINK can be found at
NETLINK(7) and RTNETLINK(7).
