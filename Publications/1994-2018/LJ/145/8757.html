You don't always need a Java Virtual Machine to run Java in an embedded
system.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26a2580.0x279a2f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
This article discusses how to use GCJ, part of the GCC compiler suite,
in an embedded Linux project. Like all tools, GCJ has benefits, namely
the ability to code in a high-level language like Java, and its share
of drawbacks as well. The notion of getting GCJ running on an embedded
target may be daunting at first, but you'll see that doing so requires
less effort than you may think.
</p><p>
After reading the article, you should be inspired to try this out on a
target to see whether GCJ can fit into your next project. The Java language
has all sorts of nifty features, like automatic garbage collection,
an extensive, robust run-time library and expressive object-oriented
constructs that help you quickly develop reliable code.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26a2580.0x279a450"></a>
Why Use GCJ in the First Place?</h2></div></div><p>
The native code compiler for Java does what is says: compiles your Java
source down to the machine code for the target. This means you won't
have to get a JVM (Java Virtual Machine) on your target. When you
run the program's code, it won't start a VM, it will simply load and run
like any other program. This doesn't necessarily mean your code will
run faster. Sometimes you get better performance numbers for byte code
running on a hot-spot VM versus GCJ-compiled code.
</p><p>
One advantage of using GCJ is that you save space by not needing the
JVM. You may save money in royalties as well. Furthermore, using GCJ
lets you deliver a solution using all open-source software, and that's
usually a good thing.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26a2580.0x279a5b0"></a>
Pitfalls</h2></div></div><p>
The first thing embedded engineers reach for when creating a root filesystem for a target is trusty uClibc, a compact implementation of the
glibc library. For those new to using Linux on an embedded target,
the standard C library can be a bit on the large side when working with
targets that may have only 8MB (for example) for a root filesystem.
To conserve space on an embedded system's root filesystem, engineers
will switch from the standard C library to something smaller, like uClibc.
GCJ requires unicode support, which is not supported by uClibc, so glibc
is a requirement.
</p><p>
The standard library for GCJ weighs in at 16MB, so even if you could
conserve space by switching to a smaller standard C library, it wouldn't
make that much difference overall. The standard GCJ library can be
trimmed by removing support for executing Java byte code, but the loss
of that feature would reduce the overall value of GCJ.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26a2580.0x279a710"></a>
The Host and Target Configuration</h2></div></div><p>
Because this article is about using GCJ in an embedded environment, it
shows you how to build a cross compiler and a simple root filesystem for
the target system. For those new to embedded development, a cross compiler
builds code that runs on a processor different from the machine where the
compilation occurred. The machine that runs the compiler is called the
host and the one where the code runs is called the target.
</p><p>
In this article, the target system is a PPC 745/755-based system
running at 350MHz. This particular board comes wrapped in a translucent
case with a monitor and hard drive and is otherwise known as an iMac.
Okay, this is hardly a prime example of an embedded system, but it does
present some of the same challenges you'll encounter with a true embedded
system. The things you learn here should apply well to embedded systems
using other processors.
</p><p>
The host system is a run-of-the-mill IBM ThinkPad notebook running
a Pentium III processor. Yellow Dog Linux is already running on the
host system, but with a little sleight of hand, we'll make it use the
root filesystem created in the article for testing.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26a2580.0x279a8c8"></a>
Getting GCJ Ready</h2></div></div><p>
First, we need a cross compiler that runs on our Pentium machine that
creates code for a PowerPC 750-based processor. Building a cross compiler
for a target system can be a very tedious process; a working compiler is
more than GCC, it also contains some extra tools (affectionately named
binutils) and the standard libraries for the language.
</p><p>
To get a cross compiler up and running quickly, try using the crosstool
package, compliments of Dan Kegel. Crosstool does all of the hard
work necessary to get a cross compiler built: it fetches the source
and patches, applies the patches, configures the packages and kicks off
the build. After obtaining and unpacking crosstool, here are the steps
for building your GCJ cross compiler:

<pre     class="programlisting">

$ export TARBALLS_DIR=~/crosstool-download
$ export RESULT_TOP=/opt/crosstool
$ export GCC_LANGUAGES="c,c++,Java"
$ eval `cat powerpc-750.dat gcc-4.0.1-glibc-2.2.2.dat' sh.all --notest

</pre>
</p><p>
While waiting for the compilation to finish, let's take a look at what we
just did to start our crosstool build. TARBALLS_DIR is the location
where crosstool downloads its files. Crosstool fetches all of the
files it needs for a build by default. RESULT_TOP is the installation
directory of the cross compiler. Lastly, GCC_LANGUAGES controls which
language front ends will be enabled for the compiler. GCC supports many
different language front ends and each front end adds a considerable
amount of time to the compilation process, so only the necessary ones
were selected for this toolchain build.
</p><p>
The last line, for those lacking their bash script-foo license, dumps
the two dat files on the command line and executes the all.sh script
with the parameter --notest. To make building a cross compiler easy,
crosstool includes configuration files with the correct environment
variables set for the target processor and the gcc/glibc combination.
In this case, crosstool builds a gcc 4.0.1 with glibc 2.2.2
targeting a PPC 750 processor. Crosstool includes scripts for all major
processor architectures and glib/gcc combinations.
</p><p>
When the build finishes, the cross compiler will be installed at
$RESULT_TOP/gcc-4.0.1-glibc-2.2.2/powerpc-750-linux-gnu/bin. Add this
to your path to make invoking the cross compiler easier.

Configuring the Root Filesystem</h2></div></div><p>
The first thing to compile with your newly minted cross compiler
is the root filesystem. The root filesystem, in this case, is
compliments of BusyBox. For the uninitiated, BusyBox is a single
binary that encapsulates mini versions of the most popular UNIX utilities
in a surpassingly small executable. Built for people that count
bytes, BusyBox has hundreds of knobs to turn to create a filesystem
with the utilities you need within your desired space constraints.
For the purpose of this article, we change the BusyBox
configuration so that it cross compiles, leaving size optimization as an exercise for the reader.
</p><p>
BusyBox is a mainstay of the embedded Linux world and is
maintained by Erik Anderson. One way to get BusyBox is to download
it at <a href="http://www.busybox.net/downloads/busybox-1.01.tar.bz2" target="_self">www.busybox.net/downloads/busybox-1.01.tar.bz2</a>.
</p><p>
To create a BusyBox root filesystem, you need to invoke <tt  >make
menuconfig</tt> in the directory where BusyBox was untarred. The menuconfig
program works just like the 2.4/2.6 menuconfig kernel configuration
interface. Here's what you'll need to do to build the root filesystem.
</p><p>
First, select the build options. Check the Do you want to build BusyBox with
a Cross Compiler? box. Fill in the prefix of the cross compiler in the
input control that appears when you click this option, in this case,
powerpc-750-linux-gnu-. The BusyBox build scripts concatenate the
necessary tool name during compilation (gcc, ld and so on). Make sure that
the compiler is on your $PATH.
</p><p>
Next, run make and install:

<pre     class="programlisting">

make
make install

</pre>
</p><p>
BusyBox puts the newly minted root filesystem at ./_install. You'll notice that
BusyBox compiles in much less time than GCC.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26a2580.0x279b268"></a>
Populating the Root Filesystem with Libraries</h2></div></div><p>
Almost there! The root filesystem BusyBox creates does not contain any libraries.
GCJ programs require some libraries and so does BusyBox, shown in
Table 1.
</p><div class="table"><a name="N0x26a2580.0x279b370"></a><p class="title"><b>Table 1. Libraries Required by GCJ and BusyBox
</b></p><table     summary="Table 1. Libraries Required by GCJ and BusyBox&#10;" border="1"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><thead><tr><th>Library File</th><th>Function</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>
ld.so.1</td><td>Dynamically linked file loader.
Invoked when the program is run,
loads required libraries and
performs dynamic linking.</td></tr><tr><td>
libdl.so.2</td><td>Helper functions for manipulating dynamic libraries.</td></tr><tr><td>
libgcc_s.so.1</td><td>Defines interfaces for handling
exceptions.</td></tr><tr><td>
libgcj.so.6</td><td>The GCJ run-time library.
Contains implementations of the
standard Java library. </td></tr><tr><td>
libm.so.6</td><td>Library of math functions.</td></tr><tr><td>
libpthread.so.0</td><td>POSIX threads library.</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>
These libraries match those used by the cross
compiler. In this case, the files are stored in the
$RESULT_TOP/gcc-4.0.1-glibc-2.2.2/powerpc-750-linux-gnu/powerpc-750-linux-gnu/lib (not a typo!) directory. The easiest way to get them into the root
filesystem is simply to copy them:

<pre     class="programlisting">

for f in ld.so.1 lib libdl.so.2 libgcc_s.so.1libgcj.so.6 libm.so.6 libpthread.so.0 ; do

cp
$RESULT_TOP/gcc-4.0.1-glibc-2.2.2/powerpc-750-linux-gnu/powerpc-750-linux-gnu/lib/$f
&lt;busybox install directory&gt;/lib

$RESULT_TOP/gcc-4.0.1-glibc-2.2.2/powerpc-750-linux-gnu/bin/power
pc-750-linux-gnu-strip &lt;busybox install directory&gt;/lib/$f

done

</pre>
</p><p>
You also need to create a folder in the root filesystem, /proc, to use
as a mountpoint for the proc filesystem. Keen eyes will notice that
I'm not preserving the symlinks used to accommodate different versions
of the libraries&mdash;that's a shortcut typical in embedded systems where
library configuration won't change over the life of the device, unlike a
desktop system. Running strip greatly reduces the amount of disk space
required by the files, almost by 50%.
</p><p>
At this point, the root filesystem can be copied to the target system
into the /tmp/bbox directory. To tell the system to use this as the
root filesystem, start a terminal as root and execute the chroot command:

<pre     class="programlisting">

chroot /tmp/bbox /bin/ash

</pre>
</p><p>
This command remaps the / mountpoint into /tmp/busybox and runs
/bin/ash to get a terminal. Did it work? Congratulations! You've
created a complete root filesystem for an embedded system from scratch.
Pat yourself on the back.
</p><p>
GCJ also needs the proc filesystem mounted. After the chroot, you
need to remount the proc filesystem into the current root filesystem
by doing the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">

mkdir /proc
mount -t proc none /proc

</pre>
</p><p>
Although this root filesystem resides on a standard drive, the root
filesystem deployed on a
production embedded system wouldn't be much different. The only changes
necessary would be creating inittab, so the board will run the right scripts
at the start and add a /dev filesystem with the right device files
for the target board.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26a2580.0x2792808"></a>
GCJ Development</h2></div></div><p>
After building the cross compiler and root filesystem, building your GCJ application
will be a bit anticlimactic. We'll start with the traditional hello
world:

<pre     class="programlisting">

Class hello {
 Static public void main(String argc[]) {
   System.out.println("hello from GCJ");
 }
}

</pre>
</p><p>
Following Java convention, this class resides in the hello.class file.
To compile the file, enter:

<pre     class="programlisting">

powerpc-750-linux-gnu-gcj hello.class --main=hello -o hello-java

</pre>
</p><p>
What's going on with --main=hello? Any class could define a method
with a suitable entry point. The --main=hello option tells the linker
to use the main method in the hello class when linking. Leaving off
this option results in a link error, &ldquo;undefined reference to
main&rdquo;, which,
to the uninitiated, is confusing, because your class contains a main.
</p><p>
Download this file to the target and run it from the chrooted
shell. You'll see:

<pre     class="programlisting">

# ./java-test
Hello from GCJ

</pre>
</p><p>
At this point, development carries on much like any other Java project,
with the exception of invoking the GCJ cross compiler instead
of the native javac compiler.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26a2580.0x2792b78"></a>
Conserving Space</h2></div></div><p>
In this example, the root filesystem weighs in at more than 20MB. Because many
embedded systems use Flash memory, which is considerably more expensive
on a per-megabyte basis than disk-based storage systems, a minimally
sized root filesystem is
frequently an important business requirement. One easy way to reduce the
size of your root filesystem is to link your application statically.
Although this may seem counterintuitive at first, as you'll have an extra
copy of libc code in your application, recall that libgcj.so contains the
entire Java standard library. Most applications use a fraction of the
standard Java library, so using static linking is a great way to winnow
out the unused code in the library. Just be sure to strip the resulting
binary;
otherwise, you'll be shocked at the size due to the amount of debugging
information in libgcj.so.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26a2580.0x2792c80"></a>
Wrapping Up</h2></div></div><p>
From the article, you've seen that creating software for an embedded
system using GCJ is something that can be reasonably accomplished using
tools already present in the Open Source community. Although there are
a few minor nits, configuring the root filesystem doesn't require
a heroic effort; you just need to get a few different libraries from what
you otherwise would need. For applications requiring a smaller root filesystem, we've seen how you can use static linking of your application
to reduce the root filesystem greatly. In short, GCJ is a practical
solution for using Java on a resource-constrained embedded system&mdash;worthy
of consideration for your next project.
