Why I Gave Up on Linux and Returned to Windows XP</h4><p>
I am a senior IBM mainframe software engineer and database administrator,
and in its day, I was highly proficient in MS-DOS line commands. I have
written thousands of lines of computer code and tested hundreds of
thousands of lines of computer code. I recently tried several Linux
distributions, and after too much time wasted chasing solutions for issues
that simply work or work simply in Windows, I made the decision to return
to Windows XP to catch up on other projects.
</p><p>
I would like to begin by complimenting all the software engineers,
developers and testers that have diligently worked and contributed to
Linux.
</p><p>
On the positive side, Linux is void of one of the key architectural design
faults of all MS Windows versions since Windows 95, that being what I often
refer to as the GFR (God Forsaken Registry) or Windows Landfill. I have
been told that the entire Windows Registry is assembled from various files
on the hard disk and loaded into memory upon startup, regardless of which
applications are running or not running. The Registry contains nearly all
the critical Windows operating system settings along with settings and
parameters for almost all Windows applications. Unfortunately, many Windows
applications do not completely remove all of their entries when
uninstalled,
leaving heaps of junk behind in the Registry. There are numerous Registry
&ldquo;cleaners&rdquo;, but I have yet to find one that accurately removes
all the junk left behind by uninstalled applications. Furthermore,
applications, including MS Windows, use the Registry as a temporary location
for temporary settings but fail to remove these when they are no longer
needed. Thus, the Registry is forever expanding in size. Hard disk space is
not the issue here. The issue is waste of RAM, operating inefficiency,
stability and OS portability.
</p><p>
On the negative side, I encountered a persistent font-rendering issue with
Ubuntu, Kubuntu, Xubuntu and Linux Mint. I live on an HP nc8430 Notebook
PC with 1680x1050 WXGA resolution, where increasing font size is a must.
The feature works for system fonts, but it did not work for key applications
like Firefox. My research revealed that the issue already has been
documented throughout the Web and is related to these distributions failing
to update the standard configuration file that Firefox and other
applications rely upon for their font settings. Although the Ubuntu folks are
aware of it, they seem uninterested in fixing it. The issue is also present
in Linux Mint, which is based on Ubuntu. The fonts worked as expected for
both Gentoo and PCLinuxOS. However, I was unable to get my Intel 3945 ABG
wireless card to work with PCLinuxOS (both GNOME and KDE versions).
</p><p>
In every incarnation of Linux that I tried, my notebook fan was
<span   class="emphasis"><em>always on</em></span>,
even when no applications were running with CPU near 0%. This issue may be
related to CPU throttling and fan throttling. Linux needs to resolve this
before I can use Linux on a notebook without the associated side effects,
such as annoying noise of the fan on max, increased fan wear and reduced
battery life.
</p><p>
There is nothing more this user would like than to depart the world of
Microsoft Windows for Linux, but the path will have to be paved with far
fewer rivers to cross or mountains to climb just to get there.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Dave Freeman  <br><br>
</p><p>
Your frustrations are less common than even a few years ago, but indeed,
there are many computer models, laptops especially, that don't behave
right under Linux. I could go on a rant about vendors and closed drivers,
but that won't help you get on-line with your wireless card. The best,
and admittedly most frustrating, way to get great Linux support on a
notebook computer is to research before buying. I realize it's too late
in your case, but without massive amounts of tweaking, some laptops are
just difficult to penguinify.
</p><p>
As to the font issue, well, one of the frustrating things about standards
is that there are so many. I don't know about your specific issue, but
I'm sure Ubuntu expects the Firefox folks to do things their way, and
vice versa. In the short term, some things require tweaking no matter
what your hardware might be. Good luck, and hopefully you'll still get
to tinker with Linux on your Windows laptop. Perhaps a virtual machine
with VirtualBox or VMware?&mdash;Ed.

Open-Source Software in the UK
</h4><p>
Thank you for the article &ldquo;OSS: Europe vs. the United States&rdquo; by Doug
Roberts on LinuxJournal.com
(<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/oss-europe-vs-united-states" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/content/oss-europe-vs-united-states</a>).
You may be interested in the response to the recently submitted Freedom of
Information Act request to the UK Home Office:
<a href="http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/home_office_compliance_with_hmg" target="_self">www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/home_office_compliance_with_hmg</a>.
</p><p>
The request aims to highlight the gap between existing policy and a lack of
compliance with it. The policy levels the playing field for open-source
software in the UK government&mdash;see linked document referred to in the
request&mdash;but in practise, this is ignored, giving undue favour to
established vendors such as Microsoft.

Pencil</h4><p>
I just finished reading Dirk Elmendorf's article &ldquo;Cool Project
Potpourri&rdquo; in the August 2010 issue.
I've been using the Pencil Firefox add-on
(<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/8487" target="_self">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/8487</a>), which is an
alternative to Mockingbird.
</p><p>
Some of Pencil's benefits over Mockingbird are:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Open source (GPL version 2).
</p></li><li><p>
Pencil is free, although you can support the project with donations.
</p></li><li><p>
Mockingbird might not be free once the beta period is over.
</p></li><li><p>
Your designs are hosted locally.
</p></li><li><p>
Exports to HTML, PNG, OpenOffice.org document, Word document and PDF.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
The project's home page is at <a href="http://pencil.evolus.vn" target="_self">pencil.evolus.vn</a>.
</p><p>
Keep up with the good work. <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> is one of the few magazines I read
cover to cover more than once.

Flash and Linux</h4><p>
I have been using Linux for quite a while and recently made a switch from
Mac OS X to a brand-new PC, which is the first time I have seriously run a
distro for my desktop! I chose Fedora 13 because although I cut my teeth on
Debian or Debian-based systems, I found that I <span   class="emphasis"><em>really</em></span> like Fedora and the
support it offers for a power user.
</p><p>
By trade, I am a developer, and I recently have been doing development using
Adobe Flash (CS4), although personally, I agree with Apple Founder and CEO
Steve Jobs in that Flash technology is getting quite old and is, in my own
opinion, <span   class="emphasis"><em>very kludgy</em></span> at best.
</p><p>
Still, sites insist on using Flash for content, and if you are using 64-bit
Linux (as I am), you are left with three choices:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Don't install Flash (my current selection).
</p></li><li><p>
Install the 32-bit player inside a wrapper (not ideal).
</p></li><li><p>
Wait for Adobe to finish &ldquo;rebuilding&rdquo; the 64-bit Linux player
(I may be a very elderly man by then).
</p></li></ol></div><p>
I am sure readers are aware that Steve Jobs has not allowed Flash
into the iPhone/iPad (including iPod Touch) platform, and I personally
feel others should follow suit. It is time for a better alternative
to Flash that is more open. I think HTML5 may hold the answer.
</p><p>
I feel we need an alternative now. HTML5 will at least be built in to
browsers so that needing a plugin to use the content will no longer plague
users.
</p><p>
Obviously, this is just my two-cents' worth on the subject, but it seems
like a lot of sites (including <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>) rely on Flash in some
capacity to display content. Maybe the answer is Android? I know it is
mainly for phones, but it is lightweight, and from what I have seen, it's robust
enough to do the job.
</p><p>
Thank you for listening to my opinion, and I hope that this can be published
and discussed.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
J. Mike Needham  <br><br>
</p><p>
Your 64-bit frustration is one many folks share, myself included. In fact,
on my desktop machines, I usually install 32-bit Linux and use a PAE
kernel to use all my system memory. It's a kludge for sure, but on my
desktop, I find it's quicker and more reliable just to stick with 32-bit.
</p><p>
Like you, I see HTML5 as a viable and logical replacement for many of the
things Adobe Flash can do. I think Flash is used often enough, however,
that for a full Internet experience (good or bad), we'll likely be using
Flash for a very long time. Hopefully, before long 64-bit Flash won't be
an issue, and we can live in a Flash/HTML5 world at the same
time.&mdash;Ed.

Thanks Mick!</h4><p>
As I print out your series on OpenVPN [see Mick Bauer's column in the
February, March, April, May and June 2010 issues] to set one up both at home and at
work, I must write to let you know how much I look forward to your columns
in <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>. I subscribe and look
forward to your column 
every month. But, in particular, your series on OpenVPN was great.
We're using it for some Web-facing servers we're renting on Rackspace and
will be using it for the computing environment we're building here at the
office. As well, I'll use it at home to ensure that both my wife and myself
are able to use it while on the road. I'll probably even set up accounts
for
my kids for when they're on the road.
</p><p>
As well, I did appreciate your article on locking down your desktop
before going to DEF CON [see Mick's &ldquo;Brutally Practical Desktop
Security&rdquo; in the October 2009 issue]. I was unable to attend this
year, but I intend to do
so next year and will use your article to help me prepare for taking a
portable computing device with me.
</p><p>
Please keep writing your Paranoid Penguin. I enjoy both the information that you
present as well as your writing style. Your effort is not wasted and is
greatly appreciated by me. 

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Mark   <br><br>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Mick Bauer replies:</b></span> When your very
generous e-mail arrived, I was frantically trying
to finish (past deadline of course!) a difficult article on OpenWrt, part of
a series whose production has, at times, been characterized by technical
failures and frustrations. Your generous words could not have come at a
better time!
</p><p>
Although I don't flatter myself to think I'm smarter than or even as smart as
most of my readers, I have had the impression that the more trouble I have
getting something to work (OpenLDAP springs to mind), the more useful my
readers tend to find my tutorials. But it's hard to remember this in the heat
of battle (so to speak), so again, I much, much appreciate your taking the
time to write!
</p><p>
It's especially gratifying to hear you are using OpenVPN both at home and at
work. Sometimes I worry that since I do all of my testing in a home
networking lab, my stuff has less relevance to readers who need to build
&ldquo;production-grade&rdquo; solutions at work. I take some comfort knowing that
security controls tend to need to be the same whether you apply them to two
systems or 200. Anyhow, I'm glad you found my OpenVPN tutorials to be
so useful!
</p><p>
Wishing you all the best, and promising many more columns for at least a few
more years.

Patents</h4><p>
I'm discouraged.
I've been using Linux for years, and now I'm trying to switch from Windows to Linux
for video editing, DVD authoring and so on.
It seems difficult to do this without using a program or library that seems to be
violating a &ldquo;patent&rdquo; somewhere. I want to
respect the work of others.
</p><p>
From what I understand, the creators of those programs (the open-source
ones) coded
them themselves, but because there is resemblance with an original,
copyrighted work,
there is a &ldquo;patent&rdquo; violation. If I understand it correctly,
like for MP3, there are
algorithms you cannot avoid in the programming language to be able to get
the same results.
</p><p>
I'll give you an example. Even if I don't use the Ubuntu Multiverse
repository,
it's giving me warnings about patents or licenses:
gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly (in the Universe repositories) is telling me that I
might be breaking the law in my country and that I might need a license, but
that I can use it for research.
</p><p>
I want to use these programs for personal use now, but I might use them
professionally
later, and I do not wish to end up with a big lawsuit once I make money
from my work.
</p><p>
I don't want to exaggerate, but since you guys are professionals in the field of
Linux and open source, I would really appreciate your advice and direction
in this matter.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Jean-Fran&ccedil;ois Tass&eacute;  <br><br>
</p><p>
Patents are funny things. Not comical, but funny in that I don't
understand them completely either. Add to that copyright, intellectual
property, licensing, fair use and DRM, and you have the makings for
a very boring horror film.
</p><p>
My suggestion is to use the tools you're comfortable with now, and if
you decide to become professional with the tools, contact the software
folks to see how much and whom to pay. Generally, if you stick with open
audio/video formats, you should be fine. The problems usually come when
using licensed codecs. If you are okay with the open-source alternatives,
I suspect you'll be fine.&mdash;Ed.

<span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> Addiction</h4><p>
I'll be picking up the latest <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> at my local bookstore this
week, which will mark a full year of feeding the addiction that reading
your fine magazine has become for me.
</p><p>
I've been using Ubuntu for a couple years now, but since I started reading
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>, I'm getting so much more from my new favorite OS. There's a
lot for newbies to learn, especially for a cross-platform developer like myself.
Your magazine feeds that need in ways I never imagined when I picked
up my first issue&mdash;from the series on NoSQL databases, to the excellent
column on shell scripts, to the many feature articles about inspiring cool
projects, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> has become the centerpiece of my Linux education,
often introducing me to things I didn't know I'd be interested in.
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> is the only magazine in which I read every word, from the
letters to the closing comment, and I enjoy every bit of it.
</p><p>
I suppose I could save a couple bucks by subscribing, but I feel it
doesn't hurt to raise Linux's visibility even in a small way by helping
your issues fly off the shelves at my local bookstore.
</p><p>
Please extend my thanks to the team for producing such an uncommonly useful
publication with every issue.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Richard Gaskin  <br><br>
</p><p>
Well shucks,
if you keep talking like that, we won't be able to get our heads through
the door! In all seriousness, when we received your letter, the editorial
staff bounced appreciative e-mail messages back and forth. Letters like yours
make the whole thing worthwhile. Thanks again.&mdash;Ed.
