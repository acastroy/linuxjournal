Hello, book-lovers! If you live in the Northern Hemisphere, you
presumably are reading this as the weather is getting colder. But as
I write this, Israel (and much of North America and Europe) is
&ldquo;enjoying&rdquo; rather hot weather, with very high temperatures and no
obvious relief in sight. Regardless of whether the temperature is
high or low, I'm always game for a new book to teach me about
the latest open-source Web-related technologies. Fortunately, a
number of good, new books have been published during the past year.
This month, I'm taking a break from my usual discussion of the latest
open-source Web-related technologies, in favor of a list of some of
the more interesting books I've seen this year.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2045580.0x213d568"></a>
Ruby, Python and Perl</h2></div></div><p>
Regular readers of this column already know that for about five years
now, my favorite programming language is Ruby. This is due in no
small part to Ruby on Rails, the Web framework that has taken the
industry by storm, against which all other frameworks seem to be
measured. Given Ruby's popularity, it's no surprise that publishers
continue to offer a large number of Ruby-related titles. However,
many of these books are aimed at more-advanced programmers, often
looking to improve their programming techniques and code
maintainability.
</p><p>
Two of the more-advanced Ruby books I've seen have almost
identical names, and confusingly, both come from the same publisher,
Addison-Wesley. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Refactoring Ruby</em></span> by Kevin Rutherford is a
combination taxonomy and tutorial, introducing Ruby programmers to
common &ldquo;code smells&rdquo;, potential problems with code that should be
addressed before they get out of hand. Rutherford is the author of
one of my favorite tools, Reek, which automatically identifies code
smells and, thus, potentially problematic code.
</p><p>
The other book, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Refactoring (Ruby Edition)</em></span>, is
by Jay Fields, Shane Harvie and Martin Fowler, with Kent
Beck. As the title implies, this is a Ruby version of Fowler's
classic <span   class="emphasis"><em>Refactoring</em></span>, which introduced the idea to many programmers
that it's both possible and good to improve code without changing its
functionality. The book includes many examples of how to make your
code more readable and emphasizes the use of many small methods
rather than a small number of long ones. As I read through this book,
I alternated between feeling good about my current techniques and
understanding how I might improve my code's maintainability. It's
easy to read, with many clear examples, and it's good for intermediate
and advanced Ruby programmers.
</p><p>
A hot topic in the Ruby community, and in the programming world in
general, is that of automated testing. Two books released
in the past year, both from the Pragmatic Programmers, address the
issues of testing from different angles. One, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Rails Test
Prescriptions</em></span> by Noel Rappin, is a great introduction to all the
different ways you can test code in your Rails application,
starting with the basics (models and controllers), moving on to mock
objects and factories, and finally looking at Cucumber, Webrat and
Capybara. If you are interested in the alternative RSpec test
framework for Ruby, as well as testing with the scenario-driven
Cucumber system, <span   class="emphasis"><em>The RSpec Book</em></span> written by RSpec's current
maintainer, David Chelimsky, might be worthwhile reading. It
introduces both RSpec and Cucumber as complementary, and it shows how to
use the two of them to test your code effectively and easily, both
before and as you write it.
</p><p>
Although I do spend most of my time working with Ruby, it's true that I
still do use other programming languages on occasion. In particular,
I often teach courses in Python programming. To date, I hadn't seen a
book that went into many of the more-advanced aspects of Python
programming, with a particular emphasis on object-oriented
development, automated testing and metaprogramming. However, the book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Pro
Python</em></span>, written by Marty Alchin and published by Apress, aims to fill
in this gap, and from what I've seen, it does an excellent job. I
expect I will recommend this book to students in my advanced
Python development classes. Although the book is written for Python 3.x,
the author recognizes that much of the Python world still is using the
2.x series, so he includes a large number of sidebars and
notes indicating differences between 2.6, 2.7, 3.0 and 3.1 where
appropriate.
</p><p>
Finally, I should add that although Perl is no longer the first language
for which I reach when writing code, it still occupies a warm spot in
my heart. It was, thus, something of a homecoming for me when a client
recently requested that I do a project in Perl, and that I use
Catalyst as the framework for that project. Perl hackers would
describe Catalyst as an excellent MVC Web framework (which Ruby
hackers would describe as a Perl knockoff of Rails).
</p><p>
Regardless of your perspective, Catalyst is a good way to write modern
Web applications in Perl. And, although there certainly are similarities
between Catalyst and Rails, there are enough differences that I needed
an introduction to Catalyst to get me up and running
relatively quickly. <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Definitive Guide to Catalyst</em></span>, published by
Apress and written by Kieren Diment and Matt Trout, was just what I
needed. When I had questions about how Catalyst worked, I found myself
turning not only to the excellent on-line documentation, but also to
this book.

New Languages</h2></div></div><p>
It's nice to work with languages that you already know, but there's
a lot to be said for learning and working with new languages as well.
Each language teaches you something new and (I would argue) improves
your understanding of other languages you already know. So, I was 
pleased to discover <span   class="emphasis"><em>Seven Languages in Seven Weeks</em></span> by Bruce
Tate, published by the Pragmatic Programmers. The book reviews
(as you might expect) seven programming languages, each quite
different from the others: Ruby, Io, Prolog, Scala, Erlang,
Clojure and Haskell.
</p><p>
I had been meaning to learn several of these languages for the last
year or two, and although I didn't take seven weeks to read through the
book, I did use it as a way to familiarize myself with several of
these languages and where they might be useful. (I'm particularly
interested in Clojure and Scala, in no small part because of the
possibilities for Web development in those languages.) I found the
writing to be clear, the examples good, and perhaps most important,
the comparisons with other languages were useful. Even if I'm not
going to program in Io, for example, it's interesting to see
how the data types work and how a prototype-based language operates.
As the author himself writes, Io gave him a new perspective on
JavaScript, undoubtedly the most popular prototype-based language in
use today.
</p><p>
Another popular language, although we might not think of it as such,
is SQL, the query language used in all relational database systems.
Just as there are books and tutorials about &ldquo;design patterns&rdquo;,
examples of how you can and should structure your code, a growing
number of articles and books talk about &ldquo;antipatterns&rdquo;, examples of
how you should <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> structure your code. The book
<span   class="emphasis"><em>SQL
Antipatterns</em></span> by Bill Karwin, published by the Pragmatic
Programmers, introduces a number of ways people should not use
SQL and relational databases, and then it shows ways in which database
tools can and should be used. I was very happy to see that he
recommended against using the &ldquo;float&rdquo; type, against searching through
textual columns with patterns like <tt  >'%target%'</tt>, and against storing
multiple values in a single column. I have seen these (and more!) on many projects, and it's nice to have a checklist for what to avoid.
I largely disagree with the author's argument in favor of putting
images and other large binary objects inside BLOB columns. That
said, he made a fairly convincing argument for his case and
acknowledged that this is a subject of great controversy. Especially
if you're fairly new to database and query design, this book might
well come in handy.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2045580.0x213e010"></a>
World-Wide Web</h2></div></div><p>
When Steve Jobs publicly announced that there would be no support for
Flash on iPhones and iPads, many people wondered what the alternatives
were. Jobs told everyone that HTML5 offers most or all of the same
capabilities. My response was, &ldquo;Hmm, I guess HTML5 is further along
than I thought&mdash;I'd better check it out.&rdquo; 
I've since been reading up
on the various parts of the emerging HTML5 standard, and I must admit
that it seems very compelling, at least at this stage.
</p><p>
My main source of information is Mark Pilgrim's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Dive into
HTML5</em></span>,
published both for free on-line and also as a book from O'Reilly. I
have long found Pilgrim's writing to be clear and entertaining, and
I was not disappointed by his description of HTML5. The Web version of
his book has the advantage of being able to demonstrate the features
alongside the description, letting you see what your browser can do,
with graphical depictions of what other browsers would show instead.
If you are a Web developer of any sort, you should read Pilgrim's
book, and then bookmark it as a reference to which you will turn
many times during the coming years.
</p><p>
Drawing on the deserved praised for Douglas Crockford's <span   class="emphasis"><em>JavaScript:
The Good Parts</em></span>, O'Reilly is publishing more books of this type.
Crockford's volume is still the biggest bang for the buck, in no small
part because he manages to tell you what parts of JavaScript you
should avoid. But another book in this series, <span   class="emphasis"><em>HTML &amp; CSS: The Good
Parts</em></span> by Ben Henick, is readable, interesting and has given me the
confidence to (once again) try to use CSS for something more advanced
than basic boxes.
</p><p>
A surprisingly interesting book, also published by O'Reilly, is <span   class="emphasis"><em>Web
Reputation Systems</em></span> by Randy Farmer and Bryce Glass. My dissertation
software includes a rating system, so I was interested in what
these authors had to say on the subject. I didn't expect there
would be enough to fill an entire book, but I found that they provided
interesting food for thought, as well as practical considerations for
the implementation and incorporation of rating systems into a Web
site. If you're considering the inclusion of such a rating system
into your Web application, this book is worth at least a look.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2045580.0x213e3d8"></a>
Podcasts and Screencasts</h2></div></div><p>
Screencasts have become an increasingly popular way to deliver
tutorials and information. Because everyone can see the speakers'
screens, it's possible to follow along as they program, show diagrams
and even make mistakes. I've become quite the fan of screencasts and
often watch them to better understand a problem or learn a new
topic.
</p><p>
Ryan Bates has been producing his excellent, weekly and free
&ldquo;Railscasts&rdquo; series for several years now. I try to watch every one
of them. Particularly as I start to make the transition from Rails 2
to Rails 3, &ldquo;Railscasts&rdquo; comes in handy, showing me where I will need to
change my code and where I can leave it as is.
</p><p>
The weekly &ldquo;Rails Envy&rdquo; podcast is no more, but Gregg Pollack and his
colleagues at Envy Labs now are producing a twice-weekly podcast
called &ldquo;Ruby5&rdquo;, which tries to summarize the latest Ruby and Rails
news in less than five minutes. It has more of a newsy feel than
&ldquo;Rails Envy&rdquo; did, and we no longer get the cheesy (but funny, in my
opinion) sound effects and music, but the information is up to date
and solid, and it's delivered with a large degree of thought and
clarity.
</p><p>
For me, the biggest surprise of the year was my discovery of Bruce
Momjian's Webinars (then turned into screencasts/movies) about
PostgreSQL. If you work with PostgreSQL, I'm sure you'll get
something out of these excellent, carefully written and clearly
explained seminars. Momjian works for EnterpriseDB, a PostgreSQL
consulting and support company. His screencasts are available free of
charge from <a href="http://enterprisedb.com" target="_self">enterprisedb.com</a>.

Non-Computer Books</h2></div></div><p>
I don't spend all of my time reading about computers, although it
might seem that way to anyone who sees the stacks of books in my home
office. In this space, I mention a few of my favorite
non-programming books from the past year, although you'll see that
there's still a technical bent to most of them.
</p><p>
Perhaps the most computer-related book in this section is <span   class="emphasis"><em>Coders at
Work</em></span> by Peter Siebel, published by Apress. If
you read and enjoyed <span   class="emphasis"><em>Founders at Work</em></span>, in which the author interviews
the founders of many startups, you likely will enjoy <span   class="emphasis"><em>Coders at
Work</em></span>, which interviews many impressive and famous programmers. It's
always interesting to hear what some of these programmers have to say
and learn from the insights they have gained during their
years of software development.
</p><p>
Everyone in my family (including my children) really enjoys cooking. I
often have said that one of my reasons for cooking is that it lets me
perform science experiments with edible results. For this reason, one
of the most important books in our house (often referred to as &ldquo;The
Book&rdquo;) is the 2nd edition of Harold McGee's <span   class="emphasis"><em>On Food and
Cooking</em></span>, a
seemingly endless collection of history, facts and interesting
tidbits about the science of food and cooking. Well, if McGee's book
provides the science, a new book published by O'Reilly, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Cooking
for Geeks</em></span>, provides the engineering, offering practical advice,
recipes, interviews with cooks and a wealth of techniques you
can use right away. (I've already stopped peeling garlic before
putting it into the press. Who knew?) If you enjoy cooking, or just
want to get into it, I strongly recommend this book.
</p><p>
Another non-computer O'Reilly book is <span   class="emphasis"><em>Your Money: The Missing
Manual</em></span>.
<span   class="emphasis"><em>The Missing Manual</em></span> series, started by <span   class="emphasis"><em>New York
Times</em></span> columnist David
Pogue, tries to provide reference guides for users who need a bit of
hand-holding, but who aren't going to pay or wait for support. Recently,
the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Missing Manual</em></span> series has branched out into non-computer topics,
including <span   class="emphasis"><em>Your Body</em></span> (a fascinating introduction to human biology) and
the realm of personal finance. Living outside the United States,
many aspects of the book weren't relevant to me. However, the general
attitude of the book was a welcome one, especially for those of us who
aren't as disciplined as we should be when it comes to our money. I
wouldn't say that the book changed my life, but it did give me many
new ideas about how to get a better handle on my family's finances,
which is good for all of us.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2045580.0x21356b8"></a>
Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Amazon recently announced that it's selling more ebooks than
hardcover books, and I can believe it. There is a
compelling argument to be made for ebooks, although I prefer the paper
versions when I need to concentrate or just for convenience.
Regardless of the medium you use to read, let me suggest to
readers of this column what I tell my own young children, that the
important thing is just to read and keep learning new things all
the time. This year's crop of new books, of which I barely
scratched the surface here, should provide enough food for thought
for at least another year, and probably well beyond that.
