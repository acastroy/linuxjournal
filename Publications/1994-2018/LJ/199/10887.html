<span   class="emphasis"><em>0 A.D.</em></span>&mdash;Stunning Real-Time Strategy Game
(<a href="http://www.wildfiregames.com/0ad" target="_self">www.wildfiregames.com/0ad</a>)</h2></div></div><p>
When exploring these projects, sometimes I have to dig deep to find
something that will arouse my audience, but other times, I'm
instantly mesmerized and need discipline, so I don't run out of writing
space! This is one of those times. According to the game's Web site:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>0 A.D.</em></span> (pronounced &ldquo;zero ey-dee&rdquo;) is a free, open-source, cross-platform
real-time strategy (RTS) game of ancient warfare. In short, it is a
historically based war/economy game that allows players to relive or
rewrite the history of Western civilizations, focusing on the years
between 500 B.C. and 500 A.D. The project is highly ambitious, involving
state-of-the-art 3-D graphics, detailed artwork, sound and a flexible
and powerful custom-built game engine.
</p><p>
The game has been in development by Wildfire Games (WFG), a group
of volunteer, hobbyist game developers, since 2001....In short, we
consider <span   class="emphasis"><em>0 A.D.</em></span> an educational celebration of game development and
ancient history.

<span   class="bold"><b>Installation</b></span>
</p><p>
At the time of this writing, the game was in an early testing version (Build: Jul 29
2010&mdash;7732-release). Tailored packages purportedly are available in
various guises for Gentoo, Arch Linux, Debian, OpenSUSE, Fedora and
Mandriva. If you can, trust me, grab a binary! A package was supposed
to be available for Ubuntu on the PlayDeb.net Web site, but I got an
error when I tried to download it. If you're unlucky like I was, source
packages are available, and as that's the usual &ldquo;distro-neutral&rdquo; option,
that's what I'll be running with here. This project is in its infancy, and
compilation will be more streamlined in the future (possibly by the time this
article is printed), but for now, strap yourselves in&mdash;this will be a long one!
</p><p>
As far as library requirements go, the documentation states you need the
following:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
GCC (at least 4.0, preferably 4.3).
</p></li><li><p>
Subversion.
</p></li><li><p>
NASM&mdash;there is a bug in NASM 2.06 on x86_64, so you might want to try
a different version if you get errors.
</p></li><li><p>
SDL.
</p></li><li><p>
Boost.
</p></li><li><p>
zlib.
</p></li><li><p>
libpng.
</p></li><li><p>
libxml2.
</p></li><li><p>
OpenGL.
</p></li><li><p>
OpenAL.
</p></li><li><p>
libogg.
</p></li><li><p>
libvorbis.
</p></li><li><p>
wxWidgets (probably called wxgtk on Linux; optional, but required for the
editor tools).
</p></li><li><p>
Gamin (FAM should work too; Linux only).
</p></li><li><p>
BFD (typically called something like binutils-dev; Linux only).
</p></li><li><p>
ENet 1.2.x (not 1.3.x).
</p></li><li><p>
DevIL.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Of course, this doesn't include the &ldquo;-dev&rdquo; libraries you'll need
to compile it, and I needed to grab a few for my Kubuntu machine. The
docs are helpful enough to recommend this command for Ubuntu or Debian (at
least unstable and testing):

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo apt-get install build-essential libsdl1.2-dev zlib1g-dev 
 &#8618;libpng12-dev libjpeg62-dev libgamin-dev nasm 
 &#8618;libwxgtk2.8-dev libboost-dev libboost-signals-dev 
 &#8618;libboost-filesystem-dev libopenal-dev libalut-dev 
 &#8618;libvorbis-dev libogg-dev libcrypto++-dev binutils-dev 
 &#8618;libdevil-dev libenet-dev libxml2-dev 
</pre>
</p><p>
Sorry I don't have room for helping out with other distros, but the package names should at least give
you a hint for your own system.
</p><p>
Once the packages are sorted, grab the latest tarball files from the
Web site, specifically the 0ad build and data files. Now, this is
important: copy the two files into the <span   class="emphasis"><em>same</em></span> folder, and extract
them both there.
</p><p>
Next, open a terminal in the (0ad main directory)/build/workspaces/ folder,
and run the command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ./update-workspaces.sh
</pre>
</p><p>
A series of files will download for several minutes. Once they're
done, continue with the following commands:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ cd gcc
$ make
$ cd ../../../binaries/system
</pre>
</p><p>
Run the game with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ./pyrogenesis_dbg
</pre>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Usage</b></span>
</p><p>
This game is still in its early alpha stage,
so there's no single-player AI yet, but you can at least test the game
mechanics. For now, you can play multiplayer over a LAN&mdash;at
least I think so, I didn't get the chance. For now, fire up a single-player
map and have a look around. I recommend the default choice to
begin.
</p><p>
Once you're in the game screen, you're presented with a village that
is your starting base with a number units (people). To
scroll around your world, middle-click and drag your mouse. Left-click a
unit or object to select it, and right-click on a map to tell 
where to go or what to do.
</p><p>
Units seem able to go beyond simply one class, like harvesting
wood or combat. Instead, a unit seems to be capable of combat, wood
harvesting, hunting, stone milling and so on. Hover your mouse over a
piece of rock for instance, and the mouse pointer will change to a
stone-working icon. Hold your mouse pointer over an enemy unit, and an attack
sign will appear. Hold it over some livestock, and an icon of meat appears.
</p><p>
What becomes inescapable are the gorgeous graphics, with beautiful 3-D
rendering, especially when you scroll around the map. In particular, I
noticed some photographically mapped rocks, and trees are lush and green,
rendered in a very tasteful and intricate 3-D. There's a distinct lack
of sprites around the place to keep the game from feeling tacky.
</p><p>
Oceans move around dynamically with rippling water, beaches graduate
from pebbles to sand and move gently on to the seemingly random but
convincing beach vegetation, which itself graduates into thicker inland
bush. Everything's just so organic. There's none of that blocky squared
mapping that screams of a basic-level designer&mdash;you may as well be
looking at a more convincing Google Earth!
</p><p>
The soundtrack is gentle and tastefully done, with the sort of soundloops
that can be played over 100 times without becoming annoying, and without
turning into bland muzak. Unit animations also are wonderfully smooth,
with many frames per second and shadow rendering.
</p><p>
A scenario editor also is included for those who want to make their own
levels. Look on-line to see galleries of some absolutely stunning
efforts. But, that's for another day. 
</p><p>
I'm not a real-time strategy fan, and I haven't been
excited about an RTS game since <span   class="emphasis"><em>Command and Conquer: Red
Alert!</em></span> However, this
is the first RTS I'm actually enthused about, and I'll keep a close
eye on it in the future. The graphics are easily on par with commercial
efforts (and even better than quite a few). Hopefully, the gameplay
dynamics are just as solid as development continues. My keen hope is that
the <span   class="emphasis"><em>free 0 A.D.</em></span> one day dominates LAN parties and
caf&eacute;s, outdoing
its commercial rivals and becoming a free software gaming classic.

Videoporama&mdash;Slideshow Video Sequencing
(<a href="http://www.videoporama.tuxfamily.org" target="_self">www.videoporama.tuxfamily.org</a>)</h2></div></div><p>
If you're chasing a picture and music slideshow maker with a decent
interface, you
may find yourself at home with Videoporama. According to the Web site:
&ldquo;Videoporama is an application for the creation of video sequences established
by images or by photos, fixed or livened up. These sequences are
assembled in a slideshow by means of transitions of sequence to produce
complete videos.&rdquo;
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10887f4.large.jpg"><img src="10887f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Here I am using Videoporama to brush up on my kana to the soundtrack of
Alice in Chains.
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10887f5.large.jpg"><img src="10887f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
You can add captions to any frame of a slideshow.

</p></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Installation</b></span>
</p><p>
A binary package is provided for those using Debian or Ubuntu, but lo
and behold, the package was corrupt when I downloaded it. I'm having a
bad month with packages! Still, the all-purpose source package
is available, and thankfully, it isn't a pain to use. I was lucky when it came
to installing Videoporama, as I had all of the needed libraries installed
and didn't encounter errors. Nevertheless, it's unlikely you'll have the
same luck. The documentation says you need the following libraries:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Python: version &gt;= 2.5 but not yet 3.x.
</p></li><li><p>
Qt: version &gt;= 4.4 (best to use Qt 4.6 and above).
</p></li><li><p>
pyqt: version &gt;= 4.x.
</p></li><li><p>
pil: version &gt;= ? (Python Image Library).
</p></li><li><p>
mjpegtools: version &gt;= 1.8.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Videoporama also makes use of the following external programs: ffmpeg,
sox, ppmtoy4m and mplayer.
</p><p>
Head to the Web site and grab the latest source tarball. Extract it,
and open a terminal in the new folder. If your distro uses sudo, enter
the command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo python setup.py install
</pre>
</p><p>
Otherwise, enter the commands:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ su
# python setup.py install
</pre>
</p><p>
To run the program, enter:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ videoporama
</pre>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Usage</b></span>
</p><p>
When started, a status screen appears telling you what features will
and won't be available, especially in regard to the use of certain
codecs. If any crucial codecs are missing, you still can add them
post-compilation, and the extra sox libraries are a good place to start,
especially with MP3 output and the sox ffmpeg package.
</p><p>
Once you're inside the main screen, if you look to your right, there is
a section with three tabs. This is where most of your file tweaking
will take place&mdash;you can select things such as aspect ratio,
what audio track to use, overlaid text, zooming options and so on. The
default ouput format is VCD/SVCD, but you'll probably want to change that.
I chose AVI (XVid/MP3) myself.
</p><p>
Let's make a slideshow. If you look at the icons below the main
menu, there's a green box with a + sign on its bottom-right corner. This
will add an image, and once something's added, simply repeat the process
to add more.
</p><p>
To add a sound file, look in the tab Montage options, where there's
a sound file field. Further below is the output section where you can
choose the previously mentioned codecs, as well as specify where your
video file will end up.
</p><p>
Timing always will be an issue with a slideshow/music combo, and if
you want to edit the timing of an individual frame, look in the Zoom
and travel tab where there is an option called Time display fixe
(presumably a typo).
</p><p>
I've got room for only one more feature, so I'll go with text. The
Overlaid text part of the Montage Options applies text to the entire
file. If you want to add text to an individual frame, the Image tab's
Background text button will do exactly that, and both feature options
like placement, font size and so on.
</p><p>
Ultimately, this is a fairly intuitive program after the first five
minutes or so of usage. The project could do with some features like
auto-syncing the timing of frames with the length of an audio track.
And personally, I'd change some of the GUI methodology, but it's a new
project, and things may change by the time you read this. At
the end of the day, I still recommend Videoporama, and it's been a
pretty pain-free ride so far, which is a good sign with OSS projects.

Jon Rafkind is the author of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Paintown</em></span>, one of the projects
covered in this column in the August 2010 issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>
(<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/10765" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/10765</a>). He wrote us
the following in regard to the controversy between himself and the Beats of
Rage Project mentioned in that article:
</p><p>
In 2004, I searched the Internet for fighting games that would run on Linux.
I didn't find much, but I did find Beats of Rage (BoR). I attempted to port BoR to
Linux, but it was a hassle, and so I decided to start a project from scratch.
I did not start with the code from BoR and modify it; I wrote the first
file starting from an empty buffer.
</p><p>
I did take most of the graphics from BoR, so I could get a game up
and running quickly. I noted this in the LEGAL file in the project source with the
following lines:


<pre     class="programlisting">
data/bgs/**/*.png - http://www.senileteam.com/games.php#bor.
data/chars/**/*.png - http://www.senileteam.com/games.php#bor.
data/sprites/**/*.png - http://www.senileteam.com/games.php#bor
</pre>
</p><p>
I felt this was enough credit to the BoR team, seeing as how that was all I
used from the project. It is not surprising that the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Paintown</em></span> and BoR
engines look similar because they use the same graphics (for now), but the
level of sharing ends there. I have been trying to replace the main
graphics in <span   class="emphasis"><em>Paintown</em></span> for a while (I even started a
river of ransom clone),
but so far, I still am using the BoR graphics.
</p><p>
The BoR people were upset that I was &ldquo;ripping them off&rdquo; and made various
claims about me stealing parts of their game. Here is a thread on the BoR
forums in which I tried to clarify their complaints: <a href="http://www.senileteam.com/forum_thread(84).html" target="_self">www.senileteam.com/forum_thread(84).html</a>.
</p><p>
I asked them in a respectful manner what elements of their game I ripped
off, but unfortunately, the BoR creator, Roel, did not want to respond to my
request and instead insulted me. Eventually I added &ldquo;Senile&rdquo; to the credits
list of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Paintown</em></span>, although I don't think anyone in the BoR community knows
about this. I have never been confronted by anyone in the BoR community
with specific examples of things I stole from them (other than graphics,
which I didn't &ldquo;steal&rdquo;), although a few members have made vague statements
that I &ldquo;stole stuff&rdquo;.
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Paintown</em></span> was rightfully pulled from PlayDeb.net because it uses copyright
art. I never asked for <span   class="emphasis"><em>Paintown</em></span> to be hosted on
PlayDeb.net, so I don't mind
this decision.
