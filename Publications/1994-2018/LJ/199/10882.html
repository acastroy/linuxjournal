Hack your cheap wireless gateway into a stealth firewall.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20c3580.0x21bb408"></a></h2></div></div><p>
In this series of articles, I'm showing how to build a transparent firewall
using OpenWrt (Linux) running on an inexpensive Linksys WRT54GL wireless
router. In Part I, I explained why firewalls are still important
and the difference between a traditional IP firewall and a
transparent firewall.
</p><p>
In Part II, I sketched out a simple design for deploying a transparent
firewall in a home network setting (probably the best application of
any OpenWrt-based firewall). I also showed the step-by-step process by
which I replaced the native Linksys firmware on my WRT54GL with OpenWrt
Kamikaze (v. 8.09.2, running a Linux 2.4 kernel) and then upgraded it
to OpenWrt Backfire (v. 10.03, running a Linux 2.6 kernel).
</p><p>
This month, I recompile and configure OpenWrt Backfire, hopefully
the last major OpenWrt-specific task covered in this series. Next
time, I'll begin writing a custom iptables firewall script, which will
apply to <span   class="emphasis"><em>any</em></span> Linux system you want to use as a transparent firewall.
</p><p>
Before diving back in, a quick note on OpenWrt performance: OpenWrt is
a hobbyist's distribution, and it runs on cheap hardware with less RAM
and slower processors than any modern Linux desktop system. I'm writing
about it because it's fun to play with, and because I've long wanted to
do some hardware hacking in this column. OpenWrt is not, however, a good
choice if you need a firewall that is either very fast or very
stable.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20c3580.0x21bb778"></a>
Recompiling the OpenWrt Kernel</h2></div></div><p>
Before configuring OpenWrt, you need to recompile it. That is, you need
to recompile the Linux 2.6 kernel in Backfire so that iptables can run in
bridging mode, rebundle the kernel into a new firmware image and re-flash
that to your gateway. This is less work than it probably sounds like.
</p><p>
The OpenWrt build process has some prerequisites. First, you need all
of these Ubuntu packages (or your distribution's equivalents):
gawk, gcc, binutils, patch, bzip2, flex, bison, make, gettext, pkg-config,
unzip, libz-dev, libcheaders and subversion.
</p><p>
If you've compiled a Linux kernel before, your system may have most
of these already; on mine, I needed to install only gawk, flex, bison,
subversion and gettext.
</p><p>
Next, you need 3.5GB of free disk space on a non-Windows-formatted
volume (msdos, fat32 and ntfs don't support Linux user/group-ownerships
and permissions). I don't know why so much space is necessary to compile
a firmware image for devices with only 4MB of RAM, but if you run
out of disk space during the compile, you'll get strange, cryptic
error messages.
</p><p>
The compile process is time consuming but simple. As a nonroot user,
change your working directory into your 3.5GB-free volume,
and execute this sequence of commands:


<pre     class="programlisting">
backfireimage-$ svn co svn://svn.openwrt.org/openwrt/branches/backfire
</pre>
</p><p>
This fetches the source code tree for the current version of OpenWrt
into your working directory.
Now, enter that source code tree:

<pre     class="programlisting">
backfireimage-$ cd ./backfire
</pre>
</p><p>
By adding this line to your kernel configuration, you make iptables able to
operate in bridging mode&mdash;that is, to control packets traversing a
local bridge device:


<pre     class="programlisting">
backfireimage/backfire-$ echo "CONFIG_BRIDGE_NETFILTER=y" &gt;&gt; 
 &#8618;./target/linux/brcm47xx
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, rebuild the entire OpenWrt firmware image&mdash;the Linux 2.6 kernel,
all system commands and the compressed RAM filesystem on which they reside: 

<pre     class="programlisting">
backfireimage/backfire-$ make
</pre>
</p><p>
This one <tt  >make</tt> command takes quite a long time,
depending on how fast your CPU and hard disk are. If it ends prematurely
due to errors, the likeliest causes are either that you're missing a
required package or you don't have enough free disk space.
</p><p>
If your build fails for some other reason, or if you simply can't tell,
try again with this command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
backfireimage/backfire-$ make V=99
</pre>
</p><p>
Setting make's verbosity to 99 in this way causes it to output a very
large quantity of log messages. If you end up seeking help on the OpenWrt
Forums (<a href="https://forum.openwrt.org" target="_self">https://forum.openwrt.org</a>), including some of these log messages
will improve your odds at receiving a useful answer.
</p><p>
Once the build completes successfully, you can change your working
directory to that in which the new binary firmware images reside. Since
I'm working with a Linksys WRT54GL, which uses a Broadcom chipset,
and since I'm installing a Linux 2.6 kernel, the binaries I want are
in bin/brcm47xx:

<pre     class="programlisting">
backfireimage/backfire-$ cd bin/brcm47xx
</pre>
</p><p>
Now it's time to reboot the WRT54GL and re-flash its
firmware. Immediately after turning your router's power off and then
back on, or issuing the command <tt  >reboot</tt> from a telnet session, enter
this command to push the new image from your build system:


<pre     class="programlisting">
backfireimage/backfire-$ tftp -m binary 192.168.1.1 -c 
 &#8618;put openwrt-wrt54g-squashfs.bin
</pre>
</p><p>
As you may recall from last time, OpenWrt's default IP address is
192.168.1.1. On the laptop from which I'm connecting to my broadband
router, I've configured the Ethernet interface with an IP address on
the same network (192.168.1.30, netmask 255.255.255.0).
</p><p>
It may take a few reboot/TFTP attempts for your broadband router to
&ldquo;see&rdquo;
the TFTP push, but once it does, and after it decompresses and loads
the new firmware, your router will be capable of acting as a transparent
firewall! But, first you've got to do some system-level configuration.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20c3580.0x21bc220"></a>
Enabling SSH</h2></div></div><p>
Both examples I showed last month for how to connect to OpenWrt involved
telnet. Although this is the default way to log on to OpenWrt (at least
for initial setup), it's highly insecure.
</p><p>
Luckily, on OpenWrt Backfire, the Dropbear Secure Shell (SSH) d&aelig;mon
package is installed and runs at startup, by default. All you have to do
to disable telnet logins and enable SSH logins is first to telnet in to
OpenWrt and then set a root password via the <tt  >passwd</tt> command, like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
root@OpenWrt:~# passwd
Changing password for root
New password: *********
Retype password: *********
Password for root changed by root
</pre>
</p><p>
You don't need to restart the router; simply log out of the telnet
session, and <tt  >ssh</tt> back in. This time, you'll be prompted for a user name
(use &ldquo;root&rdquo;) and password (the one you just entered).
</p><p>
Now that you've got a secure administrative session, you can get to
work reconfiguring OpenWrt using the Unified Configuration Interface
(uci) system.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20c3580.0x21bc590"></a>
Using uci</h2></div></div><p>
In earlier versions of OpenWrt, such as White Russian, you had to manage
two different configuration systems: NVRAM settings, via the
<tt  >nvram</tt>
command and the standard /etc system for ordinary Linux OS and
application settings. With the Kamikaze and Backfire versions of OpenWrt,
however, nvram settings are maintained in files stored in /etc/config,
making OpenWrt a bit more UNIX-like than before.
</p><p>
In fact, most OpenWrt behavior, not just NVRAM-specific settings, can
be managed via files in /etc/config/. The catch is that unlike ordinary
configuration files, you're supposed to use the command
<tt  >uci</tt> rather
than a text editor to manipulate anything in /etc/config.
</p><p>
uci automatically decides whether changes in a given /etc/config file need
to trigger an NVRAM change, require other commands such as
<tt  >iptables</tt> to
be invoked and so forth. Strictly speaking, you probably don't always
<span   class="emphasis"><em>have</em></span> to use uci&mdash;for example, I was able to change my WRT54GL's
time zone by editing /etc/config/system and rebooting. However, things
work better on OpenWrt when you stick to uci.
</p><p>
Listing 1 shows a block of uci commands with which you can change your
OpenWrt box's time zone and hostname.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20c3580.0x21bc9b0"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Listing 1. Changing Time Zone and Hostname</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">
root@OpenWrt# uci set 
 &#8618;system.@system[0].timezone=CST6CDT,M3.2.0,M11.1.0
root@OpenWrt# uci set system.@system[0].hostname=sugartongs
root@OpenWrt# uci commit system
</pre></div><p>
The general syntax of the uci command is <tt  >uci [action]
[config-file-name].[config-file-section].[option-name]=[value]</tt>. Thus,
the first line in Listing 1 translates to &ldquo;change a setting in
/etc/config/system, in its system section, called timezone, to have
the value CST6CDT,M3.2.0,M11.1.0&rdquo;.
</p><p>
Why does a time zone value have so much gobbledygook after the name of
the actual time zone? Why not just say &ldquo;CST6CDT&rdquo;? It's because of the
difference in Daylight Savings Time start and end dates in different
countries. See Resources for a link to a chart of different
time zone strings you can use.
</p><p>
Setting the correct time zone is important. It allows your OpenWrt
Backfire system to synchronize its time over the Internet automatically,
using the <tt  >rdate</tt> command (or you can install ntpclient to have
it use ntp instead). If you don't set the correct time zone, rdate won't
work correctly, which means lots of other things will fail too, such as
IPsec and anything else that uses digital certificates.
</p><p>
Moving on, the second line in Listing 1 involves changing the
setting of option &ldquo;hostname&rdquo; from its default of
&ldquo;OpenWrt&rdquo; to
&ldquo;sugartongs&rdquo;. Obviously, you can specify whatever hostname you like.
</p><p>
The third line tells uci to commit all changes to /etc/config/ since
the last time it was run&mdash;that is, to change NVRAM, execute iptables
commands and so forth, as applicable. I find that with time zone and
hostname settings, however, you also need to reboot the router for the
changes to take effect (using the command <tt  >reboot</tt>, naturally).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20c3580.0x25b52e0"></a>
Installing Optional Packages</h2></div></div><p>
I'll come back to uci in a moment. First, a here's quick word about optional
software packages.
</p><p>
Like any Linux distribution, OpenWrt has optional software packages you
can install after the base system image is in place. The majority of
OpenWrt's packages are network-oriented, and they include apache, bind,
freeradius, various Linux kernel modules, snort, squid, stunnel, vpnc
and vsftpd.
</p><p>
But these are out of scope for this series of articles. Everything you
need in order to build a transparent firewall using OpenWrt Backfire
is included in the base image (at least that was true for my Linksys
WRT54GL). Furthermore, most broadband routers have between 16 and 72
megabytes <span   class="emphasis"><em>total</em></span> combined Flash-memory and RAM; even with a compressed
filesystem, this doesn't amount to much storage space either for
applications themselves or for their data.
</p><p>
Still, if you want to install optional packages, they're available
from openwrt.org in the packages directory of your architecture's
download site. For example, for my system, running the Broadcom
47xx version of OpenWrt Backfire, optional packages are located in
<a href="http://backfire.openwrt.org/10.03/brcm47xx/packages" target="_self">backfire.openwrt.org/10.03/brcm47xx/packages</a>. See the OpenWrt
Wiki page for Packages for more information on finding and managing
OpenWrt packages.

OpenWrt Documentation</b></p><p>
In my opinion, complete documentation is not one of OpenWrt's
strengths. This is a Linux distribution by and for network engineers,
and its maintainers assume OpenWrt users have a higher-than-average
ability and willingness to figure things out on their own.
</p><p>
For the rest of us, some useful OpenWrt documentation is found
<span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span>
in the OpenWrt home page's Documentation area, but within the OpenWrt
Wiki at <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org" target="_self">wiki.openwrt.org</a>. Sooner or later you'll also probably
need to use the Forum (<a href="https://forum.openwrt.org" target="_self">https://forum.openwrt.org</a>) or even Google to
find answers to your OpenWrt-related questions. 
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20c3580.0x25b5910"></a>
Changing Network Configuration on OpenWrt</h2></div></div><p>
The last task to cover this month, and (I hope) the last
OpenWrt-specific one, is configuring networking on OpenWrt. This is a
huge topic I can't cover in depth (though I think my examples are pretty
clear). There's a more complete explanation of the many different
ways you can configure networking on OpenWrt on the OpenWrt Wiki
(<a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/network" target="_self">wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/network</a>).
</p><p>
Speaking of which, you'll notice that the wiki article on configuring
networking doesn't list any actual uci commands; it shows only the
&ldquo;finished product&rdquo;, /etc/config/network. 
This is because statements in OpenWrt's /etc/config files are easy to
translate into uci commands once you understand the syntax.
</p><p>
I recommend you first sketch out on paper what you want
/etc/config/network to look like, compare that to how /etc/config/network
presently looks, note which lines need to change, and then translate
those changes into a list of commands. It <span   class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> somewhat easier to
make mistakes when entering a long sequence of commands than it is by
simply editing a configuration file. However, using the up-arrow key to
call up the command you just entered, and then backspacing over the part
that's different in the next command in the sequence, reduces the amount
of typing you need to do and, therefore, your potential for messing up.
</p><p>
Listing 2 shows Backfire's default /etc/config/network file for a
Linksys WRT54GL.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20c3580.0x25b5c28"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>

#### WAN configuration

        option ifname   "eth0.1"
        option proto    dhcp
</pre></div><p>
Let's work our way down this file, from the top. First, <tt  >config
switch eth0</tt> and <tt  >option enable 1</tt> constitute the first configuration
section. Each section consists of a config line that names some network
interface, switch, vlan or other element, followed by one or more
option lines that affect that element. The first section in Listing
2 enables the switch device eth0.
</p><p>
As is typical for broadband routers, all the Ethernet ports on a Linksys
WRT54G are controlled by a single switch chipset (a Broadcom chipset in
this case). Individual ports are referred to in OpenWrt by their Virtual
LAN (VLAN) assignment, for example, eth0.0 (VLAN #0), eth0.1 (VLAN #1)
and so forth. Subsequent configuration sections in Listing 2 define and
configure those VLANs.
</p><p>
The second section in Listing 2 shows the settings for VLAN 0, called
<tt  >eth0_0</tt> within the config file but subsequently known to the kernel as
<tt  >eth0.0</tt>. <tt  >option device</tt>, specifies which switch the VLAN is associated
with (eth0 being the only switch present); <tt  >option
vlan</tt> specifies the
VLAN number you want to define; and <tt  >option ports</tt> specifies which ports
belong to this VLAN.
</p><p>
Port numbers are assigned differently from what you'd expect in OpenWrt. Port
#5 is a &ldquo;virtual&rdquo; port associated with the kernel itself. Every VLAN
must be associated with port #5. Port #4 on the WRT54GL is labeled as the
&ldquo;WAN port&rdquo;, the port you customarily connect to your DSL router or cable
modem (though in OpenWrt you can assign it to whatever VLAN you like&mdash;there's actually nothing special about it).
</p><p>
Ports 0&ndash;3 correspond to ports 4, 3, 2 and 1, respectively, on the
WRT54GL; they're numbered <span   class="emphasis"><em>backward</em></span> relative to the screen printing
on the box. Therefore, in Listing 2, <tt  >option ports "0 1 2 3
5"</tt> means
&ldquo;ports 4, 3, 2 and 1&rdquo; and <tt  >option ports "4
5"</tt> would translate to
&ldquo;the WAN port&rdquo;.
</p><p>
Therefore, it follows that the next section defines the WAN port as
belonging to VLAN #1 (eth0.1).
</p><p>
Don't worry about the <tt  >loopback</tt> section. If you know anything
about loopback interfaces, this section's meaning is obvious. If you
don't, it doesn't matter because you never should change this section
anyhow. Suffice it to say that as on any other Linux system, packets
sent to either IP address 127.0.0.1 or interface lo will go directly
to the local kernel and be flagged as having originated locally.
</p><p>
The last two sections define network interfaces. The first interface
section is arbitrarily named lan, its actual interface name (ifname)
being eth0.0 (which as you'll recall is actually VLAN 0 on the switch
eth0). Since it concerns switch ports, it's of the type switch. This
interface has a static IP address of 192.168.1.1, with a netmask of
255.255.255.0.
</p><p>
As you'll recall from the second section of Listing 2, eth0.0 is associated
with ports 1&ndash;4 on the router. This VLAN is now being defined as a
standalone Ethernet switch whose IP address is 192.168.1.1/24 (implying
that anything connecting to ports 1&ndash;4 needs to have an IP address in
the same logical LAN).
</p><p>
In the second interface section, VLAN 1 (eth0.1), which is associated
only with the router's WAN port (OpenWrt port 4), is configured as a
standard (nonbridge) interface with a dynamic, dhcp-assigned IP address.
</p><p>
So, what changes do I want to make? Basically, I want to configure the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>entire</em></span> block of Ethernet interfaces as a single switch, including
the WAN interface. I also want to change the switch's IP address (and
also its network address) to 10.0.0.253, an unused IP address on the
network into which I plan to insert the firewall.
</p><p>
Since all bridge ports will be on the same VLAN, I can delete the entire
VLAN eth0_1 section and the entire interface wan section. I'll also
have to change the ports option under VLAN eth0_0 and the ipaddr
option under interface lan. All this will take a total of only seven
commands (including rebooting the system)!
</p><p>
Listing 3 shows the way you want /etc/config/network to look.

I'm out of space for this month, so I can't dissect Listing 4, which is
hopefully similar enough to the previous uci examples to make sense. I
will, however, leave you with two important notes.
</p><p>
First, note the <tt  >uci show network</tt>. This allows you to check your work
before committing changes. If any line is wrong, you can re-enter the
relevant uci command. To start over, enter the command <tt  >uci revert
network</tt> to undo <span   class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span> changes. If you mess things up so badly you
can't <tt  >ssh</tt> back in, you can re-flash the firmware image, which among other
things will reset the router's IP address back to 192.168.1.1. Checking
and rechecking your work before committing, however, is less work and
easier on your nerves than re-flashing!

Second, after changing your device's IP address and rebooting, you won't
be able to reconnect to your OpenWrt box until you've reconfigured your
client system with an IP address compatible with the OpenWrt box's new
address. For example, after I reconfigured my Linux laptop's Ethernet
interface with the IP address 10.0.0.30 and netmask 255.255.255.0,
I was able to <tt  >ssh</tt> back in to my OpenWrt router with
the command <tt  >ssh
root@10.0.0.253</tt>.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
I've covered a lot of ground this month: recompiling OpenWrt for
iptables bridging support, enabling SSH, using uci and reconfiguring
networking. Next time, I'll show you how to disable the default OpenWrt
firewall and create a custom iptables script that should work on
<span   class="emphasis"><em>any</em></span> bridging-aware Linux 2.6 system. Until then, be safe!
