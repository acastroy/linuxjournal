Using D-Bus, you can personalize and automate your desktop.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dc1580.0x1eb92a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Every modern Linux desktop environment uses D-Bus, a system for allowing software
applications to communicate with each other. Thanks to D-Bus, you can
make your desktop work the way you want. In this article, I illustrate
some of the things that are possible with D-Bus. Get ready for some desktop
tweaking.
</p><p>
D-Bus (Desktop Bus) is an interprocess communication (IPC) system,
which provides a mechanism for applications to talk to each other. The
D-Bus designers built it from scratch, but were heavily influenced by
KDE's DCOP (Desktop COmmunication Protocol) system. Currently, D-Bus
is everywhere&mdash;KDE 4 has ditched DCOP for D-Bus, and GNOME is moving
toward D-Bus instead of its own Bonobo system. So, D-Bus has become a
desktop-agnostic IPC mechanism. Software that uses D-Bus seamlessly
integrates with your desktop, regardless which desktop environment
you use. D-Bus is part of the cross-desktop project freedesktop.org, and 
Red Hat is the primary contributor.
</p><p>
With D-Bus, every program that offers services to other programs registers
itself. Other programs then can look up which services are available. A
program also is able to register itself for events, which some system
services do, for example, to detect hot-swapping hardware.
</p><p>
D-Bus does not allow direct process-to-process communication, but works
by providing a &ldquo;bus&rdquo;. The bus d&aelig;mon routes messages between processes
on a bus, and in this way, processes can speak to one or more applications
at the same time. Each application can send messages to the bus or listen
for events on the bus.
</p><p>
Usually, D-Bus creates two buses: a privileged system bus and a session
bus. The system bus allows system-wide communication between processes
with the right access permissions, and its main use is to deliver events
from HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer) to processes that are interested
in hardware events. Some possible hardware events might be notification
that a new hardware device has been added or that a printer queue has changed.
The second bus, the session bus, is created when you log in, and it lets your
applications communicate.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dc1580.0x1eb9670"></a>
Talking D-Bus</h2></div></div><p>
Each application using D-Bus exposes some objects, which generally map
to internal GObject, C++ or Python objects. One application can send
a message to a specific object in another application. You address each
D-Bus object with a unique pathname, which looks like a filesystem pathname. To ensure that each application uses unique pathnames, a D-Bus
object pathname generally is prefixed with the developer's domain name,
such as /org/kde or /com/redhat. The Java programming language uses the
same system with package names (for example, org.sun). A D-Bus path is made up of
three parts: the service name, the object path and the interface (I give
examples of them a bit later in this article).
</p><p>
So, how do you support or use D-Bus in your own
application? The core
API is written in C and is rather low level. It is not really designed
for application programmers to use. Different programming languages and
environments have binding layers built on top of this API, such as GLib, Qt, Python,
Ruby, Perl and Mono. I don't go into C or GLib (GNOME's base library)
programming here, but I give some examples written in script languages like
Python and Ruby, as well as shell scripts.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dc1580.0x1eb9828"></a>
Which Applications Are Using D-Bus?</h2></div></div><p>
The freedesktop.org project has an incomplete list of applications using
D-Bus on its Web site, and the bus name for each application is listed there also.
However, you can find the bus names yourself by using some interesting tools to
help you explore D-Bus on your own system. For example, Qt has a graphical
D-Bus browser called qdbusviewer (Figure 1). In Ubuntu, you can find the application in
the qt4-dev-tools package. Although it's part of KDE, the application
works perfectly on other desktop environments, including GNOME.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10455f1.large.jpg"><img src="10455f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. QDBusViewer Running on GNOME
</p></div></div><p>
When you run qdbusviewer, it shows two tabs: Session Bus
and System Bus. Within each tab, the left pane shows a list of service
names. If you click on a service name, the right pane shows information
about that service, such as the available methods and signals. For
example, if you click on the service org.freedesktop.PowerManagement, and
then click in the right pane through the hierarchy org/, freedesktop/
and PowerManagement/, you will have navigated two parts of the D-Bus path:
org.freedesktop.PowerManagement in the left pane is the service name, and the
org/freedesktop/PowerManagement in the right pane is the object path.
</p><p>
The object path has one final part in the right pane,
three so-called interfaces, with a dot-separated name:
org.freedesktop.DBus.Introspectable, org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties
and org.freedesktop.PowerManagement. Each interface implements some
methods and signals. These are the things you can interact with. Here, we're
interested in the interface org.freedesktop.PowerManagement, as this one
implements the concrete power management actions. When you click on it,
you can see all implemented methods and signals in a list. If you click
on the method Suspend, your computer suspends, and wakes up only when
you press the power button.
</p><p>
Some methods, such as Shutdown, Reboot, Hibernate and Suspend
implement actions, and other methods give you some information about
the system. For example, the org.freedesktop.PowerManagement object
implements some methods like GetLowBattery, GetOnBattery, CanShutdown and so
on.
If your system (laptop) is running on battery power but with enough battery
time remaining, clicking on GetOnBattery gives a reply &ldquo;Arguments:
true&rdquo;
in the pane below, but if you click on GetLowBattery, it gives the reply
&ldquo;Arguments: false&rdquo;.
</p><p>
It's worth pointing out that qdbusviewer can show only the
service names that are registered at the moment. For example, if you haven't
started Pidgin, the viewer won't list the Pidgin service. Take
this into account when you are exploring the D-Bus services you can use
on your system.
</p><p>
If you are more of a command-line person, you don't have to fire
up qdbusviewer. The command-line application qdbus exposes the same
information. If you run <tt  >qdbus</tt> in a terminal, you get the list
of service names available on the session bus. If you run it with the
<tt  >--system</tt> flag, the services known to the system bus are shown. If you
want to know the different objects a service exposes, run, for example:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ qdbus org.freedesktop.PowerManagement
/
/org
/org/freedesktop
/org/freedesktop/PowerManagement
/org/freedesktop/PowerManagement/Backlight
/org/freedesktop/PowerManagement/Inhibit
/org/freedesktop/PowerManagement/Statistics
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, if you want to know which interfaces the
/org/freedesktop/PowerManagement object implements, use:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ qdbus org.freedesktop.PowerManagement \
            /org/freedesktop/PowerManagement
</pre>
</p><p>
This will give the same list of methods and interfaces that you saw in
qdbusviewer. For example, the line:


<pre     class="programlisting">
method bool org.freedesktop.PowerManagement.GetOnBattery()
</pre>
</p><p>
The <tt  >bool</tt> means this method returns a boolean value, which
can be true or false. If the method doesn't return a value,
for example, org.freedesktop.PowerManagement.Suspend(), the line lists
<tt  >void</tt> instead of <tt  >bool</tt>.
</p><p>
qdbus also allows you to call these methods directly. For example,
if you want to call the Suspend method, execute:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ qdbus org.freedesktop.PowerManagement \
            /org/freedesktop/PowerManagement \
            org.freedesktop.PowerManagement.Suspend
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dc1580.0x1eba220"></a>
Playing with D-Bus on the Command Line</h2></div></div><p>
In the rest of this article, I show some of the D-Bus functionality
exposed by some popular applications and write some scripts to
communicate with those applications and automate some tasks. Hopefully,
this will give you some inspiration to communicate with your own favorite
applications. I use different D-Bus tools and script languages
to show the different ways you can use D-Bus.
</p><p>
I've already mentioned the first way to make use of D-Bus: by using the
KDE programs qdbusviewer and qdbus. However, if you're not into KDE, you
can use the command-line programs dbus-send and dbus-monitor to send and
monitor D-Bus messages, respectively. For example, you can put the system
into suspend mode with the following command:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ dbus-send --dest=org.freedesktop.PowerManagement \
                /org/freedesktop/PowerManagement \
                org.freedesktop.PowerManagement.Suspend
</pre>
</p><p>
As you can see, the dbus-send calls are almost identical to the ones with
qdbus. The only difference is that you have to use the --dest parameter
for the service name. But, let's look at something new. If you are watching a
long YouTube video in your browser, the screensaver can kick in, because
the Flash plugin doesn't communicate with the rest of your system. With
D-Bus, you can stop this annoying behavior. The magic command is this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ dbus-send --print-reply \
            --dest=org.gnome.ScreenSaver / \
            org.gnome.ScreenSaver.Inhibit \
                string:"YouTube" \
                string:"Inhibit Screensaver"
</pre>
</p><p>
With this command, you call the Inhibit method of the org.gnome.ScreenSaver
interface with two arguments. The first one is the application's name. I
use &ldquo;YouTube&rdquo; here, but it can be an arbitrary name. The second argument
is the reason to inhibit the screensaver. dbus-send expects each argument
to be preceded by its type, such as string, boolean, int16 and so on. The two
arguments here are strings. I also use the argument --print-reply, because
I need the reply of the command: the Inhibit method returns a uint32
number, which is a &ldquo;cookie&rdquo; identifying the inhibit request.
If you want
to uninhibit the screensaver, you have to send this cookie as the argument:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ dbus-send --dest=org.gnome.ScreenSaver / \
            org.gnome.ScreenSaver.UnInhibit \
                uint32:1234567890
</pre>
</p><p>
With these two commands, you can hack your own personal
screensaver-inhibition shell script.
Note: you need to save the cookie to a variable or a file
when the first command runs and then substitute the actual cookie value
in the command above.
</p><p>
If you are debugging D-Bus scripts or observing the methods and signals
of other D-Bus applications, the command-line program dbus-monitor comes
in very handy. Just fire it up in a terminal, and you will see all D-Bus
activity scrolling by.
dbus-monitor is useful for seeing all D-Bus activity in real time. So if something is
happening on your system, for example, your network goes down, you can see
in the output of dbus-monitor how this message is sent to the D-Bus bus. This
way, you know which signals to listen for or which methods to call to tap
in to the same events.
</p><p>
dbus-monitor also allows you to specify a set of expressions you want
to watch&mdash;for example:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ dbus-monitor --system "interface='org.freedesktop.NetworkManager'"
</pre>
</p><p>
This will monitor all NetworkManager events. I use the --system argument
because NetworkManager uses the system bus.

Scripting the Liferea Feed Reader</h2></div></div><p>
The Liferea feed reader has a small but interesting set of D-Bus
methods. The most interesting method is Subscribe, which allows you to
add a feed to Liferea from another application. One application that uses
this is FeedBag, a Firefox extension that modifies the feed button
in the browser's address bar: if you click on the button, it will add
a subscription to Liferea instead of to the Live Bookmarks. Under the hood,
this works because FeedBag calls the org.gnome.feed.Reader.Subscribe
method. You can do the same from a terminal:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ feed="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/linuxjournalcom?format=xml"
$ dbus-send --dest=org.gnome.feed.Reader \
            /org/gnome/feed/Reader \
            org.gnome.feed.Reader.Subscribe \
                string:"$feed"
</pre>
</p><p>
Liferea provides a script, liferea-add-feed, which does exactly this,
but with some added error handling.
</p><p>
Liferea also exposes some information via D-Bus, which is interesting
if you have an alternative window manager that is not using Liferea's
notification area. Then, you can brew your own notification system&mdash;just
ask for the number of new and unread items in Liferea and show the output:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ dbus-send --print-reply \
             --dest=org.gnome.feed.Reader \
             /org/gnome/feed/Reader \
             org.gnome.feed.Reader.GetNewItems

$ dbus-send --print-reply \
            --dest=org.gnome.feed.Reader \
            /org/gnome/feed/Reader \
            org.gnome.feed.Reader.GetUnreadItems
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dc1580.0x1ebab10"></a>
Away from the Keyboard</h2></div></div><p>
If you want to do more complex tasks than calling a single method, you
can write a shell script with dbus-send commands or use a
higher-level language to simplify the task.
There are D-Bus bindings for languages such as Python, Ruby and Java.
</p><p>
In this next example, I implement a Python script that
sets your status on Pidgin to &ldquo;Away from keyboard&rdquo; if your screensaver
activates. This shows two aspects of D-Bus: the script waits for a signal
from the screensaver, and then it calls a method in Pidgin. The script
is shown in Listing 1.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dc1580.0x22b2f70"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Listing 1. pidgin_screensaver.py</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">
#!/usr/bin/env python

def pidgin_status_func(state):
    obj = bus.get_object("im.pidgin.purple.PurpleService",
                         "/im/pidgin/purple/PurpleObject")
    pidgin = dbus.Interface(obj, "im.pidgin.purple.PurpleInterface")
    status = pidgin.PurpleSavedstatusFind("afk")
    if status == 0:
        status = pidgin.PurpleSavedstatusNew("afk", 5)
    if state:
        pidgin.PurpleSavedstatusSetMessage(status,
                                           "Away from keyboard")
        pidgin.PurpleSavedstatusActivate(status)

import dbus, gobject
from dbus.mainloop.glib import DBusGMainLoop

dbus.mainloop.glib.DBusGMainLoop(set_as_default=True)
bus = dbus.SessionBus()

bus.add_signal_receiver(pidgin_status_func,
                        dbus_interface="org.gnome.ScreenSaver",
                        signal_name="ActiveChanged")

loop = gobject.MainLoop()
loop.run()
</pre></div><p>
Let's dissect this script. The function pidgin_status_func sets your
status in Pidgin. It gets the im/pidgin/purple/PurpleObject object and
then the im.pidgin.purple.PurpleInterface interface from the session
bus. Then, it calls this interface's methods. It creates a new &ldquo;saved
status&rdquo; type by first checking if the status type with name
&ldquo;afk&rdquo; exists,
and if not, it creates it (&ldquo;afk&rdquo; stands for &ldquo;Away From
Keyboard&rdquo;,
and 5 is the &ldquo;away&rdquo; status type).
</p><p>
Then, the function checks the state variable that is an argument to
the pidgin_status_func function call (I explain what this argument
means later). If the argument is true, it sets the status message of the
new &ldquo;afk&rdquo;
status to &ldquo;Away from keyboard&rdquo; and activates the new status.
The effect is that Pidgin shows your status as &ldquo;afk&rdquo; with the
status message &ldquo;Away from keyboard&rdquo;.
</p><p>
Now you need to call this function when the screensaver
activates. Therefore, start the dbus main loop and connect to the
session bus. Then, add a signal receiver that listens to the signal
ActiveChanged from the org.gnome.ScreenSaver interface. If/when the signal
fires, it calls out pidgin_status_func function. As the
ActiveChanged signal has a boolean argument that signifies the current
state of the screensaver (1 for active and 0 for non-active), you have
defined one argument called state in the pidgin_status_func function.
To keep listening, let the loop run indefinitely, as long as the script
is running.
</p><p>
Pidgin has an extremely rich D-Bus interface;
you can do almost anything with it. So let this example give you some
inspiration to do some creative tasks in Pidgin!
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dc1580.0x22b3650"></a>
Playing D-Bus</h2></div></div><p>
Let's look at another example, this time in Ruby. We're going to create
a script that shows the currently playing song in Rhythmbox as your
status in Pidgin (Listing 2).

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dc1580.0x22b37b0"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Listing 2. pidgin_rhythmbox.rb</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">
#!/usr/bin/env ruby

require 'dbus'

bus = DBus::SessionBus.instance
rhythmbox = bus.service("org.gnome.Rhythmbox")
player = rhythmbox.object("/org/gnome/Rhythmbox/Player")
player.introspect
player.default_iface = "org.gnome.Rhythmbox.Player"

pidgin = bus.service("im.pidgin.purple.PurpleService")
purple = pidgin.object("/im/pidgin/purple/PurpleObject")
purple.introspect
purple.default_iface = "im.pidgin.purple.PurpleInterface"

player.on_signal("playingUriChanged") do |uri|
  status = purple.PurpleSavedstatusFind("rhythmbox").first
  if status == 0
    status = purple.PurpleSavedstatusNew("rhythmbox", 2).first
  end
  purple.PurpleSavedstatusSetMessage(status, uri.to_s)
  purple.PurpleSavedstatusActivate(status)
end
</pre></div><p>
Here you see the same type of commands as I used in the Python script: 
open a D-Bus session, define D-Bus services, objects and interfaces,
and I define a signal receiver. And, a loop runs indefinitely to keep
listening to the D-Bus signals.
</p><p>
Of course, this could be tidied up a bit.
For example, you now are showing only the file path of the song as the status
message. I'll leave it to the reader to extract the relevant ID3 tags out
of the file and show them instead of the file path.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dc1580.0x22b3a70"></a>
Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Now that you know how to perform D-Bus calls and how to handle D-Bus
signals, you can get started automating tasks on your desktop.
If you are a Linux power user, D-Bus definitely should be in your
vocabulary.
</p><p>
There is much more to D-Bus than I could show you in this
article, but with qdbusviewer, qdbus, dbus-send and dbus-monitor, you
can explore the possibilities yourself. If you want to create some more
complex automation tasks with D-Bus, the Python and Ruby programming
languages are a good fit. Consider the tutorials mentioned in the
Resources, and then just let your imagination flow.
</p><p>
If you're a software developer, the part I didn't cover
here is registering a service.
This is the other side of the D-Bus story. If you register a service,
you can provide objects to other applications via D-Bus.
