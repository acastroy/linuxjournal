Using a combination of open-source technologies, you can
build an unattended network-based OS installer that can save you
huge amounts of time and even can install Windows.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x176c580.0x1864250"></a></h2></div></div><p>
In the April 2008 issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>, Kyle
Rankin's article
&ldquo;PXE Magic&rdquo; explains how PXE (Preboot
eXecution Environment) works and how you can install your own PXE
server and integrate rescue tools like Knoppix along with a PXE-capable
Kickstart installation. I've used much of Kyle's PXE Magic before
(he and I worked together in a previous life), but recently I found
myself managing not only a network of Linux servers, but also the entire LAN,
encompassing Ubuntu laptops, desktops and servers, along with Windows
laptops, desktops and servers. I found myself imagineering a PXE server
that would not only allow me to kickstart servers and boot rescue tools
off the network, but that also could provide a temporary environment for my users
in the event that their computers broke. In my mind, the Holy Grail of this
PXE server even would be able to install Windows machines via the
network. After
a fair amount of trial and error, I finally figured out the recipe,
and in a strange twist, I was able to automate a network-based Windows
installation...by bootstrapping Linux first.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x176c580.0x1864510"></a>
Setting Up an Ubuntu Terminal Server</h2></div></div><p>
I knew one of my goals for this system would be to give the users
of my network an environment they could PXE boot to in a pinch&mdash;something that would appear familiar to them, as well as allow them the
ability to perform basic tasks like check e-mail, surf the Web, instant
message and so on. Luckily, much of our staff here runs Ubuntu on the desktop, so the
decision to implement an Ubuntu Terminal Server using the Linux Terminal
Server Project (LTSP) was a simple one. 
</p><p>
Like any PXE implementation, the
LTSP server requires a TFTP server, a properly configured DHCP server
and the syslinux software. In a nutshell, the client boots; the PXE code
in the network adapter runs; the machine gets a DHCP address and the
address of a server to grab the syslinux code via TFTP; and then, it actually
runs a TFTP client and downloads that code and executes it, starting the
boot process. Thanks to the hard work of the Ubuntu LTSP maintainers,
setting up the server was fast and easy. 
</p><p>
There are two paths you can
take to install an LTSP server: normal or standalone. A normal
LTSP installation assumes you have a pre-existing DHCP server on your
network, and a standalone LTSP install assumes no DHCP server, and
it will install the DHCP infrastructure and integrate it with the LTSP
server automatically. There already was a DHCP server on our corporate
LAN, so I elected to do the normal LTSP installation and integrate it
with our existing Microsoft Windows DHCP server.
</p><p>
I began the installation by installing a standard Ubuntu 8.04 desktop
on a Dell 1950 server, as the LTSP server will have to act as a GNOME
desktop for anyone who would be logging in to it. After that, I assigned
the server a static IP on our LAN (on the same subnet as the desktops and
laptops). Installing the LTSP server was a piece of cake&mdash;a simple
<tt  >sudo
apt-get install ltsp-server openssh-server</tt> at the GNOME
terminal, and
that task was complete. The final step on the LTSP server was to build
the thin-client environment. Simply running <tt  >sudo
ltsp-build-client</tt>
at the GNOME terminal fired off the remaining configuration steps
and built the LTSP chroot.
</p><p>
Now that the LTSP server itself was ready, I had to enable our network for
PXE booting, and this meant messing with the Windows DHCP server. It took
a little bit of trial and error, but much like in the DHCP server config
that Kyle mentions in his article, there were only two configuration
options that needed to be added to the DHCP scope. In Microsoft-ese,
these were Option &ldquo;066 Boot Server Host Name&rdquo;, which I set to the IP
address assigned to the LTSP server and Option &ldquo;067 Bootfile
Name&rdquo;,
which I set to &ldquo;ltsp/i386/pxelinux.0&rdquo;. The last DHCP option seemed
a little obscure, until I realized that the Ubuntu TFTP server's root
directory was /var/lib/tftpboot. If you're running some other DHCP server,
see the DHCP Notes sidebar, or refer to your DHCP server's documentation
on adding options to the DHCP scope.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x176c580.0x1864930"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
DHCP Notes</b></p><p>
I mentioned integrating the LTSP server with a Microsoft Windows DHCP
server, but it's not difficult to get the server to work with other DHCP
servers. If you are running the &ldquo;standard&rdquo; ISC dhcpd server,
see Kyle's &ldquo;PXE Magic&rdquo; article (listed in Resources). He
includes example
configuration options along with excellent explanations as to how they
work. If you are running dnsmasq (popular in OpenWRT and other embedded
or lightweight Linux distributions), the 
<tt  >dhcp-option=66,&lt;ltsp_ip_address&gt;</tt>and
<tt  >dhcp-option=pxe,67,pxelinux.0</tt> in the dnsmasq.conf
file should be
what you need (I run this configuration at my home).

Figure 1. The Ubuntu LTSP GDM Login Screen
</p></div></div><p>
At this point, I could boot a PC on our LAN, press F12, select Onboard
NIC as the boot device, and in about 30 seconds, I got a GDM login
screen! I could log in to an LTSP session at this point, but I had to do
it as one of the users that already was on the Ubuntu server. It was close,
but not quite what I wanted, as the ideal setup would allow anyone on
our Windows domain to log in to an LTSP session. Fixing this would have
meant integrating the server with our corporate Active Directory. That
used to be a major chore unto itself, but with Ubuntu 8.04 and higher,
it's just an apt-get and a couple commands away. 
</p><p>
The package that
makes all this magic happen is called likewise-open. First, I ran:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo apt-get install likewise-open
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x176c580.0x1864fb8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
to get the likewise package. After that, I had to
get the Ubuntu server to &ldquo;join&rdquo; the Windows domain. I did this
by running:


<pre     class="programlisting">

sudo domainjoin-cli join &lt;fqdn.mydomain.com&gt; &lt;DomainAdminUID&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
I wanted
likewise to run when the machine boots, so I issued a:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo update-rc.d likewise-open defaults 
</pre>
</p><p>
I also wanted the logins to be checked against
the default domain, so I added the following line to the
/etc/samba/lwiauthd.conf file:

<pre     class="programlisting">
winbind use default domain = yes
</pre>
</p><p>
Finally, I started the
likewise-open d&aelig;mon using:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo /etc/init.d/likewise-open start
</pre>
</p><p>
Now,
my PXE LTSP clients could authenticate against the corporate Active
Directory. Step one of the mission was complete!

Setting Up Unattended Windows Installs via PXE</h2></div></div><p>
The next step in my PXE adventures came when I was told I needed to
refresh about 30 laptops with fresh builds of Windows. The method the
previous Windows staff used to install Windows was through imaging the
machine. Unfortunately, I could not locate the image files that had been
used previously. Due to the issues and time constraints involved with
trying to redevelop valid images for each hardware platform we had,
I elected to do unattended installations of Windows. 
</p><p>
I knew Windows
included Remote Installation Service (RIS), but
because I was in a time crunch, I was reluctant to learn a completely
new technology. However, there was another option: Unattended, an open-source project. I'd found the Unattended project about a year earlier,
and although I'd dabbled with it in my home lab, I'd never tried it in a
corporate environment. Like many Linux administrators, I hear
&ldquo;Windows&rdquo;
and I cringe, but because I was tasked with this, I figured I'd do my
best to make sense of the Windows install process, as well as get some
repeatability and understanding out of it.
</p><p>
Unattended relies on the fact that the first step of the Windows 2000/XP
installer is essentially a DOS program. What happens when a machine is
PXE booted to an Unattended install is a little convoluted, but it allows
for great flexibility. Basically, the machine boots to a Linux kernel
and shell, where some scripts provided by Unattended step in. The script
partitions the system's disk and creates a basic FAT filesystem, and then
it walks you through some menus where you can make choices as to the OS
type (if you've set up Unattended with different Microsoft
OS flavors), installation options and optional software you may have
packaged. You're asked all the questions for a particular installation
up front, including the CD Key, User Name, workgroup or domain to join,
and administrative users. The Unattended scripts automatically digest
all of this and create an unattend.txt file, which is dropped on the
newly created FAT filesystem. Then, a FreeDOS session is started, and
the Windows installer and OS bits are copied from a Samba share on
the Unattended server, and then the installer is launched using the
unattend.txt file. At this point, the installation is hands-off and
proceeds without administrator intervention. The Unattended team has even
gone so far as to create custom scripts that can install other pieces
of software you may want to add to your configuration (automated VPN
or Microsoft Office, for example).
</p><p>
Because there is no packaged install for Unattended, and the install process
is quite different from the standard <tt  >./configure &amp;&amp; make
install</tt>,
I sat down for a bit and read the documentation on the site. Basically,
the Unattended system leverages PXE and Linux as stated above, plus Samba
for the distribution of the installation bits, and a bunch of Perl,
shell and batch scripts to do a lot of the installation
&ldquo;magic&rdquo;. 
</p><p>
The
documentation asks that you have a working DHCP and DNS server, as well as
a Samba server. I had the DHCP and DNS figured out for the LTSP server,
so as per the step-by-step documentation, a <tt  >sudo apt-get install
samba</tt> got the Samba server installed. Next, I downloaded the Unattended
distribution from the Web site and unpacked it in /opt/unattended. Then,
I created a CNAME record on our DNS server that pointed ntinstall
to the real hostname of the installation server. I then configured the
Samba server with the following share information in /etc/samba/smb.conf:

<pre     class="programlisting">
[global]
...
guest account   = guest
unix extensions = off
...
[install]
   comment  = Unattended
   writable = no
   locking  = no
   path     = /path/to/unattended/install
   guest ok = yes
</pre>
</p><p>
Finally, it was time to populate the OS distribution point with the
Windows bits. This is done by creating a directory under the &lt;unattended
root&gt;/install/os directory for whatever flavor of Windows you choose
to install. In my case, I created an /opt/unattended/install/os/winxp
directory and mounted that directory via Samba on my desktop. Then, I
dropped the Windows installation media into the CD drive on my desktop
and copied the /i386 directory from the CD to the /install/os/winxp share
on the server. Now my Unattended server was, in theory, ready to install a
system...except there was no way to select the Unattended install from
a boot menu.
</p><p>
Here's where Kyle's article helped out again. What I needed was a
PXE boot menu, and thanks to his article, I was able to whip up one
in fairly short order. I had to take the bzImage and initrd files
out of the tftpboot directory in the linuxboot zip file on the
Unattended site and place them in the /var/lib/tftpboot/ltsp/i386/
directory (I renamed the bzImage to unat and the intird to
unatin.img to help distinguish them better). 
</p><p>
Then, I created a
/var/lib/tftpboot/ltsp/i386/pxelinux.cfg/default file (Listing 1) on the server,
containing a combination of the syslinux boot arguments from the LTSP
server and the Unattended server's configurations. Note the DISPLAY and
LABEL directives. The DISPLAY directive states that when the machine
boots you see the file pxemenu.msg displayed on the screen. This
contains the text of the menu. The LABEL directive is what you type
to boot a particular menu option. In this case, if I type &ldquo;1&rdquo;, I get
the Ubuntu LTSP session (this is also the default), and if I type
&ldquo;2&rdquo;,
I get the Unattended Windows install.

APPEND initrd=unatin.img z_user=guest z_password=guest 
 &#8618;z_path=//192.168.1.20/install
</pre></div><p>
Now, when I booted a PXE client, I got a choice as to whether to go
to the Ubuntu LTSP session or the Unattended install. At this point, I
tested the Unattended installation, and it sort of worked&mdash;it installed
a base Windows system just fine, but it didn't install any of the drivers,
nor any of the patches to the operating system. I realized
just how spoiled I am by Ubuntu's driver coverage and update manager,
but I slogged ahead and continued to work to refine the system so that
the driver and update installation happened without my intervention.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10410f3.large.jpg"><img src="10410f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Choosing What Software Goes on the Machine
</p></div></div><p>
It turns out I didn't have to re-invent the wheel, as the driver issue
and the update issue both have been addressed by the Unattended team. As
far as the driver stuff goes, there is a method to integrate DriverPacks
(which are large compressed archives of drivers) into the Unattended
system. It's a little bit too involved for the scope of this article, but see
the DriverPack link in the Resources section for more information. 
</p><p>
With
respect to automatic update installation, the method the Unattended folks
use is very Linux-like in its resourcefulness. Under the Unattended root
path, there are two directories: the /install/scripts and /install/tools
directories. The scripts directory contains Windows batch files (.bat)
that are used to do automated installation of various software packages,
as well as some basic updates. The tools directory contains a set of
scripts that will look at your Unattended server's current configuration
and scripts directory, and then compare it to the CVS tree maintained
by the Unattended team. The scripts then will grab the latest .bat files
and drop them in the correct place in the scripts directory. At that
point, the next Windows install that's done with the Unattended system
will get all the patches and install them automagically. The system 
even will reboot at the appropriate times, then pick up the next patch in the
series and install it. To update the Unattended system's patch repository,
it's as simple as running a <tt  >./script-update; ./check;
./prepare</tt> from
the /install/tools directory under the Unattended root.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10410f4.large.jpg"><img src="10410f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Windows installing! Faster and more reliable, that's
debatable.
</p></div></div><p>
The CVS archive of scripts, as well as the script archive on the wiki,
proved to be invaluable. Those resources allowed me to finish the complete
automation of my install, and now, I have a configuration that meets my
company's needs for Windows. After about 30 seconds of typing
the machine-specific information at the beginning of the installation,
I now can walk away and know that Windows, Office, the Cisco VPN client,
Symantec Anti-Virus and many other things my Windows users need will
be done my way, automagically, without requiring myself or another staff
member to babysit it.
</p><p>
In closing, thanks to the efforts of the Ubuntu and LTSP teams, I now
have an environment that lets my users do some kind of work, even when
their systems may have some kind of issue. And, thanks to the Unattended
team, I don't have to sit at a Windows machine physically to install it,
nor do I have to mess with half-baked images or other strange packaging
solutions. I'm already getting other ideas on how to extend this system
even further.
