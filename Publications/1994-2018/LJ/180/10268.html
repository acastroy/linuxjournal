Solaris-Zones provides the ability to run Linux and Solaris
on the same machine without all the overhead of full virtualization.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe3f580.0xf37250"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Seldom is a data center asked to do less. More often, it's asked to do
more with less&mdash;fewer computers and less power consumption. One significant
industry discussion for the past few years has been regarding a reduction in
the number of physical servers and an increase in the application-to-server ratio to maximize server utilization.
Often, this increase is done via virtualization.
</p><p>
At Texas Instruments (TI), we have numerous data centers and design environments that
thrive on the use of Linux and Solaris. Typically, each OS is installed
on individual systems stacked high and aligned in rows throughout the
data center. Linux applications run on Linux;
Solaris applications run on Solaris.
</p><p>
Recently, a new virtualization solution
has emerged that enables IT professionals to combine Linux and Solaris together
within one physical environment. This solution reduces the number of
physical systems in the computer environment and increases server work
with greater efficiency.
</p><p>
One of the Solaris virtualization environments is called
Solaris-Zones (also known as Solaris-Containers).
Through the development of Open-Solaris, Solaris-Zones has been expanded
to support zone branding. Solaris-Zones now enables the creation of
&ldquo;lx&rdquo; branded zones. The lx branded zone supports the installation and
execution of the Linux OS and its applications. When lx branded
zones are used in conjunction with the ZFS (Zeta-byte File System),
Linux environments are able to do more, faster.
</p><p>
Linux always has been about technical developers and enthusiasts doing
whatever moves them. The security of Solaris-Zones combined with the
power of Linux opens a huge new frontier of development freedom&mdash;from
the enterprise environment to the single desktop. With Solaris-Zones,
it's easy to define, create, install and execute Linux (lx) branded zones.
</p><p>
This article introduces lx branded zones and presents the necessary tools
for each step of the zone management process. Readers should have some understanding
of a chroot environment and
the basic concepts of virtual machines (VMs) and the features they provide.
Knowledge of these concepts is not required, but it will help
in conveying what a zone is and create a better platform for understanding.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe3f580.0xf37670"></a>
Zones Simplified</h2></div></div><p>
So, what is a zone? A zone provides security and virtualization in a unique
way. The Solaris-Zone has its own filesystem with a root directory,
system files and so on, like that of the primary environment of the physical
system. The private root filesystem, one per zone, gives it the ability
to be fully configurable and flexible. A zone provides nearly the same
experience as the main OS. In this regard, it is like a VM without the VM
hardware emulation layer. 
</p><p>
The zone is provided with an operating environment
but without a private dedicated kernel. The lack of a dedicated kernel is a huge
performance enhancement&mdash;when you experience the boot process, you will see how
fast it is compared to a normal boot. User and administrator experience
within the zone is very similar to that of a full VM in flexibility, but
like a chroot environment, it sheds the overhead of a full VM.
</p><p>
It is important to understand that a zone is not a full virtual machine
in the sense that you would see with Xen or VMware or VirtualBox.
A zone is an emulation layer, more akin to Wine perhaps, but at a more fundamental level.
This, for example, means that an lx branded zone does not contain its own
Linux kernel;
rather, the kernel calls are redirected by the zone's emulation layer to the underlying Solaris kernel.
</p><p>
The zone provides security through isolation. Each zone has its own root
account and password. The superuser within
a zone has no special privileges to gain access to objects outside the
zone. No account has rights to exit the zone or examine processes and
files outside the zone. Advanced resource management is enabled
when control of memory and CPU resources by zone is important. Resource
management keeps zones from being harmed by others, including but not limited
to CPU and memory starvation.
</p><p>
Note: the primary Solaris OS and the physical platform on which it executes are
also known as a zone. It is defined as the global zone and continues
to look and feel as it always has. All other zones
are created from the global zone. Created zones are called sub or
non-global zones. Non-global zones cannot create zones within themselves. Figure 1 illustrates
the relationship between the global zone,
non-global zones and possible VMs.

Zone Branding</h2></div></div><p>
Solaris-Zones became available with the release of Solaris 10
(later Open-Solaris). With these early releases, only a
&ldquo;native&rdquo; Solaris
zone could be defined, installed and executed. With the August 2007
release, Solaris-Zones includes support for zone branding to allow Linux
installation and execution. By default, a zone is defined as native,
unless it's defined explicitly as a Linux (lx) branded zone. Once
a zone is branded lx, only Linux can be installed into that zone.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe3f580.0xf37c48"></a>
Commands</h2></div></div><p>
The zone experience is defined by a simple command set. Each command
is used to manage one of the logical divisions of the zone maintenance
process. The primary divisions of zone administration are define,
install and execute. The zone experience is very simple; it involves only a
few commands. Two of the commands
provide support for the definition, installation and setup of zones, and
the other two are used for a running zone:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
zonecfg: define a zone (metadata only).
</p></li><li><p>
zoneadm: install/uninstall, boot and query.
</p></li><li><p>
zlogin: log in to a zone or connect to its console.
</p></li><li><p>
zonename: prints the name of the zone executed within.
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe3f580.0xf38068"></a>
Define a Zone</h2></div></div><p>
Use the zonecfg command to define a zone. Although it is possible to
define a zone without networking, all examples presented here define
zones with networking.
Listing 1 shows how to define a network interface for use
by an lx branded zone.
With zonecfg, you can create a minimal zone definition,
set the zone's name, set its installation path and type
and include a network interface.
A minimum definition requires only the branding,
zone name and the installation path. The zonecfg command must
be executed as the superuser. In the examples here, the shell prompt is used
to illustrate from which zone a command is run. The initial example
below indicates the shell is within the global zone and ready to
&ldquo;define&rdquo;
a non-global zone by the use of the zonecfg command.
</p><p>
Note: ZFS (denoted
or hinted at by path names) is used for performance; however, it is not
required. Feel free to use any appropriate directory path to build one
or more zones.

</pre></div><p>
Adjust the paths accordingly to match your local environment. Items
to consider are zonepath and network values. Change these to match
available storage, local network requirements and available network
interface. The first command shows that execution is in the global
zone. The zonecfg command defines the name of the zone, the installation
path and network attributes. The final command lists all configured and
running zones. Once a zone is defined, use the zonecfg command to update
or delete a zone configuration.
</p><p>
Note that not all properties can be updated or added after a zone
has been installed.
Generally, properties with this restriction are ones related
to native zone definitions, not lx branded zones.
For properties that can be changed after a zone is installed,
the zone should be in a halted state or rebooted to make the change active.
</p><p>
The first example shows the red-zone as configured. This means it is
defined only (metadata created and saved). Two properties in
the example can be used to illustrate updating properties of
an already-defined zone: zonepath and the network attributes. Each
of them can be changed while the zone is halted (not running). If a
zone has been installed and the zonepath is changed, the operator is
required to move the physical location of the old zonepath
to the location of the new zonepath manually. In the next example (Listing
2),
the directory red-zone needs to be renamed to red-zone-x under the
/zpool01/zones directory to complete the property update.

Install a Defined Zone</h2></div></div><p>
We now have a defined zone. Use the zoneadm command
to complete the OS installation into the zone named red-zone. The sub functions
of zoneadm are related to the execution status of a zone. The install
process of an lx branded zone requires Linux media. The media can be
provided in a physical form and loaded into the system's CD-ROM drive,
or you can use the &ldquo;green&rdquo; method and provide the image as one or
more ISO files.

Boot the Zone</h2></div></div><p>
Once the zone installation is complete, it's time to boot it.
Create two shells, and run the commands shown in Listing 4.
Connect to the zone console first, then boot the zone in the second shell to get the full
console experience (it's very fast, you'll not want to miss it). The example
zlogin connects to the zone's console device and configures the escape
(exit the zlogin) as the &ldquo;#.&rdquo; (pound sign then period) key sequence. This key
sequence should be unique and avoid issues that the default sequence of
&ldquo;~.&rdquo; (tilde then period) can cause when connectivity to the global zone
is remote.

Login</h2></div></div><p>
A non-global zone has nearly the same abilities as the global zone to
provide services: login connections are not limited
to text or console logins.
The use of zlogin with no options (only the zone name) connects
to the zone without a console, which creates a tty and invokes login.
Any active zone service also
can be used, such as XDM, SSH and FTP, to allow other forms of login.

The zone creation steps are straightforward and simple. The process may
take only a few steps, but they are manual and error-prone.
The zonetool.pl utility (see Resources) automates the zone creation process
and includes detailed POD documentation.

Closing Thoughts and Ideas</h2></div></div><p>
With relatively small
amounts of disk and memory resources, a single physical server can
host hundreds of zones. Each zone is usable by any number of users,
and a single-user zone provides extreme flexibility. A single user
can create more than one zone to test both server and client environments,
and the applications will believe they are on unique physical hosts.
A zone user may have use of the zone's
unique root password or unfettered sudo access within that zone without
concern for security and stability of the global zone and other non-global
zones.
</p><p>
The lx branded
zone does have its limitations. Much of the zone's power comes from
securely shared resources with the global zone. The zone shares a kernel
with the global zone and, therefore, places limits on kernel modules and
drivers. Because zones are not full VMs, the Linux distributions that can be installed in an lx
branded zone are limited. Support for other Linux releases
is possible, and further interest in this technology will inspire continued
development and support for additional Linux distributions. Review the
Resources section of this article for more information on this and related topics.
