<span   class="emphasis"><em>Ultrastar Deluxe</em></span>&mdash;Home Karaoke Game
(<a href="http://www.ultrastardeluxe.org" target="_self">www.ultrastardeluxe.org</a>)</h2></div></div><p>
This project really caught my eye when browsing through SourceForge this
month, and not being a big karaoke guy, this well-established project
(more than 12 million users strong) has somehow passed me by all this
time. For any others not in the know, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Ultrastar Deluxe</em></span> is &ldquo;A free and
open-source karaoke game inspired by the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Singstar</em></span> game available on
the PlayStation. It allows up to six players to sing along with music
using microphones in order to score points, depending on the pitch of the
voice and the rhythm of singing.&rdquo; <span   class="emphasis"><em>Ultrastar
Deluxe</em></span> also runs on Linux,
Windows and Mac OS X.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10383f1.large.jpg"><img src="10383f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
<span  class="emphasis"><em>Ultrastar Deluxe</em></span> brings you an amazing karaoke program with gorgeous
graphics.
</p></div></div><p>
The most impressive feature I found was the ability to use pretty
much any kind of video you want in the background, including MPEG,
DivX, YouTube .flv&mdash;whatever you like. An extremely impressive and
professional demonstration is available on YouTube (<a href="http://au.youtube.com/watch?v=uvBSeme34bE" target="_self">au.youtube.com/watch?v=uvBSeme34bE</a>),
where you can see the program in action with karaoke cues taking place
on top of videos from artists such as the Foo Fighters and Tenacious
D. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Ultrastar</em></span> isn't limited only to videos though. Standard gameplay
generally takes place with an MP3 playing with a possible artist's picture
in the background while the program takes information, such as timing cues
and the like, from an accompanying text file. As the text file is raw
ASCII and the format is well documented, it leaves the entire process
open to fans syncing up their own lyrical cues to any track they like,
from any band. The game also comes with an editor built in, which will
save hours of headache-inducing raw text editing.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10383f2.large.jpg"><img src="10383f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Although I've got it set up with only one song, you can see how clean and
colorful the interface is.
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10383f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
The guys from <span  class="emphasis"><em>Ultrastar</em></span> have put up a great YouTube video of their program
in action. Here's someone rockin' out to the Foo Fighters.
</p></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Installation</b></span>
</p><p>
Installing <span   class="emphasis"><em>Ultrastar</em></span> can be a pain without someone holding your hand,
but luckily there's a quick-start guide available that's well worth a
look. The guide to installing it quickly under Ubuntu is very good,
and it's probably the best guide for many other distributions too (if it
doesn't work right away, or your distro doesn't use apt, at least
the package names should help). I've chopped the Ubuntu guide down
to the bare essentials that worked for me, but if you need more information,
see the installation guide on-line (<a href="http://ultrastardeluxe.xtremeweb-hosting.net/wiki/doku.php?id=development:compile" target="_self">ultrastardeluxe.xtremeweb-hosting.net/wiki/doku.php?id=development:compile</a>).
</p><p>
First, you need to satisfy <span   class="emphasis"><em>Ultrastar</em></span>'s dependencies. Open a shell,
and enter the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo apt-get install fp-compiler fp-units-base 
 &#8618;fp-units-misc fp-units-fcl fp-units-i386 fp-utils 
 &#8618;libsdl1.2-dev libsdl-image1.2-dev portaudio19-dev 
 &#8618;libsqlite3-dev libfreetype6-dev libavcodec-dev 
 &#8618;libavformat-dev libswscale-dev
</pre>
</p><p>
You can download the source either by SVN or wget, but for the sake of
space, we'll just run with SVN here. If you don't have SVN, grab it with
the following command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo apt-get install subversion
</pre>
</p><p>
Open a terminal where you want to save the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Ultrastar</em></span> source, and enter
this command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ svn co https://ultrastardx.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/
&#8618;ultrastardx/trunk usdx-source
</pre>
</p><p>
SVN will save the contents to the directory usdx-source. Enter
that directory with this command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ cd usdx-source
</pre>
</p><p>
And, compile it with these commands:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install
</pre>
</p><p>
You can run <span   class="emphasis"><em>Ultrastar Deluxe</em></span> now, but I found with the SVN download,
there weren't any songs added along with it (hence, nothing to load
up and sing along to). If you check the project's Web site, there
are some free songs to download provided by the community. Download
a song's zip file and extract the contents somewhere locally. Then,
with root or superuser permission, copy the files to the folder
/usr/local/share/ultrastardx/songs. Once those are in place, you should
be good to go.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Usage</b></span>
</p><p>
After all that, you now should be able to run the program with this
command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ultrastardx
</pre>
</p><p>
Once you're in the game, you'll be presented with the following menu options:
sing, party, tools and quit. If you want to jump right into the
action, choose sing. Enter your player name, select your difficulty level,
and then you'll be taken to your song selection. Here you will find what
are quite frankly gorgeous graphics, and an interface that should be
familiar with users of programs such as iTunes and the like. Left and
right arrows scroll through available tracks, and Enter starts playing a
track. If you look at the bottom of the screen, there's a guide
to further controls for better navigation and setting up a playlist. Once
the track is playing, a number of cues will guide
you quite easily through things such as timing and pitch, and anyone mildly
familiar with karaoke should have no problems here.
</p><p>
Under party mode, you can choose from a number of innovative playing
modes, such as the classic one on one with Duell. Blind Mode removes
pitch cues leaving you to sing purely by feel. Until 5000 mode is where
each player races to get 5,000 points, and the first one there wins. Once
you've played for a while, it's worth checking what's available under
tools, as there are options to tweak microphone settings, change the
graphics resolution and change the in-game theme, among many others.
</p><p>
If you aren't getting anything from your microphone, check that it's
working properly back in desktop land. It's probably a good idea to
try to record a small amount of audio under a basic recording program
and play it back to make sure everything's in order and sounding
decent. Anyone who has the Singstar microphone from the PlayStation game
should be able to use this too, according to the instructions (I don't have
either the original game or mic, so I can't verify this). 
</p><p>
Back
in the game, there are settings to tweak the number of channels you can
use, including the number of players, and even a party option with up to
12 players with three teams, but I don't have nearly enough space
to cover that here.
</p><p>
Honestly, checking out the rest of the Web site is well worth it, as
there's a bundle of themes available, including one that will make
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Ultrastar</em></span> resemble the Nintendo Wii (quite appropriate given you 
also can use a Wii controller). The links section of the Web site has instructions for a
number of tools, such as the in-game editor and its syntax, plus there's
a community board for requesting songs, exchanging help and so on.
</p><p>
Not only is <span   class="emphasis"><em>Ultrastar Deluxe</em></span> a great program for karaoke enthusiasts,
it's also a great place for musicians to get their music out there to the
public for free while having adoring teenagers singing along. Proprietary
solutions may be better for getting famous songs on hand straightaway,
but you would have to pay quite a premium for this, and the last time I tried
karaoke, one of these machines was using a very lame midi soundtrack
(which sounds awful when playing Metallica, trust me)!
</p><p>
If I were an enthusiast setting up at home and didn't mind scouting around
for text files or spending some hours making your own, I'd use this program. If I
were going into the karaoke business myself, I'd probably still use this
program,
given the amount of control you have and the ability to play original
sound files. With the gorgeous graphics and well-thought-out interface,
for karaoke, this is probably your best bet.

Editra&mdash;Advanced Text Editor
(<a href="http://editra.org" target="_self">editra.org</a>)</h2></div></div><p>
For those looking for an advanced text editor that runs across the main
three platforms of Linux, Windows and Mac OS, without being too bulky,
this might be for you. According to the Web site: &ldquo;Editra is a general,
extensible, multiplatform text editor with an implementation that focuses
on creating a clean and easy-to-use interface with features that aid in
code development. Currently, it supports syntax highlighting and a variety
of other useful features for more than 60 programming languages.&rdquo;
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10383f4.large.jpg"><img src="10383f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Editra brings a whole bunch of cool and sensible features into one snappy,
multiplatform package.
</p></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Installation</b></span>
</p><p>
I didn't run into any weird dependencies with this one, but it does
require wxPython 2.8.3 or higher (which I already had installed). Although
there are binary packages available only for Windows and Mac OS, there
is a source package for Linux, and compiling Editra is pretty painless.
</p><p>
Head to the Web site, grab the latest tarball, and extract it. Open a
terminal in the folder, and enter the following command either as root
or sudo:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# python setup.py install
</pre>
</p><p>
This built straight off for me, and it probably will give you little hassle,
provided you have wx installed.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Usage</b></span>
</p><p>
Once it had compiled, I entered the command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ editra
</pre>
</p><p>
That worked straightaway, and it even prompted me about an available
update. It didn't work, but that's beside the point! That's some cool
coding for something this early on in the development cycle. If you're
reading along and have made it this far, you obviously don't need
me to tell you how to use a text editor. However, let me draw attention
to the cool features that sets Editra apart from other editors.
</p><p>
First, it's very lightweight and snappy. There's no bulkiness to put you
off, and it probably would run nicely on old systems. Second, opening
up extra files splits each one into tabs, like Opera, Konqueror,
Firefox and so on. Third, it color-codes sections of text, depending
on the language and syntax used. It recognizes a large number of languages
too. I threw the following file types at it, and it knew 
Python, C, Pascal&mdash;heck, it even handled my configuration file for
the X Window System.
</p><p>
It also has the extremely useful ability to open other character
sets that are non-UTF-8, and it even suggests which encoding to choose to
view the text you need (handy when jumping between systems and foreign
countries). What really impressed me was the ability to &ldquo;fold&rdquo;
paragraphs of text. Next to the line numbers (another handy feature),
it groups text into specific bodies that are collapsible and expandable
with that little box with a minus sign in it, which turns into a plus sign when
collapsed. It's very handy for wrapping your head around lots of intricate
code and keeping things organized, with the bonus that it also encourages
clean coding.
</p><p>
Editra has way more features available than what I've mentioned here, so check the
Web site if you want to see the whole list. If you want an advanced text
editor, you could do a lot worse than this. But, if you also want something
that works across all of your systems&mdash;meaning you have to use only one
interface&mdash;this might be the one.

</p><p>
For people who want to enjoy music and videos on the go, media hive
is a free program for playing multimedia from anywhere within your
browser. It works across multiple platforms, has a number of different
interface modes, lets you rate the content of what you play and allows
you to modify your playlist in your browser while it's streaming. It's
also darn pretty to boot.

Although RTS games are generally not my favorite genre,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Widelands</em></span> draws
its inspiration from such venerable classics as the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Settlers</em></span> series and
appears to have some pretty solid gameplay and impressive graphics for
a free game. Hopefully, I can get it compiled and working and bring you
an in-depth review in the future.
