SystemBase's Eddy Series Embedded CPU Modules</h2></div></div><p>
Hot and fresh from SystemBase's ovens are the new Eddy v2.1 Series embedded
CPU modules for high-speed serial communication with real-time Linux.
These small, Linux-ready 32-bit ARM9-based modules support high-speed
RS-232, RS-422 and RS-485 serial interfaces at up to 921.6Kb/s, tolerate
an extended temperature range (from &ndash;40&deg;C to +85&deg;C) and are equipped
with Ethernet and wireless interfaces. SystemBase says that developers
can set up their designs on the Eddy-DK v2.1 hardware development kit
and the software development environment LemonIDE for Lemonix. Lemonix
is an embedded, real-time Linux operating system that has been revised
to support real-time capabilities while retaining the stable traits and
merits of the Linux kernel 2.6.x.

Instantiations' CodePro AnalytiX</h2></div></div><p>
If Java's your gig, take note of the latest v6.0 release of
Instantiations' CodePro AnalytiX, a code-review tool for Eclipse Java.
Instantiations asserts that CodePro AnalytiX's new product features
will &ldquo;help developers decrease potential code security vulnerabilities
early in the software development life cycle, improve Java code quality
and reduce development costs through increased developer
productivity&rdquo;.
Core product features include code audit, metrics, automated unit tests
and team collaboration. New features include 25 new OWASP-based
rules; two new audit-rule categories (Web services and threads and
synchronization), mock objects to simulate the behavior of other
objects safely and JUnit testing support for more Web application frameworks.
JUnit test generation now supports most popular frameworks, including
Spring, Struts and Enterprise Java Beans.

Shai Vaingast's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Beginning Python Visualization</em></span> (Apress)</h2></div></div><p>
Although the title of Shai Vaingast's new book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Beginning Python
Visualization</em></span>
tells you something, the subtitle, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Crafting Visual Transformation
Scripts</em></span>, perhaps tells you even more. Author Vaingast says that we are
&ldquo;visual animals&rdquo; whose brains must sort, organize and transform data
into images &ldquo;before we can see the world in its true
splendor&rdquo;. Part of
Apress' Beginning Series, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Beginning Python
Visualization</em></span> illustrates
how to turn many types of small data sources into useful visual data.
Learning Python is simply an added bonus. Readers will learn to set up
and use an open-source environment as an alternative to Excel for data
visualization. The book is for IT personnel, programmers, engineers,
hobbyists and others who are interested in acquiring and displaying data
from sources such as the Internet, sensors, economic trends, astronomical
sources and more.

Victor Kane's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Leveraging Drupal</em></span> (Wrox)</h2></div></div><p>
Thanks to past efforts of <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> founder Phil Hughes, Drupal holds a special
place in the hearts of our editors. Thus, I will preach the good Drupal
word by informing you of Victor Kane's new book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Leveraging Drupal:
Getting Your Site Done Right</em></span>. Publisher Wrox calls
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Leveraging Drupal</em></span>
&ldquo;much more than a tutorial&rdquo; and a &ldquo;nuts-and-bolts living
mentor and guide&rdquo;
that explains how to do what is really required to build a site that
works. Kane's book covers Drupal topics such as theming, customization
and best practices in Web development while including videos and code
and theme samples at every step. Advanced topics include views, panels
and content creation.

ToutVirtual's VirtualIQ Pro</h2></div></div><p>
The company ToutVirtual bills itself elegantly as an &ldquo;emerging
leader&rdquo; in
virtualization based on its product VirtualIQ Pro. Now in version 3, the
product is &ldquo;a single, platform-agnostic management and automation
console&rdquo;
for virtualization deployment, says the company. VirtualIQ installs on
Linux and Windows and provides features such as server-virtualization
assessment, asset management, performance management, capacity management
and reporting, together in one product. Users can support Xen, Citrix,
Microsoft, Oracle and VMware virtualization platforms from one console.
New features in Version 3 include an updated UI, physical and virtual
asset and inventory discovery, a physical-to-virtual migration
analyzer and virtualization analytics. A free version supporting up
to five CPU sockets or 25 virtual machines is available for download from
ToutVirtual's Web site.

Blancco Kit</h2></div></div><p>
That Linux is the ideal OS for safeguarding data is logical. Meanwhile,
the Blancco Kit from Blancco, Ltd., deploys Linux for exactly the
opposite&mdash;to erase data safely from PCs. The recently upgraded Blancco Kit
is a portable tool for performing data erasure at multiple sites, such
as at dispersed warehouses storing obsolete computers. Blancco claims
that &ldquo;in a single day, just one engineer can erase 160 computers and share
detailed reporting to meet compliance requirements&rdquo;, as well as label
the machines for resale or redeployment. The kit consists of a laptop
PC with the Blancco Management Console and supporting applications,
as well as a manual and label printer. The stylish aluminum case meets
airline regulations as carry-on baggage.

Arkeia Network Backup</h2></div></div><p>
The new version 8.0 of Arkeia Network Backup is a backup and disaster
recovery solution dedicated to supporting virtualized server environments.
Version 8.0 extends Arkeia's deployment support for physical backup
appliances and traditional software to support for virtual backup
appliances, which the firm says is an industry first. The product also
introduces backup and restore of complete virtual machine environments,
permitting both traditional and virtual machine platforms to be protected
with the same consistent process. The Arkeia Virtual Appliance delivers
Arkeia Network Backup as a system image for a VMware virtual machine.
Other features in v8.0 include an improved graphical user interface,
expanded reporting capabilities and integrated help system.

Location Based Technologies' PocketFinder</h2></div></div><p>
From the &ldquo;I wish I had thought of that&rdquo; department comes Location
Based Technologies' PocketFinder, a GPS-based personal locator system.
The combination device and service allows users to check the real-time
location of a PocketFinder device carried by a person, pet or suitcase at
any time via the Internet, telephone or smartphone. The company calls
its product &ldquo;the smallest known single-board GSM/GPS device&rdquo;. Advanced
features include tracking of vehicle speeds and designation of
customizable alert areas, whereby a notification is sent when a device
enters or leaves a specified zone. The PocketFinder is also integrated
into the iPhone and Google Android platforms.
