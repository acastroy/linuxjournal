<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #180, April 2009</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
The <span   class="bold"><b>kernel boot process</b></span> is one of the strangest parts of the whole
operating system. One aspect of it is <span   class="bold"><b>initramfs</b></span>, where the kernel must
first boot up in a RAM-based root filesystem, before it can mount the
disk-based filesystems and transition the kernel to consider those the
root filesystem. initramfs traditionally has not been part of the
official kernel, so each Linux distribution has come to maintain its
own unique implementation. In general, this means the sequence of
events in the boot process of each distribution is different. This can
affect the way hardware is initialized and the state it's in when the
user finally sees a login prompt.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Jeremy Katz</b></span> recently announced <span   class="bold"><b>Dracut</b></span>, a new distribution-independent
implementation of initramfs, inspired by discussions at the most
recent <span   class="bold"><b>Kernel Summit</b></span>. The project's goal is to simplify and
standardize the boot process and move the initramfs implementation
into the official kernel tree. Each Linux distribution then would boot
up identically, but would be able to layer any additional
functionality on top of the main initramfs implementation.
</p><p>
Jeremy's work is based on the <span   class="bold"><b>Red Hat
initramfs</b></span>. <span   class="bold"><b>Hannes Reinecke</b></span> is
working on his own implementation, based on <span   class="bold"><b>OpenSUSE</b></span>. It's likely the
two projects will merge at some point. The
project will need to bear several issues in mind. As <span   class="bold"><b>Neil Horman</b></span> explained, some
systems elect to stay in the RAM-based filesystem for stability
reasons and never transition to a disk-based root filesystem. Any
successful initramfs would have to support that feature, in order to
work with various embedded system projects.
</p><p>
Keeping track of what goes into the kernel is always pretty tough.
Each new version could contain thousands of patches. There are various
ways to track them all, including using <span   class="bold"><b>git</b></span> or one of the git
repository browsers. <span   class="bold"><b>John Hawley</b></span> recently set up a new method at
<a href="http://patchwork.kernel.org" target="_self">patchwork.kernel.org</a>. This page keeps track of all patches sent
to a variety of kernel-related mailing lists, including the main one,
<span   class="bold"><b>linux-kernel</b></span>. It presents the patches in
color and is nicely formatted,
and it lets folks change the status of each patch, so it's clear which
have been accepted.
</p><p>
Although a variety of git documentation exists, some of it is fairly
involved. For folks who'd rather just learn what they need to know,
<span   class="bold"><b>David Howells</b></span> has written &ldquo;The Git
Hater's Guide To The Galaxy&rdquo; and
submitted it for inclusion in the kernel source tree. It's not the
most in-depth git doc out there, but it covers a lot of the stuff
David himself uses it for on a daily basis, and it may be more accessible
than the more detailed docs out there.
</p><p>
One problem with running <span   class="bold"><b>d&aelig;mons</b></span> is that the init process loses track
of the relationship between the d&aelig;mon process and the parent
processes that spawned it. As <span   class="bold"><b>Scott James
Remnant</b></span> has discovered,
there doesn't seem to be any straightforward way in Linux for init to
know by which process a given d&aelig;mon was spawned. That information is
currently lost by the spawning procedure.
</p><p>
Scott has coded up support for some new signals to carry this
information into the kernel. If accepted into the main tree, this code
will allow system logs to track effectively the activities of the
application that spawns any d&aelig;mons, along with the d&aelig;mons it spawns.
Among other things, this will improve debugging efforts for any
applications that spawn d&aelig;mons.
</p><p>
Most modern CPUs have special registers for tracking performance.
Things like <span   class="bold"><b>perfmon</b></span> use these, but
recently <span   class="bold"><b>Thomas Gleixner</b></span> and <span   class="bold"><b>Ingo
Molnar</b></span> took a shot at designing something better. Their initial effort
actually has met with fierce resistance from <span   class="bold"><b>Paul
Mackerras</b></span> and <span   class="bold"><b>David
S. Miller</b></span>, who felt that the approach Thomas and Ingo had taken was
not likely to meet the needs of real systems. The debate does not seem
anywhere near over, and certainly Thomas and Ingo will produce some
code to prove their points. Probably something excellent will come out
of all this, but currently, the two sides have not had much of a
meeting of the minds. Paul has said there's no way to 
track a process effectively without stopping it, and Thomas and Ingo say, yes, it
can be done. Time will tell.

<h2 class="title">EUCALYPTUS: a Tree Growing in the Cloud</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Doc Searls</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #180, April 2009</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
From the Linux (and <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>) perspective, there's an issue with
clouds&mdash;those back-end Web services that compose Utility Computing.
They're proprietary. Amazon owns AWS (Amazon Web Services: S3, EC2 and a
growing number of others). Google, Microsoft and other companies own theirs
as well.
</p><p>
These are open in the sense that most services are substitutable, which
makes them utilities. If you don't like storing your data at Amazon's S3,
you can park it elsewhere. The documents you create and keep at Google Docs
can be put elsewhere as well. Elastic computing is more tricky, but it should
be substitutable as well.
</p><p>
In a way, all these data centers are available to the public as a utility
service. They are an important trend in computing, comprising the growth of
a vast open SLA (service-level agreement) infrastructure for computing
resources spread across the Net. (Nicholas G. Carr wrote about all this in
his book <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Big Switch&mdash;Rewiring the World, from Edison to
Google</em></span>. I
visited the topic in &ldquo;The Bigger Switch&rdquo;, my EOF column in the May 2008
issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>.)
</p><p>
But, why should The Cloud consist only of proprietary back ends? How about
building our own cloud services, our own way?
</p><p>
I was pleased to find an answer from colleagues at UCSB (where I'm a
fellow at the Center for Information Technology &amp; Society), namely Rich
Wolski and his merry band of computer scientists in the Computer Science
Department. There they have created EUCALYPTUS (Elastic Utility Computing
Architecture for Linking Your Programs To Useful Systems). It's what they
call &ldquo;an open-source software infrastructure for implementing
Elastic/Utility/Cloud computing using computing clusters and/or workstation
farms&rdquo;. It is interface-compatible with Amazon's EC2 (the de facto
standard for elastic cloud computing) and designed for modification and
extension as needed for you-name-it client-side interfaces. Most
important for <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> readers, &ldquo;EUCALYPTUS is implemented using
commonly available Linux tools and basic Web service technology making it
easy to install and maintain&rdquo;, they say.
</p><p>
The issue for IT folks is a range of choices that should include DIY as
well as commercial back ends. Rich Wolski puts it this way:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Cloud computing permits &ldquo;self-service&rdquo; IT independently of whether the
provider is an external company or an internal IT organization. Part of
what makes IT onerous these days is that the infrastructure organization
also must be a customer service organization. Cloud computing really
streamlines customer service for IT in the same way that Web-based
e-commerce streamlined customer service for retail. It doesn't eliminate
the need entirely (you still can get someone on the phone even when a
company has an e-commerce site), but it does improve the business efficiency
considerably.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
As I write this, version 1.5 is coming along. (Version 1.0 was released in
June 2008.) And,
there are ambitious plans. For more information, check out

Freescale may be the first semiconductor company to associate itself
aggressively with portable Linux devices. The former Motorola semiconductor
division is sharply targeting the low-priced Linux-based Netbook market,
which is hot in the world market and just starting to get warm in the US.
</p><p>
Early this year, Freescale launched a new processor called the i.MX515
Cortex A8 Netbook Processor. Company literature positions the part for
&ldquo;low-power, gigahertz performance Netbooks at sub-$200 price
points&rdquo;.
According to CNET, Glen Burchers, director of global marketing for
Freescale's consumer products group, says &ldquo;Because the primary function (of
a Netbook) is accessing the Internet, Linux and Firefox are a good
operating system and application for that purpose.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Freescale is developing a reference design with ASUS-subsidiary Pegatron.
It will feature the 1GHz i.MX51 processor, Ubuntu Linux, Adobe's Flash
Player, a new power management chip and the SGTL5000 ultra-low-power audio
codec.
</p><p>
Some data:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
The i.MX515 is a 65nm CPU based on an ARM11 Cortex-A8 blueprint.
</p></li><li><p>
Clocks from 600MHz to 1GHz.
</p></li><li><p>
Includes the SGTL5000 ultra-low-power audio codec.
</p></li><li><p>
OpenVG and OpenGL graphics cores are available.
</p></li><li><p>
Up to eight hours battery life with displays up to 8.9".
</p></li><li><p>
Memory interface supports both DDR2 and mobile DDR1.
</p></li><li><p>
MC13982 power-management integrated circuit, for reduced size and weight
and more battery life.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
The company is working first with Tier 1 OEMs (so watch for ASUS units) and
expects products to start hitting the market in Q2 of this year&mdash;in other words, about
now.

That's what it's called. I found out about it when a pal sent a link under
the subject line &ldquo;Hell hath frozen over.&rdquo; Look up the above on Google and

I was pointed recently to Zappos (<a href="http://www.zappos.com" target="_self">www.zappos.com</a>) as a near-perfect example of a company
that brings the principles of open source to business. Its site is
inventive and fancy (as you'd expect a clothing retailer to be), but not a
triumph of design over utility. What's more, it's fast. I can check Web site
responsiveness with some confidence, because our little apartment near
Boston has 20Mb/s symmetrical service from Verizon FiOS (that's fiber, and
pretty cheap, considering), and the speeds I get at the office I share at
Harvard are more than twice that.
</p><p>
So I decided to see what they were running that site on, by checking with
Netcraft.com's &ldquo;What's that site running?&rdquo; service. The answer was Linux.
Zappos itself is in an Akamai Netblock, and of the 13 other results
(all foo.zappos.com), the results for OS were Linux or
&ldquo;unknown&rdquo;.
</p><p>
Then I decided to look beyond Zappos to other on-line retailers. Here are the
results for the top ten, as listed by InternetRetailer.com, with sales
volume numbers in parentheses. Results for companyname.com are first, and other
results for each company are summarized in text (Netcraft gives results in
lowercase):
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Amazon.com Inc. ($14.8 billion): linux.
</p></li><li><p>
Staples Inc. ($5.6 billion): linux, through akamai.
</p></li><li><p>
Office Depot Inc. ($4.9 billion): the top result is linux for
www.officedepot.com, but officedepot.com (without the dubs) is windows
server 2003. Other foo.officedepot.com sites are a mix of the two and
&ldquo;unknown&rdquo;.
</p></li><li><p>
Dell Inc. ($4.2 billion): f5-big-ip, though l.dell.com (Dell laptops) is
linux and a couple of foo.dell.com sites are &ldquo;unknown&rdquo;.
</p></li><li><p>
HP Home &amp; Home Office Store ($3.4 billion): hp-ux.
</p></li><li><p>
OfficeMax Inc. ($3.2 billion): f5-big-ip, with a mix of solaris, windows
server 2003, linux and &ldquo;unknown&rdquo; among other officemax sites.
</p></li><li><p>
Apple Inc. ($2.7 billion): &ldquo;unknown&rdquo;, but the company uses linux through
akamai for a number of foo.apple.com sites.
</p></li><li><p>
Sears Holding Corp. ($2.6 billion, includes Sears.com and Kmart.com): for
sears.com, linux, plus some &ldquo;unknown&rdquo;, solaris, f5-big-ip and windows
server 2003 for sears.com.mx. For kmart.com, linux (through akamai), plus
linux (with and without akamai) for various foo.sears.com sites.
Kmart.com.au is windows 2000. Most of the rest are linux, plus a couple
&ldquo;unknown&rdquo; and one f5-big-ip.
</p></li><li><p>
CDW Corp. ($2.4 billion): the top result is linux for www.cdw.com (through
akamai). cdw.com (sans dubs) is f5-big-ip. The rest are a mix of linux and
f5-big-ip, with one windows server 2003.
</p></li><li><p>
Newegg: windows server 2003, though linux shows up in five out of the nine
foo.newegg.com results.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
Although that summation is far from a complete picture, or even a completely
accurate one for this Top Ten, it's clear that the picture can't be painted
without linux as the most primary color.

<div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
If computers of the kind I have advocated become the computers of the
future, then computation may someday be organized as a public utility. We
can envisage computing service companies whose subscribers are connected to
them by telephone lines....
</p><p>
The system could develop commercially in fairly interesting ways. Certain
subscribers might offer services to other subscribers. One example is
weather prediction. A weather-predicting company that is a subscriber to
the central computer predicts the weather but keeps the predictions in
its private files. If you subscribe to its service, your programs can gain
access to those files. You may even have weather-predicting programs run
for your benefit to answer your own particular questions....Other
subscribers might furnish economic predictions. The computing utility could
become the basis for a new and important industry.

&mdash;John McCarthy, in 1961
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
At present, a newspaper, magazine or book is a package produced by a large
organization. With the information utility, the physical production and
distribution disappears, allowing a much smaller organization to put out
the same packages of text and pictures. Moreover, the user does not face a
one-shot decision to buy <span   class="emphasis"><em>Time</em></span> or
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Newsweek</em></span>. He will be able to read the
&ldquo;cover&rdquo; or table of contents of each, read such items as strike his
fancy, and the system will bill him for what he reads from each source. In
fact, since the cost of keeping a file of information in the computer and
making it publicly available will be small, even a high school student
could compete with the <span   class="emphasis"><em>New Yorker</em></span> if he could write well enough and if word
of mouth and mention by reviewers brought him to public attention.

Does anyone really think that a company-owned platform is going to win
here, that it won't be swamped by an open federated system of servers that
peer, like e-mail? If so, I'd like to hear why. We went through this
exercise repeatedly in the tech industry; the lesson of history is
clear&mdash;closed systems have their place and time, at the beginning of a new layer,
when users need simplicity over everything else, they serve as training
wheels when everyone is a newbie. Eventually we grow out of the need to
have our hands held and the freedom of open systems becomes attractive, and
we jump.

While Linux-based netbooks have not gained much consumer acceptance in the
US, their success varies greatly by geographical market. In developing
countries, Linux-based Eee PCs have fared better....Even if a majority of
netbooks run Windows, the minority that run Linux are the most successful
non-Windows, non-Macintosh consumer PCs in the industry in terms of
penetration.

We love Web videos. We especially love videos that teach us new
quick-and-easy tricks, so we've been cooking up some more videos over in
the LinuxJournal.com kitchen. We'll have several short video tips per week
in the Tech Tip of the Day section. Visit us often to see some fun tricks to
make your life just a little better. Here's one of my favorites:

<h2 class="title">What They're Using: Philip Jacob</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Doc Searls</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #180, April 2009</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
I first met Phil Jacob on a consulting gig (yes, I got paid, but that was a
long time ago), and quickly discovered that he was one of our most careful
readers. Subsequently, he also became one of our most constructive
critics&mdash;in the best sense of the word.

</p><p>
Phil is a born connoisseur. He applies that nature as founder and CTO of
StyleFeeder (<a href="http://www.stylefeeder.com" target="_self">www.stylefeeder.com</a>), a startup with a
&ldquo;personal shopping engine&rdquo; that combines
machine learning techniques and social data to provide users with a richer
shopping experience. Among the features under StyleFeeder's hood is one
that personalizes search results from a dataset of more than ten million products using
a custom-built recommendation engine. It also has a mature data tier
shared across 100 MySQL databases in order to handle its scalability
requirements. Given that StyleFeeder is only six people, they've done a lot
with a little during the past two years. Phil also is a technology advisor to
PRX, a nonprofit licensing and distribution platform for public radio
content. He's also married to a well-known food blogger, Beatrice Peltre,
who runs La Tartine Gourmande (<a href="http://www.latartinegourmande.com" target="_self">www.latartinegourmande.com</a>), so at least he eats well.
</p><p>
When I asked him to share some of what he's using, he concentrated his
report on a single application&mdash;music:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Without a doubt, the device that attracts the most attention from guests
visiting my house is the Slim Devices Squeezebox sitting in the living
room. They usually don't notice it at first, but there's always that
&ldquo;double-take&rdquo; moment when I change the music using my laptop or my iPod
Touch.

</p><p>
I store my music in the basement on a Dell machine running Ubuntu with a
bunch of FireWire disks attached for media files. This server runs Slim
Devices' GPL-licensed SqueezeCenter software, which is a d&aelig;mon that is
mostly written in Perl, surprisingly enough. I happen to know Perl quite
well as I programmed with it on a full-time basis for many years, so I was
actually quite reluctant to buy this device when I first saw it. What I
desperately wanted to avoid was a situation that required work just to get
my music playing. And imagine a dinner party going silent because of a
segfault in your own code!
</p><p>
I did, however, end up making a few changes to the software, which was only
possible due to the open nature of it (at one point, I had reconfigured it
to use MPlayer internally rather than LAME because MPlayer wasn't as
abusive to the CPU). One thing I really like about it is that I have a
plugin installed that keeps a log of everything that gets played, which
means that I could actually tell you what I was playing at 8:14pm last
Thursday. One of my forthcoming weekend projects is to syndicate this onto
my personal Web site, probably with a programming language that I'm looking
to learn (OCaml is near the top of my list these days).
</p><p>
I access the music on my basement server when I'm at work by port-forwarding
HTTP connections on my router to either Apache or to the SqueezeCenter's
built-in streaming capabilities, depending on what I want to do. My router
runs dd-wrt, a Linux-based firmware that runs on various types of home
routers. It's very stable and provides a bunch of cool features that will
appeal to power users.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Asked for last words on the subject, Phil adds, &ldquo;We run RHEL and CentOS at
StyleFeeder, some on EC2 and some at Contegix in St. Louis. We run behind
Apache and nginx on the Web tier. We own zero servers and run dd-wrt on our
office LAN as well....Typing one-handed with a baby in the
other....&rdquo; Babies
are a new hack for Phil.
