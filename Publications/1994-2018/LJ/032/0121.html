Naba Barkakati</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Publisher:</b></span> IDG Books,
1996</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>ISBN:</b></span> 1-56884-798-X</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Price:</b></span> $49.99 (includes
CD)</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Reviewer:</b></span> David Alan
Black</p><p>&ldquo;Naba Barkakati,&rdquo; says I when I received the review copy of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux SECRETS</em></span>, &ldquo;That's the guy who wrote
<span   class="emphasis"><em>The Microsoft Macro Assembler Bible</em></span>.&rdquo; I'm a
low-level guy from way back, and in my DOS assembler programming
days, Naba's books always stood out for their readability,
seriousness, and thoroughness. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux SECRETS</em></span>
continues this tradition.</p><p>I'd be bluffing to generalize too much about &ldquo;what to look
for in a mass-market Linux book&rdquo;, because this is the first one
I've owned. So I'll be specific. What I looked for in this book,
among other things, was information that can actually be used. In
other words, I kept it close at hand in order to see whether or not
I ever actually referred to it. The answer is that I did&mdash;not every
day, but enough to continue to keep it close.</p><p>I also tested the book's clarity and utility by using its
instructions for a project I'd never done before&mdash;namely, writing a
<b  >man</b> page. The instructions for this neither are,
nor pretend to be, a <b  >groff</b> tutorial; but they
make sense and they work. (You can judge for yourselves&mdash;see
<a href="0121f1.html" target="_self">Figure 1.</a>) It's always been my
impression that Naba has a gift for explaining, and this book
confirms that impression.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux SECRETS</em></span> covers an enormous amount
of material. The table of contents alone is a full twenty pages
long, with chapter titles such as Installing Linux; Secrets of X
under Linux; Secrets of Linux Commands; Scripting with Tcl/Tk;
Running a Business with Linux; Networks; Modems; Printers, and Text
Processing. The book's stated goal is to serve as &ldquo;a practical
guide that not only gets you going with the installation and setup
of Linux, but also shows you how to use Linux for a specific task,
such as an Internet host or a software development
platform.&rdquo;</p><p>The book views different topics at levels of magnification;
it explores some topics in telescope-like detail; for others, it
uses binoculars; and sometimes it looks through those devices from
the other end.</p><p>The topics presented in the most detail include installation
and other setup-related procedures. My experience on both sides of
the virtual help desk suggests that no single written source will
ever get everyone from blissful ignorance to Linux Nirvana with no
problems and no outside help; but anyone who studiously follows
Naba's installation chapter will see that it comes very close.
Along the way there is much supplemental information, such as
remarks on the 16/32-bit OS distinction, sidebars about the BIOS
and DOS, and so forth.</p><p>While we're on the subject of installation: the book and
CD-ROM are Slackware-oriented. If you have reason to care&mdash;for
instance, if you're starting out and have decided in advance to use
a different distribution&mdash;you should be aware that the only
distribution on the CD-ROM is Slackware 3.0, and much of the
treatment of installation, setup, and upgrading assumes a
Slackware-based system. You should also keep in mind that a great
deal of the material in the book is
distribution-independent.</p><p>Also covered in considerable detail is the topic of hardware.
There's actually a chapter called &ldquo;Computers&rdquo;, which forms a
bridge between a general look at hardware architecture and
Linux-specific compatibility concerns. Input devices, CD-ROMs and
sound cards, video hardware, disk drives, printers, and modems all
receive their own chapters. As always, these chapters include
information about how things work generally, as well as detailed
discussion of how they work under Linux.</p><p>Shifting from telescope to binoculars, we find coverage of
the things you can actually <span   class="emphasis"><em>do</em></span> with Linux,
centering around Part IV, &ldquo;Using Linux for Fun and Profit&rdquo;.
Almost half of this chapter is devoted to networking (setting up a
server, running an ISP, and so on); and while the binoculars
perhaps get picked up backwards here and there, overall this
section contributes much&mdash;not only in practical advice, but in
making the point that Linux has real sweep as a platform for many
projects.</p><p>At the sketchier end, the book includes sections on such
topics as vi, shell programming, emacs, Perl, and Tcl/Tk scripting,
as well as a &ldquo;Linux Applications Roundup&rdquo; which introduces
several other editors and applications (gzip, Workbone,
Ghostscript, etc.). Much of this material, of course, is second
nature to many of us, but I have found some of these short sections
very handy for getting an overview of a topic and deciding whether
I want to pursue it. In this respect, the less detailed sections
can be very helpful.</p><p>Overall, the lesson learned from breaking contents down by
level of magnification is that while no one is likely to need or
use everything in the book, many people at varying levels of
expertise with Linux will find a good fit between their needs and
the book's coverage. I'll just add that the author provides
guidance on where to go for further information, both interspersed
throughout the text and listed in a &ldquo;Linux Resources&rdquo; appendix.
(Of the various resource subheadings, &ldquo;Magazine&rdquo; is the only one
that appears in the singular!) Even if some of the pointers to
resources remind us how quickly things change (e.g., the inclusion
of comp.os.linux.help), it helps keep you in touch with the world
of Linux.</p><p>Linux will always be (I hope) too dynamic a thing to be
captured fully on paper. But while we watch it take off, explode,
spread, and do various other non-static things, it's nice to have
written works that are lucid, informative, and in touch with the
spirit of the project.</p></div></div>
