translation of a book originally written in German and published in
early 1994. I was immediately concerned since I have read literal
translations from German to English that were very hard to
understand.</p><p>Fortunately, my fears were unfounded. The translation job is
excellent and the content of the book fulfills expectations based
on the book title.</p><p>If you intend to write kernel code, or a kernel module, or
just want to know how the kernel of a Linux system works, this book
is an excellent source of information. Also, if you want to know
how to build a kernel and understand what you are doing, understand
file systems, networking, or even just how a system boots, this
book will answer your questions.</p><p>As I was reading the book to write this review, I found
myself slowing down to carefully understand all the Linux kernel
structures. The information is there, and by reading the book cover
to cover, you will learn all about the kernel.</p><p>On the other hand, if you just want to know about some
specific feature&mdash;like how timer interrupts work or how to debug a
kernel module&mdash;that information is included as well, and presented
in an easy-to-find, easy-to-understand fashion. But, not too easy.
That is, if you don't know C, you are not going to understand most
of the book. The information presented is at the code level with
snippets of code scattered throughout the book.</p><p>After a brief introduction covering Linux in general and
compiling the kernel, the book covers important data structures,
like the process table, followed by inodes, memory management and
timers. Next, how signals, interrupts, booting, the scheduler and
system calls work are presented. There is even a section on how to
implement a new system call.</p><p>The next five chapters deal with specific pieces of the
system: memory management, inter-process communication, the file
system, device drivers and network implementation. This information
is presented in enough detail to clarify the process and enable the
reader to write compatible code. The chapter on the file system
includes the proc and ext2 file systems.</p><p>The final chapter in the main part of the book is on modules,
describing what modules are and how they are implemented. The text
presents an example module (the PCMCIA card handler), and explains
how to debug modules.</p><p>The book ends with five appendices. The first details the
system calls in much the same way as Section 2 of the man pages,
but the calls are sorted by area (processes, file system, etc.)
rather than alphabetically. It also tells you where the file with
the code to implement the function is located.</p><p>The second appendix discusses what the authors call
&ldquo;kernel-related commands&rdquo;. These include free, ps, rdev, top,
init, shutdown, strace and mount as well as network, serial and
parallel interface configuration.</p><p>The third appendix discusses the proc file system. Many
people don't realize how important the proc file system is. This
short (ten page) chapter explains it and the important information
that can be secured from it.</p><p>The final appendix explains the boot process, including the
MS-DOS boot sector and partition table, and discusses LILO with an
explanation of the LILO startup errors (e.g., when you just get LI
and the system dies).</p><p>The final appendix presents &ldquo;useful kernel functions&rdquo;. This
is an explanation of functions, such as printk(), available to
users writing kernel code.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f07580.0x1fffce8"></a>What's Wrong with the Book?</h2></div></div><p>Very little. I think it does an excellent job of covering the
material. It doesn't attempt to cover subjects outside its primary
focus, and I find that a plus.</p><p>The only shortcoming I see is that it covers version 1.2
kernels, not 2.0. Of course, at this time, it would be very
difficult to have a book that covers 2.0. Addison-Wesley may decide
to update the book before the next printing.</p><p>Bottom line, I highly recommend this book for anyone who is
serious about writing kernel code or who wants to know what is in
the Linux kernel.</p><p>Phil Hughes is the publisher of <i  >Linux Journal</i>.</p></div></div>
