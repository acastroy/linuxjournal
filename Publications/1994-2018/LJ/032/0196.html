    This article introduces a program that produces output in
    text mode, graphics and Java. Besides all that, XTide is
    both useful and fun.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dfa580.0x1ef24a8"></a></h2></div></div><p><a href="0196f1.html" target="_self">XTide</a> is
free software for predicting tides. If you live on the water, then
you're already convinced that it's the coolest program ever
written. But if you're stuck inland, like 99% of the human
population, you may still find it to be an interesting and possibly
educational toy. In fact, I originally wrote it to ease the pain of
long hours in a land-locked, windowless office.
</p><p><a href="0196f2.html" target="_self">XTide</a> can provide tide
predictions in a wide variety of graphic and text formats. It can
also act as an on-screen tide clock, showing the current time and
water level at the location of your choice.</p><p>It was developed entirely under Linux, but all flavors of
Unix are supported. Ports to Macintosh, DOS, MS-Windows and OS/2
also exist, supported by their respective maintainers.</p><p>Since <a href="0196f3.html" target="_self">XTide's</a> release in
Summer 1995, web sites offering tide predictions have appeared
everywhere. It is probably a safe bet that the majority of XTide
users have used it only through a web page. Dean Pentcheff's page
(<a href="http://tbone.biol.sc.edu/tide" target="_self">http://tbone.biol.sc.edu/tide/</a>)
is an example, offering tide predictions for many locations
world-wide. However, if you look around, you will find that many
coastal cities have their own XTide pages offering local tide
information. [One example of this is our own page for Pacific
Beach, Washington at
<a href="http://www.a42.com/grays/PB" target="_self">http://www.a42.com/grays/PB/</a>.  &mdash;Pub]</p><p><a href="0196f4.html" target="_self">XTide</a> is released under the
GNU Public License and comes with no warranty. It is an excellent
tool for visualizing tide predictions, but don't ever depend on it
for navigation or use it where an error could be dangerous. XTide's
predictions are only as good as its database of tide information,
and that was built up almost entirely by scavenging the Net. Always
verify the output against predictions published by NOAA or a
similar agency before taking any risks.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dfa580.0x1ef2920"></a>Installing XTide</h2></div></div><p>The primary site for the XTide source distribution is
<a href="http://universe.digex.net/~dave/files/" target="_self">universe.digex.net/~dave/files/</a>.
Only HTTP access is permitted (no anonymous FTP). However, that web
page contains full instructions for downloading via HTTP and even
provides a program, http_get, to make it easier.</p><p>You will need to get at least two files: an XTide source
distribution and a harmonics file. The harmonics file is the
database of tide information that XTide uses to predict the tides.
The default harmonics file, <span   class="emphasis"><em>harmonics</em></span>,
contains data for many U.S. and British Columbia locations, as well
as a fair number of assorted locations world-wide. There is another
harmonics file, <span   class="emphasis"><em>harmonics.canadian</em></span>, which
contains data for over 1,000 Canadian locations.</p><p>Generally, there will be two source distributions available:
a stable version and a development version. The development version
will have &ldquo;dev&rdquo; in the file name. XTide follows an open
development process, much like the Linux kernel, with every new
feature immediately available to those brave enough to run
it.</p><p>While XTide installation is not fully automatic, there is
nothing especially difficult about it. The following is taken from
the XTide README, simplified by the assumption that we have a
typical Linux system:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Copy the harmonics file to the place that you have
decided to put it (e.g., /etc/harmonics), gunzip it, and chmod
644.</p></li><li><p>Edit the #defines in config.h to specify the
location and name of the harmonics file and the default location
for which to show tides. The location you specify must be in the
harmonics file. NOTE: The environment variables LOCATION and HFILE
override the values specified in config.h, so you might just want
to set these in /etc/profile instead.</p></li><li><p>xmkmf; make depend; make.</p></li><li><p>Copy the xtide executable into
/usr/X11R6/bin.</p></li><li><p>Copy xtide.man to /usr/man/man1/xtide.1 and chmod
644.</p></li><li><p>Copy xtide.xpm into /usr/include/X11/pixmaps (mode
644) and change your window manager config file to use that icon
for windows whose names start with &ldquo;XTide&rdquo;. The syntax to do this
in fvwm (system.fvwmrc) is:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Style "XTide*"     Icon xtide.xpm
</pre></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dfa580.0x1ef3108"></a>Running XTide</h2></div></div><p>XTide is controlled almost entirely by command line switches.
Pull-down menus and other user-interface niceties may be added in
future versions; thus far it's been a challenge just keeping up
with the more urgent feature requests.</p><p>XTide has way too many command line switches. Everyone seems
to want different things from a tide program, and I have attempted
to keep everyone happy. As a result, the default modes are very
simple and boring, and you need to supply the switches to turn on
any fancy features you may want. The XTide README can help with
this; you can also type <b  >xtide -help</b> to get a
listing of the switches.</p><p>The default mode for XTide is tide clock, with no fancy
options enabled. To get it to look like the picture, you need at
least the following switches:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
-now    Show current time in tide clock.
  -hinc Label the tide height tick marks with
        default increment.
  -tinc Label the time tick marks with default
         increment.
  -hairy        "Hairy" tide clock mode,
        showing slice of tide graph.
</pre><p>In order to get a different location and/or the time zone for
that location, you will need these:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
-list   List all supported locations.
  -location     Specify the location for which to predict tides
  -loctz        Use their time zone, not mine.
</pre><p>&lt;f&ldquo;Courier&rdquo;&gt;-location random&lt;f$&gt; will cause XTide
to choose a location at random.</p><p>If you are not interested in keeping a tide clock on your
desktop, the next most interesting mode will probably be
<a href="0196f4.html" target="_self">graph mode</a>. For that, you will
need these switches:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
-graph  Specify graph mode.
-gstart Specify the starting time for graphs and
        listings.
</pre><p>The format for the time stamps given to -gstart is
<span   class="emphasis"><em>YYYY:MM:DD:HH:MM</em></span>. For example, half past
midnight, June 1, 1995, is 1995:06:01:00:30.</p><p>By generating tide graphs for various locations, you will
quickly get a feel for the different kinds of tides different
places have. Many people are surprised to find out that not all
places have two high tides and two low tides each day. Some places,
like Bayou Rigaud, Louisiana, have only one high and one low tide
per day; other places, like Brunswick, Maine, can have four of
each! The latter are known as quarter-diurnal tides; the former
(diurnal tides) are also interesting in that they will sometimes
<span   class="emphasis"><em>flatline</em></span>, showing almost no tidal activity for
24 hours or more.</p><p>XTide supports many other modes, including simple ASCII text
listings of tides, tide calendars, PPM and GIF output, and even
Java-based tide graphs. It also has many options of special
interest to folks on the water, such as to apply offsets for
secondary tide locations, or to find the times at which the water
goes above or below a specific tide level. Most of these options
are explained in greater detail in the XTide README.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dfa580.0x1ef3738"></a>Learning More</h2></div></div><p>An illustrated version of the XTide README can be accessed at
<a href="http://universe.digex.net/~dave/xtide/" target="_self">universe.digex.net/~dave/xtide/</a>.
It contains examples of almost every kind of output that XTide can
generate and includes full instructions and a FAQ.</p><p>You can learn a lot about tides and tide prediction by
reading the National Ocean Service's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Tide and Current
Glossary</em></span>. An old version is preserved at
<a href="http://universe.digex.net/~dave/xtide/tidegloss.html" target="_self">universe.digex.net/~dave/xtide/tidegloss.html</a>
for the purpose of providing definitions for the technical terms
used in the XTide README. The latest version, currently accessible
at
<a href="http://www-ceob.nos.noaa.gov/tidegloss.html" target="_self">www-ceob.nos.noaa.gov/tidegloss.html</a>,
has been separated into many smaller web pages for easier
browsing.</p><p>The canonical reference for tide prediction is the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Manual of Harmonic Analysis and Prediction of
Tides</em></span>, Special Publication No. 98, Revised (1940)
Edition, United States Government Printing Office, 1941. However,
much of the traditional lore on tide prediction is not digestible
unless you like swimming through pages of equations. Probably the
easiest introduction to the subject for programmers is to read the
source for the Java applets provided in the XTide distribution.
These were written to be as small and simple as possible, and you
can easily see where the tides are generated.</p><p>Although tide prediction is almost a definition of the term
<span   class="emphasis"><em>niche market</em></span>, XTide has attracted an amazing
number of users, and I hope that it will continue to serve their
needs for years to come.</p></div></div>
