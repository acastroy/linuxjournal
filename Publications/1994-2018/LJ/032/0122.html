<span   class="bold"><b>Publisher:</b></span> O'Reilly &amp;
Associates and Red Hat Software
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>ISBN:</b></span> 1-56592-212-3</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Price:</b></span> $24.95</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Reviewer:</b></span> Josh Turiel</p><p>When Matt Welsh and Lar Kaufman wrote their excellent
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Running Linux</em></span> last year, one of the things I
noticed about it was that, unlike most Linux books to that date,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Running Linux</em></span> was not really written with any
one distribution's idiosyncrasies in mind. Also, most Linux boxes
typically have a CD-ROM with whatever distribution they favor
(historically the Slackware <span   class="emphasis"><em>du jour</em></span>).</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Running Linux</em></span> had none. With the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Running Linux Companion CD-ROM</em></span>, a separate
100-page volume with a bound-in copy of Red Hat Linux 2.1, O'Reilly
enters the Linux distribution business. Unlike most, Red Hat's Marc
Ewing has written the guide, aided by Donnie Barnes and Erik Troan,
also of Red Hat.</p><p>The included copy of Red Hat Linux 2.1 is precisely the same
as any other version the reader may have encountered&mdash;in fact, as I
am writing this, the current release is 3.03, so this one is even a
little out-of-date. However, the point of the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Running
Linux</em></span> package is not to have a bleeding-edge
distribution for all the hard-core Linux enthusiasts to pound on;
it is to give readers a combination of several assets:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The O'Reilly brand name, a staple to Unix sysadmins
and network pros everywhere</p></li><li><p>A book oriented to the user who wants to become
familiar with Linux</p></li><li><p>A software distribution for those who want to put
theory into practice (backed with the first two assets)</p></li><li><p>The CD-ROMs in the package contain the Red hat 2.1
installation and a Sunsite archive of freely distributable software
(not all in the RPM format)</p></li></ul></div><p>The manual seems to have a definite bent towards the user
with previous network experience&mdash;or possibly those who are already
familiar with the Linux information in the original
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Running Linux</em></span>. It's interesting at times,
since a section like the Xconfigurator description seems to be
written with novice-level users in mind (with instructions
explaining what kind of graphics chip your video card probably has,
among other relatively basic features), while the section
immediately following on Sendmail opens with the following
paragraph:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>A default <span   class="emphasis"><em>sendmail.cf</em></span> file
will be installed in <span   class="emphasis"><em>/etc</em></span>. The default
configuration should work for most SMTP-only sites. It will not
work for UUCP sites; you will need to generate a new
<span   class="emphasis"><em>sendmail.cf</em></span> if you need to use UUCP mail
transfers.</p></blockquote></div><p>My question here is not so much a criticism as a comment. A
trend I have noticed in many Linux books is to present instructions
like these for the more complex software packages. Remember,
O'Reilly's own definitive <span   class="emphasis"><em>Sendmail</em></span> reference
is over 800 pages long, so obviously all the needed information
doesn't fit here. But it would be handy to at least explain some of
the relevant terms with bullet points or something similar. Even
though the ideal use of this set is with the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Running
Linux</em></span> volume, having this information in a slightly less
elliptical form would be helpful in making Linux less threatening
for the first-timer.</p><p>That aside, there is excellent documentation provided on
<span   class="emphasis"><em>glint</em></span>, the Red Hat package manager for X, and
the Red Hat FAQ at the end of the book is very helpful
(particularly the clearly written information on the Trident 9400
series chip-set). One thing that was not completely clear from the
documentation is the support arrangements for the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Companion CD-ROM</em></span>. Although its authorship by
Red Hat may lead you to believe otherwise, support on this product
is not available from Red Hat directly without the purchase of a
support agreement. Support on the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Companion
CD-ROM</em></span> is available on the Internet (through Red Hat's
mailing lists and the comp.os.linux.* hierarchies), and O'Reilly
provides installation support via e-mail.</p><p>O'Reilly &amp; Associates intends to update the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Companion CD-ROM</em></span> on a fairly frequent basis
(every six months or so), in order to stay fairly current with the
state of Linux development. As a first step into the actual
software distribution business, this is a fairly sound strategy.
They've associated themselves with the distribution that is
arguably the most &ldquo;commercial-ready&rdquo;, provided very solid
reference material, and split the product into both a book (with
relatively infrequent updates) and a CD product that can be updated
more often. Combined with the new attention to Linux appearing in
O'Reilly's newest editions of their indispensable Unix guides, the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Running Linux Companion CD-ROM</em></span> is a product
that can only help in the ongoing penetration of the market by
Linux.</p></div></div>
