Would a new BIOS solve the problem?  &mdash;Scott Sharpe
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21d1580.0x22ca948"></a>Getting off On-Track</h2></div></div><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Your problem in this case is the On-Track software
and DOS itself. DOS suffers from a lack of foresight. Any disk is
made up of a combination of cylinders, heads and sectors per track.
For an operating system to be able to operate a drive, it must know
these values, called the &ldquo;geometry&rdquo; of the drive.DOS was
originally written quite some time ago. The function that it uses
to determine the disk geometry returns the number of cylinders in a
value 10 bits wide. As anybody up to speed with their binary knows,
this allows a value from 0-1023.As drives have grown, these values
have also risen. Modern hard drives, those that are generally above
500MB in size, have more than 1024 cylinders, causing problems with
DOS.There are two solutions. One is compatible with Linux, and the
other is not. The most common today is to use Logical Block
Addressing (LBA). This is typically provided by the computer's BIOS
as a feature to handle larger drives. What it does is double the
number of heads and halve the number of cylinders &ldquo;logically&rdquo; so
that DOS can operate on a drive physically outside its capability.
The BIOS handles the translation on the fly, and DOS is none the
wiser.Linux will operate quite well with this scheme. It simply
does not use that function, and instead determines the geometry
itself. However, this is not compatible with the other method, that
of using disk management software to handle the problem.Disk
management software works in much the same way that the LBA mode
does, but it relies on a piece of software loaded in memory when
the computer boots. Since Linux (or any other operating system
besides DOS) will not load this driver, it cannot read a disk
controlled by the manager software.Your best solution is to replace
your BIOS, or buy a new motherboard with a newer BIOS. Either
solution is probably just as good. Since a BIOS upgrade is a rare
event, companies typically charge high prices for them. You may be
able to find a 486/80 or something even faster for approximately
the same amount of money it would cost you to upgrade your
BIOS.  &mdash;Chad Robinson, BRT Technical Services
