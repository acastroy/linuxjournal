    Expect scripts to help you support multiple versions of the
    kernel across different platforms.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2564580.0x265c2f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>I work in the Atlas experiment at CERN.
Many of the groups in Atlas are beginning to turn to Linux as the
operating system for the next generation of particle-physics
experiments. Among the teams working on the data-acquisition, there
is often a need for specific versions of the Linux kernel.
Typically, the teams are using special PC cards, such as ATM cards,
where the drivers may not yet be available for all kernel versions,
or for which patches must first be applied to the kernel. Both SMP
and uniprocessor machines are used, and team members want the same
kernel with the same patches for both flavors. They also wish to
share software and meaningfully compare results.
</p><p>This article describes how my team supports this need. I will
assume you are familiar with the basic process of configuring and
compiling a kernel.</p><p>We needed an environment in which a range of kernels could be
configured, built, packaged for distribution and later installed in
a coherent and consistent manner. The result is our &ldquo;kernel
repository&rdquo;, containing tar files of the source code for several
kernel versions with different patches applied, tar files of the
compiled kernels, and a set of scripts used to compile and install
the kernels. We wanted to ensure that the configure and build steps
were fully recorded and any kernel configuration could be
reproduced at a later date, even if the details of the build
environment had changed. Also, we wanted to keep up with newer
kernel versions (at the time, 2.2.0 was about to be released), so
we tried to make it easy to add new versions as they came out. We
also wanted the distributions to be easy to install, so that people
could use them without knowing the details.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2564580.0x265c4a8"></a>Availability</h2></div></div><p>Our kernel repository and all its associated tools are
accessible on the WWW at
<a href="http://www.cern.ch/Atlas/project/kernels/www/kernels.html" target="_self">www.cern.ch/Atlas/project/kernels/www/kernels.html</a>.
The kernels are available as separate distributions of precompiled
binaries and source code. A technical note is included, which goes
into greater detail on some points and helped form the basis of
this article.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2564580.0x265c608"></a>Preparing the Source Distributions</h2></div></div><p>The original kernel sources were downloaded from the Web.
Each kernel unpacks into a single subdirectory&mdash;/linux. Since users
may want several kernel source trees available at the same time, we
rename this directory to
/linux-<span   class="emphasis"><em>kernel_version_number.orig</em></span> and repack
the tree using <span   class="bold"><b>tar</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>bzip2</b></span>. To give a clear example, if
I had downloaded the tar file for version 2.2.0 of the kernel, I
would repack it with these commands:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cat linux-2.2.0.tar.bz2 | bzip2 -d | tar xf -
mv linux linux-2.2.0.orig
tar cf - linux-2.2.0.orig | bzip2 &gt;linux-2.2.0.orig.tar.bz2
</pre><p>The kernel repository includes scripts which will fetch and
repack kernels for you.
</p><p>Whenever any patches were applied, the corresponding source
tree was renamed to reflect the patch and sometimes the version of
the patch. For example, 2.0.36 with the &ldquo;bigphysarea&rdquo; patch is
packed as linux-2.0.36.bphys.tar.bz2.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2564580.0x265c920"></a>Configuring the Kernels</h2></div></div><p>To configure the kernels, I wrote an Expect script called
KernelConfig.exp. Expect is a tool for automating interactive
processes (see &ldquo;Automating Tasks with Expect&rdquo; by Vinnie Saladino,
<i  >Linux Journal</i>, October 1998), and it is
ideally suited to this task. KernelConfig.exp runs
<b  >make&nbsp;config</b> at the top of the kernel source
tree and answers the questions for you. The beauty of controlling
the configuration by an Expect script is that it is insensitive to
the kernel version used with it. This script should be able to
configure any Linux kernel version. I have run it on all stable
kernels from 2.0.33 to 2.2.7 and on a number of the 2.1-series
kernels. While it may not give an optimal configuration for any
kernel (whatever that might mean), it does provide consistent and
reproducible configurations.</p><p>Some configuration options are hardwired in the script, such
as:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Support for EXT2 and Minix file systems for
compatibility with the majority of the available rescue
disks.</p></li><li><p>Support for RAM disk and initial RAM disks. This is
essential because the kernel uses modules for most of its
functionality and needs the initial RAM disk support to boot on the
widest possible range of hardware.</p></li><li><p>Compile the kernel for a Pentium-class
processor&mdash;we have no 386 or 486 machines.</p></li><li><p>Support for NFS and for root-on-NFS. Eventually,
booting over the network might be useful, in which case this option
is mandatory.</p></li><li><p>Enable the &ldquo;experimental code&rdquo; option. This might
seem dangerous, but it is needed to include the ATM code.</p></li><li><p>Module-versioning is disabled. While this means one
less safety net for the user, it does make life easier if we have
to move modules around.</p></li><li><p>Support for all classes of network cards, SCSI
cards, sound cards and other classes of hardware is enabled. The
individual card support is compiled as modules.</p></li></ul></div><p>Some hardware support is plainly excluded, even though it is
available as modules, because at least one of the kernels in the
range we are using does not compile. Such problems are normally
caught and fixed rapidly, but if the software is not important to
us, I leave it disabled for consistency. This happens for a few
sound cards, the infrared devices (broken in 2.2.6) and at least
one ATM card we don't use. This list may grow as more kernels are
produced, so you should look at the configuration log or the script
to see what it does. For all other options, the script will select
to compile the code as a module if possible; otherwise, it will use
the default offered by the configuration. The output of the
configuration is stored in the KernelConfig.log file in the current
directory. If this file already exists, the output will be appended
to it, not written over existing information.
</p><p>Two words of caution are necessary. The script reacts to the
defaults and will therefore react differently if the default
changes. For some code, the default changes over time. Something
available only as built into or excluded from the kernel in the
2.0.<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> series might be available as a module in
the 2.2.<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> series. In this case, it will be
built in or excluded from the 2.0.<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> series,
according to the default, but will certainly be built as a module
for the 2.2.x series. If you need that feature at boot time, be
warned.</p><p>Secondly, the defaults are taken from the .config file if it
exists, or from the file arch/i386/defconfig if the sources have
never been configured. If you configure the kernel by hand and set
some options before running KernelConfig.exp, it will accept those
settings as default. For truly consistent results, run
<b  >make mrproper</b> before running
KernelConfig.exp.</p><p>SMP support is tricky. In the 2.0.<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span>
series, SMP support had to be enabled by editing the Makefile or by
building the kernel with the command <b  >make SMP=1
bzImage</b> or a similar one. In the
2.2.<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> series, SMP support is a
configuration-time option, and the Makefile no longer needs to be
changed. KernelConfig.exp enables or disables SMP support,
depending on the value of a user-defined environment variable
<b  >SMP_SUPPORT</b>. If this variable is not defined or
is empty, the script will not enable SMP support. If it is
non-empty, the script will enable SMP support in the
2.2.<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> series.</p><p>This is not enough for the 2.0.<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> series,
where the value of the make-macro <b  >SMP</b> must be
true when the kernel is compiled, not when it is configured. I get
around this by defining <b  >SMP_SUPPORT</b> to have the
value <b  >SMP=1</b>. I can then run KernelConfig to
configure the kernel, and <b  >make $SMP_SUPPORT
bzImage</b> afterwards. For the 2.0.<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span>
series kernels, the <span   class="emphasis"><em>value</em></span> of
<b  >SMP_SUPPORT</b> ensures that the kernel is built
with SMP enabled at compilation time. For the
2.2.<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> series, the very fact that the variable
is defined causes KernelConfig.exp to enable SMP support at
configuration time. This gives a consistent approach to SMP for
both the 2.0.<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> and 2.2.<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span>
series kernels.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2564580.0x265d8f0"></a>Building the Kernels</h2></div></div><p>I use a Bash script called KernelBuild.sh to compile the
kernels and produce the binary distributions. It takes one
argument, the name of a kernel source file (without the
&ldquo;.tar.bz2&rdquo; extension&mdash;e.g., <b  >./KernelBuild.sh
linux-2.0.36.bphys</b>). It starts by defining a few
environment variables:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><b  >MY_WORK</b> is my working directory.
Here, the kernel sources will be unpacked and the distributions
will be built. KernelBuild.sh expects to find all the scripts and
tools it needs in the directory $MY_WORK/bin. It will also ensure
the correct subdirectory structure exists for building the
distributions. The built kernels are installed here, not under the
root directory, and the distribution tar file is created at this
level. Users can unpack it in the true root directory of their
client machines.</p></li></ul></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><b  >MY_SRC</b> is the directory
containing the prepared kernel sources. I set this as a separate
variable to allow customisation of the compilation scripts in
another working directory, without having to copy the sources with
them. For example, separate teams who wish to build their own
versions of the kernels could set <b  >MY_SRC</b> to the
source directory in a common repository and use the sources
directly from that location.</p></li></ul></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><b  >MY_ROOT</b> is the root directory
from which the link is set to the source code of the kernel being
compiled. In other words, KernelBuild.sh sets a soft link from
$MY_ROOT/linux to point to $MY_WORK/linux-2.0.36.bphys&mdash;or
whichever version it is compiling. In a normal Linux environment,
<b  >MY_ROOT</b> would be /usr/src, and the link would be
set from /usr/src/linux to the actual source tree. By allowing it
to be another directory, it is possible to compile the kernel as a
normal user in another directory instead of working as root. You
set the link /usr/src/linux to point to $MY_ROOT/linux once, as
root. Then you can change the link $MY_ROOT/linux, as the user who
compiles the kernels, as often as you wish.</p></li></ul></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><b  >KERNEL_VERSION</b> is simply the
input argument.</p></li></ul></div><p>The <b  >MY_*</b> environment variables may be
defined externally if you wish, and will not be overridden by the
script. <b  >KERNEL_VERSION</b> will always be set from
the input argument.
</p><p>KernelBuild.sh does not actually do the work of compiling the
kernels. For this, it uses two other scripts, Meanwhile.pl and
KernelBuild.cmds. Meanwhile.pl is a Perl script which will execute
a Bash script in the background, log all the output and send an
e-mail message when it is done.</p><p>The real workhorse is KernelBuild.cmds, which can be executed
as a stand-alone script, although normally you would use
KernelBuild.sh. It unpacks the source code tree, uses
KernelConfig.exp to configure it, compiles the uniprocessor version
of the kernel, packs it into a binary distribution file, packs the
header files into a header-file-distribution, then repeats the
process for the SMP version.</p><p>KernelConfig.exp determines how a kernel is to be configured,
but KernelBuild.cmds determines how it is to be built and
installed. The boundaries between the two are a bit blurred because
of the way in which SMP support has changed from the
2.0.<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> series to the 2.2.<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span>
series, as mentioned earlier. If you wish to customise the build,
it is these two scripts that you will want to change.</p><p>KernelBuild.cmds makes use of the fact that anything stored
in a file called .name at the top level of the kernel source will
be incorporated into the kernel name and can be retrieved later
using the commands <b  >uname&nbsp;-v</b> or <b  >cat
/proc/version</b>. I use this to record the kernel version
string, including the distinction between uniprocessor and SMP
versions. For the 2.2.<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> series, the Makefile
includes this distinction, but for the 2.0.<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span>
series it does not. KernelBuild.cmds uses a bit of
<span   class="bold"><b>sed</b></span>, smoke and mirrors to smooth
out the differences.</p><p>Finally, the binary and header file distributions are stored
in the /dist directory, packed using tar, and compressed with
bzip2. The binary distribution contains the kernel image, the
System.map and all modules. It also contains a copy of
KernelConfig.exp, so in the likely event that this script is
updated, you will still have access to the exact version used to
compile any particular distribution of the kernel. For the same
reason, the log file of the configuration is also packed in the
distribution. When the distribution is installed, these will find
their way into the directory
/log/<span   class="emphasis"><em>kernel-version</em></span>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2564580.0x2a56850"></a>Installing the Kernel Binary and Header File
Distributions</h2></div></div><p>The kernels can be installed using the InstallKernel.pl
script. InstallKernel.pl takes the full name of the kernel
distribution file as input, with the &ldquo;.tar.bz2&rdquo; extensions.
First, it checks that the distribution will not overwrite any
existing file&mdash;if so, it aborts execution unless you specifically
tell it to go ahead. It installs the kernel and its modules, and
adds an entry to /etc/lilo.conf for this kernel. It is quite
careful about how it does this. It creates a backup copy of
/etc/lilo.conf, then scans it line by line until it finds a
<b  >root=</b> entry. It uses this to set the root for
the new kernel. If it finds a later <b  >root=</b> entry
that specifies a different root partition, it will warn you, but
will continue, using the first one it found. It will not add an
entry if it finds an existing entry for this kernel image. The last
thing it does is show you the differences between the saved
lilo.conf and the one it has just created. InstallKernel.pl will
not run LILO for you&mdash;you must do that yourself.</p><p>Another script, InstallHeaders.pl, will take care of
installing the header files for you. The headers are installed as
subdirectories of /usr/src/linux-headers. If you set the link
/usr/src/linux to point to one of these installed sets of header
files, you can compile your driver or program for a version of the
kernel different from the one you are actually running. I make use
of this to compile the ARLA AFS clone for all the kernels I
support, without rebooting my machine.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2564580.0x2a56a60"></a>Post-Installation Steps</h2></div></div><p>Whichever distribution of Linux you are using, you will
probably have to modify the way it decides which set of kernel
modules to use. The details vary from distribution to distribution,
so it is not possible to describe all the necessary changes
here.</p><p>Since these kernels rely heavily on the use of modules, you
may also need to create an initial RAM disk for your specific
machine. This is certainly true if you have a SCSI-based system.
See the man page for the <b  >mkinitrd</b> command for
details.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2564580.0x2a56c18"></a>Cloning the Kernel Repository</h2></div></div><p>In order to clone the repository to build your own kernels,
copy the contents of the /bin and /source directories, and modify
them as you wish. KernelBuild.sh will need modifying in order to
set the <b  >MY_*</b> variables correctly.
KernelConfig.exp may also need modifying to enable or disable any
specific options&mdash;this may not be a trivial task. KernelBuild.cmds
will need to be modified if you wish to actually change the way the
kernels are built. The other scripts should never need to be
altered.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2564580.0x2a56d78"></a>Summary</h2></div></div><p>At present, about 30 kernel source distributions are included
in the repository, representing kernels from 2.0.34 to 2.0.36 and
2.2.0 to 2.2.7 with various patches. As the person who manages the
machines running these different kernels, I find that this
standardization has simplified my tasks considerably.</p></div></div>
