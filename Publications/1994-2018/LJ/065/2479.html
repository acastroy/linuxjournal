    This article is about filtering, a very powerful facility
    available to every Linux user, but one which migrants from
    other operating systems may find new and unusual.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1072580.0x116a450"></a></h2></div></div><p>At its most basic level, a filter is a
program that accepts input, transforms it and outputs the
transformed data. The idea of the filter is closely associated with
several ideas that are part of the UNIX operating system: standard
input and output, input/output redirection and pipes.
</p><p>Standard input and output refer to default locations from
which a program will take input and to which it will write output.
The standard input (STDIN) for a program running interactively at
the command line is the keyboard; the standard output (STDOUT) is
the terminal screen.</p><p>With input/output redirection, a program can take input or
send output using a location other than standard input or output&mdash;a
file, for example. Redirection of STDIN is accomplished using the
&lt; symbol, redirection of STDOUT by &gt;. For example,</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ls &gt; list
</pre><p>redirects the output of the
<span   class="bold"><b>ls</b></span> command, which would normally
go to the screen, into a file called
<span   class="bold"><b>list</b></span>. Similarly,
<pre     class="programlisting">
cat &lt; list
</pre>


redirects the input for <span   class="bold"><b>cat</b></span>, which
in the absence of a file name would be expected from the keyboard,
to come from the file <span   class="bold"><b>list</b></span>--so we
output the contents of that file to the screen.
</p><p>Pipes are a means of connecting programs together through I/O
redirection. The symbol for pipe is |. For example,</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ls | less
</pre><p>is a common way of comfortably viewing the output from a
directory listing where there are more files than will fit on the
screen.
</p><p>Simple programs provided as standard with your Linux system
can be enhanced by using them as filters for other similar
programs. I'll also show how simple programs of your own can be
built to meet custom filtering needs.</p><p>One program I don't look at in this article is Perl. Perl is
a programming language in its own right, and filters are
language-independent.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1072580.0x116aa28"></a>grep</h2></div></div><p>The program <span   class="bold"><b>grep</b></span>, &ldquo;Get
Regular Expression and Print&rdquo;, is a good place to begin. (See
&ldquo;Take Command: grep&rdquo; by Jan Rooijackers, March 1999.) The
principle of grep is quite simple: search the input for a pattern,
then output the pattern. For example,</p><pre     class="programlisting">
grep 'Linus Torvalds' *
</pre><p>searches all files in the current directory for Linus' name.
</p><p>Various command-line switches may be used to modify grep's
behaviour. For example, if we aren't sure about case, we can
write</p><pre     class="programlisting">
grep -y 'linus torvalds' *
</pre><p>The <b  >-y</b> switch tells grep to match without
considering case. If you use any upper-case letters in the pattern,
however, they will still match only upper-case. (This is broken in
GNU grep, which simply ignores case when given the
<b  >-y</b> switch&mdash;that's what the <b  >-i</b>
switch does).
</p><p>With just this bit of information about grep, it is easy to
construct a practical application. For example, you could store
name and address details in a file to create a searchable address
book.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1072580.0x116aea0"></a>Extended Grep</h2></div></div><p>Sometimes, basic grep won't do. For instance, suppose we want
to find all occurrences of a text string which could possibly be a
reference to Linus. Clearly, searching for <b  >'Linus
Torvalds'</b> is not enough&mdash;that won't find just Linus or
Torvalds. We need some way of saying, &ldquo;This or this or this&rdquo;.
Here is where <span   class="bold"><b>egrep</b></span> (extended
grep) comes in. This handy program modifies standard grep to
provide just such a conditional syntax by using the | character to
denote &ldquo;or&rdquo;.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
egrep 'Linus Torvalds|L\. Torvalds|Mr\. Torvalds' *
</pre><p>will now find most ways of naming the inventor of Linux. Note
the backslash to &ldquo;escape&rdquo; the period. Since it is a special
character in regular expressions, we must tell egrep not to
interpret it as a &ldquo;magic&rdquo; character.
</p><p><a href="2479s1.html" target="_self">A Note on Regular
Expressions</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1072580.0x116b1b8"></a>tr</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>tr</b></span> is perhaps the epitome of
filters. (See &ldquo;Take Command: A Little Devil Called tr&rdquo; by Hans de
Vreught, September, 1998.) Short for translate, tr basically does
what its full name suggests: it changes a given character or set of
characters to another character or set of characters. This is done
by mapping input characters to output characters. An example will
make this clear:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
tr A-Z a-z
</pre><p>changes upper-case letters to lower-case. A-Z is shorthand
for &ldquo;all the letters from A to Z&rdquo;.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1072580.0x116b3c8"></a>sort</h2></div></div><p>Sorting is a very basic computer operation. It is commonly
used on text, to get lists in alphabetical order or to sort a
numbered list. Linux has a powerful filter for sorting called,
logically enough, <span   class="bold"><b>sort</b></span>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1072580.0x116b528"></a>head and tail</h2></div></div><p>These two very simple filters have a surprising variety of
uses. As their names suggest, <span   class="bold"><b>head</b></span>
shows the head of a file, while
<span   class="bold"><b>tail</b></span> shows the end. By default,
both show the first or last ten lines respectively, and tail in
particular has a number of other useful options. (See the man
pages.)</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1072580.0x116b6e0"></a>Programmable Filters</h2></div></div><p>Sometimes we need to do something a bit more complex than the
relatively simple command lines of the above examples. For this, we
need something I'll call a &ldquo;programmable filter&rdquo;, that is, a
filter with a scripting language that allows us to specify complex
operations.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1072580.0x116b7e8"></a>sed</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>sed</b></span>, the stream editor, is a
filter typically used to operate on lines of text as an alternative
to using an interactive editor. (See &ldquo;Take Command: Good Ol' sed&rdquo;
by Hans de Vreught, April 1999.) There are times when firing up vi
or Emacs and making the change, whether manually or using vi/ex
commands, is not appropriate. For example, what if you have to make
the same changes to fifty files? What if you need to change a
string, but are not sure exactly in which files it occurs?</p><p>As is common in the UNIX world, where tools are often
duplicated in different ways, sed can do most things grep does.
Here is a simple grep in sed:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
sed -n '/Linus Torvalds/p' <span   class="emphasis"><em>filename</em></span>
</pre><p>All this does is read standard input and print only those
lines containing the string &ldquo;Linus Torvalds&rdquo;.
</p><p>The default with sed is to pass standard input to standard
output unchanged. To make it do anything useful, you must give it
instructions. In our first example, we searched for the string by
enclosing it in forward slashes (//) and told sed to print any line
with that string in it with the <b  >p</b> option. The
<b  >-n</b> option ensured that no other lines would be
printed. Remember, the default behaviour is to print
everything.</p><p>If this were all sed could do, we would be better off
sticking with grep. However, sed's forte is as a stream editor,
changing text files according to the rules you supply. Let's take a
simple example.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
sed 's/Torvuls/Torvalds/g' <span   class="emphasis"><em>filename</em></span>
</pre><p>This uses the sed &ldquo;substitute&rdquo; (<b  >s</b>
option) and applies it globally (<b  >g</b> option). It
looks for every occurrence of &ldquo;Torvuls&rdquo; and changes it to
&ldquo;Torvalds&rdquo;. Without the <b  >g</b> command at the end,
it would change only the first occurrence of &ldquo;Torvuls&rdquo; on each
line.
<pre     class="programlisting">
sed '/^From /,/^$/d' <span   class="emphasis"><em>filename</em></span>
</pre>


This searches the standard input for the word &ldquo;From&rdquo; at the
beginning of a line, followed by a space, and deletes all the lines
from the line containing that pattern up to and including the first
blank line, which is represented by <b  >^$</b>, i.e., a
beginning of line (^) followed immediately by an end of line ($).
In plain English, it strips out the header from a Usenet posting
you have saved in a file.
</p><p>Double-spacing a text file takes just one command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
sed G <span   class="emphasis"><em>filename</em></span> &gt; <span   class="emphasis"><em>file.doublespaced</em></span>
</pre><p>According to our manual page, all this does is &ldquo;append the
contents of the hold space to the current text buffer&rdquo;. That is,
for each line, we output the contents of a buffer sed uses to store
text. Since we haven't put anything in there, it is empty. However,
in sed, appending this buffer adds a new line, regardless of
whether there is anything in the buffer. So, the effect is to add
an extra new line to each line, thus double-spacing the output.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1072580.0x1564328"></a>AWK</h2></div></div><p>Another very useful filter is the AWK programming language.
(See &ldquo;The AWK Tools&rdquo; by Lou Iacona, May 1999.) Despite the weird
name, it is an everyday tool.</p><p>To start with, let's look again at yet another way to do a
grep: 'grep'. Fast</p><pre     class="programlisting">
awk '/Linus Torvalds/'
</pre><p>Like grep and sed, AWK can search for text patterns. As with
sed, each pattern can be associated with an action. If no action is
supplied as in the above example, the default is to print each line
where the pattern is matched. Alternatively, if no pattern is
supplied, then the default action is to apply the action to every
line. An AWK script for centering lines in a file is shown in
Listing 1.
</p><p><a href="2479l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1.</a></p><p>AWK's strength is in its ability to treat data as tabular,
that is, arranged in rows and columns. Each input line is
automatically split into fields. The default field separator is
&ldquo;white space&rdquo;, i.e., blanks and tabs, but can be changed to any
character you want. Many UNIX utilities produce this sort of
tabular output. In our next section, we'll see how this tabular
format can be sent as input to AWK using a shell construction we
haven't seen yet.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1072580.0x1564640"></a>Pipes: When One Filter Isn't Enough</h2></div></div><p>The basic principle of the pipe (|) is that it allows us to
connect the standard output of one program with the standard input
of another. (See &ldquo;Introduction to Named Pipes&rdquo; by Andy Vaught,
September 1997.) A moment's thought should make the usefulness of
this when combined with filters quite obvious. We can build complex
instructions 'programs', on the command line or in a shell script,
simply by stringing filters together.</p><p>The filter <span   class="bold"><b>wc</b></span> (word count)
puts its output in four columns by default. Instead of specifying
the <b  >-c</b> switch to count only characters, give
this command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
wc lj.filters | awk ' { print $3 } '
</pre><p>This takes the output of wc:
<pre     class="programlisting">
258    1558    8921 lj.filters
</pre>


and filters it to print only the third column, the character count,
to the screen:
<pre     class="programlisting">
8921
</pre>


If you want to print the whole input line, use
<b  >$0</b> instead of <b  >$3</b>.
</p><p>Another handy filtering pipe is one that does a simple
filtering of <b  >ls -a</b> output in order to see only
the hidden files:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ls -a| grep ^[.].*
</pre><p>Of course, pipes greatly increase the power of programmable
filters such as sed and awk.
</p><p>Data stored in simple ASCII tables can be manipulated by AWK.
As a simple example, consider the weights and measures converter
shown in Listing 2. We have a simple text file of
conversions:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
From    To      Rate---     ---     ----
kg      lb      2.20
lb      kg      0.4536
st      lb      14
lb      st      0.07
kg      st      0.15
st      kg      6.35
in      cm      2.54
cm      in      0.394
</pre><p>To execute the script, give the command:
<pre     class="programlisting">
weightconv 100 kg lb
</pre>


The result returned is:
<pre     class="programlisting">
220
</pre>


<a href="2479l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2.</a>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1072580.0x1564dd0"></a>Power Filters</h2></div></div><p>The classic example of &ldquo;filtered pipelines&rdquo; is from the
book <span   class="emphasis"><em>The UNIX Programming Environment</em></span>:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cat $* |tr -sc A-Za-z '\012' |
sort |
uniq -c |
sort -n |
tail
</pre><p>First, we concatenate all the input into one file using
<span   class="bold"><b>cat</b></span>. Next, we put each word on a
separate line using <span   class="bold"><b>tr</b></span>: the
<b  >-s</b> squeezes, the <b  >-c</b> means to
use the complement of the pattern given, i.e., anything that's not
A-Za-z. Together, they strip out all characters that don't make up
words and replace them with a new line; this has the effect of
putting each word on a separate line. Then we feed the output of tr
into <span   class="bold"><b>uniq</b></span>, which strips out
duplicates and, with the <b  >-c</b> argument, prints a
count of the number of times a duplicate word has been found. We
then sort numerically (<b  >-n</b>), which gives us a
list of words ordered by frequency. Finally, we print only the last
ten lines of the output. We now have a simple word frequency
counter. For any text input, it will output a list of the ten most
frequently used words.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1072580.0x1565248"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>The combination of filters and pipes is very powerful,
because it allows you to break down tasks and then pick the best
tool for each task. Many jobs that would otherwise have to be
handled in a programming language can be done under Linux by
stringing together a few simple filters on the command line. Even
when a programming language must be used for a particularly
complicated filter, you still save a lot of development effort by
doing as much as possible using existing tools.</p><p>I hope this article has given you some idea of this power.
Working with your Linux box should be both easier and more
productive using filters and pipes.</p><p>All listings referred to in this article are available by
