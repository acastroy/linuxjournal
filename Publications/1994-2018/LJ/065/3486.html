first of what will undoubtedly be many books on this subject, and
it will be a tough act to follow. This book is targeted for those
just beginning windows programming in Perl/Tk on both UNIX and
Windows platforms, although veteran programmers will find a wealth
of detailed information in it as well.
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Learning Perl/Tk</em></span> is well-written and
thoroughly researched. It begins with a brief history of the Perl
and Tk languages. It tells exactly where to download the Perl/Tk
module, how to unpack and install it, and how to test your
installation to see if you are ready to write Perl/Tk
programs.</p><p>Next is a general discourse on window geometry, and the
concepts of the widget and the event loop. These are details the
windows programmer must deal with that do not apply to the
traditional Perl programmer. Ms. Walsh does a fine job of
explaining these concepts in terms anyone can understand.</p><p>The majority of the book is devoted to a detailed description
of the most commonly used window widgets: the button, check box,
radio button, label, entry, scrollbar, list box, text box, canvas,
scale, menu, frame and composite widgets such as the dialog box.
Virtually every aspect pertaining to these widgets is covered in
the minutest detail: color, placement, size, border size, style and
functionality. Other widgets are available in Perl/Tk, but these
are the most common ones, and in order not to get too far out in
left field, the book limits its focus to these.</p><p>The author's code examples are written in an elegant,
concise, easy-to-follow style. For example, the following code
creates five text entry widgets, each in a different relief style,
with the style's name displayed in the respective boxes:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
foreach (qw/flat groove raised ridge sunken/) {
$e = $mw-&gt;Entry(-relief=&gt; $_)-&gt;pack(-expand=&gt; 1);
$e-&gt;insert('end', $_);
      }
</pre><p>This example appears on page 112 of the book. Throughout, the
author demonstrates an enviable command of the Perl language,
particularly the object-oriented features.
</p><p>The book does a great job of bringing the first-time Perl/Tk
user up to speed. By the end of the second chapter, the reader will
have at least five fully-functional windows programs up and
running. And for the veteran programmer, the book goes into a level
of detail about the various window widgets which should meet the
most demanding needs.</p><p>There is something of a void of information for the
intermediate-level programmer. For example, there is no discussion
of how to create a text-entry widget, get some user input from the
widget, and use Perl to do something useful with the input. The
Perl/Tk module does come with many demo examples that basically
fill this gap. I did notice a few minor typos in the book, but it
was obvious even to me (a non-programmer) how to fix them. Almost
all the code runs perfectly. I know, because I typed in and ran
each example! Virtuous (i.e., lazy) programmers can download all
the book's code from the O'Reilly web site
(http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/lperltk/).</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Learning Perl/Tk</em></span> provides a simple yet
thorough introduction to this newest method of writing windows
programs, and will also be a valuable reference for the production
programmer. There is room for more books on this subject at the
intermediate level.</p><p>I believe anyone with an interest in Perl/Tk will benefit
from reading this book, and I recommend it with enthusiasm.</p></div></div>
