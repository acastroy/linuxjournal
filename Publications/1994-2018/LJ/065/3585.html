Back in the old country&mdash;in his case, Samoa&mdash;Frank taught math. I
have no idea how much he knows about math, but I do know he is
fully capable of building anything or fixing any building. To put
it another way, Frank hacks buildings.
</p><p>Frank was the foreman of the crew who built our house. This
was no ordinary construction job. The architect was a 78-year-old,
who had been an apprentice of Frank Lloyd Wright and had many of
the Great Man's qualities, including the prickly perversity behind
such lines as &ldquo;It's the job of the architect to bankrupt the
builder.&rdquo; While the house was a remodeling job, it was also
completely original, turning a one-story ranch into a two-story
modern, with cantilevered decks, whole walls of custom-made glass
and almost nothing found in a catalog or at Home Depot.</p><p>Of course, mistakes were made, as they always are, and minds
were changed. Much of the kitchen had to be redone. Pipes in the
wrong places had to be moved. A bedroom wall bulged strangely and
had to be flattened.</p><p>What amazed me was that Frank could look at all these
problems&mdash;walls, windows, pipes and floors&mdash;as if they were
modeling clay. As if nothing was a permanent structure. As if
making or altering a building were merely a matter of tools and
time. Need a door moved? Sure; stay out of the way and we'll do it
this afternoon. Sorry about the dust.</p><p>I didn't fully understand the similarity between hacking
Linux and hacking buildings until our own chief hacker and
publisher, Phil Hughes, stayed at our place over the past few days,
fixing just about everything that didn't work. This included my
home-brew FM transmitter, which had baffled me for nearly a year
(and I'm not stupid&mdash;except next to guys like Phil and our
readers). Armed with a schematic, a meter and a soldering iron, he
fixed the thing in less time than it took him to tell me how bad my
tools were and what I should do to replace them. Not much different
than his constant put-downs of all editing tools that don't measure
up to <span   class="bold"><b>vi</b></span>.</p><p>Where Phil did his best work was on our Linux box, a no-name
133MHz PC clone. Using vi and other software tools, Phil turned it
into a mean, clean Linux machine. When he was done, this 133MHz
clone was routing e-mail, serving web pages, hosting files for an
office full of Macs and PCs, and serving as a desktop for reading
and writing .doc, .xls and .ppt files. In other words, he made it
into a real Linux system. I submit that this is less an example of
Linux doing good work than of a good worker using Linux and
UNIX-grade tools to do what lesser materials and tools won't
allow.</p><p>Phil looked at our Macs the way Frank loooked at the home
tool-boxes in our garage, each filled with amateur-grade implements
from Sears and Orchard Supply. He made me realize I know even less
about building real computing solutions (in the literal sense of
that hackneyed word) than I do about building houses. I also
realized only those who truly know the virtues of vi and other
&ldquo;Real Tools&rdquo; are in a position not just to solve problems, but to
build a better world.</p><p>For proof, look at the Internet. Much of what we know and
love about the Internet&mdash;such as the way it moves mail and serves
up pages&mdash;was built by guys who love to solve hard problems with
good tools. These are guys who look at computing problems the way
Frank Saelua looks at a bad wall.</p><p>Of course, there is far more to the Internet than Sendmail
and Apache. But I submit there is something highly significant
about the success of those solutions&mdash;two applications truly
deserving of the label&mdash;that isn't highly obvious, and that is the
matter of origins. There is something about where those problem
solvers came from which gave their solutions an enormous
scope.</p><p>Where they came from was the UNIX world. Back in 1994, when I
got my first working account with an ISP, I had a hard time getting
my head around all the things my stupid old Macintosh could
suddenly do all at once: browsing in multiple windows; archie,
gopher and TELNET sessions; file transfers and even web service,
thanks to Chuck Shotten's freshly hacked WebStar. One day, I was on
the phone with one of the geeks who built the ISP when he
interrupted me and said, &ldquo;You gotta understand: this is UNIX. You
can do lots of stuff at once. In fact, there's just about no limit
to what you can do.&rdquo; At the time, his whole business was built on
cheap, used Sun machines and a pile of free software.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>There's just about no limit to what you can
do.</em></span> Combine the scope of UNIX with a problem-solver's
mentality and you've got a future that's equally promising and hard
to see from the non-UNIX perspective. Trying to anticipate that
future with non-UNIX concepts is like trying to frame a skyscraper
with nothing but two-by-fours and sheet rock. And this is what
Microsoft is up against right now. Whatever its ambitions,
Microsoft will always come from the desktop. From the client. From
one person working alone with a <span   class="emphasis"><em>personal</em></span>
computer.</p><p>The future of computing won't be built by a company, even
though we'll call it an industry. It will be built by builders and
companies of builders. Both will operate on UNIX-informed concepts
of not just operating systems and development models, but of
understanding and solving problems and&mdash;critically, because this is
a first&mdash;of doing business.</p><p>This new building trade won't be limited by one vendor's
monopolistic insistence that everything be built only with its
materials and tools. It won't be made out of one vendor's pre-fab
parts. Most of all, it won't be built on shaky foundations that
nobody can improve because their bricks and mortar can be touched
only by their own manufacturer.</p><p>At too many companies today, even the best builders are
limited by software and tools they can get only from the aisles of
Microsoft Depot. This will end. Now the software business will turn
into a <span   class="emphasis"><em>real</em></span> building trade, because the whole
conversation will be liberated from hegemonistic corporate agendas
by the builders themselves. Where they'll come from is the UNIX
world view&mdash;one where <span   class="emphasis"><em>there's just about no limit to what
you can do</em></span>.</p><p>This new trade is about designing, assembling, reassembling
and fixing structures that are good because good professionals
using good tools and materials are doing the work and learning
constantly from each other about how to do it better&mdash;and doing it
for the love of the work far more than the money.</p><p>Enabling this community is fundamental to everything we do at
<i  >Linux Journal</i>. Many of our writers are just
readers who step forward because they have useful stories to tell.
Calling them freelancers doesn't cover their value. Eric Kidd puts
it this way in a post at Scripting.com: &ldquo;For those of you who
aren't familiar with <i  >Linux Journal</i>, it is one
of the best geek magazines currently available. In an age when
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Dr. Dobb's</em></span> and <span   class="emphasis"><em>Byte</em></span> have
utterly forsaken their technical roots, <i  >LJ</i>
still publishes actual source code&mdash;in some issues, well over half
the articles have sidebars with program fragments. The articles are
written by members of the Linux community.&rdquo;</p><p>So there it is. You made us what we are, and for that, we owe
you a hearty thanks. Now let's get back to work.</p></div></div>
