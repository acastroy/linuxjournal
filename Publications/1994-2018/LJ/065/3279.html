    A trip down gaming's memory lane with an enthusiastic,
    long-time player.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15e6580.0x16de2f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>Adventure is an old game and one that has
been known by many names: ''Adventure'', &ldquo;Colossal Cave&rdquo;, and the
simplistic abbreviation &ldquo;Advent&rdquo;. As games go, it is indeed a
classic, having sparked an entirely new tangent of game development
in the early days of the gaming industry. Its effects can still be
felt today.
</p><p>I sat down this morning to write a review of a game. At some
point, I figured I'd tell about its strengths and weaknesses. In
the end, I'd probably assign it a value in stars or thumbs or
joysticks or some other arbitrary measurement of quality. However,
assigning a letter of quality to this game is nearly as
anachronistic as seeing <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Illiad</em></span> on Oprah's
booklist; it is simply inappropriate and demeans the true quality
of the work. So instead, I'm going to tell you what this game has
meant to me, a little about where it came from, and how it shaped
the Quake III world in which we live today. We've come a long way
from the early days of text adventures&mdash;or have we?</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15e6580.0x16de4a8"></a>My Story</h2></div></div><p>It was 1989 and I was 10. The end of the eighties was upon
us, and we all looked with trepidation to the coming decade and the
closing years of our millennium. The Bangles played &ldquo;Walk Like an
Egyptian&rdquo; to hordes of onlookers not interested in the nostalgia
of the moment. The economy was in a deep recession, and with the
Cold War and movies like <span   class="emphasis"><em>War Games</em></span>, people
were naturally wary of what the coming years would bring. The
Berlin Wall fell that year, and we all wondered what more the
future would bring. Well, I didn't wonder. I was 10, what do you
expect?</p><p>Instead, I was concentrating on my own life. Already the
budding geek (before the term became a compliment), I went out and
hunted my butterflies (tilted my windmills) and enjoyed life. I had
a Commodore 64 at the time, and thought it was the coolest thing in
the world, but it never affected me. It was fun, certainly. I knew
how to program simple things in Basic. I could make balloons float
around on the screen. I knew that if I typed &ldquo;SYS 64738&rdquo;, the
whole thing would reboot. But it never grew beyond a tinker toy to
me&mdash;it never awakened my inner geek.</p><p>That changed, of course. My father bought me a game package
he had pulled from the bargain bin. It was a set of two 5.25-inch
floppies from Broderbund (the covered wagon people) entitled
&ldquo;Golden Oldies Volume 1.&rdquo; Loading it up, I was surprised to find
a collection of four &ldquo;classics&rdquo; of the day: Adventure, Eliza,
Life and Pong. My mother decided she liked Eliza the best and would
continually attempt to convince the poor thing that she was a beach
ball or something similar. I found my passion in Adventure, a
little game that transported me into a world filled with scary
little dwarves and myriad treasures, all for the taking, if the
young spelunker was up to the challenge. Needless to say, I never
beat the game. I rarely drew maps, and when I did, I routinely
forgot which direction was east. I had managed to memorize a large
portion of the game, but in retrospect I don't think I ever truly
got it. Maybe it was because I was too busy experiencing the world
to really want to win. (Or more likely, because I was young and
stupid, but leave me to rose-tint my world however I want, please.)
Eventually, my old copy of Adventure developed bad sectors and I
put it to rest.</p><p>Several times later in life, I would rediscover these games I
loved. I did eventually get to play Zork (a version of Adventure)
for the Apple II, and found it richly gratifying, but too similar
to the game I left behind. Other games I loved: King's Quest, Quest
for Glory and the early Sierra masterpieces. Somehow, even with
their fancy four-color pictures and their beeps, they never
transported me to a world in the same way my first Adventure did. I
rediscovered Adventure when I finally turned to the &ldquo;dark side&rdquo;
and was given a 386 and a modem to play with. It was just as I
remembered it, except free from a local BBS. I played and played
and mapped it a little, but I still never beat it. Life had a
tendency to intrude and I put it away again, a cherished childhood
game to relive later.</p><p>I was happy to rediscover my game in the BSD Gamespack
(/usr/games/) that ships with many Linux distributions, including
Red Hat. It was like meeting a childhood friend again on the
street. Now I'd like to introduce it to you.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15e6580.0x16de768"></a>History of Adventure</h2></div></div><p>The game of Adventure has a long history, dating back to the
earliest days of modern computing. In the beginning (1972), there
was Will Crowther. He was a programmer, caver and role-player
(Dungeons and Dragons, in particular). Faced with boredom (the
motivational force behind many a good program), a desire to create
something for his daughter and his assorted talents, he set out to
create a game based on his explorations of the Mammoth and Flint
Ridge cave systems in Kentucky. This game included many of the
features of the later versions and included descriptions and room
names taken directly from the caves in the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>real</em></span> world.</p><p>A couple of years later, Don Woods discovered the game and
added a number of fantasy elements to the plot including pesky
dwarves, a dragon and whatnot. His primary inspiration was fantasy
literature (such as the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Lord of the Rings</em></span>
trilogy), and Adventure was never to be the same again.</p><p>Many other coders added bits and pieces after that point.
This may be one of the earliest examples of open-source gaming. The
game Adventure could be one of a dozen or more variants, each with
minor scoring differences and occasional major additions. By and
large, all Adventures are created equal.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15e6580.0x16de9d0"></a>An Evolutionary &ldquo;Dead End&rdquo;?</h2></div></div><p>Most people, while writing game reviews, don't have the
luxury of jumping ahead 30 years and seeing how a particular piece
of software affected the computing landscape. I do have this
luxury.</p><p>The games of today, at first glance, are not even remotely
similar to the games of yesteryear. Space Invaders yielded to Quake
and Rogue to Diablo. Are these games fundamentally different from
their legacy counterparts? Take a close look and you will find
relatively little difference, except for the quality of the
graphics engine. Early in the process, game manufacturers
discovered that graphics sell. In the early days, black and white
games yielded to those with color and then yielded to those with
sound. 3-D polygonal rendering is the big kick these days (take a
look at Nintendo 64). Are these true enhancements, or just eye
candy? I tend to take the stance of the latter. Move, shoot and
move, shoot and repeat until your thumbs get sore. What game am I
talking about?</p><p>It would be foolish of me to point to two of the oldest
breakthroughs in game design and say that the gaming industry has
stagnated&mdash;that is not what I'm trying to say. Now-classics such as
Civilization, SimCity, PacMan, Tetris, The Legend of Zelda and
Super Mario Brothers sparked their legions of clones but were all
individual and profound. But which of these series haven't suffered
in some way from graphics mania? (I'd like to make an exception to
this point. Mario 64 was actually, in my opinion, a breakthrough in
gaming and not just a knock-off of a superior product.)</p><p>What games trace the lineage back to Adventure? What games
descended from its pinnacle in the non-combat adventure
genre?</p><p>Following Adventure first and foremost was Zork. There were
probably others before Zork, but Zork made a noticeable impact on
our consciousness. The original Zork didn't stray far from the
original concept; it had a newer and fancier parser than the old
caving adventure, resulting in more fluid game play. Later
installments by the Infocom crowd took gaming to new heights. Their
games had magic, mystery and fun. They pioneered the interactive
story and took it much farther than even Adventure. This is not to
say that each of their games were classic; many were derivative,
but many more were unique.</p><p>Eventually, however, Infocom's luster began to wear off.
Games increasingly turned to graphical albeit inferior forms of
gaming. Sierra On-line took a prominent role with King's Quest and
other games. Their storytelling was fantastic, but something was
just not right about using the arrow keys to walk up to a tree and
typing &ldquo;look into tree&rdquo; when you got there. Gradually, they
refined that interface further with icons and mouse movement, but
the &ldquo;universal range of motion&rdquo; feel that you got with the old
text adventures was gone. Now your actions were defined by what you
could click on, not by what you could imagine. Particularly
frustrating for me were the layers of eye candy they added to their
games. It looked nice, but was often distracting, especially when
you wanted to manipulate and just couldn't figure out how.</p><p>Eventually, &ldquo;point and click&rdquo; adventure gaming became even
more &ldquo;clicky&rdquo; with the advent of games without funny icons. In
these games, you just click on the screen and the computer figures
out what action you want from context. To make matters worse, it
wasn't long before gamers discovered a profound secret: when one is
stuck, one needs only to click madly around the screen until
stumbling on the magic hot-spot that jumps to the next level.
Certainly, this is a far cry from the seemingly infinite worlds
offered by the early text-adventure games, but is it
progress?</p><p>Infocom (now owned by Activision) and others would try to
break away from this mold with later games, such as Return to Zork,
which offered a much more detailed mouse interface. Sadly, however,
this is where I became disinterested with the genre of non-combat
&ldquo;adventure&rdquo; gaming, and I have yet to see whether their more
recent titles have matched that level in playability. (I'd love to
see a review of Zork: Grand Inquisitor&mdash;too bad they don't make it
for Linux.)</p><p>What made these games so wonderful? It wasn't the graphics,
obviously. What made these games special was something more subtle.
In addition to generally good writing, the textual format allowed
game designers to plug the computer's output directly into the
gamer's imagination. Who among us doesn't have splendid memories of
&ldquo;Flood Control Dam III&rdquo; (Zork), the little white house with the
boarded front door (Zork), or the &ldquo;Hall of the Mountain King&rdquo;
(Adventure)? Graphical games just don't plug into the subconscious
in the same way. For me, that made all the difference.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15e6580.0x16ded98"></a>The Game</h2></div></div><p>In the game of Adventure, you are an unnamed hero-explorer
with a good head on your shoulders and a sturdy back. Your mission
is to locate and explore Colossal Cave and bring back the hoards of
treasure rumored to be inside. But watch out; magic is afoot in the
cave and all may not be as it seems. Scoring is based on how many
treasures you find, how much of the cave (if any) you explore, and
how many of those treasures you get out of the cave.</p><p>The game play is fairly simple. You instruct the game in
two-word English phrases (&ldquo;get lamp&rdquo;) to do things, and your
character does them. The vocabulary of the game is not quite as
large as its Infocom descendants, but that is understandable. When
you get stuck, you can ask for help (although it may not be
forthcoming) and when you die, you can get put back together again.
It is all very simple.</p><p>On first starting the game, it will probably seem confusing.
You've just been plopped down in the middle of a large world with
little idea of where to go. A building is nearby&mdash;that's obvious.
Consider it your base of operations, as you'll need to deliver your
hoards of treasure there in order to score the most points. Farther
afield is the hidden entrance to the cave, a confusing forest (the
game's first mini-maze), and many other sights once you get
underground. That is, if you remembered to bring your lamp.
Otherwise, it'll be a short trip.</p><p>If you're playing this game for the first time, I recommend
just exploring for a while and seeing the sights. Once you are
comfortable with the interface, you'll probably want to get pen and
paper and start drawing maps like a true spelunker. Without some
sort of map, you will most likely become lost in the maze-like
passageways, halls and crawls of Colossal Cave. If you do get
stuck, don't ask me for help. I'm at Witt's End.</p></div></div>
