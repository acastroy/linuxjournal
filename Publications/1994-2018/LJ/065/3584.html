    domination, some of us know the true key&mdash;the reason we became interested in computers&mdash;is games. While much of our
    karmic lineage may come from the punch-card generation of computer hackers, for whom so many games may not have
    been available, many of us grew up in the days of early home machines such as the Spectrum, Commodore, Atari and
    Amiga. Some younger hackers may even hail from the days of 3-D. (Imagine having grown up with
    <span   class="emphasis"><em>that</em></span> technology.) Despite slow processors, limited colors, small memories and other obstacles
    of primitive technology, the years saw numerous ingenious masterpieces, elegant studies in working within
    limitations, classic games to which we returned time and again, sometimes poking (on BASIC machines) or
    manipulating with hex editors and disassemblers, but mostly just playing.</p><p>Now Linux is developing its own classic games, in a time when limitations on processor speed, color graphics,
    sound, multitasking, memory, disk space, and networking hardly even seem to exist. Like the classics of old, Linux
    games have a character all their own; since the games are often developed by a single person or a small group of
    people, they tend to have a personal, hand-made quality which is missing from their slick, commercial counterparts
    on other platforms.</p><p>Rather than technological limitations, the main constraint today seems to be development time. Although
    open-source cooperation solves a large part of this problem, another part of the Linux answer is playability, the
    mysterious quality possessed by games of old which captured our attentions and imaginations despite 1MHz processors
    and graphics that weren't even vector-shaded 3-D. One legitimate Linux classic which exemplifies this essence of
    playability, and is an excellent game for inaugurating this new gaming section, is Jan Hubicka's Koules, found at
    <a href="http://www.paru.cas.cz/~hubicka/koules/English/koules.html" target="_self">www.paru.cas.cz/~hubicka/koules/English/koules.html</a>.</p><p>
      <a href="3584f6.jpg" target="_self">Koules for X version 1.4</a>
    </p><p>The Dark Applepolisher, you see, is up to no good&mdash;he has sent his spherical forces to conquer Earth and
    claim its resources. In order to defend us from these evil Koules, you will have to bump them out of each of the
    100 sectors (and finally confront the Dark Applepolisher). Fortunately, you have been transformed into a yellow
    beach ball. Well, according to Hubicka, mutated into a chest with eyes to make your job easier, of course.</p><p>Although the task may seem simple at first, there will come many varieties of Koules, each with different
    weights and sizes and mysterious abilities. Black holes and stars and other natural dangers appear as well, and the
    Koules keep coming! Once the first few sectors are cleared, special Koule ablities and secret weapons begin to
    appear and the game becomes more exciting and visually interesting. Fortunately, you too can gain special abilities
    from Koule deserters who give you more weight, more speed and even extra lives. A well-stocked beach ball can weigh
    enough to wipe out even enormous Koules in a single blow.</p><p>Koules is simply an excellent idea which, when developed, becomes fantastically playable. Koules supports up
    to five players, at a single terminal or over a network, and is more fun with multiple players. Keyboard, mouse and
    joystick are supported, as well as SVGA and X. Sound support is excellent and exists on multiple platforms, and
    there are multiple difficulty levels.</p><p>Even though Koules was developed by a single person and is completely free, it has the finished quality of a
    professional game along with the personality of a small project. I recommend getting some friends together on a
    rainy Saturday, defending Earth from and finally defeating the Dark Applepolisher, and going out for pizza to
    celebrate the victory. When you get home, you can start again!</p><p>Also, check out the Linux Game Tome at

    his company's browser source code from &ldquo;this guy Raymond&rdquo;, and identified the originator of Linux as &ldquo;Linus
    Pauling&rdquo;. He wasn't too far off, because Linus Torvalds' parents actually named their boy after the famous
    American Nobel prize winner and vitamin C wacko.</p><p>And there began the tale of two pronunciations that have done nothing but permute. There is not only no
    consensus on how to pronounce Linux, but this condition appears to derive from an equal uncertainty about how to
    pronounce Linus. The Web is full of sound files in which Linus says, &ldquo;Hi, my name is Leenoos Torvahlds and I
    pronounce Leenooks as Leenooks.&rdquo; More or less. That's Jim Choi's phoneticization of the recording.</p><p>But let's face it: that's not complicated enough. Since there is only a one-letter difference between Linus
    and Linux, we thought we'd see how well the two mapped across the Web by searching for the coincidence of Linus and
    Linux with various phonetic spellings of the same. As you can see, the results are equally absorbing and
    inconclusive, providing plenty of grist for the disagreement mill.</p><p>Oh, by the way, Lin-ux appears to be the winner, with 72 pages showing this pronunciation.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="3584f4.large.jpg"><img src="3584f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Linus/Linux Pronunciations</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13a1580.0x17a8c90"></a>VENDOR NEWS</h2></div></div><p>

    was held on June 30 and July 1 in Austin, Texas. This event, which I attended, was capably presented by
    Ziff-Davis.</p><p>This was a completely different experience for me than attending shows such as LinuxWorld or Linux Expo. The
    attendees were dressed casually, but were definitely business and professional people&mdash;not the hardcore Linux
    faithful. These people were there to find alternatives to Windows and determine whether open source was a good fit
    for their companies. Their minds were open, but not made up.</p><p>Keynote speeches by Eric Raymond, Ransom Love and Jon &ldquo;maddog&rdquo; Hall were enlightening and gave a good
    positive start to the proceedings. Eric discussed open-source business models and how to decide if and when to go
    open or stay closed. Ransom talked about the shift from mainframes to PCs (right-shifting) and the current shift to
    Internet devices (left-shifting), noting Linux is the perfect Internet device because of its capability to be pared
    down to a very small footprint, its stability, easy customization, high performance and low cost to implement and
    maintain. Jon discussed the various ways to make money with Linux and advised companies to &ldquo;put an ad in
    <i  >Linux Journal</i>&rdquo;.</p><p>
      <a href="3584f5.jpg" target="_self">User Friendly Cartoon</a>
    </p><p>Other talks presented a different side. In particular, Jonathan Eunice, President of Illuminata, proclaimed
    that for large enterprise applications, Linux was definitely
    <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> &ldquo;enterprise-ready&rdquo; and &ldquo;free, open-source software is
    <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> a panacea&rdquo;. He pointed out that the market demands a standard for something it can depend
    on, that UNIX failed because of fracturing due to not being able to agree on open standards, and that when time is
    of the essence and skills are limited, paying for a commercial product is the way to go.</p><p>Z-D's theme for the show was &ldquo;Build Your Business with Open Source&rdquo; and the auditorium was decorated as a
    construction site. Flashing yellow lights onstage proved to be a bit distracting. Attendance seemed low compared to
    the Expos and could be numbered in the hundreds rather than the thousands, although I did not get any final count.
    Still, it was a good conference&mdash;one that provided a much-needed platform for Linux and Open Source to strut their
    stuff for the business world.</p><p>&mdash;Marjorie Richardson</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13a1580.0x1a25940"></a>Readers' Choice Awards</h2></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3584f7.jpg"></div><p>It's that time of year again&mdash;time to vote for your favorite products in our Readers' Choice Awards.

    interest in purchasing Corel Corporation. We're sure Adobe would love to hear your opinions on this one.</p><p>Factoid: How do penguins sleep? Some species return to their burrows on land for a few hours of rest, but
    most penguins take only short naps. Some penguins actually sleep at sea, although this has not yet been observed.
    Overall, they sleep very little&mdash;much like programmers!</p><p>Another Famous Linus: Linus Van Pelt: better known simply as &ldquo;Linus&rdquo;. Famous
    <span   class="emphasis"><em>Peanuts</em></span> character in the long-running strip by Charles Schultz. Noted for trademark &ldquo;security
    blanket&rdquo; and thumb-sucking. Turns 47 on September 19th. Words to live by: &ldquo;I love mankind. It's people I can't
    stand.&rdquo;</p><p>Rumor Mill: James Sasser, the U.S. Ambassador to China, has blamed much of the tension between the two
    countries on the recent proliferation of &ldquo;1999: Year of the Penguin&rdquo; T-shirts. Graphics and T-shirt designer
    Jesse Judd was unavailable for comment, having retreated to the Olympic Mountains outside Seattle.</p></div></div>
