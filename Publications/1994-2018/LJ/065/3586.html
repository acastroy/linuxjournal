I've used various methods to add them to my system via the
<span   class="bold"><b>adduser</b></span> command and through
various X control-panel programs. When I add them, everything seems
to go well, and they exist when I look them up after I created
them. My problem is that I can't log in without being root. If I
attempt to log in as a user, it will say &ldquo;login incorrect&rdquo;, as if
I typed in the wrong password or user name, which is not the case.
I have tried numerous times and am frustrated since I cannot get
any users to work on my system.  &mdash;Anthony Dipaula,
dipaula@udel.edu</p><p>You will need to check two files. The first is /etc/passwd.
Make sure each user has a valid shell and home directory. Then look
at /etc/login.conf. This defines login control settings, and you
might have a setting that prevents non-root logins on the
console.  &mdash;Chad Robinson, chadr@brt.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1118580.0x1210348"></a>File Type</h2></div></div><p>Can someone tell me what the hyphen after a file name
indicates? Two examples are in /etc: <b  >passwd-</b> and
<b  >group-</b>. Thanks in advance for the
answer.  &mdash;George R. Boyko, grb99@nni.com</p><p>These are backups made by the utilities that manage these
files. You can most likely delete them safely, but it's also a good
idea to keep them around. Otherwise, if your passwd file ever
becomes corrupted, you will be unable to log in, and rebuilding it
is always a pain if you don't have a good copy lying around.  &mdash;Chad

NT 4.0 and SuSE Linux (kernel 2.0.36). My problem is that I don't
know how to install the Plug and Play modem on Linux. With the
first two operating systems (Windows 95 and NT), the modem works
just fine. I tried many ways of installing the modem using the Isa
PNP tools. It recognizes the modem, but I still have trouble
setting up the port. I read some of the HOWTOs and they don't help
me much. They say to set up the modem with the
<span   class="bold"><b>setserial</b></span> command, but I don't
know how to use this command. In the Windows NT 4.0 setup, my modem
is installed with the following parameters: COM5, IRQ 07,
Input/Output Range 02E8 to 02EF.</p><p>Can someone tell me how to set up my modem on Linux? Or how
to set up the modem using the
<span   class="bold"><b>setserial</b></span> command? It is a 3Com US
Robotics 56K Voice Faxmodem.  &mdash;Manuel Enrique,
phrotos@email.com</p><p>COM5 is usually (not always) a clue that your modem isn't a
modem but a winmodem, which would therefore be useless with
anything other than Windows.</p><p>Now, if it really is a modem, you should find out which port
it is on as far as Linux is concerned (probably ttyS2) with
<b  >dmesg | grep ttyS</b> right after boot. Then
configure the interrupt and the port number like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
setserial /dev/ttyS2 port 0x3E8 irq 2
</pre><p>substituting the right values for your card.  &mdash;Marc

I don't know, I am clueless. I am running on Red Hat 6.0, and
Netscape Communicator 4.5. Whenever I go to a Java web site, like
linux.com or yahoo.com, Netscape will crash; that is, it will just
disappear. If I run Netscape in a terminal ./netscape, it will also
disappear whenever I go to a Java site. But in the terminal, it
will say &ldquo;bus error&rdquo;. What does this mean? I know I enabled Java
in my setting, but how can I fix this? &mdash;Eric Zabinski,
diablo@elnet.com</p><p>Netscape has been known to crash for a variety of reasons,
many of them linked to Javascript and especially Java. I recommend
you try upgrading to Netscape 4.61, or downgrading to Netscape
4.08.  &mdash;Marc Merlin, marc@merlins.org</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1118580.0x1210a80"></a>PPP and Network Configuration</h2></div></div><p>I recently accomplished my first successful Linux install,
Red Hat 5.2. I installed PPP software, but thought network
configuration should be done only for NIC-equipped machines, not
ones just doing dialup, so I didn't perform the network
configuration at that time.</p><p>Although I have subsequently edited a raft of PPP-related
files using the HOWTOs, books and the suggestions of an ISP, I
don't get the expected PPP &ldquo;garbage&rdquo; (40-character frames with
frequent { characters) in response to a
<span   class="bold"><b>pppd</b></span> command from the command-line
prompt. Does this clearly mean that I don't have PPP support
properly installed and need to reinstall or add via a package
manager? Or would this also occur with errors in the configuration
files (like host.deny or host.allow or ...)? &mdash;Stephen S. Rinsler,
70353.714@compuserve.com</p><p>You should be able to create the PPP connection with
<span   class="bold"><b>netcfg</b></span>, which you can launch from
the control panel that should be there by default when you log in
as root and launch X (type <b  >control-panel</b>
otherwise). You also have the option of using
<span   class="bold"><b>linuxconf</b></span> to create your PPP
connection.  &mdash;Marc Merlin, marc@merlins.org</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1118580.0x1210d98"></a>Mounting NFS</h2></div></div><p>I need to implement NFS (Network File System) from my Linux
host to a WinNT Server for files access. I have Linux Red Hat 5.2
installed on a Pentium 133 MHz and 24MB RAM machine. I also
installed the NFS services (client and server). In a server
machine, I have Windows NT 4.0. I read the book <span   class="emphasis"><em>TCP/IP
Illustrated Vol.1</em></span> by Richard Stevens (chapter 29 talks
about NFS), so I am a beginner of the protocol. When I try to mount
an NFS link, the following error appears:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
mount: RPC: Port mapper failure - RPC: Unable to send
</pre><p>Can you help me? &mdash;Ing. Juan Salazar Velasco,
jsalazar@merkafon.com
</p><p>The easiest way to do this is not with NFS, but with Samba,
which you can get at
<a href="http://samba.anu.edu.au" target="_self">samba.anu.edu.au</a>.
By installing Samba on your Linux box, you will be able to use
<span   class="bold"><b>smbclient</b></span> to access your Windows
NT server, and the combination of
<span   class="bold"><b>nmbd</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>smbd</b></span> to allow your NT server to
access files on your Linux box. This works for printers,
too.</p><p>NFS services require special configuration in the Windows NT
server (and usually additional software), and often aren't as fast
because the native protocols to each type of server (SMB for NT and
NFS for UNIX) were designed with somewhat different intentions in
mind. In my experience, UNIX emulates SMB better than NT emulates
NFS.  &mdash;Chad Robinson, chadr@brt.com</p><p>It's not clear to me which machine is the NFS server. If it's
Linux, then most likely the portmapper isn't running. Type:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/etc/rc.d/init.d/portmap restart
</pre><p>Also, make sure that rpc.nfsd and rpc.mountd are
running on your machine.
</p><p>If the server is NT, type:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
showmount -e <span   class="emphasis"><em>name_of_nt_server</em></span>
</pre><p>and as long as you don't get suitable output from
it, your NT server isn't configured correctly.  &mdash;Marc Merlin,

For Dummies</em></span> book, I have somehow locked myself and the
install program out of it. Once you have partitioned a drive
partially for Linux, how do you get back in and straighten out any
mess you may have made? The install floppy or the CD-ROM have
nothing on them that I can access from the DOS prompt or from the
DOS program <span   class="bold"><b>fdisk</b></span>, which, by the
way, says there is an error reading the disk and won't let me in.
Also, DiskDruid won't let me back in either. Can you
help? &mdash;&ldquo;Budskie&rdquo;, Budskie@email.msn.com</p><p>I would guess that you somehow damaged your partition table,
but this is tough to tell without looking further at the drive. You
may wish to try a different tool, such as the
<span   class="bold"><b>fdisk</b></span> program that comes with the
Slackware package. It is a more raw tool, and while it may be
harder to use, it probably won't completely stop you from getting
to your drive.</p><p>I've seen problems like this come from misunderstandings
about the LBA (logical block addressing) setting in the BIOS for a
drive. Unfortunately, without knowing more about what exactly has
happened, I can tell you only how to completely wipe out what
you've done so you can reload your system. (The adage about backups
comes to mind here.) If you do go this route, you would want to use
a more basic tool (such as the fdisk that ships with Slackware) to
remove all of the Linux partitions on your drive in the hopes of
recovering your DOS information. Failing that, you could always
remove them all and re-install Windows to return to a stable state,
then try again.  &mdash;Chad Robinson, chadr@brt.com</p></div></div>
