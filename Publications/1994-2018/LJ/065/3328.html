Guide</em></span> states:
<div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>The Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a
graphical language for visualizing, specifying, constructing and
documenting the artifacts of a software-intensive system. The UML
gives you a standard way to write a system's blueprints, covering
conceptual things, such as business processes and system functions,
as well as concrete things, such as classes written in a specific
programming language, database schemas, and reusable software
components.</p></blockquote></div>

This book is intended to be read by people involved in the
production of object-oriented software systems. It assumes the
reader has a basic understanding of object-oriented concepts, and
from there teaches one how to use UML. In realistic terms, the book
contains too much information to review adequately here, as I
cannot do justice to the authors in such a short space.
</p><p>The book is divided into three major sections: structural
modeling, behavioral modeling and architectural modeling. The
structural and behavioral modeling are then subdivided into basic
and advanced sections. Each section is laid out in a manner such
that you can read the entire section (as I did) or only those parts
that are important to you.</p><p>The basic structural modeling section describes the use of
classes, relationships and class diagrams. It provides the basics
which all object-oriented software engineers require to build UML
models. Classes are described down to their lowest level, and
subsections show how to distribute the responsibilities of a system
among the classes that compose it. The advanced section expands on
this to describe how to model the semantics of a class, object
diagrams, packages, relationships and interfaces. This section
shows how to model the relationships between classes and how to
model the interfaces provided by a group of classes. It also
teaches how to model a set of objects and their relationships at a
given point in time using object diagrams.</p><p>The basic behavioral modeling section describes how to model
the interaction between objects. It describes the interaction, use
case and activity diagrams which dictate how the objects in the
model interact with each other. The advanced behavioral modeling
section also describes how to model events, state machines,
processes, threads and time constraints. This book contains a
wealth of information for the modeling of the structure and
behavior of classes and objects. The authors show how to use state
diagrams to model the behavior of individual objects within the
system, showing how an object responds to internal and external
stimuli. The examples start at simple state diagrams and continue
through to complex diagrams that contain states and substates
(states within states).</p><p>The architectural modeling section describes how to use the
UML to document the physical arrangement of the software system. It
deals with the complex issue of managing the components of the
final product as well as how those components are deployed when the
software is installed, using component and deployment diagrams. A
component diagram graphically depicts the components that comprise
the software; similarly, the deployment diagram describes how the
components are distributed across one or more systems and how the
hardware components are interconnected.</p><p>The authors have gone to great lengths to produce a readable
book full of examples and useful tidbits. Try not to be overwhelmed
by the volume of information in this book&mdash;much information is
there, but it is all aimed at helping you model systems more
accurately, and thereby design and implement better systems.</p><p>In my opinion, this book is a great addition to every
object-oriented software developer's library, because it contains a
great deal of information about how to model software systems.
Although I have used both the Booch method and UML for some time
now, I learned many things that improved the quality of my designs,
especially in the area of communicating these designs to others. It
is a book worth buying.</p></div></div>
