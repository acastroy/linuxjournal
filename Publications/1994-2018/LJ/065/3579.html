    Generating graphics, charts and graphs for your web site is
    easy following Mr. Lerner's instructions.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1eff580.0x1ff74a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>Mark Andreessen, a co-founder of
Netscape, is often credited with having turned the Web from an
academic playground into a mass medium. But just what did
Andreessen do? After all, Tim Berners-Lee invented the browser,
HTML and URLs. You could even argue that the original browser was
superior in some ways, in that it allowed people to write pages of
HTML as well as read them.
</p><p>Historians might take issue with this, but I would argue that
Andreessen's greatest idea was allowing for graphics alongside text
in web documents. As a text-only medium, the Web was interesting
mainly to physicists and other academics, but with the introduction
of graphics, it began to appeal to an entirely new segment of the
population.</p><p>Today, graphics are not just used for decoration, but often
stand on their own. Nearly every professional web site now hires
one or more graphic artists to design the site&mdash;even when the site
will deal mainly with text. Some sites would not be possible or
even worthwhile were it not for the use of graphics. In some cases,
these graphics are dynamically generated, produced by a program,
instead of sitting in a static file on disk.</p><p>This month, we will look at ways in which we can create such
dynamic graphics with CGI programs. We will look at the GD library,
which allows us to create arbitrary images, and will quickly move
on to creating different kinds of dynamically generated charts and
graphs. After looking at some simple examples of such charts, we
will examine a more sophisticated example, one which draws its
inputs from a relational database.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1eff580.0x1ff76b8"></a>Perl, Dynamic Graphics and GD</h2></div></div><p>Writing a CGI program that outputs HTML is not particularly
difficult, as we have demonstrated in many previous installments of
&ldquo;At the Forge&rdquo;. Here, for example, is a simple program that, when
invoked, returns some HTML to the user's browser:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#!/usr/bin/perl -wT
    use strict;
    use diagnostics;
    use CGI;
    use CGI::Carp qw(fatalsToBrowser);
    # Create an instance of CGI
    my $query = new CGI;
    # Send an appropriate MIME header
    print $query-&gt;header(-type =&gt;
    "text/html");
    # Send some content
    print $query-&gt;start_html(-title =&gt;
    "This is a test.");
    print "&lt;H1&gt;Testing!&lt;/H1&gt;\n";
    print "&lt;P&gt;This is a test.&lt;/P&gt;\n";
    print $query-&gt;end_html;
</pre><p>If we want to return graphics to the user's browser, we must
modify the &ldquo;Content-type&rdquo; header in the HTTP response, generated
with the call to &ldquo;header&rdquo;. If we want to generate a GIF, we will
have to change our call to header such that it outputs
&ldquo;image/gif&rdquo; instead. By the same token, we can tell the user's
browser that a JPEG (image/jpeg) or PNG (image/png) graphic will be
sent. Once we have described the content to the user's browser, we
must generate a graphic of this type. How can we do that?
</p><p>Perl's scalar variables can contain any data we might like.
If we were more familiar with the GIF standard, we could stick a
GIF into a scalar, then send that value to the user's browser. Of
course, most of us are unfamiliar with the intimate details of the
GIF standard, which makes this a less than ideal solution. A better
idea would be to take advantage of Perl's object-oriented
capabilities, using someone else's solution to the same
problem.</p><p>Sure enough, Lincoln Stein (author of CGI.pm, the standard
module for CGI programs) has written and distributed GD.pm. This
module, available on CPAN (see &ldquo;Resources&rdquo;), gives us access to
the popular &ldquo;gd&rdquo; libraries for C written by Thomas
Boutell.</p><p>GD gives your program the ability to draw in a manner similar
to popular drawing programs. You can choose from an array of paint
brushes, colors and built-in shapes, as well as any fill shapes you
have drawn. GD has its own internal drawing format, but as we will
see, it supports the conversion of drawn images into GIF
format.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1eff580.0x1ff7978"></a>A Simple Graphics Program</h2></div></div><p>A simple program that uses GD, gd-intro.pl, is shown in
Listing 1. If you install it in your CGI directory and invoke it
from your browser, you should see a blue-filled green
square.</p><p><a href="3579l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1.</a></p><p>As you can see, our program manipulates two objects&mdash;an
instance of CGI and an instance of GD. Each object handles its own
affairs, keeping its nose out of the other object's business.
<b  >$query</b>, our instance of CGI, neither knows nor
cares what sort of data we are receiving from the user or returning
to his or her browser. By the same token,
<b  >$image</b>, our instance of GD, does not know that
its output is going to be sent to a browser. Such
compartmentalizing of tasks is one reason why objects make
programming easier and software more maintainable.</p><p>When we create <b  >$image</b>, we declare it to be
of type <b  >GD::Image</b> and to be 100 pixels wide by
100 tall. GD will not warn you if your image is cut off by the
boundaries of this declared &ldquo;canvas&rdquo;; when I first started to
play with GD, I was puzzled by the fact that no output appeared. I
finally realized that my image was 100x100, but I was drawing a
circle with a 400-pixel diameter. GD dutifully performed the task I
requested, which meant that no picture appeared in the end.</p><p>After declaring <b  >$image</b>, we allocate some
colors, using GD's <span   class="bold"><b>colorAllocate</b></span>
method. Each color is defined as red-green-blue (RGB), with each of
those parameters varying between 0 and 255. I find it useful to
declare color names within a hash, as with
<b  >%COLORS</b> in gd-intro.pl, but you may prefer to
assign them to individual variables or to work with colorAllocate
directly.</p><p>Next, we tell <b  >$image</b> that it should create
GIFs in &ldquo;interlaced&rdquo; mode. Interlacing means that instead of
drawing every horizontal line of an image, the computer should
first draw all the even lines, and then all the odd lines. You can
see this in action on an ordinary television set. When TV standards
were defined, televisions were unable to draw all the horizontal
lines at once. Because of this, your television draws all the odd
horizontal lines, followed by the even ones, followed by the odd
ones again.</p><p>Making a GIF interlaced is not related to the speed of your
computer or its ability to display images quickly; rather, it has
to do with the speed of a user's connection. If the user has a slow
connection, a GIF will load slowly. Making the graphic interlaced
allows the user to see the graphic as it loads. Otherwise, the
graphic will not be displayed until it is completely loaded, which
might take a while.</p><p>We also set the &ldquo;transparent&rdquo; color, which is the color
selected to melt into the background. By setting white as the
transparent color, we indicate that anything drawn in white should
actually be drawn in the color of the background. Since GD drawings
have a white background by default, setting white as the
transparent color means our graphic will appear to be floating in
the user's browser, rather than set against a white
background.</p><p>After all this, we can finally draw. We create a rectangle
between 20,20 and 80,80, which should fill most of the 100x100 area
defined when we created <b  >$image</b>. We choose to
draw the rectangle in green, using <b  >%COLORS</b>,
which we defined earlier. Finally, we fill the rectangle with blue
by pointing GD to a point inside of the rectangle and asking it to
fill the area.</p><p>GD has a number of other functions, including the ability to
draw polygons, create custom brushes and fill with specified
patterns. You can add text labels, which are incorporated into the
final graph. You can even save graphics to disk in GD's own format,
then load them again and continue to manipulate them before turning
them into GIFs.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1eff580.0x1ff8160"></a>Charts and Graphs</h2></div></div><p>GD is a wonderful tool for drawing on the Web. With it, you
can create all sorts of marvelous things. Most of the web graphics
I want to create are charts and graphs based on various types of
data. I could use GD to create such graphs, but that would involve
too much work.</p><p>Luckily, as is often the case with Perl, someone else had
this problem and decided to solve it. Martien Verbruggen wrote and
distributed the GIFgraph module, which allows us to create
different types of charts based on a list of data points. GIFgraph
uses GD, but provides us with an object-oriented interface to the
new graph. This allows us to think in terms of graphs, styles and
shapes&mdash;as opposed to GD, which would force us to think in terms of
pixels and lines.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3579f1.jpg"></div><p>GIFgraph is actually a set of modules collected under the
single &ldquo;GIFgraph&rdquo; name. One module handles bar graphs, another
pie charts and so on, for nearly ten different types of
graphs.</p><p><a href="3579l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2.</a></p><p>In Listing 2, for example, we create a simple bar graph, with
labels &ldquo;a&rdquo;, &ldquo;b&rdquo; and &ldquo;c&rdquo;, with respective values of 1, 2 and
3. We do this by creating an array, traditionally called
<b  >@data</b>. Each element of <b  >@data</b>
is an array reference, with the first element corresponding to the
labels. Our program displays results from a single set of
data:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
my @data = (["a", "b", "c"], [1, 2, 3]);
</pre><p>We could easily compare two sets of data:
<pre     class="programlisting">
my @data = (["a","b","c"], [1,2,3], [4,5,6]);
</pre>


GIFgraph is smart enough to use different colors for different sets
of data. So given the above data, it will draw six bars&mdash;three each
of two colors, with the values 1 and 4 associated with the &ldquo;a&rdquo;
label, the values 2 and 5 associated with the &ldquo;b&rdquo; label, and the
values 3 and 6 associated with the &ldquo;c&rdquo; label.
</p><p>Before we can send the output to the user's browser, we must
send a MIME type. Because it relies on GD, GIFgraph can produce
output in GIF format. We tell the browser what to expect with the
following command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
print $query-&gt;header(-type =&gt; "image/gif");
</pre><p>Now we will create our graph object and send its GIF output
to the user's browser:
<pre     class="programlisting">
my $graph = new GIFgraph::bars;
print $graph-&gt;plot(\@data);
</pre>


Notice how we pass an array reference to <b  >@data</b>
by prefacing it with a backslash (<b  >\@data</b>).
Passing <b  >@data</b> as a reference ensures it will be
handed to the <span   class="bold"><b>plot</b></span> method as
intended.
</p><p>In this example, we created a bar chart. What if we want a
different kind of chart? We can do that by importing a different
Perl module (e.g., <span   class="bold"><b>GIFgraph::lines</b></span>
instead of <span   class="bold"><b>GIFgraph::bars</b></span>) and
making <b  >$graph</b> an instance of the new
type.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3579f2.jpg"></div><p>Note that calling <b  >$graph-&gt;plot</b> creates
a graph based on <b  >@data</b> but does not send it to
the user's browser. This method returns the resulting GIF to its
caller, allowing us to save it to disk, send it to the user's
browser or manipulate the resulting GIF in Perl or external tools.
Since the CGI standard mandates all output to STDOUT be sent to the
user's browser, we can display the chart on the user's computer by
printing the result from this call.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1eff580.0x23f0f60"></a>Charting Based on a File</h2></div></div><p>Now that we have seen a simple program that produces a chart,
let us look at a slightly more complicated example, one which
mirrors some real-world situations. Assume we want to create a
graph based on a text file. For example, assume we are implementing
part of the reporting function for a web-based voting system. The
results of a given election will be placed in a text file, called
votes.txt:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Tom    123456
Dick   100000
Harry  20000
</pre><p>The election data is stored in the above file, with the
candidate's name and the number of votes he received separated with
one or more tab characters. This allows the candidates' names to
contain space characters, such as between first and last names.
</p><p><a href="3579l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3.</a></p><p>We could use a bar chart with this data, but it would not be
nearly as useful as a pie chart, in which each candidate is given a
proportional part of the pie. As you can see in Listing 3, our
program vote.pl is not very difficult to create and produces
results relatively quickly.</p><p>It does this by iterating through each line of votes.txt,
using Perl's built-in &ldquo;split&rdquo; function to turn a scalar value
(the line from votes.txt) into a list value. In this case, we split
that line across tabs, putting everything before the tab in
<b  >$name</b> and everything after the tab in
<b  >$votes</b>. We then use the &ldquo;push&rdquo; function to add
these values to <b  >@names</b> and
<b  >@votes</b>, respectively, which are built up with
every iteration through votes.txt. If there are four candidates in
votes.txt, this loop is executed four times, and
<b  >@names</b> and <b  >@votes</b> each has
four elements.</p><p>When we exit from the loop, we create
<b  >@data</b> by inserting references to
<b  >@names</b> and <b  >@votes</b>. As always,
the first element of <b  >@data</b> is an array reference
containing the names. Subsequent elements of
<b  >@data</b> contain values; in this case, we have only
one value, <b  >@votes</b>. We create the graph by
creating an instance of <b  >GIFgraph::pie</b> and then
plotting it to the user's browser.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1eff580.0x23f1748"></a>Retrieving Data from a Database</h2></div></div><p>The above example introduced us to the notion of creating a
chart based on data stored on disk. While this is certainly the
right idea, storing such data in a text file has its drawbacks. It
is more common and more useful to put such data in a relational
database.</p><p>Creating a chart based on a table in a relational database is
not very different from creating one based on a text file. The main
difference is with the loop we use to iterate over our input data.
In vote.pl, we iterated over each line of votes.txt, turning each
line of text into a name,value pair, which we then added to
<b  >@data</b>. When we retrieve information from a
database, the information is already split into name,value pairs
for us.</p><p>Before we can begin to write db-vote.pl (a database version
of vote.pl), we must create a table in our database. As usual, I
will use MySQL, a &ldquo;mostly free&rdquo; database described in Resources.
MySQL's syntax is standard enough for most purposes, and most of
the following should work with other databases as well.</p><p>Relational databases expect to receive input in SQL, the
&ldquo;structured query language&rdquo;. SQL is not a programming
language&mdash;so while we can create all sorts of queries to manipulate
data in our table, we must embed those queries within a program
written in a full programming language. Perl's DBI (&ldquo;database
interface&rdquo;) module allows us to embed SQL statements inside our
Perl programs.</p><p>We can create a new table by issuing the following SQL
command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
CREATE TABLE Votes (
         candidate_name VARCHAR(30),
         votes_received BIGINT UNSIGNED
         );
</pre><p>While we could send the above to our database server from
within a Perl program, it is more usual to type it directly from
within an interactive database client. MySQL comes with an
interactive client called <span   class="bold"><b>mysql</b></span>
which allows you to send queries to the database (and receive
responses) without having to embed your statements inside a Perl
program.
</p><p>After you issue the above SQL query, the database server will
create a new table, Votes, with two columns. The first column,
<b  >candidate_name</b>, allows for up to 30 characters.
The second column is defined to be a <b  >BIGINT
UNSIGNED</b>, that is, a large integer. We name this column
<b  >votes_received</b>.</p><p>We will now take a leap of faith and assume that, after the
polls close on election night, our database table will magically be
filled with appropriate values for each candidate. (In a real
application, we would probably design things differently, storing
each candidate's name in a second table and perhaps even storing
each vote in its own row. We will ignore real-world concerns for
the time being, so as to concentrate on how to create a graph with
this data.)</p><p>Assuming our table has been populated with a list of
candidates' names and their votes, how can we rewrite vote.pl so it
takes its input from a database? As mentioned above, we will rely
on DBI, Perl's database interface, which provides a uniform,
object-oriented interface to most popular relational databases.
Each database is described in a DBD, or database driver, and is
imported automatically when we open a connection.</p><p>Opening a connection to the database creates a &ldquo;database
handle&rdquo; object, traditionally called <b  >$dbh</b>. We
use this object to create a &ldquo;statement handle&rdquo;, traditionally
called <b  >$sth</b>, with which we send the SQL to the
database server. Our query, in this case, is rather simple:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
SELECT candidate_name, votes_received
    FROM Votes
</pre><p>When it executes this query, the database server will return
a two-column table to the user&mdash;in this particular case, the entire
contents of the Votes table. Each row of the table corresponds to a
line in the text file votes.txt which we saw earlier.
</p><p>DBI provides us with a number of methods by which to retrieve
data from <b  >$sth</b>. The most commonly used methods
retrieve a row as an array, either in its usual form (using
<b  >$sth-&gt;fetchrow_array</b>) or as a reference
(using <b  >$sth-&gt;fetchrow_arrayref</b>). While the
<span   class="bold"><b>arrayref</b></span> method is more efficient,
beginning Perl programmers often prefer to avoid references, which
sometimes confuse them. In both cases, the order of elements in the
returned list is determined by the order in which columns were
named in the query.</p><p><a href="3579l4.html" target="_self">Listing 4.</a></p><p>The rest of db-vote.pl (see Listing 4) continues in almost
the same way as vote.pl, pushing the values in each row onto
<b  >@names</b> and <b  >@values</b>, then
using those to create <b  >@data</b>.</p><p>It is generally preferable to put such information in a
database, because of the reliability and flexibility offered by
relational databases. Remember, though, there is no free lunch: a
relational database is inherently much slower than a flat ASCII
text file. Moreover, our CGI program opens a connection to the
database each time it is invoked, an expensive and time-consuming
operation. For these reasons, vote.pl will almost certainly execute
faster than db-vote.pl. Whether this is an appropriate trade-off
depends on the number of visitors to your site, as well as the
nature of your web applications.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1eff580.0x23f22f8"></a>Modifying the Graph</h2></div></div><p>Now that you have seen how to create simple graphs based on
various inputs, let us spend a few moments discussing how you can
modify the outputs. GIFgraph allows you to change just about every
aspect of the graph, including the colors, placement and style of
the legend, and the way in which the axes are marked. This is done
with the <span   class="bold"><b>set</b></span> method. Of course,
certain settings are active for only certain types of graphs; for
instance, there are no axes on a pie chart, meaning that setting
the axis labels will be meaningless.</p><p>Here is one example invocation of set:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$graph-&gt;set(x_label =&gt; "Candidates",
        y_label =&gt; "Number of votes",
        title =&gt; "Voting results",
     logo =&gt; "corplogo.gif",
     zero_axis =&gt; 1);
</pre><p>The GIFgraph manual page, available by typing
<b  >perldoc&nbsp;GIFgraph</b> after installing the
package, describes these and many other options in detail. However,
the above is probably a good starting point and demonstrates how
the various factors describing a chart can be set. In the above
example, we label the X axis <b  >Candidates</b>, the Y
axis <b  >Number of votes</b>, include our corporate logo
on the chart, and ensure the axes will always begin at the origin
(0, 0). There are also options to choose colors and fonts, as well
as define how often ticks should appear on each axis&mdash;if you read
the manual, you will likely be overwhelmed by the wealth of
options.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1eff580.0x23f2668"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>As you can see, it is not particularly difficult to create
graphics on the fly from within our CGI program. Even more
impressive&mdash;as well as generally useful&mdash;is the ability to create
many types of charts and graphs in only a few lines of code.</p><p>Next month, we will take a further look at dynamically
generated graphics, looking at a simple application that tracks a
user's stock portfolio. That application will revisit two topics we
discussed last month, namely HTTP cookies and saving state to a
database.</p></div></div>
