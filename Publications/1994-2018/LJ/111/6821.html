Linux platform choices are better than ever.</p><p>by Don Marti</p><p>
Running Linux makes you smarter, and we've got proof. In his
article on Nagios on page 52, Richard C. Harlan explains how John
Deere integrated its diverse server management needs under the
thumb of one Linux-based project, for a small budget.</p><p>Other cluetrain-riding people at a variety of companies
talked to Doc Searls about the new balance of innovation power
between informed Linux-using customers and their vendors (page 38).
Freedom is changing companies behind the scenes, and thanks to your
discreet tips, Doc is watching it better than anyone.</p><p>This issue also includes the year's best Linux hardware news
so far. The big cheeses of the information technology industry are
building servers based on AMD's new AMD64 architecture, which you
may know as <b  >linux/arch/x86_64</b>. In an interview
on tazaa.info, AMD CEO Hector Ruiz included Linux as one of only
two &ldquo;operating systems that matter&rdquo;, and our favorite OS was the
first one released for AMD64.</p><p>You can get an idea of AMD64's abilities, and those of the
Newisys two-way server that's among the first Opteron products on
the market, in Michael Baxter's first look on page 58. Michael is
the man to ask about Linux in the electronic design automation
industry, and the new AMD architecture is already attracting
attention from Cadence and others as a way to replace expensive
64-bit RISC UNIX.</p><p>Our other featured hardware article this issue covers
Microsoft's Xbox video game system. On page 44, Michael Steil
explains how making the Xbox run Linux is not only fun but actually
useful. Try it. Upgrading an Xbox is a great way to learn about the
boot process and is cheaper than a single-board computer for
hobbyist embedded projects. Cut back on the coffee the day you
solder those two little pads together, though.</p><p>If your web site uses free software exclusively, you might
not realize how big of a deal CMF for Zope (page 14) really is.
Proprietary content management systems have high-priced licenses
and <span   class="emphasis"><em>still</em></span> require you to do substantial
customizing. This might be the article that makes you a web hero at
work, so pay attention.</p><p>This issue also hosts a cross-platform development-tool cage
bout. Will your next project use the promising new Mono (page 74)
or the reliable wxWindows (page 90)? Both are free as in Dmitry, so
you can easily try both. Finally, contributor Josh Rabinowitz told
me that he got hooked on using the man page index, shown in his
article &ldquo;How to Index Anything&rdquo; (page 82), before he was even
done with the article. Imagine searching all your man pages,
<i  >Linux Journal</i> archive CDs and old mail with
one tool. I'm going to try it out.</p></div></div>
