The fact that many items on your tech wish list have yet to find
their way to Best Buy doesn't mean you can't find a workaround. One
of the biggest benefits of using open-source tools is not having to
wait for other people to give you what you want. While Doc Searls
and others keep their eyes on the big vendors and suppliers,
wondering when the customer will gain the upper hand, our web
authors have been supplying us with articles about what we can do
for ourselves in the meantime.</p><p>Take, for example, Linux on the laptop. Other than the recent
availability of the Lindows MobilePC
(<a href="../000/6662.html" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/6662</a>),
the options for using Linux on one's laptop have been limited, to
say the least. Between system incompatibilities and lack of
support, getting Linux up and running may seem next to impossible
for many. To this end, Jay Docherty has been writing a web series
for us that takes people from the purchasing phase to setting up
GNOME, selecting themes and enabling sound. &ldquo;Configuring Your
Laptop for GNOME and Sound&rdquo;
(<a href="../000/6809.html" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/6809</a>)
explains how to install GNOME 2.2 for Debian, configure support for
the i810 chipset, change themes and set up a USB mouse on the
laptop.</p><p>Another example of assuming responsibility for one's own
needs is Roberto de Leo's article, &ldquo;Self-Hosting Movies with
MoviX&rdquo;
(<a href="../000/6474.html" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/6474</a>).
de Leo wanted to find a &ldquo;Linux CD mini-distribution that is able
to boot and play automatically all audio/video files on the CD&rdquo;.
His internet search for such a CD proved fruitless, so he decided
to build it himself. The result is MoviX, which fulfilled his need
for a dedicated CD mini-distribution. His step-by-step creation
article, however, can be adapted for whatever purpose your
mini-distribution might serve.</p><p>The quest to have the coolest, fastest, quietest and, simply,
ultimate Linux box leaves one with no option other than to build it
oneself. Without a doubt, one of <i  >Linux Journal</i>'s most popular yearly features is the Ultimate
Linux Box (ULB) article, where we lay out the components of our
dream machine and the reasons why it's so dreamy. This year, we're
doing things a little differently in the spirit of community
collaboration. We're using the web site as a launching pad for the
ULB conception. Articles will be posted naming the contenders in
each area. Glenn Stone started the discussion with &ldquo;Ultimate Linux
Box: a Case Study&rdquo;,
(<a href="../000/6764.html" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/6764</a>).
We're asking for your input, in the form of e-mail to the authors
and postings on the article web page, to help make the final
decisions. Don't wait until the final ULB is unveiled to tell us
where our mistakes are; speak up now.</p><p>If you have taken matters into your hands to get what you
want for Linux, send article ideas to
<a href="mailto:info@linuxjournal.com">info@linuxjournal.com</a>. Be
sure to visit the <i  >LJ</i> web site often; new
articles are posted every day.</p></div></div>
