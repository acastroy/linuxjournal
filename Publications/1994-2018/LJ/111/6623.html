    Mono is useful for more than simply getting Linux to work
    with Microsoft's .NET. It offers you a chance to use
    libraries in one language from another without writing a
    wrapper.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2581580.0x2679660"></a></h2></div></div><p>If you have ever written an application
for the Linux desktop, or even looked into writing one, you are
familiar with the multitude of language bindings available for the
various GUI toolkits. This is one of the strengths of writing GUI
applications for Linux; you are not locked in to a particular
programming language. Unfortunately, you quickly come to realize
that different language bindings offer varying amounts of API
completeness. A widget you used from one language isn't yet
supported when using a different language. This is the downside of
supporting multiple languages. The amount of work needed to
maintain an API increases with each set of bindings. A change or
update to the original API must be replicated in each of the
language wrappers.
</p><p>Now imagine a single GUI toolkit, accessible from any
programming language without having to rely on API wrappers&mdash;a
toolkit that offers the same functionality to every language that
uses it. Mono has the potential to provide this, plus much more, by
offering programming language independence as well as programming
language interaction.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2581580.0x26797c0"></a>Brief History</h2></div></div><p>Life for Mono began about two years ago at the Linux software
company Ximian, Inc. Ximian is known for their Ximian Desktop,
Evolution PIM/e-mail client, Red Carpet upgrade system and
enthusiastic CTO Miguel de Icaza. Recognizing the potential in a
couple of newly proposed standards, Miguel de Icaza began
prototyping what would later become the Mono Project.</p><p>So what were these standards that caught Miguel de Icaza's
eye? It's no secret that they were ECMA-334 and ECMA-335, the
specifications for the core technologies in Microsoft's .NET
development platform. At this point, it probably is important to
point out that there is a difference between the .NET development
platform and the blanket term &ldquo;.NET&rdquo;. Microsoft covers a whole
slew of products and services, including operating systems,
development tools, network services and applications, with the
expansive .NET term. We are concerned with only a portion of
.NET.</p><p>In October 2000, Microsoft, Hewlett-Packard and Intel jointly
submitted the specifications for a runtime environment known as the
Common Language Infrastructure (CLI) and a newly developed
object-oriented language named C#. By the second half of 2001,
Ximian officially had launched the Mono Project to provide an
open-source implementation of the .NET development platform based
on the proposed standards. In December 2001, the European Computer
Manufacturing Association (ECMA) officially ratified as standards
the specifications for the CLI and C# language.</p><p><a href="6623s1.html" target="_self">Sidebar: Brief Introduction to
C#</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2581580.0x2679a28"></a>Overview</h2></div></div><p>The CLI lays out a base class library and a runtime
environment that provides services such as Just In Time (JIT)
compilation, memory management, exception handling, loading and
linking and security management. To illustrate this better, it
helps to compare it to the traditional method of compiling source
code.</p><p>Traditionally, source code is converted by the compiler to
machine-specific instructions. The instructions are then executed
directly on the processor. A program compiled for the x86 processor
line will fail to execute on a PPC processor without first being
recompiled for that processor. This makes it difficult for software
to target multiple hardware platforms, as a different version of
compiled code must be kept for each one.</p><p>As an alternative, source compiled for a runtime environment
is converted to an intermediate set of instructions that are not
dependent on the underlying hardware. The intermediate instructions
then can be executed in a couple of different ways. One method is
to use a interpreter. The interpreter loads the intermediate
instructions and then executes them, in essence acting as a virtual
machine. In a second method, the intermediate form is JIT-compiled
at runtime or installation time into machine-specific instructions
and then executed directly. Because JIT compiling executes native
platform instructions, compiling can be optimized for the target
processor. The JIT compiler can increase execution speed further by
converting only the portions that are being used into native
instructions and then storing those in memory for subsequent
calls.</p><p>The trade-off for having the platform independence of using a
runtime environment is in execution speed. Compared to the
traditional method of compiling to native instructions, the runtime
is slower. How much slower depends on the specific situation and
which method of execution the runtime uses. Generally though, an
interpreter provides the slowest execution speed. The performance
of a JIT compiler is much closer to the performance of traditional
compiling because both produce native instructions. The overhead of
the runtime itself still keeps the speed performance slightly
behind.</p><p>I know what you are thinking. An object-oriented language, a
base class library, a runtime environment&mdash;this sounds a lot like
Java. Well, you are right. The components of the CLI are very
similar to those found in Java. However, there is one fundamental
difference. The Java runtime was designed only for the Java
language. Although it is true that a handful of other languages
have been ported to output Java bytecode and run on the JVM, this
still falls short of the language neutrality supported by the CLI.
From the ground up, the CLI was designed to be the execution
environment for many programming languages. The data type system of
the CLI can support imperative languages, like C or Pascal, as well
as object-oriented languages. Not only does the CLI have facilities
to execute multiple languages (language independence), it also
provides the framework to allow those languages to share data with
each other (language interaction), including cross-language
exception handling. An object created in one language can be
inherited in another. Details of how the CLI achieves this level of
language neutrality can be found by examining its core
components.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2581580.0x2679c90"></a>Common Type System</h2></div></div><p>At the heart of the CLI is the Common Type System (CTS). The
CTS defines a shared data type system and the rules used in
declaring, using and managing the types. By employing a strictly
enforced type system, the CLI can ensure that type safety is
maintained as well as make it possible for languages to
interoperate with types of another language. In order to
accommodate a multitude of different programming languages, the CTS
furnishes two main data types that contain multiple subtypes,
values (value types) and objects (reference types). Values are
reserved for representing simple data types such as integers and
floating-point values. Objects are used for the more complex
entities required by programming languages.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2581580.0x2679d98"></a>Common Language Specification</h2></div></div><p>The Common Language Specification (CLS) outlines the
framework compilers must adhere to when generating libraries and
binaries for cross-language interaction. The CLS is actually a
subset of the CTS, providing a reasonable type system and rules a
language compiler must support in order to produce compiled code
that can be used or extended by other languages. A language has the
ability to choose how much of the CLS to support. Languages that
allow any CLS type to be used are called CLS consumers. Languages
that allow CLS types to be created or extended are called CLS
extenders. A language that fully embraces the CLS is both a
consumer and extender.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2581580.0x2679ea0"></a>Metadata and the Common Intermediate
Language</h2></div></div><p>When a source file is compiled by a CLI-compliant compiler, a
binary file called a portable executable (PE) or sometimes referred
to as an assembly, though an assembly can consist of one or more
files, is output. The PE contains two important pieces of
information. The first is metadata. Metadata is used to describe
the types used as well as information the CLI uses to locate and
load classes, lay out memory and other execution-time information.
The second piece is the Common Intermediate Language (CIL)
bytecode. CIL is a language-independent set of intermediate
instructions. When a language is compiled for the CLI, CIL bytecode
is produced. CIL is robust enough to to handle a myriad of
different programming languages and is designed to be converted
efficiently to native platform instructions. A snippet of CIL
instructions for a &ldquo;hello world&rdquo; program written in C# can be
seen in Listing 1.</p><p><a href="6623l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1. Part of a Disassembled C#
Program Showing the CIL Instruction Set</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2581580.0x267a058"></a>Virtual Execution System</h2></div></div><p>The Virtual Execution System (VES) provides the environment
for executing programs written for the CLI. It loads, links,
manages memory, handles security and exceptions and provides the
support framework for executing CIL instructions.</p><p>The memory management supplied by the CLI is administered by
a garbage collector (GC). Unlike other runtime environments, the GC
of the CLI can be switched on and off within the source code. The
data allocated and destroyed by the GC is called managed data. When
the GC is not used on data, it is referred to as unmanaged data.
Managed code, source code executed by the CLI, can access both
managed and unmanaged data.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2581580.0x267a1b8"></a>Mono</h2></div></div><p>The goal of the Mono Project is twofold. First, it provides
an implementation of the ECMA standards for the CLI and C#. Second,
it adds compatibility with the Microsoft .NET development platform.
Each part has its own intrinsic value and benefits Linux in
different ways. If, for example, .NET compatibility was no longer
available, Mono would remain a valuable development framework for
Linux.</p><p>However, by adding .NET compatibility to the Linux platform,
Mono makes software developed for Windows available to Linux. Along
the same line of thought, developers wishing to make the transition
to Linux application development will have access to a development
framework with which they are already familiar, thereby lowering
the learning-curve barrier.</p><p>The major portions of .NET that the Mono Project is working
on delivering are Win Forms (System.Windows.Forms), ADO.NET and
ASP.NET. Win Forms contain all the necessary methods, classes and
events for creating GUI applications compatible with Microsoft
Windows. Because it is nearly impossible to emulate the Windows GUI
API calls with native Linux GUI toolkits, Mono is using WineLib
(<a href="http://www.winehq.com" target="_self">www.winehq.com</a>) to
provide the Windows interface. If you have ever seen an application
running in Wine, you know it looks nothing like Linux desktop
environments. To solve this, Mono is looking to add theming support
to Wine to use the same rendering routines for the widgets as the
rest of the desktop.</p><p>ADO.NET contains the .NET data access classes for Mono.
ADO.NET offers more than mere database access. It provides a model
for accessing data from any source in a disconnected, scalable
method based on XML. At the time of this writing, about a dozen
databases are working as Mono ADO.NET data providers. Work
continues to increase the maturity and add additional database
vendor support.</p><p>ASP.NET support in Mono is divided into two parts, web forms
and web services. Web forms create the user interface for a web
application. Much like Win Forms, web forms provide properties,
methods and events for controls such as buttons, text boxes or
complex controls made of multiple simple controls. This allows web
form interfaces to be created in rapid application development
(RAD) environments using drag-and-drop techniques similar to Glade
on GNOME. This separates the presentation from the logic and
lessens the amount of coding needed. Web services offer SOAP-based
remote procedure call support. Using ubiquitous internet protocols
like XML and HTTP, web services allow the sharing of data or logic
over the network and even through firewalls. Any language supported
by the CLI can be used to program the logic for ASP.NET. This also
means that ASP.NET code is compiled and not interpreted like
previous versions of ASP and other web-scripting languages. ASP.NET
is available for Mono in either the XSP web server or in the
mod_mono component for Apache 2.</p><p>In addition to the Mono class libraries implementing .NET,
several other libraries and tools offer interesting and useful
functionality:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>GTK#, Qt# and Wx.NET provide C# bindings for the
popular Linux GUI toolkits. With these C# wrappers, all languages
that can run on Mono have access to the same GUI toolkits:</p></li><li><p>OpenGL#, MonoGLo and CsGL provide bindings for the
popular 2-D/3-D graphics API OpenGL.</p></li><li><p>SDL.NET provides bindings for the SDL game
library.</p></li><li><p>Gst# Gstreamer multimedia framework
bindings.</p></li><li><p>Many communication libraries, including .NET Jabber
and Gnutella.</p></li><li><p>NAnt build tool (similar to Ant).</p></li></ul></div><p>Of course, these are only a few examples, but they're enough
to illustrate the potential for developing with Mono for Linux and
other platforms.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2581580.0x267a9a0"></a>Using Mono</h2></div></div><p>The first step in taking Mono out for a test spin is to visit
the project web site
(<a href="http://www.go-mono.com" target="_self">www.go-mono.com</a>) and
download the latest source tarballs or platform binaries.
Currently, Mono has been ported only to Linux and Windows, but work
is being done on Mac OS X, FreeBSD and other platforms. Binaries
are available for a variety of Linux distributions including
Debian, Red Hat, SuSE and Mandrake. If you use Ximian Red Carpet,
the files also are available in the Mono Channel. For this article,
we are using Mono version 0.20. You'll notice that in addition to
the Mono packages providing the runtime, C# compiler and class
libraries, there are a few other goodies to play with such as the
Mono debugger, XSP web server and Monodoc documentation
browser.</p><p>If you have trouble installing Mono, check out the tutorials
offered on the web site.</p><p>Mono currently comes packaged with the following
components:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>C# and Basic language compilers.</p></li><li><p>VES consisting of a JIT compiler and associated
garbage collector, security system, class loader, verifier and
threading system. An interpreter is also included.</p></li><li><p>A set of class libraries written in C# that
implements the classes defined in the CLI standard, classes that
are part of the .NET FCL, and other Mono-specific classes.</p></li><li><p>Various utilities.</p></li></ul></div><p>The Mono C# language compiler is mcs. In an interesting
programming feat, mcs is written in C#. Since Mono 0.10, mcs even
has been able to compile itself. If you are interested in the
details of the command-line options, which are compatible with the
command-line options provided by Microsoft's C# compiler, a
thorough man page is available.</p><p>The compiler for Mono's equivalent of Visual Basic.NET,
MonoBasic, is mbas. Although not as far in development as the C#
compiler, mbas provides enough functionality to experiment a little
in Basic.</p><p>Two execution environments are included with Mono, mono and
mint. mono is a JIT compiler compatible with the CLI's definition
of the VES. mint on the other hand, is an interpreter. It is
provided as an easy-to-port alternative to mono, which currently
runs only on the x86 platform. For the greatest code execution
speed, use mono.</p><p>A couple interesting utilities also provided with Mono are
monodis and pedump. monodis is used to disassemble a compiled
assembly and output the corresponding CIL code. It was used to
display the sample CIL code for Listing 1. If you are curious to
see more of what CIL looks like or to take a peek at what makes up
a portable executable, play around with these.</p><p>Now that we are familiar with the components of Mono, it is
time to try them out. To experiment with the language interaction
of Mono, we write a simple class with a single method in C# and
call it from a MonoBasic program.</p><p>Listing 2 shows the C# library ljlib.cs, and Listing 3 shows
the MonoBasic program hello.vb.</p><p><a href="6623l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2. ljlib.cs</a></p><p><a href="6623l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3. hello.vb</a></p><p>The first step is to compile the ljlib.cs into a library.
Compiled libraries have the .dll extension, and compiled
executables have the .exe extension. To compile to a library, use
the -target:library switch in mcs:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
[jdq@newton]$ mcs -target:library ljlib.cs
Compilation succeeded
</pre><p>This creates the ljlib.dll file, which contains the <i  >LJ</i>lib
namespace and Output class. Now we need to compile the hello.vb
program. In order to use the ljlib.dll file we just created, we
need to tell the MonoBasic compiler to use it as a reference. We do
that with the -r switch:
<pre     class="programlisting">
[jdq@newton]$ mbas -r ./ljlib.dll hello.vb
Compilation succeeded
</pre>


The output of mbas is the PE hello.exe. It can be executed with
mono:
<pre     class="programlisting">
[jdq@newton]$ mono hello.exe
Hello <i  >Linux Journal</i>!
</pre>


And there you have it&mdash;two languages, C# and MonoBasic, executing
on the same runtime and working together. This is a trivial
example; however, it does demonstrate the language independence and
interoperability of the CLI and hints at the power of Mono as a
development platform.
