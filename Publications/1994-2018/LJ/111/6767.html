    John Deere had to expand network management across a diverse
    collection of hardware and software. Nagios saved the day.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2076580.0x216e6b8"></a></h2></div></div><p>When I started with the John Deere
Agricultural Marketing Center, we had 12 sites around the US and
Canada. These locations had a mixture of equipment, older servers
and desktops providing all functions from domain services to
printing. That presented a problem to us functioning as a
centralized IT organization. How could we manage and monitor the
servers and WAN lines in these diverse sites?
</p><p>About two years ago, we decided to move the user data from
the center of our network out to the edges. But how could we
monitor all the equipment from multiple manufacturers across all
the sites? To give you an idea of the equipment we were monitoring,
each of our main sites had a Maxtor 4100 network-attached storage
(NAS) server along with a Compaq 1600 serving as a print server and
domain controller. Some of the small sites had Dell GX1 desktops
serving as local print servers. At our main site, a Compaq
TaskSmart N2400 was our main file server.</p><p>Because of this diverse setup, no manufacturer's management
toolset served our needs, and the idea of using multiple tools to
monitor everything was not something I wanted to do. So, we had to
choose among manufacturer-neutral monitoring tools. What we found
seemed to be grouped into three different tiers. At the low end was
a solution that did not expand well to monitor a growing number of
servers and hosts. For the most part, we would be stuck with the
tools that came with the program. Other tools were what I call
top-of-the-line products, such as Hewlett-Packard's OpenView. It
would expand and grow with what we needed and monitor what we
wanted, but it had a price tag well out of our range.</p><p>As we started to lose faith that anything existed to fit our
situation, I ran across a project called NetSaint. NetSaint was a
monitoring system that would grow with our needs and allow us to
monitor what we wanted with an open framework allowing us to write
our own plugins. Not only would NetSaint monitor servers and
services, it enabled us to make our jobs more proactive instead of
reactive by following the trends it showed us.</p><p>Everything went along fine, with NetSaint performing its job
reliably in one of the smaller units of John Deere. As time went
on, the Agricultural Division started an IT divisionalization
project, with the goal being the ability to leverage areas of
expertise all across the division.</p><p>With this new project, the old problem of monitoring
resurfaced. As we tried to move to a more centralized IT structure,
we needed to perform everything the other monitoring programs did.
Also, every unit was on its own to make IT decisions to fit its
needs. So the question was: How would we take the multiple
monitoring solutions in use and move toward one standard solution?
This solution would need be able to handle the possibility of
monitoring hundreds of hosts with thousands of services, while
allowing individual units to extract data into graphs to monitor
trends. Also problematic was an even more diverse set of equipment
to monitor, from Network Appliance to Sun to Dell.</p><p>We still had the financial constraint, which meant the
OpenView class of products was out of our range. Because we were
running NetSaint in a production environment, we decided to go
ahead and start looking into a NetSaint solution for the Ag
Division. The first thing I learned was if you stop following the
Open Source community for a while, a lot will have changed when you
come back. In this case, NetSaint was no more; its descendant is
Nagios (<a href="http://www.nagios.org" target="_self">www.nagios.org</a>).
For the most part, Nagios is the next step in the NetSaint
evolution. I confess to some sadness seeing the penguin removed
from the main page, but I got used to it and moved on.</p><p>Studying the system, we decided to use a multi-tier model,
with Nagios servers at each unit that came onboard with the
monitoring project. This was mainly to ensure that no one server
would be overloaded, allowing us to maintain the level of
monitoring we needed. With this in mind, we installed the parent
server at our headquarters in Moline, Illinois, with the first
child server in our Ag Marketing location in Lenexa, Kansas.</p><p>The install of Nagios was the same for both the parent server
and the child server. We loaded Red Hat 8 on both and then
installed Nagios. The documentation that comes with the system is
fairly complete and walks you through the install process easily.
Along with Nagios, we installed a program called Nagat on each of
the servers (Figure 1). Nagat is a web-based configuration tool for
Nagios. With this install, the system allows you to fill in the
blanks on the web page and generates the configuration files based
on your answers. Therefore, less-experienced people can configure
Nagios, its services and hosts without touching a terminal
window.</p><p>

</p><p>Because we used Nagat, we ran into some difficulties with our
Red Hat 8 install. To fix the compatibility problems, we had to
install earlier versions of PHP (4.1.2) and Apache (1.3). With this
resolved, we were able to get the systems up and running quite
quickly. Nagat had a few bugs that were easy to work out, one
occurring on the service edit page: the system does not save the
contact group. To fix this, all you have to do is add the following
lines after the case statement on line 39:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$saveobject['contact_groups'] =
    @implode("'",$saveobject['contact_groups']);
</pre><p>By doing this, you will be able to save changes to your
contact groups when you update your services.
</p><p>Once everything was installed, we came to what I would call
the hardest part of the whole project&mdash;the configuration of the
servers. It wasn't so much configuring the server as it was
figuring out what we wanted our system to do and the path to take
to get it done. One of the first decisions we made&mdash;one we now are
reversing&mdash;was to compile Nagios without native database support.
It met our needs for over a year, but as we bring more units onto
the Nagios monitoring platform, mining the data provided from
Nagios is becoming more of a priority. No longer are the simple
graphs that come with Nagios enough. We want to take the data and
trend it out in as many ways as there are units and people, which
was not all that easy to do with the flat text files we had with
our original Nagios install.</p><p>The next step was the main configuration, which for the most
part is really straightforward. There are a few things you need to
look into and explore a little to get the most out of the Nagios
system. One of them is the idea of smart checks. Instead of the
system running all of your service checks at the same time, causing
high CPU utilization, Nagios spreads out the checks over, say, five
minutes, causing lower CPU utilization. Another thing to look at is
the parallelized service checks; they allow you to run more than
one service check at a time, which really helps on systems with
multiple CPUs.</p><p>The configurations of the parent and child servers are almost
identical, with two important differences. The child server has
notification turned off and the active checks turned on by default,
and the parent server has the exact opposite. This is done to lower
the load on the parent server and to have all notifications sent
out from only one computer. [The configuration files for both
servers are available at
<a href="../listings/111/6767.tgz" target="_self">ftp.linuxjournal.com/pub/lj/listings/issue111/6767.tgz</a>.]</p><p>From there, the next step is defining the commands Nagios
should perform. This is one thing I stress to the people using this
system: Nagios is a framework. What I mean is, Nagios itself does
not perform any checks; that work is left to the plugins that
Nagios can call. This is good because it allows you to write your
own plugins easily, as long as you stick to the framework Nagios
provides. As a result of the plugins we have written, we have the
ability to monitor systems that were not originally in the Nagios
plugin distribution. For example, we now are able to monitor NetApp
filers, to pull the page counts from our HP printers and to
integrate Compaq Insight Manager data into the Nagios
system.</p><p>The easy way to monitor a Microsoft Windows server, but not
the only way, is to use NSClient. NSClient is a program loaded on
your Windows boxes, and it runs as a service. To run it, open up a
port on the Windows server. For security, you can use a password to
access the port. At the time of this writing, no encryption is
built in to the program for talking to the Nagios server. The
plugin allows you to poll the server for memory utilization, disk
utilization, processor load and most other information that can be
polled using the performance manager tool with Windows.</p><p>A slightly different method is used to monitor your Linux and
UNIX systems. Run a program called Nagios Service Check Acceptor
(NSCA), either in d&aelig;mon mode or under inetd. With this
program, Nagios starts a plugin called check_nsca, which opens an
encrypted session between the two computers and runs the plugin to
check the other computer. The configuration of the system is rather
straightforward; pick an encryption standard between the two
servers and define the plugin command on the client. Once this is
done, you can start pulling the data back into Nagios.</p><p>As I said earlier, we are now in the process of moving from
the flat files that are the default for Nagios to a back-end
database. We plan to use that data to provide better data trending
through the use of tools such as Crystal Reports. Nagios provides
native support for two databases, MySQL and PostgreSQL. Scripts are
provided with the Nagios files for setting up the database and
preparing all the fields and tables for Nagios. We decided to use
PostgreSQL. Once the database is all set up, you need to rerun the
configuration script with <b  >--with-mysql-xdata</b> or
<b  >--with-pgsql-xdata</b>. <b  >xdata</b>
sets up the system to use the database for everything. As of right
now, the only pieces that do not support the database are the
configuration files.</p><p>That last statement brings up an interesting point: an add-on
came out in March 2003, a Webmin plugin for Nagios (Figure 2),
called NagMIN. Not only does it allow web-based configuration of
Nagios, like Nagat, it offers a few things that nothing else has
offered so far. First, it offers database support of the Nagios
configuration files. Second, something quite useful if you are
starting to set up your Nagios install, is the port scan feature
(Figure 3). I have not tried out this feature fully yet, but it
claims to perform a network discovery and turn what it finds into
Nagios configuration files, saving you the trouble of having to
enter all the data yourself. NagMIN should work with most systems,
but the more-specialized monitoring most likely still has to be
entered into the system by hand. If you would like more information
about this plugin, go to the SourceForge.net web page.</p><p>

</p><p>We set up our Nagios server in a parent/child relationship.
To do this, the system needs to be set up a little differently from
what it would be for a standalone system. For one thing, we
installed only the web interface on the parent server (Figures 4
and 5). All the child servers do is funnel their check results to
the parent server using passive checks. To make this work, we
defined an OCSP command to run a script to submit the data to the
parent Nagios server. By using the OCSP command to run the script,
it is made to execute after every check that Nagios runs. Because
of this, for the most part, only the child servers need to run
active checks. This allows the Nagios parent server to run only the
web interface and to send out notifications in case of
problems.</p><p>

</p><p>Now that you have an idea of how we set up Nagios, let me
tell you about something it has done for us. Around the first of
this year we purchased a digital thermometer, called TempTrax, that
works with Nagios. We use it to take temperature readings of our
main computer room. Around the first of March, we learned how
important Nagios is to us. I received a page at about
12<b  >AM</b> on a Friday telling me there was a warning
on the computer room temperature. In the time it took me to get
dressed, the system started sending out critical pages about the
computer room temperature. By the time I got to work, the
temperature was above 80&deg; and rising. Because of Nagios, I had
enough time to make an emergency call to our air-conditioning
people and have the unit repaired before any serious damage was
done to the computers. We found out later that two other systems
monitoring the computer room A/C unit had failed to dial out and
alert the people watching the system. If Nagios had not alerted us
to the problem in the computer room, I would have walked into a
much bigger problem that next morning.</p><p>Overall, I would have to say that Nagios is an excellent
network monitoring product. As described, it is a framework, and by
itself it can't do much&mdash;but that is what makes it such a good
product. Because it is a framework, it does only what you want it
do. Being an open framework, designing new plugins with Nagios is
as simple as formatting the output from your check into the format
that Nagios expects. With this your plugin is able to use
everything Nagios has to offer, which is quite a lot. In the end,
Nagios is something you should at least take a look at, if not test
install at your own location. I do not think you will be
disappointed.</p></div></div>
