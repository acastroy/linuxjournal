7.2 distribution to install a customized version of Linux on
several machines. Currently, I use a floppy drive to boot and store
the ks.cfg file on the floppy, so the syslinux.cfg file has a line
that looks like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
label ks
kernel vmlinuz
append text ks=floppy initrd.img lang=
devfs=nomount ramdisk_size=7168
</pre><p>How do I start the Kickstart installation using a USB
floppy/USB CD-ROM? I can boot using USB floppy/CD-ROM, but the
Kickstart installation fails, as it doesn't find the ks.cfg file
residing on the USB device.
</p><p>&mdash;Vishali Karnik,
<a href="mailto:Vishali.Karnik@respironics.com">Vishali.Karnik@respironics.com</a></p><p>According to their release notes, Red Hat did begin
recognizing USB floppy drives during install with the 7.2 release,
so this should be possible. I don't have a USB floppy drive to test
this, but the helpful people at Fujitsu Siemens Computers have some
advice on how to do Kickstart from USB floppies:
<a href="http://www.fujitsu-siemens.com/partner/linux/readme/driver-disks-redhat.shtm" target="_self">www.fujitsu-siemens.com/partner/linux/readme/driver-disks-redhat.shtm</a>.
USB floppy drives are detected as SCSI devices. If you have no real
SCSI devices on the system, you need to change
<b  >ks=floppy</b> to
<b  >ks=hd:sda/ks.cfg</b>. If that doesn't work, drop to
a shell during a manual install and <b  >cat
/proc/scsi/scsi</b> to see what device name in /dev is being
assigned to the USB floppy. The first device in /proc/scsi/scsi
will be sda, the second will be sdb and so on.</p><p>&mdash;Don Marti,

response to the question regarding telnet [see Best of Technical
Support, <i  >LJ</i>, April 2003]. OpenSSH is indeed an
excellent choice over rlogin and telnet outside a trusted
environment. But inside such a network, rlogin, telnet and the
other r* commands give excellent and much more convenient service
within their respective realms of use. I would not be happy to
retire rlogin and telnet especially where I have to deal with older
systems other than Linux. As ever with security issues, the cost of
protection (embodied, in this case, in the greater complexity and
inconvenience of setting up the secure tool) must be weighed
against the benefits accrued. Simply replacing rlogin and telnet
with SSH is useless unless the network is comprehensively bolted
down and firewalled. Again, if appropriate protection is to be
obtained, a full analysis must be done.</p><p>&mdash;Bob Hepple,
<a href="mailto:bhepple@freeshell.org">bhepple@freeshell.org</a></p><p>You have the option of inserting public keys, for user
authentication, on the servers to which you connect. Or, you simply
can use password authentication. Even if you use password
authentication, the password is protected by symmetric encryption
with SSH. Today's hardware adds an additional wrinkle to security.
Are you sure your broadband router doesn't have a trojan installed
to sniff telnet packets and pass them over the network? Are you
sure your 802.11 wireless bridge isn't passing your telnet packet
over the air? A lot of hardware you have no control over has access
to your data. Mr Hepple's assertion that &ldquo;replacing rlogin and
telnet with SSH is useless unless the network is comprehensively
bolted down&rdquo; is wrong. We always speak in terms of &ldquo;raising the
bar&rdquo; of security and adding &ldquo;layers of an onion&rdquo;. You are
correct, that if a security solution has high cost, one should
perform a threat analysis, but SSH is so easy it is a
no-brainer.</p><p>&mdash;Christopher Wingert,
<a href="mailto:cwingert@qualcomm.com">cwingert@qualcomm.com</a></p><p>Modern distributions include OpenSSH by default,
and make you go through extra effort to run a telnet server.
Thankfully, the convenient choice and the secure choice are the
same. SSH with password authentication is as easy as telnet. With
properly configured keys, it's easier. Check next
month's <i  >Linux Journal</i> for some productivity-boosting
OpenSSH tips. If you need to log in to your Linux system from
another OS, check Rick Moen's list at
