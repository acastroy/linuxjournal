    Bind specific processes to specific processors with a new
    system call.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1945580.0x1a3d608"></a></h2></div></div><p>The ability in Linux to bind one or more
processes to one or more processors, called CPU affinity, is a
long-requested feature. The idea is to say &ldquo;always run this
process on processor one&rdquo; or &ldquo;run these processes on all
processors but processor zero&rdquo;. The scheduler then obeys the
order, and the process runs only on the allowed processors.
</p><p>Other operating systems, such as Windows NT, have long
provided a system call to set the CPU affinity for a process.
Consequently, demand for such a system call in Linux has been high.
Finally, the 2.5 kernel introduced a set of system calls for
setting and retrieving the CPU affinity of a process.</p><p>In this article, I look at the reasons for introducing a CPU
affinity interface to Linux. I then cover how to use the interface
in your programs. If you are not a programmer or if you have an
existing program you are unable to modify, I cover a simple utility
for changing the affinity of a given process using its PID.
Finally, we look at the actual implementation of the system
call.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1945580.0x1a3d7c0"></a>Soft vs. Hard CPU Affinity</h2></div></div><p>There are two types of CPU affinity. The first, soft
affinity, also called natural affinity, is the tendency of a
scheduler to try to keep processes on the same CPU as long as
possible. It is merely an attempt; if it is ever infeasible, the
processes certainly will migrate to another processor. The new O(1)
scheduler in 2.5 exhibits excellent natural affinity. On the
opposite end, however, is the 2.4 scheduler, which has poor CPU
affinity. This behavior results in the ping-pong effect. The
scheduler bounces processes between multiple processors each time
they are scheduled and rescheduled. Table 1 is an example of poor
natural affinity; Table 2 shows what good natural affinity looks
like.</p><p><a href="6799t1.html" target="_self">Table 1. The Ping-Pong
Effect</a></p><p><a href="6799t2.html" target="_self">Table 2. Good
Affinitiy</a></p><p>Hard affinity, on the other hand, is what a CPU affinity
system call provides. It is a requirement, and processes must
adhere to a specified hard affinity. If a processor is bound to CPU
zero, for example, then it can run only on CPU zero.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1945580.0x1a3da80"></a>Why One Needs CPU Affinity</h2></div></div><p>Before we cover the new system calls, let's discuss why
anyone would need such a feature. The first benefit of CPU affinity
is optimizing cache performance. I said the O(1) scheduler tries
hard to keep tasks on the same processor, and it does. But in some
performance-critical situations&mdash;perhaps a large database or a
highly threaded Java server&mdash;it makes sense to enforce the affinity
as a hard requirement. Multiprocessing computers go through a lot
of trouble to keep the processor caches valid. Data can be kept in
only one processor's cache at a time. Otherwise, the processor's
cache may grow out of sync, leading to the question, who has the
data that is the most up-to-date copy of the main memory?
Consequently, whenever a processor adds a line of data to its local
cache, all the other processors in the system also caching it must
invalidate that data. This invalidation is costly and unpleasant.
But the real problem comes into play when processes bounce between
processors: they constantly cause cache invalidations, and the data
they want is never in the cache when they need it. Thus, cache miss
rates grow very large. CPU affinity protects against this and
improves cache performance.</p><p>A second benefit of CPU affinity is a corollary to the first.
If multiple threads are accessing the same data, it might make
sense to bind them all to the same processor. Doing so guarantees
that the threads do not contend over data and cause cache misses.
This does diminish the performance gained from multithreading on
SMP. If the threads are inherently serialized, however, the
improved cache hit rate may be worth it.</p><p>The third and final benefit is found in real-time or
otherwise time-sensitive applications. In this approach, all the
system processes are bound to a subset of the processors on the
system. The specialized application then is bound to the remaining
processors. Commonly, in a dual-processor system, the specialized
application is bound to one processor, and all other processes are
bound to the other. This ensures that the specialized application
receives the full attention of the processor.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1945580.0x1a3dc38"></a>Getting the New System Calls</h2></div></div><p>The system calls are new, so they are not available yet in
all systems. You need at least kernel 2.5.8-pre3 and glibc 2.3.1;
glibc 2.3.0 supports the system calls, but it has a bug. The system
calls are not yet in 2.4, but patches are available at
<a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/rml/cpu-affinity" target="_self">www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/rml/cpu-affinity</a>.</p><p>Many distribution kernels also support the new system calls.
In particular, Red Hat 9 is shipping with both kernel and glibc
support for the new calls. Real-time solutions, such as MontaVista
Linux, also fully support the new interface.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1945580.0x1a3ddf0"></a>Affinity Masks</h2></div></div><p>On most systems, Linux included, the interface for setting
CPU affinity uses a bitmask. A bitmask is a series of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>n</em></span> bits, where each bit individually
corresponds to the status of some other object. For example, CPU
affinity (on 32-bit machines) is represented by a 32-bit bitmask.
Each bit represents whether the given task is bound to the
corresponding processor. Count the bits from right to left, bit 0
to bit 31 and, thus, processor zero to processor 31. For
example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
11111111111111111111111111111111 = 4,294,967,295
</pre><p>is the default CPU affinity mask for all processes. Because
all bits are set, the process can run on any processor. Conversely:
<pre     class="programlisting">
00000000000000000000000000000001 = 1
</pre>


is much more restrictive. Only bit 0 is set, so the process may run
only on processor zero. That is, this affinity mask binds a process
to processor zero.
</p><p>Get it? What do the next two masks equal in decimal? What is
the result of using them as the affinity mask of a process?</p><pre     class="programlisting">
10000000000000000000000000000000
00000000000000000000000000000011
</pre><p>The first is equal to 2,147,483,648 and, because bit 31 is
set, binds the process to processor number 31. The second is equal
to 3, and it binds the process in question to processor zero and
processor one.
</p><p>The Linux CPU affinity interface uses a bitmask like that
shown above. Unfortunately, C does not support binary constants, so
you always have to use the decimal or hexadecimal equivalent. You
may get a compiler warning for very large decimal constants that
set bit 31, but they will work.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1945580.0x1a3e1b8"></a>Using the New System Calls</h2></div></div><p>With the correct kernel and glibc in hand, using the system
calls is easy:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#define _GNU_SOURCE
#include &lt;sched.h&gt;
long
sched_setaffinity(pid_t pid, unsigned int len,
                  unsigned long *user_mask_ptr);
long
sched_getaffinity(pid_t pid, unsigned int len,
                  unsigned long *user_mask_ptr);
</pre><p>The first system call is used to set the affinity of a
process, and the second system call retrieves it.
</p><p>In either system call, the PID argument is the PID of the
process whose mask you wish to set or retrieve. If the PID is set
to zero, the PID of the current task is used.</p><p>The second argument is the length in bytes of the CPU
affinity bitmask, currently four bytes (32 bits). This number is
included in case the kernel ever changes the size of the CPU
affinity mask and allows the system calls to be forward-compatible
with any changes; breaking syscalls is bad form, after all. The
third argument is a pointer to the bitmask itself.</p><p>Let us look at retrieving the CPU affinity of a task:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
unsigned long mask;
unsigned int len = sizeof(mask);
if (sched_getaffinity(0, len, &amp;mask) &lt; 0) {
    perror("sched_getaffinity");
    return -1;
    }
printf("my affinity mask is: %08lx\n", mask);
</pre><p>As a convenience, the returned mask is binary ANDed against
the mask of all processors in the system. Thus, processors in your
system that are not on-line have corresponding bits that are not
set. For example, a uniprocessor system always returns 1 for the
above call (bit 0 is set and no others).
</p><p>Setting the mask is equally easy:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
unsigned long mask = 7; /* processors 0, 1, and 2 */
unsigned int len = sizeof(mask);
if (sched_setaffinity(0, len, &amp;mask) &lt; 0) {
    perror("sched_setaffinity");
}
</pre><p>This example binds the current process to the first three
processors in the system.
</p><p>You then can call sched_getaffinity() to ensure the change
took effect. What does sched_getaffinity() return for the above
setup if you have only two processors? What if you have only one?
The system call fails unless at least one processor in the bitmask
exists. Using a mask of zero always fails. Likewise, binding to
processor seven if you do not have a processor seven will
fail.</p><p>It is possible to retrieve the CPU affinity mask of any
process on the system. You can set the affinity of only the
processes you own, however. Of course, root can set any process'
affinity.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1945580.0x1a3e6e0"></a>I Want a Tool!</h2></div></div><p>If you are not a programmer, or if you cannot modify the
source for whatever reason, you still can bind processes. Listing 1
is the source code for a simple command-line utility to set the CPU
affinity mask of any process, given its PID. As we discussed above,
you must own the process or be root to do this.</p><p><a href="6799l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1. bind</a></p><p>Usage is simple; once you learn the decimal equivalent of the
CPU mask, you need:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
usage: bind <span   class="emphasis"><em>pid</em></span> <span   class="emphasis"><em>cpu_mask</em></span>
</pre><p>As an example, assume we have a dual computer and want to
bind our <span   class="emphasis"><em>Quake</em></span> process (with PID 1600) to
processor two. We would enter the following:
<pre     class="programlisting">
bind 1600 2
</pre>


</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1945580.0x1a3eb00"></a>Getting Really Crafty</h2></div></div><p>In the previous example, we bound <span   class="emphasis"><em>Quake</em></span>
to one of the two processors in our system. To ensure top-notch
frame rates, we need to bind all the other processes on the system
to the other processor. You can do this by hand or by writing a
crafty script, but neither is efficient. Instead, make use of the
fact that CPU affinity is inherited across a fork(). All of a
process' children receive the same CPU affinity mask as their
parent.</p><p>Then, all we need to do is have init bind itself to one
processor. All other processes, by nature of init being the root of
the process tree and thus the superparent of all processes, are
then likewise bound to the one processor.</p><p>The cleanest way to do this type of bind is to hack this
feature into init itself and pass in the desired CPU affinity mask
using the kernel command line. We can accomplish our goal with a
simpler solution, though, without having to modify and recompile
init. Instead, we can edit the system startup script. On most
systems this is /etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit or /etc/rc.sysinit, the first
script run by init. Place the sample bind program in /bin, and add
these lines to the start of rc.sysinit:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/bin/bind 1 1
/bin/bind $$ 1
</pre><p>These lines bind init (whose PID is one) and the current
process to processor zero. All future processes will fork from one
of these two processes and thus inherit the CPU affinity mask. You
then can bind your process (whether it be a real-time nuclear
control system or <span   class="emphasis"><em>Quake</em></span>) to processor one. All
processes will run on processor zero except our special process
(and any children), which will run on processor one. This ensures
that the entire processor is available for our special process.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1945580.0x1a356a8"></a>Kernel Implementation of CPU Affinity</h2></div></div><p>Long before Linus merged the CPU affinity system calls, the
kernel supported and respected a CPU affinity mask. There was no
interface by which user space could set the mask.</p><p>Each process' mask is stored in its task_struct as an
unsigned long, cpus_allowed. The task_struct structure is called
the process descriptor. It stores all the information about a
process. The CPU affinity interface merely reads and writes
cpus_allowed.</p><p>Whenever the kernel attempts to migrate a process from one
processor to another, it first checks to see if the destination
processor's bit is set in cpus_allowed. If the bit is not set, the
kernel does not migrate the process. Further, whenever the CPU
affinity mask is changed, if the process is no longer on an allowed
processor it is migrated to one that is allowed. This ensures the
process begins on a legal processor and can migrate only to a legal
processor. Of course, if it is bound to only a single processor, it
does not migrate anywhere.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1945580.0x1a35860"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>The CPU affinity interface introduced in 2.5 and back-ported
elsewhere provides a simple yet powerful mechanism for controlling
which processes are scheduled onto which processors. Users with
more than one processor may find the system calls useful in
squeezing another drop of performance out of their systems or for
ensuring that processor time is available for even the most
demanding real-time task. Of course, users with only one processor
need not feel left out. They also can use the system calls, but
they aren't going to be too useful.</p><p><a href="6799s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
