    This is the fourth in a series of articles about writing
    character device drivers as loadable kernel modules. This
    month, we further investigate the field of interrupt
    handling. Though it is conceptually simple, practical
    limitations and constraints make this an &ldquo;interesting&rdquo; part
    of device friver writing, and several different facilities
    have been provided for different situations. We also
    investigate the complex topic of DMA.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18f2580.0x19ea710"></a></h2></div></div><p>Though <a href="../025/1221.html" target="_self">last
month's</a> installment appeared to cover everything about
interrupts, that is not true. One month later, you are ready to
understand the ultimate technology for interrupt handling. We also
begin to investigate the fascinating world of memory management by
explaining the tasks of a DMA-capable driver.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18f2580.0x19ea870"></a>Changes in Current Linux Versions</h2></div></div><p>Before we start, you should note two changes in recent Linux
versions. In Linux 1.3.70, the first steps were taken to support
<span   class="emphasis"><em>shared interrupts</em></span>. The idea is that several
devices and device drivers <span   class="emphasis"><em>share</em></span> the same
interrupt line. This is also part of the PCI specification, where
every device has its own vendor- and product-dependent device ID.
When reading this ID, Linux gets quite verbose about plugged-in PCI
devices when booting with PCI enabled. For this reason, the
declaration of <b  >request_irq</b> and
<b  >free_irq</b> in <b  >linux/sched.h</b> now
reads:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
extern int request_irq(unsigned int irq,
   void (*handler)(int, void *, struct pt_regs *),
   unsigned long flags,
   const char *device,
   void *dev_id);
extern void free_irq(unsigned int irq, void *dev_id);
</pre><p>Thus, when registering an interrupt with
<b  >request_irq()</b>, a fourth parameter must be handed
to Linux: the device ID. Currently, most devices will pass a
<b  >NULL</b> for <b  >dev_id</b> when
requesting and freeing interrupts&mdash;this results in the same
behaviour as before. If you really want to share interrupts, you
also have to set <b  >SA_SHIRQ</b> in
<b  >flags</b>, in addition to passing
<b  >dev_id</b>. Sharing of interrupts only works if all
device drivers on one interrupt line agree to share their
interrupt.</p><p>The second &ldquo;change&rdquo; is not a real change, but rather, a
stylistic upgrade: <b  >get_user_byte()</b> and
<b  >put_user_byte()</b> are considered obsolete and
should not be used in new code. They are replaced by the more
flexible <b  >get_user</b> and
<b  >put_user</b> calls.</p><p>Linus Torvalds explains that these functions use compiler
&ldquo;magic&rdquo; to look at the pointer they are passed and read or write
the correct size item. This means you can't use <b  >void
*</b> or <b  >unsigned long</b> as a pointer; you
always have to use a pointer to the right type. Also, if you give
it a <b  >char *</b>, you get a <b  >char</b>
back, <span   class="bold"><b>not</b></span> an <b  >unsigned
char</b>, unlike the old <b  >get_fs_byte()</b>
function. If you need an <b  >unsigned</b> value, use a
pointer to an <b  >unsigned</b> type. Never cast the
return value to get the access size you want&mdash;if you think you need
to do that, you are doing something wrong. Your argument pointer
should always be of the right type.</p><p>Essentially, you should think of
<b  >get_user()</b> as a simple pointer dereference (kind
of like <b  >*(xxx)</b> in plain C, except it fetches the
pointer data from user space instead). In fact, on some
architectures, that is exactly what it is.</p><p>While we're fixing previous oversights, it is worth noting
that the kernel offers a facility to autodetect interrupt lines.
That's slightly different from what was shown in our article a
couple of months ago. Those who are interested can look at
<b  >&lt;linux/interrupt.h&gt;</b> for documentation
about it.</p><p>We now return you to your regularly scheduled
programming.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18f2580.0x19eb528"></a>A Split View of Interrupts</h2></div></div><p>As you may remember from last time, interrupt handling is
managed by a single driver function. Our implementation dealt with
both low-level (acknowledging the interrupt) and high-level (such
as awakening tasks) issues. This way of doing things may work for
simple drivers, but it is prone to failure if the handling is too
slow.</p><p>If you look at the code, it is clear that acknowledging the
interrupt and retrieving or sending the relevant data is a minimal
part of the workings. With common devices where you are moving only
one or a few bytes per interrupt, most of the time is spent in
managing device-specific queues, chains, and whatever other strange
data structures are used in your implementation. Don't take our
<b  >skel_interrupt()</b> as an example here, since it is
the most simplified interrupt handler possible; real devices may
have a lot of status information and many modes of operation. If
you spend too much time processing your data structures, it is
possible to miss the next interrupt or interrupts and either hang
or lose data, because when an interrupt handler is running, at
least that interrupt is blocked, and with fast interrupt handlers,
all interrupts are blocked.</p><p>The solution devised for this problem is to split the task of
interrupt handling into two halves:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>First, a fast &ldquo;top half&rdquo; handles hardware issues
and must terminate before a new interrupt is issued. Normally, very
little is done here besides moving data between the device and some
memory buffer (and not even that, if your device driver uses DMA),
and making sure the hardware is in a sane state.</p></li><li><p>Then a slower &ldquo;bottom half&rdquo; of the handler runs
with interrupts enabled and can take as long as is needed to
accomplish everything. It is executed as soon as possible after the
interrupt is serviced.</p></li></ul></div><p>Fortunately, the kernel offers a special way to schedule
execution of the bottom half code, which isn't necessarily related
to a particular process; this means both the request to run the
function and the execution of the function itself are done outside
of the context of any process. A special mechanism is needed,
because the other kernel functions all operate in the context of a
process&mdash;an orderly thread of execution, normally associated with a
running instance of a user-level program&mdash;while interrupt handling
is asynchronous and not related to a particular process.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18f2580.0x19eb948"></a>Bottom Halves: When and How</h2></div></div><p>From the programmer's point of view, the bottom half is very
similar to the top half, in that it cannot call
<b  >schedule()</b> and can only perform atomic memory
allocations. This is understandable, because the function is not
called in the context of a process; the bottom half is
asynchronous, just like the top half, the normal interrupt handler.
The difference is mainly that interrupts are enabled and there is
no critical code in progress. So, when exactly are those routines
executed?</p><p>As you know, the processor is mostly executing on behalf of a
process, both in user space and in kernel space (while executing
system calls). The notable exceptions are servicing an interrupt
and scheduling another process in place of the current one: during
these operations the <b  >current</b> pointer is not
meaningful, even though it is always a valid pointer to a
<b  >struct task_struct</b>. Additionally, kernel code is
controlling the CPU when a process enters/exits a system call. This
happens quite often, as a single piece of code handles every system
call.</p><p>With this in mind, it is apparent that if you want your
bottom half executed as soon as possible, it must be called from
the scheduler or when entering or leaving a system call, since
doing it during interrupt service is taboo. Actually, Linux calls
<b  >do_bottom_half()</b>, defined in
<b  >kernel/softirq.c</b> from
<b  >schedule()</b> (<b  >kernel/sched.c</b>)
and from <b  >ret_from_sys_call()</b>, defined in an
architecture-specific assembly file, usually
<b  >entry.S</b>.</p><p>The bottom halves are not bound to the interrupt number,
though the kernel keeps a static array of 32 such functions.
Currently (I'm using 1.3.71), there is no way to ask for a free
bottom half number or ID, so we will hard-code one. This is dirty
coding, but it is used only to show the idea; later we will remove
such ID stealing.</p><p>In order to execute your bottom half, you need to tell the
kernel about it. This is accomplished through the
<b  >mark_bh()</b> function, which takes one argument,
the ID of your bottom half.</p><p>This listing shows the code for a split-interrupt handler
using the &ldquo;dirty&rdquo; ID pseudo-allocation.</p><pre     class="programlisting">

</pre><p><a href="1222f1.html" target="_self">Using Task Queues</a></p><p>Actually, dirty allocation of a bottom half ID is not really
needed, because the kernel implements a more sophisticated
mechanism which you will surely enjoy.</p><p>This mechanism is called &ldquo;task queues&rdquo;, because the
functions to be called are kept in queues, constructed of linked
lists. This also means you can register more than one bottom half
function that is associated with your driver. Moreover, task queues
are not directly related to interrupt handling and can be used
independently of interrupt management.</p><p>A task queue is a chain of <b  >struct
tq_struct</b>'s, as declared in
<b  >&lt;linux/tqueue.h&gt;</b>.</p><pre     class="programlisting">

function getting a pointer argument. This is a useful feature, as
you'll soon discover by yourself, but remember the

it points to <b  >kmalloc()</b>ed memory, you must
remember to free it yourself.</p><p>Another thing to keep in mind is that the

so you must be careful never to look in it, and

looking at. Here we stick to the most general call.</p><p>In order to use a task queue, you will need either to declare

explore both methods.</p><p>This listing shows how to run multiple bottom halves in your

</pre><p>Using task queues is an enjoyable experience and helps keep
your code clean. For example, if you are running the skel-machine
described in the previous few Kernel Korner columns, you can
service multiple hardware devices by using a single interrupt
handling function that gets the hardware structure as an argument.
This behaviour can be accomplished by having a
<b  >tq_struct</b> as a member of the
<b  >Skel_Hw</b> structure. The big advantage here is if
multiple devices request attention at nearly the same time, all of
them are queued and serviced later all at once (with interrupts
enabled). Of course, this only works if the Skel hardware isn't too
picky about when interrupts are acknowledged and the interrupt
condition is dealt with.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18f2580.0x19e3200"></a>Running Predefined Queues</h2></div></div><p>The kernel proper defines three task queues for your
convenience and amusement. A custom driver should normally use one
of those queues instead of declaring its own queue, and any driver
may use the predefined queues without declaring new ones. The only
reason there are special queues is higher performance: queues with
smaller IDs are executed first.</p><p>The three predefined queues are:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
struct tq_struct *tq_timer;
struct tq_struct *tq_scheduler;
struct tq_struct *tq_immediate;
</pre><p>The first is run in relation with kernel timers and won't be
discussed here&mdash;it is left as an exercise for the reader. The next
is run anytime scheduling takes place, and the last is run
&ldquo;immediately&rdquo; upon exit from the interrupt handler, as a generic
bottom half; this will generally be the queue you use in your
driver to replace the older bottom half mechanism.</p><p>The &ldquo;immediate&rdquo; queue is used like
<b  >tq_skel</b> above. You don't need to choose an ID
and declare it, although <b  >mark_bh()</b> must still be
called with the <b  >IMMEDIATE_BH</b> argument as shown
below. Correspondingly, the <b  >tq_timer</b> queue uses
<b  >mark_bh(TIMER_BH)</b>, but the
<b  >tq_scheduler</b> queue does not need to be marked to
run, and so <b  >mark_bh()</b> is not called.</p><p>This listing shows an example of using the &ldquo;immediate&rdquo;

issues.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18f2580.0x19e3c50"></a>DMA on the PC&mdash;Dirty, Machine-dependent,
Awful</h2></div></div><p>Remember the old days of the IBM PC? Yes, those days, when
the PC was delivered with 128 KB of RAM, an 8086-processor, tape
interface and 360 KB floppy. [You got a whole 128KB? Lucky
you!  &mdash;ED] Those were the days when DMA on ISA bus was considered
<span   class="emphasis"><em>fast</em></span>. The idea of DMA is to transfer a block
of data from a device to memory or vice versa without letting the
CPU do the boring job of moving individual bytes. Instead, after
initialization of both the device and the on-board DMA controller
of the motherboard, the device signals the DMA controller that it
has data to transfer. The DMA controller puts the RAM in a state
receiving data from the data bus, the device puts the data on the
data bus, and when this has been done, the controller increments an
address counter and decrements a length counter, so that further
transfers go into the next location.</p><p>In those old days this technique was fast, allowing transfer
rates of up to 800 kilobytes per second on 16-bit ISA. Today we
have transfer rates of 132 MB/second with PCI 2.0. But good old ISA
DMA has still its applications: imagine a sound card playing 16-bit
coded music at 48 kHz stereo. This would result in 192 kilobytes
per second. Transmitting the data by interrupt requesting, say, two
words every 20 microseconds would certainly let the CPU drop a
whole lot of interrupts. Polling the data (non-interrupt driven
data transfer) at that rate would certainly stop the CPU from doing
anything useful, too. What we need is a continuous data flow at
midrange speed&mdash;perfect for DMA. Linux only has to initiate and
stop the data transfer. The rest is done by the hardware
itself.</p><p>We will deal only with ISA DMA in this article&mdash;most
expansion cards are still ISA, and ISA DMA is fast enough for many
applications. However, DMA on the ISA bus has severe
restrictions:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The hardware and the DMA controllers know nothing
about virtual memory&mdash;all they can see is physical memory and its
addresses (This restriction belongs to all kinds of ISA DMA.)
Instead of using a page here and another there and gluing them
together in virtual memory, we must allocate continuous blocks of
physical memory, and we may <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> swap them
out.</p></li><li><p>Intel-based systems have two DMA controllers, one
with the lower four DMA channels allowing byte-wise transfers and
one with the upper four channels allowing (faster) word transfer.
Both have only a 16-bit address counter and a 16-bit length
counter. Therefore, we may not transfer more than 65535 bytes (or
words, with the second controller) at once.</p></li><li><p>The address counter represents only the lower 16
bits of the address (<b  >A0</b>-<b  >A15</b>
on DMA channels 0-3, <b  >A1</b>-<b  >A16</b>
on channels 4-7). The upper 8 bits of address space are represented
in a <span   class="emphasis"><em>page</em></span> register. They will not change
during a transfer, meaning transfers can take place only within one
16-bit (64 KB) segment of memory.</p></li><li><p>Upper <span   class="bold"><b>8</b></span> bits? 24
bits of address space in total? Yes, it's sad, but true. We can
only transfer within the <span   class="emphasis"><em>lower 16MB</em></span> of RAM. If
your data eventually needs to reach another address, the CPU has to
copy it &ldquo;by hand&rdquo; again, using the DMA-accessible memory as a
&ldquo;bounce buffer&rdquo;, as it is called.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18f2580.0x19e4438"></a>Allocating a DMA Buffer</h2></div></div><p>Right, you know the restrictions&mdash;so decide now to read on or
not!</p><p>The first thing we need for DMA is a
<span   class="emphasis"><em>buffer</em></span>. The restrictions (lower 16 MB of
memory, continuous page-addresses in physical memory) are all
fulfilled if you allocate your buffer with:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
void  *dma_buf;
dma_buf = kmalloc(<span   class="emphasis"><em>buffer_size</em></span>,
                  GFP_BUFFER | GFP_DMA);
</pre><p>The returned address will never fit the start of a page, as
much as you would prefer it do so. The reason is Linux has a quite
advanced memory management on used and unused blocks of pages with
<b  >kmalloc()</b>. It maintains lists of free segments
as small as 32 bytes (64 on the DEC Alpha), another list for
segments of double size, another for quadruple-size, etc. Every
time you free <b  >kmalloc()</b>ed memory, Linux will try
to join your released segment with a free neighbor segment. If the
neighbor is free, too, they are passed into the list of double
size, where it is checked again, if it has a free-neighbor, to get
into the next order list.</p><p>The sizes <b  >kmalloc</b> supports at the moment
(Linux 1.3.71) range from <b  >PAGE_SIZE &gt; 7</b> to
<b  >PAGE_SIZE &lt;&lt; 5</b>. Each step in the power of
2 is one list, so two joined elements in the one list form one
element of the next higher order.</p><p>You might wonder why you don't get a simple whole page.
That's because at the beginning of every segment, some list
information is maintained. This is called the (somewhat misleading)
<b  >page_descriptor</b>, and its size is currently
between 16 and 32 bytes (depending on your machine type).
Therefore, if you ask Linux for 64KB of RAM, Linux will have to use
a block of free 128KB RAM and hand you 128 kilobytes to 32
bytes.</p><p>And this is difficult to get&mdash;the floppy driver sometimes
dreams of this, when it tries to allocate its DMA buffer at run
time and can't find any continuous RAM. Therefore, always think in
powers of two, but then subtract some bytes (about 0x20). If you
want to look at the magic numbers, they're all in

a sound card will generate an interrupt to tell the CPU, &ldquo;Gimme
data, I'm running out of it.&rdquo;</p><p>The machine we built our driver for is quite fascinating: it
is a laboratory interface with its own CPU, own RAM, analog and
digital inputs and outputs, and bells and whistles. It uses a
character channel for receiving commands and sending answers and
uses DMA for block transfer of sampled data (or data to output).
Therefore, an invoked interrupt might have these reasons:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>send data on the character channel</p></li><li><p>read data from the character channel</p></li><li><p>initiate a DMA-transfer to or from the host</p></li><li><p>the transfer is done</p></li><li><p>the transfer is going to cross the boundary of the
DMA page register (DMA page-register has to be incremented)</p></li></ul></div><p>Your interrupt handler has to find out what is meant by the
interrupt. Normally, it will read a status register of the device
having more detailed information on the task to perform.</p><p>As you see, we have gone far away from the general truth of a
clean loading and unloading of a module and are right in the middle
of dirty specialization. We decided our lab driver should perform
the following tasks:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Allocate DMA-able memory on user request and map
this memory to the user space (the user has direct access to the
DMA buffer and can &ldquo;see&rdquo; how it fills up&mdash;this is faster and more
flexible than first capturing the data and then transferring it
via, say, a character channel to the user).</p></li><li><p>Check, whenever a transfer is required, if the
buffer address is valid (was allocated by our driver) and if the
length is sufficient.</p></li><li><p>And, of course, do not forget to release the memory
when the user closes the character channel, even if it has not been
released explicitly.</p></li></ul></div><p>This concept differs from the floppy driver, where you will
never look directly at the actual DMA buffer. But it is probably
good for you as well: you might decide to use this method for a
frame grabber. The user might allocate multiple buffers, set up the
transfer address for the one and look at the other while the first
is filled up. As the only thing the user and the system have to do
is toggle the sampling address and the buffers are both mapped into
the user address space, not a single byte of the picture has to be
transferred by the CPU&mdash;they just arrive at the location where the
user wants them. We will describe the tricks to do this in the next
Kernel Korner.</p><p>Before we start with real code, let us think of the steps to
be taken for a complete transfer:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>An interrupt occurs, meaning a transfer should
start.</p></li><li><p>The interrupt handler starts the transfer.</p></li><li><p>The interrupt handler returns, while the CPU starts
its normal activity and the transfer is running.</p></li><li><p>Interrupt occurs, meaning the transfer is
finished.</p></li><li><p>The interrupt handler ends the transfer...</p></li><li><p>...and probably asks the device for another one,
wakes up <span   class="emphasis"><em>sleeping beauties</em></span>, etc.</p></li></ol></div><p>Don't be disappointed that we don't write your whole device
driver&mdash;things will be very different in different situations!
