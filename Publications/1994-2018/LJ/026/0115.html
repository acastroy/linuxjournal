    In many cases, the right answer for an office is an
    integrated solution. SmartWare Plus from Angoss is one
    possible approach.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb81580.0xc794a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>Linux has made great inroads into
development environments, become a good X terminal, and been used
in embedded applications. However, to seriously penetrate the
office market, Linux needs to not look like Linux. That is, when
the average office user sits down at his system, he needs to see a
means for accomplishing a clerical task, not a Unix or Linux
command prompt.
</p><p>There are ways to address this problem with available tools.
Caldera has developed a desktop and applications suite. Others,
such as Dr. Greg Wettstein of the Roger Maris Cancer Center, have
built their own solutions using languages such as Perl and Tcl/Tk.
Here at SSC we use the Progress database (now running on Linux) and
then use external Linux tools (such as vi and groff) to do the
support functions. Angoss offers another alternative with SmartWare
Plus.</p><p>SmartWare Plus is an integrated office environment that
includes a database, spreadsheet, word processor, and more. Also
included is a Rapid Application Development System that allows you
to write custom applications that use the features of the various
SmartWare packages in an integrated fashion.</p><p>SmartWare has been around for quite a while and boasts over
half a million users worldwide and over 600 software developers.
SmartWare is available for MS-DOS and Xenix and has been very
popular for use in local governments.</p><p>To get an idea of what you might do with SmartWare, think
about an average office&mdash;say a dentist's office. You would need a
system that allowed scheduling of patients, ordering supplies,
patient billing, time management and letter writing.</p><p>You could train the receptionist (who probably also does
billing, orders supplies, and probably most everything else in a
small office) to use a word processor, a spreadsheet, an
appointment manager and a database&mdash;but this would mean s/he would
have to learn how to use all these programs, as well as how to use
the operating system to load the different programs and move
information between them.</p><p>One solution would be to purchase an integrated package, but
you are in trouble if this package doesn't do exactly what you need
it to right out of the box. A vendor of mass-market software is not
going to make the changes you need or give you the source code so
you can do it yourself.</p><p>With SmartWare, you can write the necessary spreadsheets,
develop the scheduling and accounting software using the database,
and then, using the Rapid Application Development (RAD) system, tie
it all together so everything can be accessed from a single menu:
<a href="0115f1.html" target="_self">Figure 1.</a>.</p><p>SmartWare also includes some utilities such as file copy,
erase, and print that insulate the user from the operating system.
While I don't get excited about a menu option to copy
a file <a href="0115f2.html" target="_self">Figure 2.</a> , menus do allow the
user to accomplish tasks without even knowing what operating system
is under the hood.</p><p>The advantages of using the SmartWare Plus package
are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The same applications work under X-Windows and in
character mode.</p></li><li><p>Applications are portable between
platforms/operating systems.</p></li><li><p>All the necessary packages are integrated into one
consistent package.</p></li></ul></div><p>But, you pay a price for this. The disadvantages I see
are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Not free.</p></li><li><p>No source code for the system itself.</p></li><li><p>The SmartWare user interface, while consistent
among the different pieces of the package, is not consistent with
other Linux/X applications.</p></li></ul></div><p>Another important consideration is data security. Internal
concerns need to be considered, such as access to payroll records,
as well as mandated protection of confidential client records.
Within the RAD system you can limit access to any application and
thus any data.</p><p>Looking under the hood there is much more to SmartWare Plus
than simply offering a GUI-based development environment. Also
included is the SmartWare Programming Language&mdash;a complete
programming environment containing standard structured programming
constructs, over 200 commands and 300 built-in functions,
multi-dimensional arrays and lots more. Thus, much can be done
directly using the GUI-development tools but there is something
under the hood if you need to do some serious programming.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb81580.0xc79f50"></a>Installation</h2></div></div><p>When I first looked at this package I had a few misgivings
concerning the installation procedure. The people at Angoss
addressed them, but to be sure that the installation made sense, I
asked Carlie Fairchild to give it a try.
<a href="0115s1.html" target="_self">This</a> is the result.</p><p>I then handed a copy to Bryan Phillippe, a systems technician
at Zebu, a company related to SSC that produces Linux-based
firewall systems. Bryan said, &ldquo;SmartWare comes as a dynamically
linked ZMAGIC a.out binary, tarred onto floppies. It installs
easily for anyone with Unix experience, although the installation
instructions themselves had some mistakes that might prevent a
newbie from being able to install by following the instructions
verbatim.&rdquo;</p><p>Once he had the product installed, Bryan started doing some
development. The <a href="0115s2.html" target="_self">&ldquo;Working with SmartWare
Plus&rdquo; Sidebar</a> contains the remainder of Bryan's comments
about the system. Figures <a href="0115f3.html" target="_self">3</a> and
<a href="0115f4.html" target="_self">4</a> show the database screens he has
developed so far. Figures <a href="0115f5.html" target="_self">5</a> and
<a href="0115f6.html" target="_self">6</a> show the word processor and its
spell-check mode, respectively.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb81580.0xc7a318"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>There are two primary markets for SmartWare Plus. The first
and most obvious market is to offer Linux as a new platform for
existing applications. For example, people in a dentist's office
already using SmartWare but who now need a multi-user answer are
the perfect candidates for a move to Linux.</p><p>Secondly, SmartWare is a good fit for office situations where
the computer is a tool to perform a particular set of well-defined
tasks. For example, an order-entry system could be quickly built
that would meet the specific needs of a company. New features (such
as letter writing from the order system) could easily be added when
needed.</p><p>As these two markets have identified millions of possible
places where Angoss SmartWare Plus could be a good solution, I
think I will stop there. Having done requirements statements for
computer solutions for government and industry, and then searched
for the right solution for hundreds of systems, I want to emphasize
that it is crucial to find the right tool for the job. And, for a
lot of jobs, this package, along with Linux, can be the right
tool.</p><p>An evaluation copy of SmartWare Plus is available over the
Internet and is also included on the InfoMagic archive CD set. This
copy has save and print disabled, but for $50, you can get the key
to enable it.</p><p>Commercial licenses cost $685 for the development system and
$299 for each additional user. Angoss Software may be reached by
