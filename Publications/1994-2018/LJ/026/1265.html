    Personal finance programs have been popular in the DOS and
    windows environments for years, and so it is not surprising
    that until about a year ago, many new Linux users wished for
    a good personal finance program for Linux&mdash;but there
    simply wasn't one available. One creative user decided to do
    something about that.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x222b580.0x23234a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>Have you ever wondered where all your
money goes? Do you get a nice big check on payday, but when it
comes time to pay the bills, your wallet is looking rather thin? It
seems there is never any money left over to save for the future.
There comes a time in every person's life when it becomes obvious
that they need to take control of their finances.
</p><p>When I began dating the woman who is now my wife, I noticed
that my money began disappearing just a little bit faster than
before. As our relationship grew, so did the rate my money
disappeared... This trend continued until it climaxed in the two
weeks surrounding our wedding, when all the bills came due. I have
never seen money disappear so fast.</p><p>Little did I know that this was only the tip of the iceberg.
It seems that as life goes on my money gets stretched thinner and
thinner. Now I find myself in the midst of purchasing a house,
making car payments, buying dog food, and wondering how I am ever
going to support my computer habit.</p><p>Needless to say, my wife and I needed a way to keep track of
where our money was coming from and going to&mdash;and we needed a way
to plan for our future expenses.</p><p>There are many excellent personal finance programs available
at little or no cost. Unfortunately, none of the ones I found could
be conveniently run under Linux. So in August of 1994 I said to
myself, &ldquo;How hard could it be? I will just whip up a quick little
check book balancing program that runs under Unix.&rdquo;</p><p>Well, as with most &ldquo;little&rdquo; projects, it turned out to be a
bit more work than I expected. This little program turned into CBB.
CBB is copyrighted under the GNU General Public License, so it is
completely free. It is my humble contribution to the world of free
software&mdash;a small payment for all the wonderful software others
have so kindly made available for free.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x222b580.0x2323768"></a>What is CBB?</h2></div></div><p>CBB is a personal check book balancing utility for Unix and
X11. It was primarily developed under Linux, but runs equally well
under most flavors of Unix. CBB is written entirely in Perl and
Tcl/Tk, so it is portable and extensible. It is a program for
anyone who would like to track their income and expenses, balance
their checkbook, and manage their money. Any other use (such as
lining for a cat's litter box) is not supported or
recommended.</p><p>CBB is an open, extensible program written entirely in
scripts. It utilizes a simple ASCII data file format. In addition,
CBB provides a simple interface for users to add their own reports
and graphs without modifying any of the CBB source code. In the
future, I plan to create a simple interface to other external
modules so that other people may provide plug-ins to increase CBB's
functionality.</p><p>CBB (if you haven't guessed already) stands for the Check
Book Balancer. This name illustrates the extreme amount of
creativeness that is inherent in us computer nerds. My wife, who is
not a computer nerd, suggested &ldquo;In Cheque&mdash;Putting the balance in
your budget.&rdquo;</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x222b580.0x2323920"></a>Feature List and Description</h2></div></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Ability to create, edit and delete transactions.
Automatically calculates the running balance.</p></li><li><p>Many input accelerators to reduce data entry work.
For instance, the <b  >+</b> and <b  >-</b>
keys will increment and decrement the value in the date and check
number fields. Transactions will be automatically completed by
typing the first few characters of the description and pressing
<b  >&lt;TAB&gt;</b>. The rest of the transaction will be
filled in from a matching transaction.</p></li><li><p>Each transaction is assigned a category such as
&ldquo;entertainment&rdquo; or &ldquo;food&rdquo;.</p></li><li><p>Ability to split the amount of a transaction across
multiple categories.</p></li><li><p>Able to undo the last transaction insert, edit, or
delete.</p></li><li><p>Handles multiple accounts.</p></li><li><p>Handles transfers between accounts.</p></li><li><p>Performs account balancing: i.e., the ability to
enter a statement's starting and ending balances, select uncleared
transactions, verify that <span   class="emphasis"><em>start balance</em></span> +
<span   class="emphasis"><em>transactions</em></span> = <span   class="emphasis"><em>end
balance</em></span>, and clear all selected transactions.</p></li><li><p>Contains a simple interface for external &ldquo;user
written&rdquo; reports and graphs. Currently &ldquo;ships&rdquo; with three
reports and one graph.</p></li><li><p>Ability to import from and export to the Quicken
export file format. This feature has not been extensively tested,
but should provide the ability to move back and forth freely
between Quicken and CBB.</p></li><li><p>Able to handle recurring transactions. One of the
contributed scripts adds this functionality.</p></li><li><p>Support for the international date format, i.e.,
30.01.68 (DD.MM.YY).</p></li><li><p>An &ldquo;auto save&rdquo; function for the ASCII format data
files. (This can save you when someone logs you out without
asking.)</p></li><li><p>The current X-Windows selection can be pasted into
any entry field. Likewise a selected piece of text in CBB can be
pasted into other X-Windows applications.</p></li><li><p>Extensive reference manual is available in LaTeX,
dvi, PostScript, or on-line locally in HTML format. The manual is
also available at

<a href="1265s1.html" target="_self">make sure you have</a> Perl version
4.036 or later, and Tk version 4.0 or later installed on your
system.</p><p>Installing CBB is very straightforward:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Unzip and untar the distribution file, and change
to the newly created cbb-0.<span   class="emphasis"><em>??</em></span>
directory.</p></li><li><p>Type <b  >make install</b>.</p></li></ol></div><p>You will be prompted for 4 items:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The location of your Perl binary.</p></li><li><p>The location of your wish4.0 binary.</p></li><li><p>Where to install the CBB executable scripts.</p></li><li><p>Where to install all the associated CBB
files.</p></li></ul></div><p>CBB attempts to present you with reasonable defaults for all
of these items.</p><p>When you have finished answering these four questions, CBB
will be installed.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x222b580.0x271d170"></a>Short Tutorial</h2></div></div><p>So, you want to go for a little test drive? Want to see how,
or if, this thing works? Want to send me a 21 inch monitor or the
DOS drivers for my ancient Sony PAS16-SCSI CD-ROM drive? Well, read
on...</p><p>The following procedure will lead you through the process of
creating a new account, importing some data, editing transactions,
and balancing your account.</p><p>First, here is the &ldquo;one-paragraph&rdquo; version of the tutorial.
To use CBB, first create the directory where you would like to keep
your accounts. Then, change to this directory, run CBB, and create
the accounts. You may import the default account categories at any
time. Finally, load the desired account (if it is not already
loaded) and create, delete, and edit transactions to your heart's
content, while printing reports, viewing graphs, and so on. When
your bank statement arrives in the mail, balance the
account.</p><p>For a more detailed tutorial, read on...</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x222b580.0x271d380"></a>Create a demo Account</h2></div></div><p>After installing CBB, the first thing you need to do is
create an account.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Run CBB by typing <b  >cbb</b>.</p></li><li><p>Select <b  >Make New Account ...</b> from
the <b  >File</b> menu.</p></li><li><p>Enter an account name (e.g.,
<b  >my-demo.cbb</b>) and an account description (e.g.,
<b  >My Demo Account</b>).</p></li></ul></div><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="1265f1.jpg"></div><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Figure 1. Making Account</p></blockquote></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Click on the <b  >Create Account</b>
button. Your new account will be created and added to the master
account list at the bottom of the main window. The name of the
account will also be added to the category list (e.g..
<b  >[my-demo]</b>). This name is used to specify
transfers between accounts.</p></li><li><p>You will be warned about not having a categories
file. This is perfectly normal at this point. An empty categories
file will be created for you.</p></li><li><p>If you want to use the default categories, pull
down the <b  >Functions</b> menu and select
<b  >Categories -&gt; Add Default Categories</b> to
create the default categories.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x222b580.0x271de28"></a>Import Some Data</h2></div></div><p>Once you have created an account, it is time to enter a few
transactions. You can import some sample data to save your fingers
from the brutalities of typing. The CBB distribution comes with
some sample data for this tutorial. Otherwise, feel free to skip
this section and enter your own transactions.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Select <b  >Import QIF File ...</b> from
the <b  >File</b> menu.</p></li><li><p>You will be presented with a file selection dialog
box. Navigate to the CBB distribution directory. Beneath the
distribution directory is a <b  >demo</b> directory. Go
to the <b  >demo</b> directory and find the file named
<b  >demo.qif</b>. Double click on this file to select it
and import it.</p></li></ul></div><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="1265f2.jpg"></div><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Figure 2. Choosing the Demo Import File</p></blockquote></div><p>Now that you have some data to play with
<a href="1265f3.html" target="_self">(Figure 3)</a>, try editing a
transaction. Then try creating new transactions. Try playing around
with &ldquo;splits&rdquo; to specify more than one category for a
transaction. Play around with CBB until you get the hang of
it.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x222b580.0x271e508"></a>Balance the Account</h2></div></div><p>Now let's pretend you just received your bank statement in
the mail and you want to reconcile your new CBB account. Let's also
pretend that you didn't mess things up too badly while editing
transactions...</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Find the <b  >Balance</b> button near the
bottom right-hand corner of the CBB window and click on it. This
will bring up a list of all &ldquo;uncleared&rdquo; transactions.</p></li><li><p>Enter a statement ending balance of $1740.00.
(Leave the statement beginning balance as $0.00.)</p></li><li><p>Select the first four transactions as well as the
sixth transaction. (Pretend these were the ones that showed up on
your statement.) As you select transactions, watch the &ldquo;Debits =
<span   class="emphasis"><em>n</em></span>, Credits = <span   class="emphasis"><em>m</em></span>,
Difference = <span   class="emphasis"><em>i</em></span>&rdquo; line.</p></li></ul></div><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="1265f4.jpg"></div><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Figure 4. Reconciled Account</p></blockquote></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>When the <span   class="emphasis"><em>starting balance</em></span> -
<span   class="emphasis"><em>withdrawals</em></span> + <span   class="emphasis"><em>deposits</em></span> =
ending balance, click on the <b  >Update</b> button to
mark all the selected transactions as cleared.</p></li><li><p>Congratulations: your account should be
balanced.</p></li></ul></div><p>When your next statement arrives and you run the balance
routine again, you will only be presented with &ldquo;uncleared&rdquo;
transactions to select. This is a good way to spot old checks that
never were cashed, such as the mortgage payment that was &ldquo;lost in
the mail&rdquo;. Note: By balancing your checkbook in this manner, two
good things happen. First, when your brother finally cashes that
check for $100.00&mdash;many months after you wrote it&mdash;your bank
balance doesn't suddenly drop $100.00 from where you think it
should be. Once that transaction was entered, the amount was
subtracted from your bank balance. Second, it is easy to spot these
situations&mdash;you can call up your brother and pester him to cash the
check.</p><p><a href="1265f5.html" target="_self">Reports and Graphs</a></p><p>Now that you have entered a bit of data, you may want to
&ldquo;understand&rdquo; your data at a deeper level. CBB comes with several
reports and graphs which can help you get a better idea of where
and how your money is being spent. Feel free to generate and look
at a few reports and graphs at this point.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x222b580.0x271f008"></a>Saving and Exiting</h2></div></div><p>Wow! You've been slaving away for the last 10 minutes
perfecting your demo account. Great job! That is about all there is
to it. CBB isn't rocket science. It just boils down to &ldquo;plus and
minus&rdquo;. Since this is not real data, you probably don't care to
save it. However, if this had been an actual account, you most
definitely would want to save your hard work.</p><p>If you want to save the changes you have made to an account,
you must tell CBB to write the changes to a file. If you forget to
save your work before you quit, CBB will remind you to do this. If
you do something awful, like reboot your machine or log out without
saving, you are not completely out of luck. CBB periodically saves
a backup copy of your account with a file name such as
<b  >#account.cbb#</b>. Just rename this file to
<b  >account.cbb</b> and you will be back on
track.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x222b580.0x262fb28"></a>Additional Information</h2></div></div><p>If you have made it this far, chances are you will be
interested in some more information. I have a section devoted to
CBB on my web page. Here you can find the complete CBB manual
on-line, the readme file, the CBB FAQ, and several screen shots.
You can even try running a live demo of CBB.</p><p>The URL for my home page is
<a href="http://www.me.umn.edu/home/clolson/main.html" target="_self">www.me.umn.edu/home/clolson/main.html</a>.</p><p>It wouldn't be fair to end this article without mentioning
two other free personal finance packages I am aware of. The first
is Xfinans, another personal account manager. You can find out more
