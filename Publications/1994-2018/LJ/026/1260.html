    On the road again? Whether business or pleasure takes you
    away from your desktop computer, Linux can come with you.
    Linux is a wonderful mobile computing environment, and
    reading this brief introduction to the state of Linux on
    laptop and notebook computers will help you get away from it
    all.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dc1580.0x1eb9500"></a></h2></div></div><p>Just imagine the ability to pick up your
Linux workstation and take it with you wherever you want to go. You
can do it today. Linux can run smoothly on notebook hardware,
taking full advantage of all the goodies that define mobile
computing. Just as with desktop systems, however, there can also be
challenges to overcome. Fortunately, extensive support for
notebooks running Linux is becoming available as interest in seeing
Linux on notebook computers continues to grow.
</p><p>This article is not intended to be an in-depth aid to
installation or configuration of Linux notebook systems. Such an
article would be nearly impossible to write for desktop systems,
and notebooks are no different. Rather, this article introduces
both the present Linux desktop user and the Linux newcomer to the
support that Linux offers for notebook hardware. Several on-line
resources exist for more specific information beyond what is
presented in this article, and they are mentioned below. The Linux
Laptop Home Page collects pointers to all the information presented
in this article and more, and is available at both
<a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/kharker/linux-laptop" target="_self">http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/kharker/linux-laptop/</a>

<a href="1260f2.html" target="_self">(Figure 2)</a>.</p><p>Notebook computers can be quite different from desktop
systems. One of the most important differences, when it comes to
running Linux, is the process of integrating different hardware
components. Desktop systems can be built by picking and choosing
components that are known to work well with Linux. You can
accessorize or replace unsupported hardware with the best cards and
adaptors for your needs. Notebooks and laptops, however, are
all-or-nothing packages. Aside from PCMCIA cards, there's very
little you can do to customize your hardware configuration. There's
also little you can do when it comes to controller chipsets or
proprietary technologies&mdash;an unfortunate fact of life. Don't let
this intimidate you, though; the vast majority of hardware on the
market works quite well with Linux, and most of the rest works
reasonably well with Linux.</p><p>Most notebooks have a similar feature set. At the time of
this writing, only notebooks with Intel x86 family and compatible
CPUs are capable of running Linux. The port to the PowerPC
architecture may eventually support Linux. [Both the Linux/SPARC
and Linux/Alpha ports have been run on laptops&mdash;ED]</p><p>Most notebooks feature keyboards with 85 keys, give or take a
few, that are usually slightly smaller than those on desktop
keyboards. Almost all notebooks come with PCMCIA drives capable of
accepting two Type II or one Type III card. Most come with built-in
3.5" floppy drives and/or 5.25" CD-ROM drives. Displays vary widely
in size, color depth, video memory, speed, and resolution. Many
machines now come with integrated sound cards. Power management
features are universal, but vary in implementation and
effectiveness. Integrated pointer devices tend to have two buttons
and come in three styles: trackballs, nub-shaped joysticks, and
touchpads. Almost all notebooks feature a serial and parallel port,
and offer some expandability or docking feature. Linux support
exists for all these notebook features.</p><p>Installation of Linux on notebook computers should not be
very much different from installing Linux on a desktop system. Most
distributions let you choose from floppy, CD-ROM, hard disk, NFS,
and even FTP installation sources. For the most part, choosing a
suitable installation method for laptops is subject to the same
criteria as for desktop systems.</p><p>There are a few exceptions, however. Some notebooks use
external floppy disk drives, and there is really no standard
interface for them. Most will allow you to boot and begin the
installation process, but some do not support DMA transfer. Without
DMA transfer capability, you may be able to boot and install from
floppy, but the drive will not be useful for mounting other
floppies.</p><p>Some distributions have boot disks that let you use a PCMCIA
Ethernet card for NFS installation, assuming your card and PCMCIA
controller are among those more commonly used. As with desktop
systems, some early CD-ROM drives in notebooks used proprietary
interfaces that are not supported by the Linux community. However,
by carefully choosing industry-standard hardware, installing Linux
on a notebook is no more or less of a task than it is on desktop
systems.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dc1580.0x1eb99d0"></a>PCMCIA</h2></div></div><p>PCMCIA is an acronym that stands for Personal Computer Memory
Card International Association. Since this is somewhat awkward to
pronounce, PCMCIA cards are also frequently referred to as PC
Cards. Physically, PC Cards are about the same width and height as
credit cards and only a few millimeters thick. They provide one of
the most versatile ways of customizing your notebook computer, and
they are not limited to memory cards.</p><p>Readily-available PCMCIA cards implement RAM, small hard
disks, SCSI adaptors, fax modems, Ethernet, sound, additional I/O
ports, and more. Nearly all the cards on the market today are
&ldquo;Type II&rdquo; cards. A few larger cards, such as those that implement
hard disks, are &ldquo;Type III&rdquo; cards, and are about twice as thick.
Most PC notebooks come with a PCMCIA drive that can handle two Type
II cards or a single Type III card. To use a PCMCIA card, your
machine needs a PCMCIA drive and some form of &ldquo;card and socket
services&rdquo; software. The real trick to using PCMCIA cards in Linux
lies in the software.</p><p>Most notebooks that come with MS-DOS and MS-Windows installed
also include the vendor's card-and-socket-services software. This
layer of software facilitates communication between the operating
system and the drive itself&mdash;recognizing when cards are inserted or
removed and determining which device driver is associated with
which card. In the Linux universe, this software is called Card
Services for Linux, and is actively maintained by David Hinds. It
is included in most of the popular distributions, including
Slackware, Red Hat, Caldera, Yggdrasil, and many others. It is also
available at ftp://hyper.stanford.edu/pub/pcmcia/ as well as the
Sunsite and tsx-11 Linux archives. The latest version at the time
of this writing is 2.8.x. The PCMCIA HOWTO is available on the
World Wide Web at
<a href="http://hyper.stanford.edu/pub/pcmcia/doc/PCMCIA-HOWTO.html" target="_self">hyper.stanford.edu/pub/pcmcia/doc/PCMCIA-HOWTO.html</a>
and can also be found on the Linux Documentation Project home
page.</p><p>Card Services for Linux supports all but a very few custom
PCMCIA drives, which are documented in the HOWTO. The support for
individual cards is a little less complete. PCMCIA cards are no
different from any desktop expansion card in the sense that the
card needs a device driver to interface the hardware to the
operating system. And like desktop expansion cards, not all PCMCIA
cards have device drivers written for Linux.</p><p>Fortunately, essentially all PCMCIA fax modems and PCMCIA
serial port adaptors operate on the same interface and are
therefore supported. At the time of this writing, over three dozen
brands of PCMCIA Ethernet cards are supported, as are numerous
FLASH/SRAM cards and SCSI cards. You can find a list of supported
cards at David Hinds' Linux PCMCIA Information Page at
<a href="http://hyper.stanford.edu/~dhinds/pcmcia/pcmcia.html" target="_self">hyper.stanford.edu/~dhinds/pcmcia/pcmcia.html</a>.
David Hinds also maintains a mailing list for announcements about
updates to the Card Services package and device drivers.
Information on subscribing to this service is also available on
this page.</p><p>The Card Services package also comes with all the current
device drivers and several utilities. The most important of these
is Cardinfo, a small X11 application that reports on the present
state of your card sockets: what is in them, if they are active,
what IRQ and I/O ports they occupy and which device (i.e.
/dev/cua0) they are using. This is a very useful utility for
finding and resolving IRQ or I/O port conflicts.</p><p>The latest versions of most Linux distributions include Card
Services, but if your distribution doesn't include it, you can
install it yourself. To do so, you will need to use kernel
1.2.8/1.3.30 or higher, compiled with support for loadable kernel
modules. You must also have the entire Linux source tree to compile
the package. Installing Card Services on an existing Linux system
is explained in detail in the PCMCIA HOWTO and in the readmes that
come in the package. This includes detailed information to help you
identify and work around any IRQ or I/O port conflicts. When
running, the core PCMCIA module takes up about 48K of RAM.</p><p>Card Services for Linux supports hot-swapping cards, and
loads and unloads the proper card-specific device driver modules as
you insert and remove PCMCIA cards. The Card Services module can
also work with the Linux Advanced Power Management driver to help
conserve battery life when your PCMCIA drive is inactive.</p><p>For those who are interested in hacking, David Hinds also
provides some hints and suggestions for writing and debugging
PCMCIA card device drivers in his HOWTO and in the PCMCIA
Programmer's Guide.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dc1580.0x1eb9e48"></a>Advanced Power Management</h2></div></div><p>A major concern for many people taking their notebooks away
from power outlets is how long their battery will last. Without any
power management software, my 486DX4/75 notebook with a NiMH
battery will last about forty-five minutes to an hour and a half
away from a power outlet. While this will vary from machine to
machine, it would be nice if this could be extended.</p><p>The goal of power management software is to manage the
overall level of power consumption of the hardware by reducing or
eliminating power consumption where it is not needed. This process
is accomplished by communication between the hardware and operating
system through a standard interface. For PC notebooks, this
interface is known as the Advanced Power Management (APM)
specification, version 1.1 at the time of this writing, and is
defined by a document drafted by Microsoft and Intel. The
specifications are intended to be operating system
independent.</p><p>Although the APM specifications are intended to make power
management independent of the operating system used, the
unfortunate reality of the market is that some notebook
manufacturers have decided to implement power management systems
that work only with an MS-DOS or MS-Windows operating
system.</p><p>Usually, new notebooks on the market will implement the
specifications correctly, but there are many older models and even
a few newer models that do not. If you happen to have one of those
machines that does not implement APM correctly or sufficiently, you
may be out of luck. Careful research of new machines can ensure
that your machine is compatible.</p><p>APM works through communication between a properly designed
system BIOS and an APM device driver in the operating system. BIOS
stands for Basic Input/Output System, and is a Read Only Memory
chip on your computer's motherboard. A system BIOS that implements
APM can both read and modify the power consumption level of the
hardware components in the machine. These components include your
CPU, battery, screen, hard disk, floppy drive, PCMCIA drive, I/O
ports, sound card, CD-ROM drive, and so forth.</p><p>The BIOS can communicate with the operating system's device
driver, relaying this information so the operating system and BIOS
can together make intelligent decisions about power levels. In this
way, the operating system can power down or reduce power to those
devices in the system that aren't in use, leaving more battery life
for those devices that are in use. In addition, many notebooks
feature a Suspend button that lets you manually put the notebook
into a state of extremely low power consumption until you wake it
up.</p><p>The Linux APM driver is maintained by Rik Faith, and the most
recent version can be found already in kernel 1.3.46 or later.
Support for APM can simply be chosen as a compile option in these
kernels. Versions of the driver for older kernels and the 1.2.x
kernels do exist as kernel patches, but are no longer supported by
Rik and the other developers and lack some of the newer features.
Those interested in APM support are therefore strongly encouraged
to use a 1.3.x kernel. APM support will be a standard part of the
next production kernel series, which will be called
1.4.<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> or 2.0.<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span>.</p><p>In order for the APM driver to work, the system BIOS on your
laptop's motherboard must support the APM version 1.0 or 1.1
interface, preferably version 1.1. It must also support 32-bit
protected-mode connections. While most late model notebooks meet
these requirements, a vendor's marketing claim of APM compliance is
<span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> sufficient. While the APM specifications
strongly encourage laptop manufacturers to meet these standards,
there is some leeway given to them. If APM support is important to
you, make sure that the machine you are using meets these
requirements.</p><p>In addition to the actual APM driver, there are several
utilities available that use the APM kernel driver and the
/proc/apm directory. These utilities are located at
ftp://ftp.cs.unc.edu/pub/users/faith/linux and the current version
of the utilities is available in the file apmd-2.1.tar.gz. This
package includes a daemon process called apmd that logs battery
status, and a utility named apm that simply outputs the information
available in /proc/apm including the current battery level. For
those running X-Windows, a simple utility called xapm displays a
simple graph of battery life. And for those interested in hacking,
a C library called libapm.a is provided so users can write their
own utilities.</p><p>For those who have notebooks that do not have an adequate APM
implementation in the BIOS, there is at least one other option
available. A simple utility called hdparm is available which sets
many IDE parameters, including how much inactivity an IDE drive
should wait for before spinning down. The hdparm utility comes with
every current Linux distribution, and can be obtained from
ftp://tsx-11.mit.edu/pub/linux/sources/sbin/hdparm-2.7.tar.gz This
is not true APM, but it's better than nothing. Hard disks use
significant power and this simple utility can increase battery life
up to 50%, in my experience.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dc1580.0x1eba370"></a>X Window System</h2></div></div><p>While some Linux users purchase commercial implementations of
the X Window System, most people who use X-Windows with Linux
choose the XFree86 implementation. XFree86 is a freely
distributable implementation of the X Window System server for PCs
running Unix and Unix-like operating systems. Odds are your
favorite Linux distribution comes with the XFree86 X Window System
server.</p><p>As anyone who has ever done it before can attest, configuring
XFree86 can be quite a complex and occasionally frustrating task.
Notebooks can complicate things further; while you can replace an
unsupported video card in a desktop system with one known to work
well with Linux, laptop owners do not have that option.</p><p>Notebooks come in all varieties and use all manner of
components, including video chipsets. Some are well supported by
the current XFree86 implementation, whereas others may not be
supported or may offer only limited support. The Linux notebook
community has both development and documentation efforts for the
popular notebook video chipsets. Improvements to particular drivers
can occur frequently. Acquiring up-to-date information about
support for particular video chipsets is possibly the most
important aspect of getting X-Windows up and running well on a
notebook computer.</p><p>The most important source of information for running
X-Windows on Linux notebooks is Darin Ernst's World Wide Web page
X-Windows and Linux on Notebook Computers available at
<a href="http://www.castle.net/X-notebook/index_linux.html" target="_self">www.castle.net/X-notebook/index_linux.html</a>
<a href="1260f3.html" target="_self">(Figure 3)</a>. This site contains
breaking news and links to numerous development efforts and their
status. There are two World Wide Web pages that provide information
on XFree86 support for the Chips and Technologies CT655xx series of
video chipsets (the most widely used in recently-designed
notebooks) as well as a mailing list for developers. Other
prevalent video chipsets used in notebooks are produced by Cirrus
Logic and Western Digital, and these are documented as well. Links
to both these pages and many other sources of information are
available from the X-Windows and Linux on Notebook Computers
page.</p><p>In addition to the resources on the Web
<a href="1260s1.html" target="_self">(See sidebar)</a>, several Usenet
newsgroups are of interest to those wanting to run X on notebook
computers. In particular, comp.os.linux.x and
comp.windows.x.i386unix are the most relevant.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dc1580.0x1eba6e0"></a>Sound, Networking, and Accessories</h2></div></div><p>Many of the more recent notebooks come with integrated sound
cards that are compatible with popular standards such as
SoundBlaster. Many of these sound chipsets are new to the market or
are reduced-size variations of chipsets used on desktop sound
cards. Support for these chipsets can be found in the most recent
release of the Linux sound driver. It is maintained by Hannu
Savolainen at
<a href="http://personal.eunet.fi/pp/voxware" target="_self">personal.eunet.fi/pp/voxware</a>.
The sound drivers are updated more frequently than most popular
distributions, so checking the documentation at this site can
produce pleasant surprises. But just as with desktop machines,
SoundBlaster compatibility is often accomplished partly through
hardware and partly through MS-DOS-based software. Therefore, you
must take the same care when investigating a notebook's sound
capabilities as when choosing a sound board for a desktop
computer.</p><p>Networking with PCMCIA modems using SLIP or PPP is not
substantially different from using a desktop machine with an
internal or external modem. Simply remember to build SLIP or PPP
support into the kernel you use. PCMCIA Ethernet networking is
likewise similar to a desktop setup; you must have TCP/IP
networking support compiled in your kernel and the appropriate
PCMCIA Ethernet card device driver.</p><p>One exciting new networking project of which Linux has become
a part is Mobile IP. This software supports transparent host
mobility across TCP/IP networks and can be found at
<a href="http://anchor.cs.binghamton.edu/~mobileip" target="_self">http://anchor.cs.binghamton.edu/~mobileip/</a>
<a href="1260f4.html" target="_self">(Figure 4)</a>.</p><p>Almost all notebooks on the market today feature integrated
pointer devices which vary in size and shape and in how they
interface to the rest of the hardware. Most recently-designed
notebooks have pointer devices that are PS/2 devices, so linking
/dev/mouse to /dev/psaux and ensuring that support for PS/2 devices
is in the kernel is all you need to do.</p><p>Some older notebooks used special controller chipsets for
their pointer devices, some of which are supported in the kernel.
If you have one of these older notebooks, your pointer device may
or may not be supported. In any case, you can hook up a serial
mouse to your serial port and use that.</p><p>Many notebooks allow the use of external keyboards or mice,
frequently through an external PS/2 style port. Generally, these
devices are managed through hardware and should work seamlessly
with Linux. Most notebooks support external video monitors as well,
and larger resolutions of external monitors can be exploited under
X with properly configured XFree86 files.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dc1580.0x1ebaaa8"></a>Other Sources of Support</h2></div></div><p>Linux has a strong tradition of user-based support such as
the Linux Laptop Volunteer Support Database available at
<a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/kharker/linux-laptop/volunteer.html" target="_self">www.cs.utexas.edu/users/kharker/linux-laptop/volunteer.html</a>.
Volunteers provide their e-mail addresses and machine makes and
models. Those looking for help can search for their hardware and
find volunteers willing to answer installation or configuration
questions. This can also be an excellent way to find a working
XF86Config file. At the time of this writing there were over 200
volunteers from 36 countries.</p><p>The Linux Laptop Home Page that I maintain can serve as a
good springboard to the world of documentation and support
available for laptops running Linux and is available at
<a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/kharker/linux-laptop" target="_self">http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/kharker/linux-laptop/</a>
and
<a href="http://www.redhat.com/llhp/" target="_self">www.redhat.com/llhp/</a>.
Everything mentioned in this article and more can be found from the
Linux Laptop Home Page, which is updated regularly.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dc1580.0x22b2f60"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>The world of mobile Linux is very exciting. The ability to
take your workstation with you appeals to many people. Concerns
that choosing Linux as an operating system might limit access to or
benefits from the various features that make notebooks really
useful are largely unfounded. Active development and documentation
efforts are supporting all aspects of mobile computing under Linux.
If you've been considering running Linux on a notebook or laptop
computer, there's never been more interest or support than there is
now.</p></div></div>
