    I used Acucobol in an SCO Xenis environment in a previous
    job. I was happy with the product, so all I had to do to
    evaluate the Linux version was make sure it works as well as
    the Xenix one.

appeared in just about every comp.* newsgroup about COBOL. They are
irrelevant to this article. In evaluating
<a href="0109l1.html" target="_self">Acucobol</a> as a product, I'm
interested in whether the statements:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
move 2 to x.
add 3 to x.
</pre><p>produce a value of five, not whether it's better or worse to
code:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
x = 2;
x += 3:
</pre><p><a href="0109s2.html" target="_self">instead</a>.</p><p>I used Acucobol in an SCO Xenix environment in a previous
job. I was happy with the product, so all I had to do to evaluate
the Linux version was make sure that it works as well as the Xenix
one.</p><p>Like most commercial products currently available for Linux,
Acucobol has been ported to a large number of platforms. Acucobol
goes a step further. The Acucobol compiler actually translates the
COBOL source into a &ldquo;b-code&rdquo; file. When you execute an Acucobol
program, you actually run a b-code interpreter. It's no problem for
a program compiled on one sort of machine to be executed on any
other machine that runs Acucobol. You can compile programs on Linux
and run them on Sun workstations, Vaxen, or even MS-DOS or Windows
NT. (Yes, Acucobol is smart enough to convert <b  >/</b>
characters in paths to <b  >\</b>. I'm not sure what
happens when a component of the path is longer than eight
characters, however.)</p><p>If your last exposure to COBOL was in a mainframe, batch
processing environment, you will see some major differences.
Acucobol is not very fussy about which column statements begin in.
There are some significant new language features. One that I
particularly like is the <b  >EVALUATE</b> statement,
which is similar to the <span   class="emphasis"><em>switch</em></span> statement in C.
There are also a lot more places where an <b  >ELSE</b>
statement can be used. It's possible to reference substrings using
what is known in COBOL as &ldquo;reference modification&rdquo;; the form is
<span   class="emphasis"><em>data-name</em></span>
(<span   class="emphasis"><em>leftmost-position</em></span>:
<span   class="emphasis"><em>length</em></span>). The <b  >SCREEN
SECTION</b>, the windowing capability, and the ability for an
<b  >ACCEPT</b> statement to bring in an entire screen of
data are Acucobol extensions. It's even possible to reference
&ldquo;embedded procedures&rdquo; within the screen section.</p><p>Another new feature is a subprogram named
<b  >W$MENU</b>. Older versions of Acucobol came with a
subprogram named <b  >MENUBAR</b>. It was written
entirely in COBOL and worked very nicely. <b  >W$MENU</b>
has all of <b  >MENUBAR</b>'s capabilities, except one.
<b  >W$MENU</b> is designed so that your menus are always
activated by a hot key. Suppose you want the menu to appear
whenever your program requires a menu choice The only way I could
figure out to do it was to call another built-in subprogram,
<b  >W$KEYBUF</b>, which stuffs the input buffer. I used
<b  >W$KEYBUF</b> to stuff the hot key into the input
buffer, and the menu appeared. (Acucobol Inc. has promised to
provide a cleaner way of doing this in the future.)
<b  >W$MENU</b> is complemented by a rudimentary menu
generator; it's batch, not interactive.</p><p>It's possible to develop C functions that can be called by
Acucobol, and the manual does a good job of explaining how to do
this. The only problem is, the functions must be linked into the
b-code interpreter.</p><p>Acucobol uses neither termcap nor terminfo. Instead, it uses
a file named a_termcap, which you would normally install in the
/etc directory. The supplied a_termcap file contains an xterm
entry, but this entry had no color or graphics support. I was able
to create a color xterm entry by cannibalizing other a_termcap
entries. It ended up looking like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
xterm-c|color xterm:\
        :GO=\E(0:GF=\E(B:GM=qxlkmjvtwun:VB:\
        :C1=\E[30m:C2=\E[34m:C3=\E[32m:\
        :C4=\E[36m:C5=\E[31m:C6=\E[35m:\
        :C7=\E[33m:C8=\E[37m:\
        :B1=\E[40m:B2=\E[44m:B3=\E[42m:\
        :B4=\E[46m:B5=\E[41m:B6=\E[45m:\
        :B7=\E[43m:B8=\E[47m:UL@:RU@:tc=xterm:
</pre><p>Acucobol comes with a reference manual and a user's guide.
They are both loose-leaf and about 1,000 pages apiece. The manuals
are used for all Acucobol implementations, including Unix, MS-DOS,
and VMS.</p><p>Like any other COBOL implementation, Acucobol supports
sequential, indexed, and &ldquo;relative&rdquo; (direct-access) files.
Acucobol's indexed file system is called Vision, which is
proprietary to Acucobol. Vision files have keys and data combined
into a single file, and the index structure is b-tree. Vision is
efficient and reliable. The only problem is that if you want
non-Acucobol programs to access Vision files, you will have to buy
a license from Acucobol Inc. A more interesting solution is an
Acucobol add-on called &ldquo;Plug and Play&rdquo;. It works like this: All
COBOL ISAM statements (<b  >READ NEXT</b>,
<b  >START</b>, etc.) are mapped into a dispatch table.
In the standard Acucobol run-time, the table entries point to
Vision functions. You can replace this table with a different one,
so that the table entries point to D-ISAM or Codebase functions. I
have an evaluation copy of Codebase (the subject of my next review)
on my desk, so I plan to actually try this.</p><p>Acucobol should be capable of compiling and running any
standard-compliant COBOL program. However, unless the program has
no user interface whatsoever, you're probably going to want to do
some conversion work. In particular, Acucobol has an RM/COBOL
compatibility mode. It works perfectly well, but my experience has
been that it's still better to rearrange the way in which data is
displayed on and accepted from terminal screens, because Acucobol
allows you to do this in a less tedious fashion.</p><p>There's a substantial pile of application software and
add-ons available for Acucobol. Two worth mentioning are the MCBA
and Real World accounting packages.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a41580.0x1b3a268"></a>A Benchmark</h2></div></div><p>I developed a simple
<a href="0109l2.html" target="_self">benchmark</a> for Acucobol, which is a
translation of another benchmark I did for xBASE products. (See
<i  >Linux Journal</i> #14, June 1995, p. 27.) This
benchmark processed a file containing 33,830 records and was run on
a 66 mHz 486 with a SCSI disk.</p><p>It's reasonable to expect that Acucobol would be noticeably
slower than Flagship, since Flagship programs are compiled into
machine code, and Acucobol programs are compiled into b-codes,
which must be interpreted at run time.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="0109f1.jpg"></div><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Figure 1. Benchmark Results</p></blockquote></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a41580.0x1b3a630"></a>Other Observations</h2></div></div><p>Acucobol Inc. hosts a developers' conference in San Diego
every year. The next one is September 18-20. I haven't been to one
of these yet, but I've had good reports from them; attendees are
treated well by Acucobol, Inc.</p><p>There are references in the manuals to GUI and mouse support,
but they seem to be only for Windows NT. Acucobol, Inc. does seem
to be interested in offering some sort of UNIX GUI support
eventually.</p><p>This product will probably not be of much interest to
hard-core Linux people; they would rather program in C for free
than pay big bucks to use COBOL. It should be of interest to the
Linux community, though, that Acucobol, Inc. went to the trouble of
porting their product, because it gives Linux more
legitimacy.</p><p>However, the Linux version of
<a href="0109s1.html" target="_self">Acucobol</a> should be of great
importance to another community: system houses that develop and
maintain COBOL application software. When these system houses sell
a product to an end user, the end user must not only purchase the
application, s/he must also purchase the hardware the application
runs on and the rest of the software environment. For example, if
the application runs under Windows 95 or SCO Unix, either the
customer or the systems house must buy a copy of Windows 95 or SCO
Unix. A system house that has a COBOL application to sell can now
try to convince customers to accept Linux as the software
environment instead and can offer a lower total cost to the
customer.</p></div></div>
