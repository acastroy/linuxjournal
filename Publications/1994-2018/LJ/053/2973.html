Mr.
Oualline has a breezy style that is easy to read and understand.
Indeed, the format of the book is designed for easy readability.
The print is large, the margins wide, and there is plenty of white
space to keep the eye moving to the next line.
</p><p>Not just another book for the total novice,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Discover Linux</em></span> is written for the Linux
newcomer who is an experienced UNIX user. It covers a lot of
territory from the requisite installing Linux to setting up PPP to
using Linux in the office. Many of the applications discussed are
introduced with one or two short paragraphs, and a web address for
obtaining more information. The word processor LyX and
<span   class="bold"><b>ispell</b></span> are two that are handled
this way. Other applications, such as Applixware and
<span   class="bold"><b>xv</b></span>, are given more space and have
some options explained. Plenty of screen shots, all in black and
white, go along with the text.</p><p>On the subject of screen shots, about midway through the book
is a chapter (Part II, Chapter 8) on games in which every screen
saver available with X is shown in black and white. To me, this
seemed a bit of a waste of space. Also, all of the games are given
just an introductory sentence or two and a screen shot. There is
nothing in-depth here and that's fine. It is certainly not the
purpose of this book to provide a tutorial on every application;
rather, to give an overview that allows the user to pick from the
many options which appeal to her.</p><p>Sprinkled throughout the book are tips, cautions and short
anecdotes about various subjects; some are funny, some are not. All
provide some information and a nice break.</p><p>The first part of the book is called &ldquo;Up and Running with
Linux&rdquo;. It covers installation, getting started, getting help,
configuration and backing up. The information provided is complete
for those who already have some idea of what they are doing. The
instructions for installing Linux are given in an easy-to-follow
list format that should be understandable even to rank newbies.
Just follow the steps&mdash;one, two, three&mdash;and you have a working
Linux system. The book comes with the requisite CD-ROM which
contains Red Hat Linux 4.2, a step behind, as usual with books, but
certainly a very stable version for a newcomer. At any rate, the
instructions for installation are therefore geared towards Red Hat
users, as is true for all instructions throughout the book. Since
Red Hat is the only distribution on the CD-ROM, this makes
sense.</p><p>The second part of the book, &ldquo;Fun and Games&rdquo;, covers
connecting to the Internet as well as the games mentioned
previously. Again, Mr. Oualline provides step-by-step instructions
for connecting with PPP, including discussions of
<span   class="bold"><b>chat</b></span> scripts,
<span   class="bold"><b>minicom</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>pppd</b></span>. He also tells you how to
download and set up Netscape Navigator.</p><p>Part III is called &ldquo;Linux in the Office&rdquo; and covers mail
programs, the X Window File Manager, Linux as a server and DOS.
Mail programs, office applications and databases are treated
similarly to the games. A short introduction is given with an
example or screen shot and then a pointer is given to places on the
Web for more information. The author presents Applixware as a
bonus, stating &ldquo;Move over Microsoft.&rdquo; He ignores the fact that
StarOffice now comes with Caldera, stating only that the German
documentation makes it hard for English-only users. For Linux as a
server, he does a good job of presenting SMB, NFS and NIS, telling
you how to set up and use them. AMD, RAID, IPX and Appletalk are
mentioned briefly.</p><p>Part IV, &ldquo;Multimedia and Programming Tools&rdquo;, follows the
same pattern. Some subjects are given more attention than others,
but you find out something about everything. An interesting chapter
in this section is Chapter 14, &ldquo;Understanding the Initialization
Process&rdquo;, which explains the boot process, including Run Levels
and rc scripts.</p><p>Part V, &ldquo;Advanced Configuration&rdquo;, gives some details on
configuring XFree86 and customizing your window manager. It also
tells you what options are available if you get into trouble and
how to report bugs.</p><p>Besides the normal Appendices, there is a section (all on
blue paper, so you can find it easily) called &ldquo;Discovery Center&rdquo;
which provides a quick reference for accomplishing tasks and points
to the page in the book where these tasks are discussed more fully.
I felt this section was a good addition, providing a quick way for
the user to find the particular task she is interested in at the
moment.</p><p>All in all, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Discover Linux</em></span> is a good
reference for those with UNIX experience who are looking into this
radical operating system called Linux.</p></div></div>
