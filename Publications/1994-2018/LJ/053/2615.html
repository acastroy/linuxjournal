    Linux can provide technical managers with cost-effective,
    reliable training tools
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13a3580.0x149b348"></a></h2></div></div><p>Money is not always available to do
training in a business environment. Overall, businesses are looking
for cost-effective solutions. Finding training tools that are both
cost effective and reliable is not easy. This is especially true in
a technical environment. To teach UNIX and web-based technology,
Linux can provide technical managers with solutions to this
dilemma. This article describes how to set up a Linux system for
training on a token-ring network.
</p><p>Convincing others of the benefit of using Linux as a training
tool was not a problem in my particular scenario; this may not be
the case in other environments&mdash;it depends on the audience. My
situation involved introducing the product to a liberal management
staff. Their main concerns were maintenance and material costs;
they wanted a system that would not add substantial cost or bring
additional work to other groups. Linux fulfills both
criteria.</p><p>Completed projects provided the equipment. The candidate for
the Linux system was a Compaq Pentium 166MHz machine with 64MB of
RAM. It has a 1.2GB drive and a 4x ATAPI Sony CD-ROM. As a training
system, multiple users needed access to this machine, so a LAN
connection was required.</p><p>The network setup at my office is token ring. Network cables
and a spare IBM token ring PCI card provided the connections. The
system was placed in the computer center located on the first floor
of the building. It resides behind some AIX mini-computers that
cost over a quarter of a million dollars. The entire cost to the
company for the Linux system's hardware was nil, since it came from
another project. If the equipment had not been available, the total
estimated hardware costs would have been, at most, $1500.</p><p>After the hardware installation, the system was ready for
software installation. The Slackware version of Linux 2.0, from a
CD-ROM, became the operating system of choice, because it provides
many of the UNIX features the staff already uses in its core
systems. The first step of software installation involved creating
boot and root diskettes. Slackware provides several different
installation options, depending on the hardware. The bare.i and
color.gz files on the Slackware installation CD-ROM are the optimal
choice for our setup. Once these files were copied to a hard drive
on another computer, the <span   class="bold"><b>rawrite</b></span>
command included on the CD-ROM was used to create the boot and root
diskettes.</p><p>The boot diskette initiated the target system, which began
loading a subset of the Linux operating system into memory. Next,
the root diskette was loaded. This was enough to start the
installation of the system.</p><p>The next step involved creating a native Linux partition on
the hard drive, then loading the operating system. Slackware
provides an easy way to do this with its setup process. This
process is menu driven, and it allows you to install a mixture of
utilities. The setup in this environment included the basic Linux
system and X utilities.</p><p>After installing the software, configuring the system's
startup was next. The startup routine was set to load the kernel
from the hard drive. At that time, no network configuration took
place, because Slackware requires you to recompile the kernel if
you have a token-ring card.</p><p>At this point, the initial system was tested by running some
of the non-network commands. After checking the system, the kernel
was rebuilt for a token-ring network. Rebuilding the kernel so it
would recognize an IBM token-ring card with a Tropic chip set was
rather painless. This does require superuser access rights,
however.</p><p>First, from the /usr/src/Linux directory, the <b  >make
config</b> command was run, starting a shell script that
prompts the end user with questions to configure the operating
system. The prompts usually default to the system's last kernel
configuration. Below is the kernel modification for the token-ring
card:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;&lt;Token Ring driver support (CONFIG_TR)[N/y/?]-Y
 IBM Tropic chip set based adapter support
 (CONFIG_IBMTR)[N/y/m/?]-Y&gt;&gt;
</pre><p>No other commands need to be changed. Following the kernel
configuration, the next four make commands must run for the system
to recognize the changes:
<pre     class="programlisting">
make dep: make clean; make zImage; lilo
</pre>


Briefly, these commands will create the necessary dependencies,
remove object files, create the kernel image and allow the Linux
loader to recognize the kernel. Creating the kernel image takes the
most time. Depending on the machine, it could take as long as a
couple of hours.
</p><p>After the kernel was rebuilt, the file /etc/rc.d/rc.inet1
needed to be changed. This file loads all of the network addresses
for the system. The Ethernet network setup was modified to a token
ring by changing eth0 in the
<span   class="bold"><b>ifconfig</b></span> command to tr0:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/sbin/ifconfig eth0 ${IPADDR} broadcast\
${BROADCAST} netmask ${NETMASK}
</pre><p>The rc.inet file was set with the appropriate IP addresses.
The host file, /etc/hosts, was modified to provide an alias to some
common systems. The entire system was tested using the
<span   class="bold"><b>ping</b></span> command and by running a few
TELNET sessions.
</p><p>Although the system includes many of the X utilities, it was
not set up to run the X Window System. These utilities are
accessible from Windows NT workstations with X emulators, such as
PCXware. Most users at the site run these utilities, since they are
accessing this system using TELNET and browser sessions from their
workstations running Windows NT 4.0.</p><p>The next step involved configuring an Apache web server for
our Linux machine. We obtained the server from CD-ROM in a
compressed format. The <span   class="bold"><b>uncompress</b></span>
command was used to unpack the files in a directory called
/usr/local/httpd. In our setup, end users needed to create and view
their home pages. For example, I needed to be able to access my
home page, called index.html, from my directory at
/home/kitsukic/www/. This required a modification to the srm.conf
file, which locates home pages and sets special parameters that
affect servicing of end users. This file is located in the
/var/lib/httpd/conf directory. In this scenario, change the value
of <b  >UserDir</b> from <b  >local_dir</b> to
<b  >www</b>. Hence, to get to my home page, my call
would be http://145.225.56.23:82/~kitsukic/. The server now allows
a browser to access my home page in /home/kitsukic/www/.</p><p>In addition, the port number in the main server configuration
file, /var/lib/httpd/conf/httpd.conf, needs to be changed from 80
to 82. The reason it needs to be changed is that another process
uses port 80. Once the changes to the configuration files were
done, the following command was activated in the /etc/rc.d/rc_httpd
file:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/usr/sbin/httpd -f
</pre><p>This starts the Apache <span   class="bold"><b>httpd</b></span>
server whenever the system is booted. Overall, the entire
installation of the server was straightforward and did not require
much effort. A mock user's web pages served to test the web server.
</p><p>The final step of the installation involved creating
processes that would make the system maintenance-free. The
<span   class="bold"><b>cron</b></span> command provides the Linux
user with this capability. The cron command runs backup and
file-cleanup processes at specific times of the day. For the backup
process, it runs a script that compresses and transfers essential
files to another machine. Another process run by the cron command
purges old log and trash files periodically. The two processes are
somewhat maintenance-free. In order to create these scheduled jobs,
the administrator must run the <b  >crontab -e</b>
routine from the root login, which provides a vi editor
environment. Using this editor, the administrator can create a list
of jobs for the cron command to run at specific times. For example,
he or she could create an entry to tell users to log off the system
every day at 6:00 PM in order to do backups at this time.</p><p>For training purposes, the system was loaded with C++ and
Perl. Programmers can safely run C++ and Perl code without
affecting the larger systems. The Linux system also hosts a group
home page that links to the staff's web sites. There are also links
to tutorials on how to create web pages. The main page also links
to an experimental SQL database. It demonstrates to the user how to
use HTML commands to connect and extract data from an SQL
database.</p><p>Currently, the Linux system is open to anyone within the
department who wishes to experiment with creating web-based
products using C++, Perl and a UNIX operating system. Programmers
have been creating web pages using HTML and Java. Several
non-programmer analysts have used this system to start learning how
to program in C++ and HTML. As of this date, there have been no
system crashes. The system has been reliable and maintenance-free
from the start.</p><p>As businesses look toward cutting costs, Information Systems
managers in UNIX environments need to find creative solutions to
train their staff. One alternative is using Linux. Although the
stigma of being a hacker's non-supported operating system remains,
Linux is surprisingly easy to install and maintain. It offers a
rather inexpensive system, with many of the UNIX features common in
bigger ones. This makes it attractive to managers trying to cut
training costs while at the same time trying to keep their staff
technically trained.</p></div></div>
