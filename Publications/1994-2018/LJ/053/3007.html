    This article describes the process of porting a variety of
    audio applications from the SGI platform to the Linux
    operating system.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29ad580.0x2aa5768"></a></h2></div></div><p>The process used to port SGI audio
applications was reflective of Linux's own distributed
developments&mdash;a truly international collaboration dependent on
Internet communication. It is still a work in progress, with
improvements and extensions to the software being created and
contributed by programmers around the world.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29ad580.0x2aa5870"></a>Background</h2></div></div><p>NoTAM is the Norwegian network for Technology, Acoustics and
Music research located at the University of Oslo. Professor Oyvind
Hammer of NoTAM wrote a series of applications designed to aid
musicians and researchers in the analysis and representation of
sound. Written originally for Silicon Graphics (SGI) computers,
these applications utilize the graphics capabilities of the X
Window System and make use of SGI's audio and sound file systems.
Many applications offer basic and advanced editing features as well
as sound file playback capability.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29ad580.0x2aa5978"></a>Preliminaries</h2></div></div><p>Although not traditionally thought of as an audio platform,
Linux already has several sound file editing and processing
systems. Packages such as MiXViews, Snd, XWave and the CERES
Soundstudio are available for audio recording, editing and
playback. Many other packages can be found on the Internet. The
Linux Soundapps page (see Resources), which I maintain, is a
comprehensive and up-to-date list of Linux-based audio
applications.</p><p>The editing capabilities of the NoTAM software are of a
different nature: edits are performed on the graphic results of a
Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of a sound file. Explaining FFTs is
beyond the scope of this article, but the results of a transform
are usually depicted in a &ldquo;spectral representation&rdquo;, i.e., a
representation of frequency versus time. With the appropriate
software, edits can then be made directly on the frequency content
of a sound. Until recently, Linux had no such software, so porting
the NoTAM applications to Linux was an attractive prospect.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29ad580.0x2aa5ad8"></a>Starting Out</h2></div></div><p>When the NoTAM source code (made publicly available by Dr.
Hammer and NoTAM) was examined, I noted that the graphics code
consisted of plain X calls, and its sound support consisted of
calls to the SGI-specific audio and audiofile libraries. Many of
the applications were built with Motif. Since the necessary X
libraries and LessTif (a freely available replacement for the Motif
libraries) were already available, all that was needed in order to
do the port were replacements for the audio and audiofile
libraries. I contacted Dr. Hammer and asked him for permission to
try porting the software to Linux, and with his gracious consent,
the porting project began.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29ad580.0x2aa5be0"></a>Scouting Around</h2></div></div><p>Looking over an excellent web page dedicated to SGI audio
applications (maintained by Doug Cook), I noticed a sound-file
editor named <span   class="bold"><b>DAP</b></span> (Digital Audio
Processor), written by Richard Kent. DAP uses the XForms libraries,
so I inquired about the possibility of a Linux port. Richard
informed me that he had already written such a port, and when I
mentioned I wanted to port some other software written for the SGI
to Linux, he graciously supplied the code used in DAP to replace
the SGI audio and audiofile libraries and headers. The Linux
versions of libaudio.a, libaudiofile.a and their associated header
files are virtually direct &ldquo;plug-in&rdquo; replacements, meaning I
could leave the NoTAM sources relatively intact.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29ad580.0x2aa5d40"></a>Porting Begins</h2></div></div><p>Armed with X11, Richard's replacement code and LessTif, I
attempted my first port. I chose Dr. Hammer's
<span   class="bold"><b>Sono</b></span>. This program analyzes a
sound file and creates a PostScript sonograph of the spectral
analysis. Since Sono does not display the graphics, instead relying
on external display mechanisms, the port was fairly trivial,
requiring only minor modifications.</p><p>With this first success, I moved on to another relatively
straightforward program, <span   class="bold"><b>PTPS</b></span>,
which creates a PostScript graph of a pitch-tracking analysis. PTPS
also compiled easily with only small changes, so I decided to
attempt a more substantial port.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Ceres</b></span> is an FFT-based
program, but its design goes far beyond the simplicity of Sono and
PTPS. Ceres renders the FFT results into a graphic display which
can then be edited directly and saved as a new sound file. The
challenge in porting Ceres was primarily in the X programming.
Since no real-time aspects were involved, there were no problems
with audio playback. There were, however, problems with the use of
variable-length Xt argument lists which, in theory, must be
terminated with a NULL entry. The SGI compiler and libraries did
not appear to require this NULL; however, the Linux GCC compiler
and libraries were stricter, and Ceres would fail with a
segmentation fault upon opening if the NULL was missing. In
addition, a problem with different maximum random numbers
(<b  >RAND_MAX</b>) between SGI and Linux caused a crash
when using the Random Sieve transform. Once these two problems were
solved, the porting of Ceres was complete.</p><p>I then decided to do an even more ambitious port, Dr.
Hammer's <span   class="bold"><b>Mix</b></span> package. Mix is a
9-channel audiofile mixer with graphic waveform displays, graphic
volume and panning curves, a scripting language for complex mixes,
and real-time effects processing. (See Figure 1.) Obviously, audio
playback capabilities are exploited to the full. I thought porting
Mix would be by far the most difficult challenge, yet with
Richard's replacement libraries (and some judicious code-cutting),
I was quickly able to compile the Mix application, and Linux now
has an excellent 9-channel, sound file mixer.</p><p><a href="3007f1.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 1. Mix
Screenshot</b></span></a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29ad580.0x2aa6210"></a>Releasing the Packages</h2></div></div><p>I placed the ported programs and their sources on the Music
Technology Department's FTP server at Bowling Green State
University in Ohio, I then notified Dr. Hammer of our successes (he
was pleased we had achieved so much), and I also advised NoTAM that
their software was now available for Linux. NoTAM obtained the
packages and placed them on their server, making the applications
easily available to everyone. I also sent notices to the Csound
mailing list and comp.os.linux.announce to inform the Linux
community of the availability of these packages.</p><p>Since the releases were made public, development has
continued. Working from our source packages and Richard's library
code, the Swedish composer Reine Jonsson has contributed a version
of Mix which now handles the popular WAV format sound files (the
original Mix, along with the other NoTAM packages, supports only
AIFF format files), while reducing loading times and enhancing
playback smoothness (a critical factor on my 486/120). A new
version of Ceres (see Figure 2) called Ceres2 is in development by
Johnathan Lee and should be available in a Linux port by the time
this article is published.</p><p><a href="3007f2.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 2. Ceres
Screenshot</b></span></a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29ad580.0x2aa6478"></a>Further Development</h2></div></div><p>Improvements can still be made: the applications ported so
far are reasonably stable but will sometimes crash for no apparent
reason. In some cases, not all of the original functionality is
available, particularly if the package uses routines specific to
the SGI's audio hardware capabilities. The Mix source code, for
instance, includes calls to the SGI MIDI interface, but a
replacement library for those calls has yet to be written. For now,
I have had to disable the MIDI control code in the Mix sources. I
have received a substantial amount of mail from users who have
expressed interest in seeing more of this porting development, and
my hopes are high that we will soon have a replacement for the SGI
MIDI libraries to add to the audio and audiofile libraries already
supported.</p><p>It must be mentioned that the NoTAM packages are not the only
sources for high-quality UNIX audio-processing software available
for possible porting. Guenter Geiger has successfully ported Paul
Lansky's <span   class="bold"><b>RT</b></span>, another real-time,
sound file mixer with excellent scripting capabilities. Work
proceeds on ports of Paul Lansky's
<span   class="bold"><b>Ein</b></span> (a DSP scratch pad), Mara
Helmuth's <span   class="bold"><b>Patchmix</b></span> (a graphic
patcher for the Cmix audio-processing language), and Russell
Pinkston's <span   class="bold"><b>XPatchWork</b></span> (similar to
Patchmix, but using the Csound language). Many other audio-related
packages are available for Linux, and the interested reader should
look at the Linux Soundapps web page for a continuously updated and
comprehensive listing.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29ad580.0x2aa6738"></a>Final Thoughts</h2></div></div><p>When I first used Linux I was thrilled by its possibilities,
but dismayed by the lack of high-quality sound-processing software.
Nevertheless, I was inspired by the availability of source code and
the willingness of the Linux community to help develop audio
applications. Since I am not a programmer, I relied on the skill,
experience and advice of Linux users around the world. Like Linux
itself, these projects were developed by a distributed
collaborative effort, heavily dependent on the Internet for all
communication, and built with freely available tools and
libraries.</p><p>Thanks to Dr. Oyvind Hammer, Richard Kent, the LessTif
developers and the XFree86 project, Linux audio software grows in
quantity and quality almost daily. I encourage interested
developers to contact me and let me know what they're working on or
what they wish to work on. Many projects are waiting for developers
who would like to contribute their talent and interest to the
rapidly growing Linux audio and music software base.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29ad580.0x2aa6898"></a>Technical Considerations</h2></div></div><p>by Richard Kent</p><p>When I first heard of Dave's project to port audio
applications from an SGI-based environment to Linux, I was very
interested in becoming involved&mdash;particularly because the sheer
dearth of audio applications for UNIX was the primary reason for
programming the Digital Audio Processor. I initially implemented
DAP for SGI-based systems, but shortly before Dave contacted me, I
successfully ported DAP to run in a Linux-based environment. (See
Figure 3.) This experience helped greatly when porting the NoTAM
applications. This sidebar is intended to detail the three main
technical considerations when attempting such ports.</p><p><a href="3007f3.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 3.
Digital Audio Processor</b></span></a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29ad580.0x2aa6b00"></a>Audio and Audiofile Libraries</h2></div></div><p>Most, if not all, SGI audio applications make extensive use
of the excellent audio and audiofile libraries supplied with IRIX.
The audiofile library provides an API primarily designed to allow
effortless loading and saving of AIFF audio files. The audio
library is designed to allow straightforward audio input and output
as well as control global audio settings. In order to make porting
as painless as possible, replacement libraries had to be written
for the Linux operating system.</p><p>The audiofile library was tackled first. Since this library
simply has to perform file I/O based on the calls made, it was
relatively straightforward to set up the necessary AIFF structures
and to initialize, load and save these structures as necessary.
However, because samples are read from and written to disk one
sample frame at a time, this straightforward port of the audiofile
library is relatively slow. In addition, only AIFF files are
supported&mdash;compressed AIFF-C and WAV format files are not.</p><p>The audio library was a more demanding port, requiring
extensive investigation into the facilities provided by the Open
Sound System (OSS/Free) driver which is, by default, compiled into
the Linux kernel. The basic process when using OSS involves opening
/dev/dsp and either writing sample data directly to the device or
reading from the device. In addition, opening /dev/mixer allows
control over the global audio settings.</p><p>The Linux conversion basically sets up internal sample queues
and provides facilities to transfer these sample queues to and from
/dev/dsp. Most complications which arose were due to the many
different sample formats (resolution and number of channels)
supported by both the audio library and the OSS driver, thus
requiring many different data conversions on input and
output.</p><p>The resulting audio library on Linux is very much a &ldquo;brute
force&rdquo; conversion and differs significantly from the SGI-based
library, despite the almost identical API. The main difference is
that the Linux audio library is not threaded whereas the SGI-based
library constantly inputs and outputs sample frames from a cyclic
queue in the background. As a result, the API user needs to be
aware that samples must be constantly written to or read from the
device to avoid audio glitches. Also, when finishing sample
playback, blank samples must be written to the device to force the
remaining sample queue to play before closing the device. The other
main difference is that only one audio &ldquo;port&rdquo; may be open at any
given time, due to the exclusive nature of opening /dev/dsp.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29ad580.0x2e9efb8"></a>Compiler Differences</h2></div></div><p>The default SGI compiler is quite different from
<span   class="bold"><b>gcc</b></span>, which is the most commonly
used compiler on Linux. More specifically, the SGI compiler is
&ldquo;relaxed&rdquo; and not nearly as strict as gcc. This manifests itself
in several ways, which must be considered when porting software
from one platform to the other.</p><p>The most obvious difference is that explicit casting is often
required on gcc to avoid warnings and errors which do not occur
when using the SGI compiler. Two examples are shown here.</p><p>Default SGI compiler accepts:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
int x = 3.2;
int *y = calloc (10,sizeof (int));
</pre><p>Linux gcc requires:
<pre     class="programlisting">
int x = (int) 3.2;
int *y = (int *) calloc (10,sizeof (int));
</pre>


Correct link order is also more important when using the Linux gcc
linker. The default SGI linker appears to place little importance
on the order of link components (object files and libraries) when
linking, as long as all &ldquo;loose ends&rdquo; are tied up by the end of
the linking process. The Linux gcc linker, which I freely admit to
not fully understanding, is much stricter and frequently requires
reordering of link components and sometimes even duplication of
linked libraries.
</p><p>Another major difference between the SGI default compiler and
gcc arises when combining C and C++ files where the C files cannot,
for syntactic reasons or otherwise, be passed through the C++
compiler. When using the default SGI compiler, the command for
compiling both C and C++ files is CC, so there is no need to
explicitly specify linkage specification using the
<b  >extern</b> C construct. When using the gcc
development environment, the command to compile C files is gcc and
the command to compile C++ files is g++; thus, the linkage
specification must be specified when referring to C-based functions
within C++ files, or else linking will fail due to C++ name
mangling.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29ad580.0x2e9f380"></a>Variable Argument Lists</h2></div></div><p>One final major difference between SGI and Linux development
environments is that of variable argument lists for Xt and Motif
function calls. The Xt toolkit provides the developer with basic
GUI constructs which may be used directly to create a user
interface. In addition, Motif and LessTif use the Xt toolkit to
provide a higher-level API for constructing user interfaces.</p><p>Within these toolkits are functions which have a variable
number of arguments, much like the standard
<span   class="bold"><b>printf</b></span> system call. Unlike printf,
these functions require a null entry to terminate the argument
list. However, in the SGI development environment, these null
entries are optional and SGI developers frequently forget to
terminate the argument list with such an entry. This does not cause
a problem on SGI-based systems, but if this same code is then
compiled in a Linux environment, the resulting executable will
almost certainly core dump upon execution. The fix is simply to add
the missing null entries to the relevant calls.</p><p><a href="3007s2.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
