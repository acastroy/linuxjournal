    just that.

send multiple people the same message. One hundred letters can be
sent as easily as one letter, and for the same price&mdash;absolutely
nothing. Because of this, e-mail is the natural choice for
distributing identical information to a group of people. Along with
its benefits, though, e-mail has brought its share of problems&mdash;the
biggest one is spam. However, just as there are legitimate uses for
bulk mail, there are legitimate uses for mass e-mail mailings.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x168b580.0x1783920"></a>The Digital Mail Room</h2></div></div><p>Smart companies on the Internet are replacing expensive paper
mailings with digital mailings whenever possible. It looks
antiquated when a company&mdash;especially one in the computer
industry&mdash;sends me a press release by mail. Doing so reflects
poorly on its understanding of technology. Physical goods can't be
delivered digitally, but information is destined to be transmitted
like e-mail: effortlessly and inexpensively. However, many
businesses are already having a difficult time managing the flow of
e-mail and can easily have numerous mailing lists with thousands of
addresses. Sockem Software's first product, SockMail, was created
to help organizations effectively use lists of e-mail addresses.
SockMail is described by its creators as a &ldquo;100% Java
client/server e-mail list management system&rdquo;, and it is just that.
Web sites overburdened with extensive lists of e-mail addresses
will find this application valuable.</p><p><a href="2933f2.jpg" target="_self">Figure 1. SockMail
Window</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x168b580.0x1783ad8"></a>Sockem Software: A Java Start-up</h2></div></div><p>Sockem Software is a 100% Java software start-up based in New
York City's &ldquo;Silicon Alley&rdquo;. The company is focused on Java
because it believes the language's multi-platform and networking
strengths will be successful in the marketplace. Java will provide
the foundation for all of Sockem Software's client/server
applications. In the company's eyes, a browser with a JVM (Java
Virtual Machine) is the universal client. If Java is the mantra of
Sockem Software, e-mail is the mantra of SockMail.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x168b580.0x1783be0"></a>Sign Me Up</h2></div></div><p>Web sites commonly have a text box in which people can sign
up to be included on or dropped from a mailing list. This is
usually done by having a CGI (common gateway interface) such as a
Perl script send the information to someone who then manually adds
and deletes names on a list of subscribers. It is difficult to
automate this process with scripts and clumsy to paste names into a
mail program in the blind copy field. SockMail's primary goal is to
make the whole process of creating, maintaining and sending out
information to lists of e-mail addresses as efficient as possible.
It's a very simple and focused application that doesn't do much
more than that. Users do a lot of the work by adding and deleting
themselves from mailing lists. This is its big selling point for
companies wanting to automate their web site subscription lists.
SockMail's interface is functional but not pretty&mdash;it has the look
of a shareware application.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x168b580.0x1783ce8"></a>Listserv and Majordomo</h2></div></div><p>Unlike Listserv and Majordomo mail programs where users send
commands within an e-mail to add or delete themselves from mailing
lists, SockMail's lists are maintained through Java applets.
Additionally, SockMail doesn't allow posting to people on a list.
It is specifically designed for sending out mail to lists, not to
facilitate communication between people on a list. A Listserv or
Majordomo system could be configured to have much the same
functionality as SockMail, but these systems are more difficult to
set up and maintain. SockMail is much easier to install and
integrate with a web site or Intranet; however, it could never
replace a Listserv or Majordomo program.</p><p><a href="2933f3.jpg" target="_self">Figure 2. E-mail
Window</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x168b580.0x1783ea0"></a>Target Market, Target Mail</h2></div></div><p>SockMail is designed for businesses with mailing lists of no
more than 50,000 people. This number should be adequate for all but
the largest company mailings and will hopefully dissuade spammers
from abusing the application. It is an ideal tool for distributing
press releases, e-zines, company updates, invitations or any
targeted mailing. A large company could also manage internal
mailing lists easily with SockMail. It is not designed for blind
mass mailings or spamming. This product could be used to do that,
but its potential to send out truly massive lists is limited. The
lists have to be loaded into the browser, so available memory
limits the potential number of recipients. Additionally, the server
may run into memory problems sending to lists of over 50,000 names.
In part, this is because Java uses static memory allocation for its
applications. By default the server allocates around 20MB of
memory, and this limit can be raised or lowered using options in
the Java interpreter.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x168b580.0x1783fa8"></a>100% Java Installation</h2></div></div><p>SockMail can be installed via a command line or GUI
(graphical user interface). The application installs in literally
seconds because the whole thing is only 197KB. It is designed to be
purchased and downloaded over the Internet and is not available on
CD-ROM or floppy disk. However, because SockMail is truly platform
independent, it requires the use of the command line to start the
GUI installation. This could be a little confusing for the novice
Windows NT user, but a system administrator or anyone used to UNIX
should have no problem getting the install up and running.</p><p><a href="2933f4.jpg" target="_self">Figure 3. Preference
Window</a></p><p>The install is done with JShield because the company insisted
on keeping the application 100% Java; WinInstall uses Windows
native code. However, it is not just a case of getting hooked on
Java. Since it is 100% Java, the whole program can be installed
remotely using TELNET. Most servers have remote administration
capabilities, but taking its network-friendly cue from UNIX,
everything on SockMail can done without being on a console. On
Windows NT, this type of remote installation is rare, and Sockem
Software has done a good job of building this functionality into
the application.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x168b580.0x17841b8"></a>The Server</h2></div></div><p>To deliver client applets, the SockMail server must be
running on the same computer as a web server, which limits its
scalability. SockMail Pro, due out soon, will be able to run
independently of a web server. The SockMail server has its own 100%
Java database used to store e-mail addresses. It is a proprietary
database without JDBC (Java database connectivity) functionality
which could lead to problems in an enterprise setting. The server
processes all requests from clients to add and delete names from
lists and must have access to a local JVM (Java Virtual Machine).
Although the server component is 100% Java, it can't function on
most Windows 95 or Macintosh desktops, because most JVMs for
Windows 95 and Macintosh don't support the TCP/IP socket
connections the SockMail server needs. Security must be set up once
the server is installed. Security features include an
administrative login, IP filtering and separate administrative
port. Only one user login is allowed. The server can handle
multiple tasks, simultaneously updating one list and mailing to
another.</p><p><a href="2933f5.jpg" target="_self">Figure 4. Server
Window</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x168b580.0x1784370"></a>The Clients</h2></div></div><p>SockMail uses three client applets: one to administer the
server, one to add and one to delete addresses. Users can add and
delete themselves from lists, but mailings can be performed only
from the administrative applet; this applet is just 85KB and loads
quickly. The <span   class="bold"><b>add</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>delete</b></span> clients are less than 30KB
each. The applets can be customized to fit the look and feel of a
particular web site. The clients run on any browser with a Sun
compatible JVM version 1.02 or later. In case users don't have a
Java-enabled browser, SockMail includes two HTML forms with CGI
scripts. These can also be used to add and delete addresses.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x168b580.0x1784528"></a>Built-in Intelligence</h2></div></div><p>SockMail includes the ability to intelligently retrieve
e-mail addresses from web sites. A spider can search an entire web
site, collect any e-mail addresses and add them to a specified
list. This feature could give the product a bad name; however, the
spider can search only about 1000 pages before running out of
memory. This limits its usefulness as a tool for spamming. For
quickly scanning a single URL, however, the spider works well. It
is a useful tool for collecting contact information. It only picks
up addresses after the <b  >mailto</b> attribute.</p><p>To be more web friendly, the spider identifies itself as a
robot. Webmasters can put configuration files on their pages to
inform the spider not to search the site. As these intelligent
agents become common, sites not wanting to be searched are starting
to deny access to them.</p><p>SockMail also includes an easy way to check the InterNIC
database for information about an e-mail address. For any
registered domain, SockMail can query the InterNIC to find out the
technical, administrative and billing contact information.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x168b580.0x1784738"></a>The Potential for Linux and Java</h2></div></div><p>Sockem Software is a strong supporter of Linux. The company
moved its own web site off of Sun Solaris and is a complete Linux
shop. SockMail was developed on Linux boxes using Emacs, the newest
versions of which have Java editing tools. The biggest advantage to
developing Java on MS Windows remains the visual editing tools that
are available on that platform. However, many visual development
programs use version 1.1. of the JVM, which can lead to
incompatibilities with version 1.0 used by most older browsers. By
developing on Linux, Java programmers are assured they will be
developing 100% Java because there are no proprietary JVMs on
Linux. Organizations such as Blackdown (http://www.blackdown.org/)
ported the JVM to Linux, and standard distributions of Linux
include a JVM.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x168b580.0x1784840"></a>Looking Forward</h2></div></div><p>Sockem Software is planning a SockMail Pro version, due
sometime soon. This will address some of the current product's
shortcomings. One limitation of SockMail is that it has only one
user login. SockMail Pro will allow multiple user accounts with
varying levels of access. SockMail Pro will also have its own Java
web server to eliminate the need to have it running on the same
computer as a site's web server, and will allow people to use the
product independently of a web site. The SockMail Pro server will
be able to run on a dedicated computer. In addition to a 100% Java
version of the server, Sockem Software plans to have a Windows NT
version compiled natively. This is being done with Supercede (a
Paul Allen company). This NT-only version will also be available
with WinInstall, so that the whole installation can be done through
a GUI.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x168b580.0x1784948"></a>The Future of E-mail</h2></div></div><p>SockMail is targeted towards a growing market. E-mail is
undoubtedly the most popular application on the Internet. As much
as the graphical WWW, it has fueled the astronomical growth of the
Internet. E-mail is cutting down the amount of time we spend on the
telephone, and may eventually force the handwritten letter to take
its place in history next to the carrier pigeon and telegram. Like
any other form of communication, though, e-mail requires courtesy
and common sense. Nothing is as impersonal as a form letter, except
possibly a form e-mail. This lesson applies to SockMail. A
potential risk is involved when increasing the amount of e-mail we
receive and send. Communication loses its value when it doesn't
understand its audience. SockMail allows individuals to easily sign
up for mailings they're interested in and drop mailings they don't
want. In this way, control over information is as much in the hands
of consumers as producers. Let's hope this relationship stays in
balance.</p></div></div>
