    Are you hesitant about porting your favorite VGA MS-DOS
    program to Linux? Using this tutorial and SVGALIB, porting
    will truly become a matter of minutes.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdab580.0xea3348"></a></h2></div></div><p>I first started VGA programming under
MS-DOS, using the popular DJGPP C compiler. In recent years, this
protected-mode 32-bit compiler, which is basically an MS-DOS port
of <span   class="bold"><b>gcc</b></span>, has established itself as
one of the preferred compilers in the MS-DOS game programmers'
community. DJGPP was in fact the MS-DOS compiler of choice for
idsoftware's game Quake. For the Linux console port of Quake, the
Linux Super VGA library, SVGALIB was used.
</p><p>When I first decided that I was going to port my own 3-D
Model Viewer, <span   class="bold"><b>jaw3d</b></span>, from MS-DOS
to Linux, it seemed logical to use the same approach. SVGALIB is
very intuitive and allows me to easily maintain and further develop
my 3-D Model Viewer for both platforms.</p><p>I found the easiest way to work with one set of source files
for both platforms was to use preprocessor directives in places
where different code was needed. Since I had already written and
used DJGPP's low-level VGA and mouse instructions for the MS-DOS
version, I simply added the equivalent SVGALIB Linux code in each
instance, and separated the MS-DOS and Linux code using the
preprocessor directive <b  >#ifdef</b>. The following
code snippet represents one of the many ways in which this can be
accomplished:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#ifdef __DJGPP__
...
...
#endif
#ifndef __DJGPP__
...
...
#endif
</pre><p><b  >__DJGPP__</b> is automatically defined by the
DJGPP compiler, and is not defined by gcc under Linux.
</p><p>An additional advantage of using SVGALIB under Linux is the
fact that there is also a DJGPP version of SVGALIB. Let's try not
to get confused at this point: SVGALIB is a graphics library that
does some behind-the-scenes low-level VGA and mouse work for the
user. Although SVGALIB was first developed for Linux, someone
eventually released a version that worked with DJGPP under MS-DOS.
Why not use SVGALIB for both MS-DOS and Linux? This would allow us
to have 100% identical code for both platforms.</p><p>I don't recommend this approach, however, for two reasons.
First, when I made speed comparisons of my 3-D engine between the
two platforms, I noticed that when using SVGALIB with DJGPP under
MS-DOS, graphics performance was sluggish in comparison with
SVGALIB under Linux. Second, the MS-DOS executable was
unnecessarily big because it had to be statically linked with the
SVGALIB library. Using SVGALIB under Linux did not seem to present
any problems. Due to the use of shared libraries under Linux, the
executable remained tiny when dynamically linked, and graphics
performance was actually slightly better under Linux than under
MS-DOS. For the sake of performance and executable size, I found it
best to use DJGPP's low-level instructions under MS-DOS and to use
SVGALIB under Linux. This makes a difference, especially in a
setting like 3-D engines, where every frame-per-second
counts.</p><p>The advantage obtained from using the DJGPP port of SVGALIB
is the fact that you can test your SVGALIB Linux code under MS-DOS,
without having to reboot. Except for speed and executable size,
both versions of SVGALIB behave identically.</p><p>Note that the DJGPP port of SVGALIB is still in beta, but I
ran across only one minor problem and that was easily fixed. The
file vgakeybo.h included with the DJGPP port of SVGALIB seemed to
differ from the file vgakeyboard.h under Linux; therefore, making
cross compilations was impossible in cases where keyboard code was
used. The two files should be identical, of course, and the
solution is to copy the Linux version of the include file over the
DOS one.</p><p>The three compiler-specific code aspects are VGA, mouse input
and keyboard input. If you have completed an MS-DOS graphics
application, you may be using much of this code already and can
quickly add on the SVGALIB equivalent code. On the other hand, if
you do not have any previous graphics programming experience, you
will find the code shown in Listings 1 through 4 to be very
useful.</p><p><a href="2279l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1. Include

is first rendered onto a buffer which has the same dimensions as
the screen, and then copied to video memory all at once, allowing
us to display frequently updated screens successively without any
flickering. This is done as follows:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
        memcpy (video_buff, image_buffer,
                DIM_X * DIM_Y);
        /* video_buff was initialized above */
        dosmemput (image_buffer, DIM_X * DIM_Y,
                0xA0000);
        /* 0xA0000 is the video memory in VGA mode
         * 13h */
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdab580.0xea3ce8"></a>Waiting for the VGA Retrace</h2></div></div><p>By waiting for the VGA retrace, we are telling the program to
wait until the monitor's electron beam reaches the bottom of the
screen. Since there is a short pause before it jumps back to the
top, it is a good moment to switch palettes without seeing
&ldquo;rainbow colors&rdquo;. Thus, before switching palettes, we should wait
for the VGA retrace as follows:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
        while (!(inportb(0x3da) &amp; 8));
        while ( (inportb(0x3da) &amp; 8));
        vga_waitretrace();
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdab580.0xea3e48"></a>Setting the VGA Palette</h2></div></div><p>The following code assumes you have a character array of 768
values, representing the RGB values for 256 colors. For
example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
char palette[768];
        where palette[0] = R value of color 0;
        where palette[1] = G value of color 0;
        where palette[2] = B value of color 0;
                ...
        for (i = 0; i &lt; 256; i++)
        vga_setpalette(i, palette[i*3],
                palette[i*3+1], palette[i*3+2]);
        outportb(0x3C8,0);
        for (i = 0; i &lt; 768; i ++)
                outportb(0x3C9, palette[i]);
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdab580.0xea3fa8"></a>Compiling</h2></div></div><p>After adding SVGALIB code to the program, it's time to
compile. Simply compile with the <b  >-lvga</b> option to
link the SVGALIB library. This library is preinstalled on most
Linux systems; thus, if you experience problems linking it, you
probably don't have it installed and should download it.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>jaw3d</b></span> was programmed by the
