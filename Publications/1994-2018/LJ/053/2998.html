    The next generation fully portable graphics library
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d77580.0x1e6f450"></a></h2></div></div><p>We didn't like the idea of another
graphics library, but when we checked the available solutions at
the time the GGI project was initiated, we found nothing that would
fit all our needs:
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Portability</p></li><li><p>Simplicity</p></li><li><p>Transparent acceleration support</p></li><li><p>Multihead support</p></li><li><p>Extensibility</p></li><li><p>Small size</p></li></ul></div>

Most of these issues had been addressed by one interface or the
other, but there was none that fulfilled them simultaneously. Let
us talk about those issues in more detail.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d77580.0x1e6f9d0"></a>Portability</h2></div></div><p>First of all, portability is our only weapon against the
commercial software market. If we are so portable that we can run
on any platform, including the mainstream market, we might be able
to get those nice programs, because it is no problem to port
them.</p><p>The X Window System is about as portable as a program gets
and X applications are normally fairly portable. However, using X
is often overkill and causes considerable overhead. Moreover,
writing X programs is rather difficult (depending on which toolkit
you use) and seems really alien to most non-UNIX gurus.</p><p>However, X is the most important platform in the UNIX world
and, to call ourselves portable, we need to support X. LibGGI uses
a system of dynamically loadable target drivers that allow it to
run on anything with the ability to display graphics. It does not
make a difference if the display target is some type of server
software, a KGI-like device, something directly accessing graphics
hardware, a printer, a system-service of a microkernel OS or
something else. Table 1 shows a few available target systems that
LibGGI programs can run on.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d77580.0x1e6fb88"></a>Table 1. LibGGI Platforms</h2></div></div><p>Graphics-server systems:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>X Window System: AIX, IRIX, Solaris,
Linux/x86/Alpha</p></li><li><p>Microsoft Windows (very alpha)</p></li></ul></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>Device-oriented systems:</b></span>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>KGI: Linux/x86; planned: Solaris/x86,
Linux/Alpha</p></li><li><p>Solaris /dev/fb</p></li></ul></div>

<span   class="bold"><b>Direct-access systems:</b></span>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>VESA/DOS</p></li><li><p>SVGAlib, GLIDE, SUID-KGI : Linux</p></li></ul></div>

</p><p>LibGGI detects the most desirable target available on the
current hardware and automatically makes use of it. This can be
overridden to force different behaviour easily.</p><p>Compatibility is maintained at binary level within one
platform. That is, a LibGGI application compiled for Linux x86 will
run without modification on a KGI full screen, in an X window,
using SVGAlib or GLIDE. It will even run on a text-mode screen via
LibAA or whatever is available.</p><p>Compatibility across platforms requires a recompile, but this
should be painless if the surrounding code doesn't heavily use OS
specifics.</p><p>So, porting applications is easy. But what about porting
LibGGI itself? We have tried keep LibGGI as portable as possible.
Most GGI code compiles without a warning in <b  >gcc
-pedantic</b> mode. We have also tried to keep use of OS
specifics to a bare minimum.</p><p>LibGGI should build easily on any system that has heard of
POSIX. Even libdl isn't strictly required anymore to allow for
systems that don't recognize dynamic libraries.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d77580.0x1e704d0"></a>Simplicity: An Example</h2></div></div><p>Another important point in the design of LibGGI is
simplicity. If a programmer just wants to write a small graphics
utility, he may be scared off by the complexity of X. To give you
an idea of how programming with LibGGI works, let's look at the
small example program shown in <a href="2998l1.html" target="_self">Listing
1.</a></p><p>It doesn't show good style, but is designed to be
straightforward to read. As with any library, you have to include
its headers. These are located in a subdirectory. Since we have
more than one library, we decided that allocating a whole
subdirectory would cause less confusion.</p><p>The first thing you have to do when using LibGGI is call
<span   class="bold"><b>ggiInit</b></span>. This initializes the
LibGGI internal data structures and sets up everything. Next, you
call <span   class="bold"><b>ggiOpen</b></span>. This call returns a
<b  >ggi_visual_t</b> which is an opaque type, similar to
what X calls a &ldquo;drawonable&rdquo;. Think of it as an abstract handle to
the display you draw on. Note that you can have multiple displays
per program as required by complex applications which handle
multiple screens.</p><p>You will want to set a graphics mode on the visual. A mode
consists of the size, or rather, resolution of the visible area
(<b  >visx</b>, <b  >visy</b>) as well as that
of the virtual area (<b  >virtx</b>,
<b  >virty</b>) on which the view port can be panned
around. Moreover, you need to specify the type of display you
request; for example, a <b  >GT_24BIT</b> true color
visual. Note that calls to request additional options are
available, as well as the capability to automatically choose
values. This is highly recommended in order to enhance
portability.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d77580.0x1e709f8"></a>Graphics Context</h2></div></div><p>Now we are set to start drawing. LibGGI uses a GC (graphics
context) to represent the current state of the drawing system. We
considered a state-free approach, but this would have meant:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Lots of parameters for some functions</p></li><li><p>A very awkward look for programmers used to the GC
concept</p></li><li><p>Ignoring that actual acceleration hardware normally
has a GC</p></li></ul></div><p>We now draw a few dots in different colors by using
<span   class="bold"><b>ggiSetGCForeground</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>ggiDrawPixel</b></span>. As an alternative,
we draw the next set of pixels using
<span   class="bold"><b>ggiPutPixel</b></span>. Higher-level
functions are also available, but only to a limited extent. As you
can see from the example program, we support various kinds of lines
and boxes (and yes, these are accelerated, if the underlying target
supports it), but that's about it.
</p><p>Don't be disappointed here. There is a higher-level library
called LibGGI2D providing more complicated functions. LibGGI has
been designed to be a basic &ldquo;foundation&rdquo; library on top of which
specialized libraries can be built for more complex requirements,
such as 3-D and animation.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d77580.0x1e677b0"></a>Events</h2></div></div><p>When we are done drawing, we use
<span   class="bold"><b>ggiEventPoll</b></span> to wait for a key or
mouse event. <span   class="bold"><b>ggiEventPoll</b></span>
determines if an event of the given type(s) is present and will
eventually block for it for a specified time or indefinitely, if
the pointer to the <b  >timeval</b> struct is
<b  >NULL</b> as in our simple case.</p><p>We then use a convenience function to get a keystroke. Note
that this will block again, if polling was terminated due to mouse
activity. In most cases, you will want to use LibGGI's event system
to get input from any device that is attachable to a computer
system. For event classification and configuration, a helper
library called LibGII is available to give you a flexible and
simple way of mapping device input to program actions. After
<span   class="bold"><b>ggiGetc</b></span> has returned, we close
down the visual using <span   class="bold"><b>ggiClose</b></span>,
and then the whole LibGGI library using
<span   class="bold"><b>ggiExit</b></span>. Note that you can reopen
another visual before ggiExit, which can, for example, be used to
transfer the program from one target to another. After ggiExit,
every other call to LibGGI functions is undefined. You will need to
call ggiInit again first. You have now gained a tiny glimpse at how
LibGGI programs look.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d77580.0x1e67b78"></a>Advanced LibGGI Usage</h2></div></div><p>Many applications, especially those ported from DOS and other
systems where a relatively direct access path to the hardware is
present, will want to access graphics RAM directly. While being
tied to the layout of the particular card/mode isn't a great idea
for portability, it is a good way to get extra speed. LibGGI solves
this dilemma by exporting a <b  >DirectBuffer</b>
structure describing all details of the currently active video
buffer. The application can decide whether to use it or fall back
to standard LibGGI calls.</p><p>LibGGI applications can service multiple visuals at the same
time, thus allowing multihead applications like CAD or games
screens split over several monitors. For convenience, we have
&ldquo;memory-visuals&rdquo; that can be used to draw an &ldquo;invisible&rdquo; area
first and then blit to screen (crossblitting). Simple color-space
management, such as gamma setting, is available, as well as support
for double/triplebuffering and waiting for vertical retrace, or
even for a specific position of the CRT beam (where the hardware
allows).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d77580.0x1e67d30"></a>3-D, Movies, Fonts</h2></div></div><p>LibGGI ends at about the level of a DrawBox, which is not a
desirable environment for many applications, and transparent
acceleration is limited. LibGGI was kept small on purpose to work
well under constrained conditions such as embedded systems, and not
waste space for applications which do not need advanced
functionality.</p><p>We extended LibGGI so more complex APIs could be implemented
&ldquo;on top&rdquo; of it. So far we have LibGGI2D, Mesa-GGI and a tiny
windowing library, LibGWT, running. A lightweight 3-D library, font
and animation support are works in progress. Such libraries are
implemented as LibGGI-Extensions. Being an extension has several
benefits over just &ldquo;using&rdquo; LibGGI; for one thing, you inherit the
complete functionality regarding library loading and target
support. Thus, extension libraries also bring along their set of
API drivers which can be used to allow for transparent
acceleration. LibGGI ensures basic services, so all extension
libraries will run on all LibGGI targets, but the level of
acceleration will vary depending on the availability of driver
libraries for the extension.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d77580.0x1e67e90"></a>Transparent Acceleration and Multi-API</h2></div></div><p>At the core of LibGGI is a trick that helps LibGGI be
portable and smart regarding acceleration&mdash;a creative usage of
dynamically loaded libraries. LibGGI functions can be overridden by
loading a suitable library. LibGGI is aware of two different types
of such libraries:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Display-Modules describe a way to connect to a
given kind of back end like X, KGI, SVGAlib etc. They are loaded at
ggiOpen time.</p></li><li><p>Driver modules are normally loaded at mode-setup
time and each describes a given API used to draw on the current
target. These APIs are normally selected by the back end that is
queried for a set of &ldquo;suggest-strings&rdquo; that map to these APIs.
See Figure 1.</p></li></ol></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d77580.0x1e68150"></a>Table 2. Multiple APIs</h2></div></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>generic stubs (fallback emulation)</p></li><li><p>linear-8-framebuffer</p></li><li><p>generic-KGI-ioctl</p></li><li><p>vendor-ABC-KGI-PrivateIoctl</p></li><li><p>vendor-ABC-MMIO-DirectAccess</p></li></ol></div><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2998f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. How Transparent Acceleration and Multi-API Work
</p></div></div><p>You might be surprised by the term &ldquo;set of&rdquo;. Normally,
there are multiple APIs which can be used to draw on a given
target. Let me explain this point a bit further for the KGI target,
which makes the most extensive use of this feature. Table 2 is the
set of suggest-strings for a fictional ABC graphics card being
accessed via KGI. The KGI module managing the card will tell LibGGI
to first load a &ldquo;stubs&rdquo; library that is used for emulation when a
function is not natively supported. This stubs library contains
fall-back functionality, such as making up a filled box from
multiple horizontal lines. Then LibGGI loads a library that
accesses the linear, 8-bit wide frame buffer exported by KGI. This
library will hold primitives such as <b  >DrawPixel</b>
and override the stubs library. LibGGI will then load KGI's generic
<span   class="bold"><b>ioctl</b></span> method to access
acceleration features. This library will handle functions which are
commonly accelerated. The next suggest-string adds a few commands
that are rather uncommon, but present in the ABC, which are
accessed by the private area of the ioctls. The last library loaded
accesses the ABC registers in an exported MMIO region. All the
libraries are loaded in increasing order of precedence. The later
ones override functions of earlier ones if they can do better.
Please note this is not a static process&mdash;it can still change at
runtime, if necessary.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d77580.0x1e68888"></a>Performance Considerations</h2></div></div><p>When it comes to graphics performance, many people are afraid
LibGGI will be slow because of the relatively high level of
abstraction its extension libraries provide. Actually, this high
level is necessary if we want to use all graphics cards at their
maximum capability. Some high-end cards do have a truly high-level
internal API. Having applications that use a low-level API would
leave that part of the card unused.</p><p>On the other hand, in some cases it is difficult to decide
which level of API to use. Consider a 3-D game. You can often do
some clever optimizations based on your knowledge of the scene. For
a low-end graphics card, you might be able to calculate things
faster yourself up to the rasterization level. With high-end cards
you might be better off using OpenGL directly, because all
calculations go to the card which does them faster than the host
CPU.</p><p>This is a difficult problem, and actually the only good
solution is to implement both and select one method at
runtime.</p><p>Another ever-present problem is calling overhead. It is
faster to use inline code than any kind of library. However, the
biggest relative gains/losses are achieved with the very fast small
operations such as <span   class="bold"><b>DrawPixel</b></span>. This
is the primary reason we chose to implement
<b  >DirectBuffer</b> functionality. If the application
knows the <b  >DirectBuffer</b> format used by the
graphics card, it can use its own inline code to bypass the calling
overhead.</p><p>LibGGI should perform well over the whole range of possible
applications and graphics cards, though specialized solutions might
perform slightly better.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d77580.0x1e68bf8"></a>Available Applications</h2></div></div><p>If you're considering using LibGGI either as a consumer or
for programming your own applications, you might be interested in
which programs are already available.</p><p>LibGGI has been designed for high speed graphics, so game
designers are our primary customers. A lot of popular games have
been ported to use LibGGI. <span   class="bold"><b>Descent</b></span>
and <span   class="bold"><b>DOOM</b></span> are two of the more
well-known ones. Using LibGGI, we managed to run Descent on a
Linux-Alpha machine a few weeks after the source was
released.</p><p>A common misconception about the GGI project is that we are
trying to replace X. This is wrong. We are at a much lower layer
than a windowing system, and have implemented some popular window
systems on top of LibGGI. We have our own X server
(<span   class="bold"><b>Xggi</b></span>), a viewer application for
the VNC networked desktop, and the Berlin consortium is building
its server on top of LibGGI. The existence of these servers
together with the ability of LibGGI to display on them brings us to
the next generation of interoperability.</p><p>Another broad group of applications deals with viewing files.
LibGGI has the nice ability to view a JPG file on the console or in
an X window, without the spawning application (such as
<span   class="bold"><b>mc</b></span>) being aware that it is running
on X or the console.</p><p>Most of the above-mentioned programs have been ported from
other graphics APIs. All porters have told me that learning LibGGI
was easy, and that after porting, the look of the program was
improved.</p><p>If you are interested in LibGGI, you will want to know where
to get it (see Resources). Our project home page provides many
pointers and quite a few sources. LibGGI is available as releases
from several major software archives like Sunsite and tsx, as daily
CVS snapshots from our web page and its mirrors, as well as via CVS
from our public CVS mirrors.</p><p>Several precompiled binaries are also available, which should
be useful for the &ldquo;pure user&rdquo; who doesn't want to bother
compiling LibGGI. Give LibGGI a try the next time you write a
graphics application.</p></div></div>
