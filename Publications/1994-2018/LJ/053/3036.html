card. I now have a Matrox Mystic in the computer, and when I try to
run X, I get the message &ldquo;configured devices not found&rdquo;. I think
the HP is not recognizing the Matrox, but with the way the HP is
set up the on-board disables itself when you install another video
card. How can I make Red Hat 5 work correctly? Thanks a
bunch.</p><p>&mdash;Fred Fredrickson, Red Hat 5.0</p><p>Sounds like the X server is still configured for the on-board
video controller, which you say is now disabled. X won't find your
new video card automatically. Try reconfiguring your X server for
the new card.</p><p>&mdash;Scott Maxwell, s-max@pacbell.net</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdf2580.0xeea2f0"></a>Login Names</h2></div></div><p>Would it be possible to give a user a login name which
consists of more than eight characters? For example, &ldquo;fujigaki&rdquo;
and &ldquo;mayuzumi&rdquo; are quite popular family names in Japan. We wish
to give them &ldquo;hfujigaki&rdquo; and &ldquo;cmayuzumi&rdquo; where the &ldquo;h&rdquo; and
&ldquo;c&rdquo; are the first characters of their first names. In some UNIX
systems, it is possible to do that. On the other hand, the default
<span   class="bold"><b>adduser</b></span> command does not seem to
support this extension. It would be great if this could be
done.</p><p>&mdash;Tokuzo Shimada, Slackware 3.10</p><p>The latest glibc libraries (found in Red Hat Linux) allow a
user name of up to 32 characters. The
<span   class="bold"><b>adduser</b></span> (as well as other shadow
utilities) script you've mentioned does indeed have a limitation,
but it should not be that hard to modify it or create your
own.</p><p>&mdash;Mario Bello Bittencourt, mneto@buriti.com.br</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdf2580.0xeea5b0"></a>Space Problem with X</h2></div></div><p>Whenever I try to start X, I get an error message stating
there isn't enough space in the /tmp directory. I've removed
everything from that directory, but I still get the message. Is
there any way to increase the size of this directory or at least
force X to run? Thanks.</p><p>&mdash;Arnold Kelly, Caldera 1.2</p><p>You don't need to make space in the /tmp directory only&mdash;you
can also free up space elsewhere on the same file system. On my
computer (which is also running low on space),
<span   class="bold"><b>df</b></span> reports the following:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
% df /tmp
Filesystem 1024-blocks Used Available Capacity
Mounted on /dev/hda2 495746 468014 2129 100% /
</pre><p>This says that my /tmp directory is on the
/dev/hda2 file system. Try the same with other directories, making
space where you can in other directories on the same file system.
In particular, I'd suggest checking /var/log, where your system
logs are kept.

How can I find out if Linux will run on a new computer
configuration?</p><p>Your answer will determine whether I give my 486 to my
brother-in-law or keep it as a Linux box.</p><p>Thanks for your time.</p><p>&mdash;Al Rivera, Slackware 3.4</p><p>You should check the Hardware-HOWTO on all the LDP mirror
sites. However, I'm pretty suspicious of recent hardware; hardware
manufacturers are always creating new stuff, and they rarely offer
a Linux driver for their products. Linux support usually arrives
later than the hardware product, but unless you play video games,
you never need the processing power they're trying to sell
you.</p><p>I prefer to buy my hardware from Linux-aware computer shops:
that's the only way to be sure I won't be throwing the whole box in
the wastebasket.</p><p>&mdash;Alessandro Rubini, rubini@linux.it</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdf2580.0xeeabe0"></a>Printing Unformatted Text</h2></div></div><p>I have an HP Laserjet 2p. The installation of Linux went well
but when using <span   class="bold"><b>lpr</b></span> to print out a
file, I get approximately three lines of unformatted text. At other
times, I get no output at all. The entry in the printcap file that
refers to the Laserjet yields two names: lp and hdj:\. When hdj is
entered as printer name, the system states that device is unknown.
When the <b  >-P</b> option is used, printer problems
persist, i.e., they are unchanged. I am a Linux novice and I could
use some help. Thanks for your input.</p><p>&mdash;Dewey</p><p>This happens because the printer uses the DOS convention for
newlines: <b  >\r\n</b> (return, newline), while UNIX
text has only a <b  >\n</b> at the end of each
line.</p><p>You should either filter the text through
<span   class="bold"><b>unix2dos</b></span> (or through
<span   class="bold"><b>sed</b></span>) or avoid sending unformatted
text to the printer. I use the
<span   class="bold"><b>a2ps</b></span> (ASCII to PostScript) filter
and then <span   class="bold"><b>ghostscript</b></span> to convert
PostScript to a PCL print file.</p><p>Setting up non-PostScript printers as if they were PostScript
is quite easy with modern distributions. Look for the &ldquo;Magic
Filters&rdquo; package and install it.</p><p>&mdash;Alessandro Rubini, rubini@linux.it</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdf2580.0xeeb160"></a>Recognizing New Memory</h2></div></div><p>I have upgraded my PC's memory from 16MB to 72MB. Although
the BIOS and Win95 recognize the extra memory, Linux appears not to
see it. Using utilities such as
<span   class="bold"><b>free</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>top</b></span> show a total of only 16MB of
available memory. My PC still performs as it did when I had only
16MB installed.</p><p>Is there something I must do for Linux to recognize the new
memory?</p><p>&mdash;George Tankoski, Slackware 1.3.2</p><p>LILO's configuration file may be explicitly setting the
available memory to 16MB. To see if this is true, check the file
/etc/lilo.conf for a line that looks like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
append="mem=16m"
</pre><p>As root, change this line to read:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
append="mem=72m"
</pre><p>
Then, run <b  >/sbin/lilo</b>
(also as root) to make LILO reread the edited
configuration file and reboot.
</p><p>If you don't see the &ldquo;16m&rdquo; line in /etc/lilo.conf, back up
your system, then try rebooting and typing the &ldquo;72m&rdquo; line
directly at the LILO prompt. If your system boots and appears to be
stable, you can then permanently enshrine the &ldquo;72m&rdquo; line in
/etc/lilo.conf.</p><p>&mdash;Scott Maxwell, s-max@pacbell.net</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdf2580.0xeeb688"></a>Modem Connection to NT</h2></div></div><p>I have a modem connection at work on a MS Windows NT/4
server. When I try to connect with PPP, I never get the login
prompt. Once the dial up is done (using
<span   class="bold"><b>seyon</b></span>), the connection hangs up. I
guess NT is using RAS rather than the regular PPP. Do you know any
way to set up the connection with NT?</p><p>Thanks for your help.</p><p>&mdash;Jacques Milman, Red Hat 4.1</p><p>The NT server uses ms-auth-chap authentication. Check out
your <span   class="bold"><b>pppd</b></span> configuration to be sure
it is compiled with ms-auth-chap crypted authentication.</p><p>Here is an example of what can happen if your pppd does not
include ms-auth-chap support&mdash;server asks for ms-auth-chap:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
pppd[164]: rcvd [LCP ConfReq id=0x0 &lt;asyncmap 0x0&gt;
&lt;auth chap 80&gt; &lt;magic 0x307f&gt; &lt;pcomp&gt; &lt;accomp&gt;]

and received a message saying &ldquo;remove and insert new disk&rdquo; or
something similar. I played around with the CMOS setting and
checked the hardware to make sure no wires had fallen out. I ended
up formatting my c: disk, and up until this time, I could still use
Linux. I received the same message, but I could load DOS from a
boot disk.</p><p>The next time I tried to load Linux at the LILO prompt, it
said &ldquo;loading........&rdquo; and hung. I then tried to use a Linux boot
disk and got the message &ldquo;cannot initiate console&rdquo;.</p><p>I am finding this to be a big problem, as I cannot access the
files on either my Windows 95 partition or my Linux partition. If
you can give me any help with fixing my Linux problem, I will be
very grateful.</p><p>&mdash;Jamie Gamble, Slackware 3.2</p><p>The process of booting Linux on the PC platform is a bit
intricate, mainly because of the peculiarities of the
platform.</p><p>LILO loads the kernel using a list of disk blocks it built
beforehand (when you ran
<span   class="bold"><b>/sbin/lilo</b></span>, the map installer).
After loading the blocks, it jumps to the kernel image; but if you
moved the kernel after running /sbin/lilo, the loader will jump to
nonsense program code, thus hanging the system.</p><p>Boot floppies, on the other hand, come in different flavours.
The message &ldquo;cannot open an initial console&rdquo; means the kernel was
loaded just right; it mounted a root file system, but couldn't open
/dev/tty1 or /dev/ttyS0. I've seen this happen when mounting the
/home partition as the root file system (there was no /dev
directory).</p><p>Restoring a Linux installation is not trivial,
especially if you have no other Linux box around. Short of finding
a local Linuxer, try the /usr/doc/lilo*/README or my article
&ldquo;Booting the Kernel&rdquo; in the June 1997 <i  >LJ</i>.</p><p>&mdash;Alessandro Rubini, rubini@linux.it</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdf2580.0x12e4220"></a>Memory Exhausted</h2></div></div><p>When I'm recompiling my kernel, I get a virtual memory
exhausted error. It seems to happen when the compile is around the
floppy.o section. When I use a different boot kernel (bare), it
gives me a fatal signal 13.</p><p>&mdash;Wes Horn, Slackware 3.2</p><p>There are two common causes of this kind of problem.</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Hardware; perhaps a bad cache or RAM</p></li><li><p>Out of swap space</p></li></ol></div><p>You did not specify how much RAM nor how much swap
space you have. Compiling the kernel is a CPU/memory intensive
task, so if you do not have enough physical memory, your system
will start using the swap space. If this swap is used up, strange
things, such as the one you mentioned, can happen.

graphics server, and I have had a lot of problems getting it to
run. A friend of mine running Linux said there is a bug in Red Hat
5.0 that prevents the necessary symbolic link from being created. I
tried to correct it using the following command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
rm /etc/X11/X ln -s ../../usr/X11R6/bin/Xmetro \
   /etc/X11/X
</pre><p>This didn't solve the problem. When I try to start Metro-X my
screen goes blank, and a few seconds later, the prompt returns with
no error messages.
</p><p>Can you help me solve this problem? Your help is greatly
appreciated.</p><p>&mdash;Tim Perry, Red Hat 5.0</p><p>If that is exactly what you typed, you missed
something crucial: a semicolon (;) before the
<b  >ln</b> (this separates the
<b  >rm</b> command from the
<b  >ln</b> command). Worse, you also removed
the Xmetro binary!</p><p>To fix it, use
<span   class="bold"><b>rpm</b></span> or
<span   class="bold"><b>glint</b></span> to reinstall the Metro-X
package, then re-run the command with a semicolon before the
<b  >ln</b>.</p><p>&mdash;Scott Maxwell,
