<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #189, January 2010</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
The <span   class="bold"><b>Linux scheduler</b></span> is pretty controversial, in large part because 
contributors can test their code and find it to be faster than someone
else's code, and that other person can run tests showing the exact
opposite! It all depends on what you test for. Some tests examine
only how many processes can be created in the shortest amount of time.
Other tests try to mimic interactive behavior and examine how smooth
that behavior is. When you add to this the fact that the scheduler
needs to work as well as possible for the full range of computer
hardware that might be running Linux, the problem becomes far more
complex. It's no small wonder that disagreements become heated, and some
contributors choose to go off and code on their own and abandon the
quest to elevate their scheduler to the status of Official Linux
Scheduler.
</p><p>
In that spirit, <span   class="bold"><b>Con Kolivas</b></span> has been quietly
writing <span   class="bold"><b>BFS</b></span> (Brain F***
Scheduler), incorporating everything he's learned about schedulers
over the years. But, his work recently got the attention of <span   class="bold"><b>Ingo
Molnar</b></span>, maintainer of the current in-kernel scheduler, and the
ensuing discussion highlighted some of the issues surrounding
scheduler coding. For example, one of Con's main goals with his
scheduler was to make the user interface as smooth as possible for
desktop systems&mdash;that is, systems with eight CPUs or thereabouts. He wanted to
play games, listen to music and do other highly interactive things,
without having a jerky display. His technique was (among other things)
to abandon support for systems that had thousands of CPUs onboard.
</p><p>
Clearly, Linux has to support both small and large systems, so Con's
scheduler wouldn't work as the primary in-kernel process scheduler.
And, because <span   class="bold"><b>Linus Torvalds</b></span> has said he doesn't want to include multiple
schedulers in the kernel, it's unlikely that Con's code ever could be
included in the official tree. So he's been coding it up on his own,
working with a small group of interested users who don't mind patching
their kernels to get the smoothest possible performance.
</p><p>
It seems like a very cool project. Maybe at some point, his code will
be offered as an option to desktop users. But for the moment, the
kernel has to stay with the scheduler that supports the most systems
and that attempts to have the broadest possible range of decent
performance.
</p><p>
The <span   class="bold"><b>VMware</b></span> folks are discontinuing <span   class="bold"><b>VMI</b></span> support. Virtualization
features in hardware are making it pointless to try to do the
same thing in software. Hardware virtualization probably will be
everywhere soon, they say, so there's no reason for VMI to emulate
multiple CPUs in software anymore. <span   class="bold"><b>Alok Kataria</b></span>
asked on VMware's behalf
about the best way to deprecate and remove the VMI code from the
kernel. As it turned out, the best way is going to be to keep
supporting it for another year or so, until it truly has no more
users. In the meantime, VMI is being added to various lists of features
that are soon to be removed, and code is being added to alert users
that they should brace for the time when VMI no longer will be
available. Kudos to VMware for working with the kernel folks to find
the best way to do this. It's nice to see industry paying attention to
open-source methods.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>CPUidle</b></span> is a new project by <span   class="bold"><b>Arun R. Bharadwaj</b></span> that attempts to save
power on PowerPCs by recognizing when CPUs are idle enough to put into
low power modes. It does this by analyzing the current system usage
and essentially making educated guesses about what's going to happen
in the near future. In addition to being a cool and useful project, we
can look forward to many future flame wars surrounding exactly how to
determine when to put a CPU into a low power mode, as hardware designs
and software usage patterns become more and more complex.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Jakub Narebski</b></span> took a survey of <span   class="bold"><b>Git</b></span> users and made the results
available at <a href="http://tinyurl.com/GitSurvey2009Analyze" target="_self">tinyurl.com/GitSurvey2009Analyze</a>. Thousands of
people participated, virtually all of whom are happy with it. It's
interesting to see that 22% of respondents use Git under <span   class="bold"><b>Windows</b></span>. If
you haven't tried Git yet, or if it's been a while, you really
should check it out. It takes a problem that stumped many people for years and
makes it look easy. The flame wars, the bitter competition between
projects and the venomous <span   class="bold"><b>BitKeeper</b></span> disputes have all melted away. Git
is a tool of peace.

<h2 class="title">Ultraportables That Cost an ARM, But No Leg</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #189, January 2010</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Whether you love Netbooks or hate Netbooks, there's no doubt that
Intel currently owns the market when it comes to providing the hardware.
Unfortunately, Intel's attempts to make CPUs that consume less
power also have resulted in Netbook computers that are painfully slow.
And, don't get me started on the GMA500 video chipset. (Actually, feel
free to read my rant on the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> Web site regarding the GMA500
chipset at <a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/how-kick-your-friends-face-gma500" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/content/how-kick-your-friends-face-gma500</a>.)

</p><p>
Thankfully for users, while Intel works to tweak its Atom line of
processors, other companies are working to enter the Netbook market too.
Unfortunately for Intel, one particular company has more experience with
low-power, high-performance computing than Intel could ever fathom&mdash;ARM.
Ironically, while Intel keeps pushing its clock speeds down to save
a bit of power, ARM has been ramping its speeds up. Intel's latest
Atom processor, at the time of this writing, has a whittled-down speed of 1.3GHz; the new ARM-based CPUs are around 2GHz.
</p><p>
Certainly, Intel has reason to fret as the embedded market, which is
dominated by ARM, begins to scale up to the Netbook market. The real
fear, however, should be that once ARM invades the Netbook and notebook
markets, there is no reason for it to stop. Imagine racks of servers
with ARM-based CPUs operating at Intel-class speeds while sipping
electricity and staying cool enough to run without heatsinks. Oh yeah,
guess who else might be a little afraid? That's right. Windows doesn't
run on the ARM architecture, but Linux sure does.

<h2 class="title">Finding xargs</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Joey Bernard</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #189, January 2010</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
In the November 2009 issue, I looked at some tools used by computational scientists
when they are doing pre- and post-processing on their data. This month,
I examine ways to automate this work even further. Let's start with
the assumption that we have a number of steps that need to be done
and that they need to be done on a large number of data files.
</p><p>
The first step is to find out which files need to be processed. The most
obvious way to do that is simply to create the list of files manually. Doing
it this way is the most time-intensive, and as with all manual operations,
it can lead to mistakes due to human error. This step lends itself to
automating, so it should be automated. The most popular utility for
creating lists of files is the find command, which finds files
based on a number of different filters.
</p><p>
The most common filter is the filename. You can use find to locate
where a certain class of files lives on your drive. Let's say you
have a group of data files that need to be processed, all ending in
.dat. The find command to search for them would be the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
find . -name "*.dat" -print
</pre>
</p><p>
The first option tells find where to start looking for files. In
this case, you are telling find to start looking in the current
directory. You also could give it any directory path, and it would start
its search at that location. The second option,
<tt  >-name</tt>, tells find
what to filter on. In this case, you are telling find to filter based
on the filename. This filter is actually a filename pattern,
<tt  >"*.dat"</tt>.
This pattern needs to be quoted so the shell doesn't try to expand
the * character. The last option, <tt  >-print</tt>, tells find to print the
search results to standard output. You can redirect this to
a file or pipe it to another command. By default, find separates the
filenames with new-line characters. A problem can occur if you have odd
characters in your filenames, like blanks or new lines, and you feed
this as input to another program. To help mitigate that issue, 
use the <tt  >-print0</tt> option instead of
<tt  >-print</tt>. This tells find to separate
the results with a null character rather than a new-line character.
</p><p>
There are many other filter options. The first one to be aware of is
<tt  >-iname</tt>. This is like <tt  >-name</tt>,
except that it is case-insensitive. There
also is a group of filter options around time: <tt  >-amin
n</tt> and <tt  >-atime n</tt>
filter based on access time. <tt  >-amin n</tt> looks for files that
were
accessed n minutes ago. <tt  >-amin +n</tt> looks for files that were
accessed more than n minutes ago, and <tt  >-amin -n</tt> looks for files that
were accessed less than n minutes ago. The <tt  >-atime
n</tt> option looks
for files that were accessed n*24 hours ago. Again,
<tt  >+n</tt> and <tt  >-n</tt>
behave the same way. The same tests can be made using <tt  >-cmin
n</tt> and
<tt  >-ctime n</tt> to test the file's created time, and
<tt  >-mmin n</tt> and <tt  >-mtime
n</tt> test the modified time of a file. The last filter option 
to use in this instance is <tt  >-newer filename</tt>. This option checks to
see whether the files being searched for are newer than some reference
file named <tt  >filename</tt>. This might be useful if you want to generate a
list of files that have been created since your last processing run.
</p><p>
Now that you have your list of files, what do you do with it? This is
where you can use another command called xargs. xargs, in its simplest
configuration, takes lines of input and runs some command for each
line. This simplest use looks like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
xargs -I {} run_command {}
</pre>
</p><p>
Here, xargs reads lines of input from standard input. The
<tt  >-I {}</tt> option tells xargs to replace any subsequent appearances
of <tt  >{}</tt> with the line of input that was just read in.
Using <tt  >{}</tt>
isn't mandatory. You can use any characters to act as
placeholders. In this example, xargs executes <tt  >run_command
{}</tt> for
each line of input, substituting the input line into the place held by
<tt  >{}</tt>. If you dump your list of files into a text file, you can tell
xargs to use it rather than standard input by using the <tt  >-a
filename</tt> option. Also, xargs will break input on blanks, not
just new-line
characters. This means if your filenames have blanks in them,
xargs will not behave correctly. In this case, you can use the 
<tt  >-0</tt>, which tells xargs to use the null character as the delimiter
between chunks of input. This matches with the
<tt  >-print0</tt> option to find
from above. If you aren't sure whether the given command should be run
on every file listed, you can use the <tt  >-p</tt> option. This tells xargs to
prompt you for confirmation before each command is run. The last option to
xargs that might be useful is <tt  >-P n</tt>. This option tells xargs
to run n number of commands in parallel, with the default value for n
being 1. So, if you have a lightly loaded dual-core machine, you might
want to try using <tt  >-P 2</tt> to see if the processing happens a bit faster.
Or on a quad-core machine, you might want to try <tt  >-P
4</tt>.
</p><p>
Putting this all together, let's look at a hypothetical job you may
have to do. Let's say that you have a series of data files, ending in
.dat, scattered about your home directory. You ran a processing job
last week and named the file containing the list of filenames to be
processed list1.txt. Now, you want to process all the data files
that have been created since then. To do so, you could run the following
commands:


<pre     class="programlisting">
find ~ -name "*.dat" -newer list1.txt -print &gt;list2.txt
xargs -a list2.txt -I {} run_processing {}
</pre>
</p><p>
This way, you would have a list of the files that had just been processed
stored in the file list2.txt, for future reference. If some of the
filenames contain blanks or other white-space characters, you would
probably run the following instead:


<pre     class="programlisting">
find ~ -name "*.dat" -newer list1.txt -print0 &gt;list2.txt
xargs -a list2.txt -I {} -0 run_processing {}
</pre>
</p><p>
Hopefully, this helps you automate some of the routine work
that needs to be done, so you can get to more interesting
results. Go forth and automate.

<h2 class="title">DRM, DMCA and OST (Other Scary Things)</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #189, January 2010</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
It's obvious to most Linux users that Digital Rights Management (DRM)
is a really bad idea. It's not just because DRM-encoded media usually
won't play with our operating system, but rather because we understand
the value of openness. The really sad part is that DRM, at least on
some level, is attempting to do a good thing.
</p><p>
Take Wil Wheaton for example. You may know Wil from television or movie
acting, but he's also a successful writer. Along with writing books,
he often performs them and sells the audiobook version of his work.
Because Wil is against DRM, his books are available as unrestricted MP3
files. That's great for those of us who like to listen to such things
on Linux or a non-iPod MP3 player. Unfortunately, some users confuse
DRM-free with copyright-free. When otherwise decent individuals don't
think through the ramifications of redistributing someone's copyrighted
work, you end up with situations like this:
<a href="http://tinyurl.com/stealfromwil" target="_self">tinyurl.com/stealfromwil</a>.
</p><p>
If you put yourself in Mr Wheaton's shoes for a second, you can see how
tempting it is for authors&mdash;and, more important, publishing companies&mdash;to
DRM-encode their work. Theoretically, if a piece of media is
&ldquo;protected&rdquo;
with DRM, only those people who purchase the rights to enjoy it can
enjoy it. Unfortunately, as everyone but the big companies that insist
on using it know, all it manages to do is punish the honest people.
People who have tried to play Amazon Video on Demand videos on their
Linux desktops or listen to Audible audiobooks on their no-name MP3
players know exactly what I mean.
</p><p>
The truth of the matter is, if people are dishonest enough to use
copyrighted materials they haven't paid for, DRM does little more
than give them an &ldquo;excuse&rdquo; for their pirating ways. Right now, users
are given the choice of paying money for limited, restricted access
to media, or to download illegally fully functional, cross-platform,
unrestricted media for free from torrent sites. I have two messages
for two different groups:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Media publishing companies: make it easy for users to buy access
to your media, and make that media flexible, archive-able and
affordable. Yes, people will pirate your stuff&mdash;just like they do now.
The difference will be that your honest clients won't hate you, and
you'll actually gain some clients because you will be offering what
people really want.
</p></li><li><p>
Frustrated users: look, I'm with you. DRM frustrates me too. Although
I'm not expecting to convert those among us who choose to pirate media,
I would hope that we'd all support those companies (and individuals, in
Wil Wheaton's case) that &ldquo;get it&rdquo;. The only way we'll be part of the
solution when it comes to eliminating DRM is actually to buy non-DRM
stuff. At the very least, every time you pirate something because you
can't buy it legitimately, e-mail the companies and let them know. If they
see lost sales, perhaps they will rethink their approach to digital media.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
I could go on and on about the insanity of Blu-ray DRM and the like,
but I don't have the energy. Plus, I want to go watch the hi-def movie I
just ripped on my Linux laptop. I'll have to remember to e-mail the movie
producer about my morally justifiable, but legally questionable ways....

with (thanks in part to user contributions), lately we've decided to step
it up a notch. We certainly will continue to provide command-line tips,
GUI shortcuts and unconventional Linux tips, but we're also adding
some practical real-world tips as well. Whether you need to brush up
on cable-crimping skills or figure out how to track down a rogue DHCP
server, you'll want to catch our new tech tips.

As always, you can find our videos on our main Web site: <a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com</a>.

See you there!
