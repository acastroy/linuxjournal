Instead of closing ports, make them disappear.

When dealing with computer security, you should assume that
hackers will be trying to get in through any available doors your system
may have, no matter how many precautions you might have taken. 
The method of allowing entrance depending on a password is a classic one
and is widely used.
In order to &ldquo;open a door&rdquo; (meaning, connect to a port on your
computer),
you first have to specify the correct password. This can work (provided
the password is tough enough to crack, and you don't fall prey to
many hacking attacks that might reveal your password), but it still presents
a problem. The mere fact of knowing a door exists is enough to
tempt would-be intruders.
</p><p>
So, an open port can be thought of as a door with (possibly)
a lock, where the password works as the key. If you are running some kind
of public service (for example, a Web server), it's pretty obvious that you
can't go overboard with protection; otherwise, no one will be able to use
your service. However, if you want to allow access only to a
few people, you can hide the fact that there actually is a door to the
system from the rest
of the world. You can &ldquo;knock intruders away&rdquo;,
by not only putting a lock on the door, but also by hiding the lock
itself! Port knocking is a simple method for protecting your ports,
keeping them closed and invisible to the world until users provide a
secret knock, which will then (and only then) open the port so they can
enter the password and gain entrance.
</p><p>
Port knocking is appropriate for users who require access to servers that
are not publicly available. The server can keep all its ports closed,
but open them on demand as soon as users have authenticated themselves by
providing a specific knock sequence (a sort of password). After the port
is opened, usual security mechanisms (passwords, certificates and so on)
apply. This is an extra advantage; the protected services won't require
any modification, because the extra security is provided at the
firewall level. Finally, port knocking is easy to implement and quite
modest as far as resources, so it won't cause any overloads on the server.
</p><p>
In this article, I explain how to implement port knocking in order
to add yet another layer to your system security.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1fe0580.0x20d8670"></a>
Are You Safe?</h2></div></div><p>
Would-be hackers cannot attack your system unless they know which
port to try. Plenty of port-scanning tools are available. A simple way
to check your machine's security level is by running an on-line
test, such as GRC's ShieldsUp (Figure 1). The test results in Figure 1 show
that attackers wouldn't even know a machine is available to attack,
because all the port queries were ignored and went unanswered.

Figure 1. A completely locked-up site, in &ldquo;stealth&rdquo; mode, doesn't give any
information to attackers, who couldn't even learn that the site 
actually exists.
</p></div></div><p>
Another common tool is nmap, which is a veritable Swiss Army knife of
scanning and inspection options. A simple <tt  >nmap -v
your.site.url</tt>
command will try to find any open ports. Note that by default, nmap
checks only the 1&ndash;1000 range, which comprises all the
&ldquo;usual&rdquo; ports, but you
could do a more thorough test by adding a <tt  >-p1-65535</tt>
parameter. Listing 1 shows how you can rest assured that your
site is closed to the world. So, now that you know you are safe,
how do you go about opening a port, but keep it obscured from view?

Secret Handshakes, Taps and Knocks</h2></div></div><p>
The idea behind port knocking is to close all ports and monitor
attempts to connect to them. Whenever a very specific sequence of
attempts (a knock sequence) is recognized, and only in that case,
the system can be configured to perform
some specific action, like opening a given port, so the outsider can get
in. The knock sequence can be as complex as you like&mdash;for example, a simple list (like trying TCP port 7005, then TCP port 7006 and
finally, TCP port 7007) to a collection of use-only-once sequences, which
once used, will not be allowed again.
This is the equivalent of &ldquo;one-time pads&rdquo;, a cryptography method that,
when used correctly, provides perfect secrecy.
</p><p>
Before setting this up, let me explain why it's a good safety
measure. There are 65,535 possible ports, but after
discarding the already-used ones (see the list of assigned ports in
Resources), suppose you are left with &ldquo;only&rdquo; 50,000 available
ports. If
attackers have to guess a sequence of five different ports, there are
roughly 312,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 possible combinations they
should try.
Obviously, brute-force methods won't help! Of course, you shouldn't
assume that blind luck is the only possible attack, and that's why
port knocking ought not be the only security measure you use, but just
another extra layer for attackers to go through (Figure 2).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10600f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Would-be attackers (top) are simply rejected by the firewall,
but when a legit user (middle) provides the correct sequence of
&ldquo;knocks&rdquo;,
the firewall (bottom) allows access to a specific port, so the user can
work with the server.
</p></div></div><p>
On the machine you are protecting, install the knockd
d&aelig;mon, which will be in charge of monitoring the knock attempts. This
package is available for all distributions. For example, in Ubuntu, 
run <tt  >sudo apt-get install knockd</tt>, and in OpenSUSE,
run <tt  >sudo zypper install knockd</tt> or use YaST. Now you
need
to specify your knocking rules by editing the /etc/knockd.conf file
and start the d&aelig;mon running. An example configuration is shown in Listing 2.
Note: the given iptables
commands are appropriate for an OpenSUSE distribution running the standard
firewall, with eth0 in the external zone; with other distributions
and setups, you will need to determine what command to use.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1fe0580.0x20d9328"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Listing 2. A simple /etc/knockd.conf file,
which requires successive knocks on ports 7005, 7007
and 7006 in order to enable secure shell (SSH) access.</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">
[opencloseSSH]
  sequence      = 7005,7006,7007
  seq_timeout   = 15
  tcpflags      = syn
  start_command = /usr/sbin/iptables -s %IP% -I input_ext 1
                  &#8618;-p tcp --dport ssh -j ACCEPT
  cmd_timeout   = 30
  stop_command  = /usr/sbin/iptables -s %IP% -D input_ext
                  &#8618;-p tcp --dport ssh -j ACCEPT
</pre></div><p>
You probably can surmise that this looks for a sequence
of three knocks&mdash;7005, 7006 and 7007 (not very safe, but just an
example)&mdash;and then opens or closes the SSH port.
This example allows a maximum timeout for entering the knock sequence (15 seconds)
and a login window (30 seconds) during which the port will be opened.
Now, let's test it out.
</p><p>
First, you can see that without running knockd, an attempt to log in from the remote
machine just fails:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ssh your.site.url -o ConnectTimeout=10
ssh: connect to host your.site.url port 22: Connection timed out
</pre>
</p><p>
Next, let's start the knockd server.
Usually, you would run it as root via <tt  >knockd -d</tt>
or <tt  >/etc/init.d/knockd start</tt>; however,
for the moment, so you can see what happens, let's
run it in debug mode with <tt  >knock -D</tt>:


<pre     class="programlisting">
# knockd -D
config: new section: 'opencloseSSH'
config: opencloseSSH: sequence: 7005:tcp,7006:tcp,7007:tcp
config: opencloseSSH: seq_timeout: 15
config: tcp flag: SYN
config: opencloseSSH: start_command:
          /usr/sbin/iptables -s %IP% -I input_ext 1
                             -p tcp --dport ssh -j ACCEPT
config: opencloseSSH: cmd_timeout: 30
config: opencloseSSH: stop_command:
          /usr/sbin/iptables -s %IP% -D input_ext
                             -p tcp --dport ssh -j ACCEPT
ethernet interface detected
Local IP: 192.168.1.10
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, let's go back to the remote machine.
You can see that an ssh attempt still fails,
but after three knock commands, you can get in:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ssh your.site.url -o ConnectTimeout=10
ssh: connect to host your.site.url port 22: Connection timed out
$ knock your.site.url 7005
$ knock your.site.url 7006
$ knock your.site.url 7007
$ ssh your.site.url -o ConnectTimeout=10
Password:
Last login: Sat Oct  3 14:58:45 2009 from 192.168.1.100
...
</pre>
</p><p>
Looking at the console on the server, you can see the knocks coming in:


<pre     class="programlisting">
2009-09-03 15:29:47:
     tcp: 190.64.105.104:33036 -&gt; 192.168.1.10:7005 74 bytes
2009-09-03 15:29:50:
     tcp: 190.64.105.104:53783 -&gt; 192.168.1.10:7006 74 bytes
2009-09-03 15:29:51:
     tcp: 190.64.105.104:40300 -&gt; 192.168.1.10:7007 74 bytes
</pre>
</p><p>
If the remote sequence of knocks had been wrong, there would have been
no visible results and the SSH port would have remained closed,
with no one the wiser.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1fe0580.0x20d9b10"></a>
Configuring and Running knockd</h2></div></div><p>
The config file /etc/knockd.conf is divided into sections, one for each
specific knock sequence, with a special general section, options,
for global parameters. Let's go through the general options first:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
You can log events either to a specific file by using
<tt  >LogFile=/path/to/log/file</tt>, or to the standard Linux log files by
using <tt  >UseSyslog</tt>. Note: it's sometimes suggested that
you avoid such
logging, because it enables an extra possible goal for attackers&mdash;should
they get their hands on the log, they would have the port-knocking sequences.
</p></li><li><p>
When knockd runs as a d&aelig;mon, you may want to check whether it's
still running. The <tt  >PidFile=/path/to/PID/file</tt> option specifies a file
into which knockd's PID (process ID) will be stored. An interesting
point: should knockd crash, your system will be safer than ever&mdash;all
ports will be closed (so safer) but totally unaccessible. You might consider
implementing a cron task that would check for the
knockd PID periodically and restart the d&aelig;mon if needed.
</p></li><li><p>
By default, eth0 will be the observed network interface. You can
change this with something like <tt  >Interface=eth1</tt>. You must
not include the complete path to the device, just its name.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Every sequence you want to recognize needs a name; the example 
(Listing 2) used just one, named openclosessh. Options
and their parameters can be written in upper-, lower- or mixed case:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
<tt  >Sequence</tt> is used to specify the desired series of
knocks&mdash;for example, <tt  >7005,7007:udp,7003</tt>. Knocks are usually TCP,
but you can opt for UDP.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >One_Time_Sequences=/path/to/file</tt> allows
you to specify a file containing &ldquo;use once&rdquo; sequences. After each sequence is used,
it will be erased. You just need a text file with a sequence (in the
format above) in each line.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >Seq_Timeout=seconds.to.wait.for.the.knock</tt> is the maximum time
for completing a sequence. If you take too long to knock, you won't be
able to get in.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >Start_Command=some.command</tt> specifies what command (either a
single line or a full script) must be executed after recognizing a
knock sequence. If you include the %IP% parameter, it will be replaced
at runtime by the knocker's IP. This allows you, for example, to open
the firewall port but only for the knocker and not for anybody else. This
example uses an iptables command to open the port (see Resources
for more on this).
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >Cmd_Timeout=seconds.to.wait.after.the.knock</tt> lets you execute a
second command a certain time after the start command is run. You can
use this to close the port; if the knocker didn't log in quickly enough,
the port will be closed.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >Stop_Command=some.other.command</tt> is the command that will be
executed after the second timeout.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >TCPFlags=list.of.flags</tt> lets you examine incoming TCP packets
and discard those that don't match the flags (FIN, SYN, RST, PSH, ACK or
URG; see Resources for more on this). Over an SSH connection,
you should use <tt  >TCPFlags=SYN</tt>, so other traffic won't interfere with
the knock sequence.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
For the purposes of this example (remotely opening and closing port 22),
you didn't need
more than a single sequence, shown in Listing 2. However, nothing
requires having a single sequence, and for that matter, commands do
not have to open ports either! Whenever a knock sequence is recognized,
the given command will be executed. In the example, it opened
a firewall port, but it could be used for any other functions you might
think of&mdash;triggering a backup, running a certain process, sending e-mail
and so on.
</p><p>
The knockd command accepts the following command-line options:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
-c lets you specify a different configuration file, instead of
the usual /etc/knockd.conf.
</p></li><li><p>
-d makes knockd run as a d&aelig;mon in the background; this
is the standard way of functioning.
</p></li><li><p>
-h provides syntax help.
</p></li><li><p>
-i lets you change which interface to listen on; by default,
it uses whatever you specify in the configuration file or eth0
if none is specified.
</p></li><li><p>
-l allows looking up DNS names for log entries, but this
is considered bad practice, because it forces your machine to lose
stealthiness and do DNS traffic, which could be monitored.
</p></li><li><p>
-v produces more verbose status messages.
</p></li><li><p>
-D outputs debugging messages.
</p></li><li><p>
-V shows the current version number.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
In order to send the required knocks, you could use any program, but
the knock command that comes with the knockd package is the usual choice.
An example of its usage is shown above (<tt  >knock your.site.url
7005</tt>)
for a TCP knock on port 7005.
For a UDP knock, either add the -u parameter, or do
<tt  >knock your.site.url 7005:udp</tt>.
The -h parameter provides the (simple) syntax description.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1fe0580.0x24d32b0"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
If You Are behind a Router</b></p><p>
If you aren't directly connected to the Internet, but go through a
router instead, you need to make some configuration changes. How you make these
changes depends on your specific router and the firewall software
you use, but in general terms you should do the following:
</p><p>
1) Forward the knock ports to your machine, so knockd will be able
to recognize them.
</p><p>
2) Forward port 22 to your machine. Although in fact, you could forward any
other port (say, 22960) to port 22 on your machine, and remote users would
have to <tt  >ssh -p 22960 your.site.url</tt> in order to connect to
your machine. This could be seen as &ldquo;security through
obscurity&rdquo;&mdash;a defense against script kiddies, at least.
</p><p>
3) Configure your machine's firewall to <span   class="emphasis"><em>reject</em></span> connections to port 22
and to the knock ports:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ /usr/sbin/iptables -I INPUT 1 -p tcp --dport ssh -j REJECT
$ /usr/sbin/iptables -I INPUT 1 -p tcp --sport 7005:7007 -j REJECT
</pre>
</p><p>
The command to allow SSH connections would then be:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ /usr/sbin/iptables -I INPUT 1 -p tcp --dport ssh -j ACCEPT
</pre>
</p><p>
And, the command for closing it again would be:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ /usr/sbin/iptables -D INPUT -p tcp --dport ssh -j ACCEPT
</pre>
