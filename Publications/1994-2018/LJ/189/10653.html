Black Duck Software's Black Duck Export</h2></div></div><p>
The raison d'&ecirc;tre for Black Duck Software's new Black Duck Export
5.0 is to confront the issue of often undetected encryption algorithms
found in the open-source software that developers integrate into their
development process. A component of the Black Duck Suite, Export helps
companies comply with export regulations by scanning software and
identifying the presence of encryption algorithms that might affect a
product's legal compliance in various markets. The new version 5.0 covers
more than 450 different algorithms. Black Duck also offers a new companion
publication, &ldquo;The Guide to Encryption Export Compliance in an Open Source
World&rdquo;, which can be downloaded at no cost from the company's Web site.

Panasas' ActiveStor</h2></div></div><p>
In its new ActiveStor Series 9 parallel storage system, Panasas claims
to have &ldquo;the highest-performance file storage system in the
world&rdquo;, a
system that combines solid-state drive (SSD) technology with traditional
disk drives &ldquo;to produce a system with breakthrough performance and
consolidation capabilities&rdquo;. Panasas further says that its synchronized
hybrid architecture produces both high-bandwidth performance and
optimized IOPS and is capable of delivering an estimated 80,000 NFS
operations per second, as well as 6 gigabytes per second of throughput.
ActiveStor users can save money by consolidating a wider variety of
applications and workloads in a single storage architecture, including
high-performance clustered applications, single-client applications and
technical and commercial applications running NFS and CIFS file protocols.

Staffan N&ouml;teberg's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Pomodoro Technique Illustrated</em></span> (Pragmatic
Bookshelf)</h2></div></div><p>
&ldquo;Can you focus&mdash;really focus&mdash;for 25 minutes?&rdquo; queries author Staffan
N&ouml;teberg as the subtitle of his new book, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Pomodoro Technique
Illustrated</em></span>
from the Pragmatic Bookshelf. We all know the pressure of needing
to be productive&mdash;the to-do list is a mile long and you find yourself
getting interrupted every other minute. You'd like to tell everyone to
leave you alone, but most of the interruptions are coming from you! You
think of a phone call you need to make or a Web site you need to check,
and before you know it, you're answering e-mail, checking Twitter and
finding a million other things to occupy your time. Author N&ouml;teberg
says that the Pomodoro Technique can put you back in charge of your
day. You'll apply successful techniques from software engineering
to identify what you should be doing today and to help you achieve
your goals. Your mind won't wander when it is fully engaged in short
bursts of focused activity. You'll learn to work less and accomplish
more using nothing more than paper, pencil and a simple kitchen timer.
This book is filled with advice on how to get started and how to tailor
the method to your own needs.

announced version 8.0 of Aqua Data Studio, a universal database
administration software that simplifies the visualization and manipulation
of multiple relational databases from within a single interface.
The new v8.0 of Aqua Data Studio extends native support for the leading

for Oracle, DB2 for LUW, DB2 for iSeries, Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL,
Sybase, Informix, Apache Derby and PostgreSQL. Another key feature is
the extension of the Entity-Relationship Modeler, now with the ability

Finally, users will enjoy the ability to export to ERX format, import
object schemas into existing databases and compare schema objects of
different models within the same or different databases.
