How-to: build a managed environment using Puppet.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1717580.0x180f1f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Puppet is an open-source platform for systems management. It allows for
rapid deployment of system configuration for hundreds or even thousands
of servers. Puppet enables you to build an environment that is robust
with systems that bounce back from unauthorized changes, reliable
with systems that are in a known-good configuration, and above all,
repeatable. Not only does Puppet allow servers to be duplicated easily,
but it also makes rebuilding failed systems a snap.
</p><p>
Puppet manages system configuration as a collection of resources. A
resource could include a user account, a configuration file or a running
service, among others. Each resource to be managed is defined using
Puppet's simple declarative syntax and then the definition applied to
the appropriate systems. Today, I describe how to build
a managed environment using Puppet with some sample modules to get
you started.
</p><p>
Installing Puppet is very simple with packages available for most
distributions. For this project, I demonstrate on Ubuntu
Meerkat 10.10 Server:

<pre     class="programlisting">
apt-get install puppet puppetmaster
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1717580.0x180f510"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Note:</b></p><p>
Most other distributions include packages for Puppet. For Puppet
packages for enterprise Linux, such as RHEL or OEL, please see EPEL
(<a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL" target="_self">fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL</a>).
</p><p>
If all else fails, Puppet can be installed on any distribution with a
recent Ruby version using RubyGems:

<pre     class="programlisting">
gem install puppet
</pre>
</p></div><p>
Although Puppet is most powerfully used in a client-server configuration,
it's possible to apply and test Puppet manifests without running a
d&aelig;mon using the <tt  >puppet apply</tt> command. Now that Puppet is installed,
let's write a short snippet of Puppet code and apply it to
your system to test the installation:

<pre     class="programlisting">
root@localhost # vim /tmp/test.pp

user { "test":
	ensure =&gt; present,
}

root@localhost # puppet apply /tmp/test.pp
notice: /Stage[main]//User[test]/ensure: created

root@localhost #  id test
uid=1001(test) gid=1001(test) groups=1001(test)
</pre>
</p><p>
Puppet configuration is a list of resources with <tt  >keyword =&gt;
value</tt>
pairs to define characteristics about these resources. Here, I've
declared the resource user and named it test. In this scenario, the
name of the resource becomes the name of the user. The ensure keyword is
used with a value of present, which means that Puppet creates the user if
it is not already present. If the user is present, Puppet does nothing.
</p><p>
If you examine /etc/passwd, you can see the test user has been applied to
the system. You can remove this user through Puppet by
changing the keyword <tt  >ensure =&gt; present</tt> to read
<tt  >ensure =&gt; absent</tt>:

<pre     class="programlisting">
user { 'test':
	ensure =&gt; absent,
}

root@localhost # puppet apply /tmp/test.pp
notice: /Stage[main]//User[test]/ensure: removed
</pre>
</p><p>
However, /tmp is a poor place to keep your configuration examples. By
default in Ubuntu, both settings pertaining to the Puppet processes and
configuration to be applied to systems reside in /etc/puppet.
</p><p>
Puppet files to note:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
/etc/puppet/puppet.conf: the puppet.conf file contains both server and client options. For the
purposes of this project, I leave the default configuration intact
for the Puppet master.
</p></li><li><p>
/etc/puppet/manifests/site.pp: the site.pp file defines options general to the site. This example site.pp
imports a list of nodes, defines a &ldquo;filebucket&rdquo; to back up the original
copies of files it modifies and sets the default $PATH for executing
commands on remote systems. Create the /etc/puppet/manifests/site.pp
file on your Puppet master using this example:


<pre     class="programlisting">
root@localhost # vim /etc/puppet/manifests/site.pp

import "nodes"

#filebucket

filebucket { main: server =&gt; 'puppet.example.com' }

File { backup =&gt; main }
Exec { path =&gt; "/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/bin:/sbin:"}
</pre>
</p></li><li><p>
/etc/puppet/manifests/nodes.pp: the nodes.pp file defines the nodes that will be controlled by Puppet
and what configuration is applied to them.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Puppet uses modules to collect code, known as manifests, and related
files into a central location. By default on Ubuntu, Puppet looks for
modules in /etc/puppet/modules. Modules have a very specific structure:

<pre     class="programlisting">
root@localhost # cd /etc/puppet/modules
root@localhost # mkdir ntp/{manifests,files,templates}
root@localhost # touch ntp/manifests/init.pp
</pre>
</p><p>
Every module has an init.pp in the manifests directory that declares the
class and optionally includes other files. If the module includes files or
templates, they are stored in the files and templates subdirectories. Here,
let's create a simple module to manage NTP configuration on our servers:


<pre     class="programlisting">
root@localhost # vim /etc/puppet/modules/ntp/manifests/init.pp

class ntp {

	package { "ntp":
		ensure =&gt; installed,
	}

}
</pre>
</p><p>
Here, I've defined a package resource called ntp, and the name of the
resource is also the name of the package. I've used the keyword <tt  >ensure
=&gt; installed</tt>, which causes Puppet to install the package if it is
not already present on the system.
</p><p>
That's great, but ntp won't do us much good unless it's running. Next,
let's define a service resource:


<pre     class="programlisting">
root@localhost # vim /etc/puppet/modules/ntp/manifests/init.pp

class ntp {

	package { "ntp":
		ensure =&gt; installed,
	}
	service { "ntp":
		ensure =&gt; running,
		hasstatus =&gt; true,
		hasrestart =&gt; true,
	}

}
</pre>
</p><p>
This resource defines the service ntp, ensures that it's running, and also
specifies that its init script supports &ldquo;status&rdquo; and
&ldquo;restart&rdquo;. Puppet
supports various types of UNIX, and if these options are not specified,
it uses methods that are compatible with older init systems
instead.
</p><p>
There's one last step before considering this module complete, and
that's to establish a relationship between the package ntp and the
service ntp. Obviously, the service can't be started until the package
is installed, and Puppet does not always execute manifests in order. To
ensure Puppet is aware of the order in which events need to occur, 
use the relationship-chaining syntax:

<pre     class="programlisting">
class ntp {

	package { "ntp":
		ensure =&gt; installed,
	} -&gt; service { "ntp":
		ensure =&gt; running,
		hasstatus =&gt; true,
		hasrestart =&gt; true,
	}

}
</pre>
</p><p>
Here, I've inserted <tt  >-&gt;</tt> between the end of the package block and the
start of the service block. This sets up a relationship that says the
package needs to come before the service. This also could be done
by using the keyword <tt  >require</tt> to state that the service requires the
package:

<pre     class="programlisting">
service { "ntp":
	ensure =&gt; running,
	hasstatus =&gt; true,
	hasrestart =&gt; true,
	require =&gt; Package["ntp"],
}
</pre>
</p><p>
Other relationships can be defined using both the chaining syntax
and keywords, such as require, subscribe and notify. For
more information, see the Puppet Language Guide at
<a href="http://docs.puppetlabs.com/guides/language_guide.html" target="_self">docs.puppetlabs.com/guides/language_guide.html</a>.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1717580.0x1810698"></a>
Connecting Servers to Puppet</h2></div></div><p>
Now that we have some configuration, let's set up some client systems to
be managed by Puppet. In order to have a few client servers to manage,
you may want to create a virtual machine and then clone it several
times. These client servers need to be able to access the Puppet master
on the network on the default port, 8140.
</p><p>
Install Puppet on the client machine:

<pre     class="programlisting">
root@localhost # apt-get install puppet
</pre>
</p><p>
On Ubuntu, you also need to edit /etc/default/puppet to enable the service
to start on boot:

<pre     class="programlisting">
root@localhost # vim /etc/default/puppet
# Defaults for puppet - sourced by /etc/init.d/puppet

# Start puppet on boot?
START=yes
</pre>
</p><p>
Edit /etc/puppet/puppet.conf and add the FQDN of the Puppet master. If
you don't have DNS, you also need to add the Puppet master's
name and IP address to /etc/hosts:

<pre     class="programlisting">
root@localhost # vim /etc/puppet/puppet.conf

[main]
logdir=/var/log/puppet
vardir=/var/lib/puppet
ssldir=/var/lib/puppet/ssl
rundir=/var/run/puppet
factpath=$vardir/lib/facter
templatedir=$confdir/templates
prerun_command=/etc/puppet/etckeeper-commit-pre
postrun_command=/etc/puppet/etckeeper-commit-post
server = puppet.example.com 

root@localhost # vim /etc/hosts

127.0.0.1   localhost.localdomain   localhost
192.168.0.1	puppet.example.com puppet
</pre>
</p><p>
It's very important that all clients have an FQDN defined in
/etc/hostname and can resolve their own names and the names of the Puppet
master as they use SSL certificates to authenticate. On the Puppet master,
configure your node in nodes.pp and apply some configuration to it:

<pre     class="programlisting">
root@localhost # vim /etc/puppet/manifests/nodes.pp

node test { 

	include ntp
}
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1717580.0x1810a60"></a>
Certificate Exchange</h2></div></div><p>
Puppet authenticates itself using SSL certificates to ensure a secure,
trusted connection. Before you can apply any configuration to nodes,
you need to exchange and sign certificates. On the client node, type the
following to connect to the Puppet master:

<pre     class="programlisting">
root@localhost # puppetd --test
</pre>
</p><p>
If all goes well, you should see the
following output:


<pre     class="programlisting">
info: Creating a new certificate request for test.example.com
info: Creating a new SSL key at /etc/puppet/ssl/private_keys/
&#8618;test.example.com.pem
warning: peer certificate won't be verified in this SSL session
notice: Did not receive certificate
notice: Set to run 'one time'; exiting with no certificate
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, on the Puppet master, check for the client certificate,
and sign it:


<pre     class="programlisting">
root@localhost # puppetca -l
test.example.com

root@localhost # puppetca -s test.example.com
notice: Signed certificate request for test.example.com
notice: Removing file Puppet::SSL::CertificateRequest test.example.com 
 &#8618;at '/var/lib/puppet/ssl/ca/requests/test.example.com.pem'
</pre>
</p><p>
Now the client is authenticated, so re-running <tt  >puppetd
--test</tt> on the
client machine should connect to the server and pull down your NTP config:

<pre     class="programlisting">
root@localhost # puppetd --test
iinfo: Caching catalog for test.example.com
info: Applying configuration version '1301969812'
notice: /Stage[main]/Ntp/Package[ntp]/ensure: created
notice: Finished catalog run in 2.42 seconds
</pre>
</p><p>
Repeat optionally for as many nodes as you would like to manage, creating
a definition for each in nodes.pp.
</p><p>
Now that you're managing some nodes, let's create some more
configuration, so that every server in your environment will have a certain
set of base configuration applied. This will include a sane hosts file,
certain required packages, some standard users and the NTP configuration
created earlier.
</p><p>
Create the directories for a module called packages:


<pre     class="programlisting">
root@localhost # cd /etc/puppet/modules
root@localhost # mkdir -p packages/{manifests,files,templates}
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, create the class. Create the file manifests/init.pp in your
favourite editor:


<pre     class="programlisting">
root@localhost # vim /etc/puppet/modules/packages/manifests/init.pp

class packages {

	package { "vim":
		ensure =&gt; installed,
	}
		
	package { "screen":
		ensure =&gt; installed,
	}
		
	package { "sysstat":
		ensure =&gt; installed,
	}
}
</pre>
</p><p>
Here, we've defined three packages for Puppet to install. On Ubuntu,
however,
there's one more step to getting sysstat to collect metrics: enabling it
in /etc/default/sysstat. To do this, grab a copy of this file from
a system where you've manually installed the package, copy it into the
right location in the module, and configure Puppet to push out this file:

<pre     class="programlisting">
root@localhost # cp /etc/default/sysstat 
 &#8618;/etc/puppet/modules/packages/files
</pre>
</p><p>
Edit the file, and ensure ENABLED is equal to true:


<pre     class="programlisting">
vim /etc/default/sysstat

# Default settings for /etc/init.d/sysstat, /etc/cron.d/sysstat
# and /etc/cron.daily/sysstat files
#

# Should sadc collect system activity information? Valid values
# are "true" and "false". Please do not put other values; they
# will be overwritten by debconf!
ENABLED="true"
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, edit the packages class, and add the file resource:


<pre     class="programlisting">
root@localhost # vim /etc/puppet/modules/packages/manifests/init.pp

class packages {

	package { "vim":
		ensure =&gt; installed,
	}
		
	package { "screen":
		ensure =&gt; installed,
	}
		
	package { "sysstat":
		ensure =&gt; installed,
	} -&gt; file { "/etc/default/sysstat":
		ensure =&gt; present,
		owner =&gt; root,
		group =&gt; root,
		mode =&gt; 644,
		source =&gt; "puppet:///modules/packages/sysstat"
	}
}
</pre>
</p><p>
Here, we've added a file resource and the name of the resource is the
full path of the file to be deployed on the remote system. We've set
the owner and group to root and the mode to 644, which is standard for
configuration files that don't contain sensitive data. The source line
specifies that Puppet will copy out a file called sysstat from the
files directory of the module packages. Note that &ldquo;files&rdquo; doesn't need
to be specified in the path&mdash;it's implied. We've used the arrow chaining
syntax again to show the relationship between the package sysstat and this
file, ensuring that the package is installed before Puppet tries to copy
out the file. This isn't strictly necessary as the directory /etc/default
already exists and it won't really hurt the system to have this file before
the package, but it's good practice to get into specifying relationships.
</p><p>
Now when Puppet runs on a remote system that has this class added to it,
it will check to see if the md5sum of /etc/default/sysstat matches the
md5sum of the copy it has. If they don't match, Puppet will overwrite
the remote file with the modified version.
</p><p>
Now, let's ensure sane hosts files for the environment. As the
hosts file will need to contain the IP address and hostname of each node,
you can't just use the same static file for each like you have for the
sysstat package. Enter templates.
</p><p>
Create the directories for the hosts module:


<pre     class="programlisting">
root@localhost # cd /etc/puppet/modules/
root@localhost # mkdir -p hosts/{manifests,templates,files}
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, copy the hosts file from the Puppet master into the templates
subdirectory to give you something to work from. Give it the suffix
.erb, as this is the extension used by Puppet templates:

<pre     class="programlisting">
root@localhost # cp /etc/hosts 
 &#8618;/etc/puppet/modules/hosts/templates/hosts.erb
</pre>
</p><p>
Open this file in an editor and insert a line beneath the localhost line:


<pre     class="programlisting">

root@localhost # vim /etc/puppet/modules/hosts/templates/hosts.erb

127.0.0.1 localhost
127.0.1.1   &lt;%= fqdn %&gt; &lt;%= hostname %&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
Where did these variables come from?
</p><p>
Every host managed by Puppet has a set of variables that can be accessed
called facts. To get a list of facts currently known about a system,
log on to that system and run:

<pre     class="programlisting">

root@localhost #  facter
architecture =&gt; i386
domain =&gt; compute-1.internal
facterversion =&gt; 1.5.8
hardwareisa =&gt; unknown
hardwaremodel =&gt; i686
hostname =&gt; domU
id =&gt; root
interfaces =&gt; eth0
ipaddress =&gt; 10.214.115.2
ipaddress_eth0 =&gt; 10.214.115.2
is_virtual =&gt; true
&lt;snip&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
Here you can see some of the available variables, although many more are
not shown here.
</p><p>
Now, populate the rest of the hosts file with addresses important to your
environment. If you use DNS internally, you may want to leave the rest of
the file blank. It may be a good idea to define the Puppet master's
IP address and hostname in /etc/hosts, so that Puppet still can manage
the environment if DNS goes down.
</p><p>
Save the hosts file template, and create an init.pp for the module:

<pre     class="programlisting">
root@localhost # cd /etc/puppet/modules/hosts
root@localhost # vim manifests/init.pp

class hosts {

    file { "/etc/hosts":
        ensure =&gt; present,
        owner =&gt; "root",
        group =&gt; "root",
        mode =&gt; 644,
        content =&gt; template("hosts/hosts.erb"),
    }

}
</pre>
</p><p>
The syntax to use a template is a little different from sending out
a file whole. Rather than use the source keyword, we've used content
and defined that this content is laid out in the template hosts.erb
in the templates directory of the module hosts. Again, templates
isn't required in the path; it's implicit.
</p><p>
For the final example module, let's look at some different
resource types to manage users.
</p><p>
Create the directory structure for a users module, and create the init.pp:


<pre     class="programlisting">
root@localhost # cd /etc/puppet/modules
root@localhost # mkdir -p users/{manifests,files,templates}
root@localhost # touch users/manifests/init.pp
</pre>
</p><p>
Let's create user accounts for Jane and Chris, two of our
sysadmins, and for Robert and Sara, two developers. The two sets of users
require different access levels, which you manage through UNIX groups. To
keep the init.pp from becoming unwieldy, let's break the users
out into two different files within the manifests directory:


<pre     class="programlisting">
root@localhost # vim /etc/puppet/modules/users/manifests/init.pp

class users {

  include users::admin, users::devel
  
}

root@localhost # touch /etc/puppet/modules/users/manifests/admin.pp
root@localhost # touch /etc/puppet/modules/users/manifests/devel.pp
root@localhost # ls /etc/puppet/modules/users/manifests/
admin.pp
devel.pp
init.pp
</pre>
</p><p>
Here, we've created two manifests within the namespace of the module
users. This certainly isn't necessary with only four users, but later
when your users grow, it will help keep them organized within their
categories.
</p><p>
Now that we have our empty manifests, we're going to cheat. Instead of
typing the manifests by hand, we are going to extract the data from a
system that already has these user accounts by using a tool called ralsh.
</p><p>
Ralsh is a simple tool for converting current system state into
Puppet code. It can be used to interrogate a resource&mdash;a file, a user
and so on&mdash;and returns everything it can find out about that resource,
formatted in Puppet syntax:


<pre     class="programlisting">
root@localhost # ralsh user jane
user { 'jane':
    home =&gt; '/home/jane',
    shell =&gt; '/bin/bash',
    uid =&gt; '1001',
    ensure =&gt; 'present',
    password =&gt; '$6$N0V80Bci$.wBuBpSNj4fnTpvoSv3hC5UpzP/kTj2/
    &#8618;Sdkj50P16YUlP7aybpz9VkjHo4r6FHooNoO0t79iEHl748wcC4zL70',
    groups =&gt; ['adm','dialout','cdrom','plugdev','lpadmin',
    &#8618;'admin','sambashare'],
    comment =&gt; ',,,'
}
</pre>
</p><p>
You can copy and paste this into the manifest, and if ralsh is run as
root, it even will return users' password hashes, allowing them to have
their usual password on the new system. We'll want to add one keyword:
managehome. If this is set to true, when the user is created, Puppet
will instruct useradd also to create the home directory. Repeat for the
other users:


<pre     class="programlisting">
root@localhost # vim /etc/puppet/modules/users/manifests/admin.pp

class users::admin {

	user { 'jane':
    		home =&gt; '/home/jane',
    		managehome =&gt; true,
    		shell =&gt; '/bin/bash',
    		uid =&gt; '1001',
    		ensure =&gt; 'present',
    		password =&gt; '$6$N0V80Bci$.wBuBpSNj4fnTpvoSv3hC5UpzP/
                &#8618;kTj2/Sdkj50P16YUlP7aybpz9VkjHo4r6FHooNoO0t
                &#8618;79iEHl748wcC4zL70',
    		groups =&gt; ['adm','dialout','cdrom','plugdev',
                &#8618;'lpadmin','admin','sambashare'],
    		comment =&gt; ',,,'
	}

	user { 'chris':
    		home =&gt; '/home/chris',
    		managehome =&gt; true,
    		shell =&gt; '/bin/bash',
    		uid =&gt; '1002',
    		ensure =&gt; 'present',
    		password =&gt; '$6$N0V80Bci$.wBuBpSNj4fnTpvoSv3hC5UpzP/
                &#8618;kTj2/Sdkj50P16YUlP7aybpz9VkjHo4r6FHooNoO0t
                &#8618;79iEHl748wcC4zL70',
    		groups =&gt; ['adm','dialout','cdrom','plugdev',
                &#8618;'lpadmin','admin','sambashare'],
   		 comment =&gt; ',,,'
	}
}

root@localhost # vim /etc/puppet/modules/users/manifests/devel.pp

class users::devel {

	user { 'robert':
    		home =&gt; '/home/robert',
    		managehome =&gt; true,
    		shell =&gt; '/bin/bash',

It's important to note that the uid supplied must be available on the
target systems.

Now that you have your basic modules, you can apply these to your nodes. One
way of doing this efficiently is to define a metanode from which other nodes
can inherit classes:

<pre     class="programlisting">
vim /etc/puppet/manifests/nodes.pp

node common {

	include users
	include packages
	include hosts

}

node test inherits common {

	include ntp

}
</pre>
</p><p>
Save the file, and run <tt  >puppetd --test</tt> on the client to check for changes. 
</p><p>
Now if all has gone well, you should have a managed environment with a
solid core of modules from which to build. The power of Puppet doesn't end
here, with built-in types to manage more than 40 system resources,
including cron jobs, filesystems and e-mail aliases.
</p><p>
Puppet also excels at configuring systems to role, allowing you to 
customize your systems further. For example, a LAMP module could install the
packages for Apache, PHP and MySQL, configure Apache for virtual hosts,
and add developer access to the new LAMP stack. If another Web server
was needed to scale, an identical one could be deployed in minutes.
</p><p>
Experiment and build on these examples, and you soon will start to notice
the benefits of configuration management with systems that are robust,
reliable and above all, repeatable.
