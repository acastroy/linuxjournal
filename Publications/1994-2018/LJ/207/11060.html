When I was younger, my friend Pete and I would do cool projects pretty much
every weekend. One of the most memorable was when we had a fish tank, a car
battery, some carbon rods and a desire to create giant exploding balloons.
The best we managed to accomplish was to fill Pete's basement with chlorine
gas. His mom was not thrilled. This issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span> is dedicated to
cool projects. Every single one of them is cooler than anything Pete or I
ever created&mdash;except for maybe that vacuum-cleaner-powered hoverboard...that
was actually pretty cool.

Reuven M. Lerner starts us out describing how to combine two different MVC
frameworks, Backbone.js and Rails. Having both client-side and server-side
frameworks can make some powerful applications. Dave Taylor also has a cool
column this month, as he shows how to determine the day of any historical
date. Was I born on a Wednesday? I'm not sure, but after reading Dave's column, I
can figure it out.
</p><p>
Kyle Rankin licks his wounds a bit this month and lets us all learn from his
mistakes. Kyle's forensics articles and presentations are known far and wide
in <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> circles as &ldquo;the guide&rdquo; to examining compromised servers.
He had to make an unexpected addendum to his procedure when it came to ext4
though,
and we get the first-hand version of why. My suggestion for Kyle is that he
just use good passwords, and he'd never have to worry about system
compromises (tee-hee!).
</p><p>
Mike Diehl starts off the projects with the Blender Game Engine. Not to be
confused with the &ldquo;Will It Blend&rdquo; guy, Mike shows how to create
a 3-D game
using all open-source tools. Blender might just be the Swiss Army knife of
the Linux world, as it can do everything from 3-D rendering to video editing
to game creation. Check out Mike's article if you want to blend yourself up a
fancy game cocktail.

The office in my new home is pretty cool, but it's not nearly as cool as Hani
Saigh's idea of a cloud-based office. Granted, he doesn't mean an actual
office in the clouds, but having your office software accessible everywhere
is still a nifty idea. Hani introduces OpenGoo, a Web-based workspace that
allows for collaboration and calendar sharing. If you prefer your computing
to be more down to earth, PJ Radcliffe's article on controlling real-world
hardware might tickle your fancy. There's nothing more down to earth than
soldering on a circuit board, and with Open-USB-IO, you can control those
circuits with Linux&mdash;pretty cool stuff.
</p><p>
Many of us are system administrators, at least on some level, so
monitoring systems is something we think about constantly. Jamie Popkin
describes how to use Mojolicious, which allows you to monitor processes
remotely with your smartphone. If that's not cool enough, perhaps you
could combine his ideas with Rick Rogers' article on using the Microsoft
Kinect with Linux. Granted, you might look silly waving your hands around in
a restaurant just to check on a remote rendering project, but if you're
willing to bring a Microsoft Kinect with you to a restaurant, I'm guessing
&ldquo;looking silly&rdquo; isn't really a concern.
</p><p>
On top of all that, we have Petros Koutoupis' demonstration of data
deduplication with Linux. Granted, storage is cheap, but efficiency is
priceless. At my local school district, just this morning someone sent a 6MB
photo to all 1,000 of my users. That one e-mail is taking up more than 6GB of space
on my e-mail server! Data deduplication is an awesome concept, and it's one that I
will be exploring this afternoon. To automate such processes, or any
configuration process for that matter, Jes Fraser's article on Puppet is a
must-read. Although I can manage individual configuration files for my dozen or
so servers here at work, it's starting to become overwhelming. Up that number
by an order of magnitude, and it's impossible to manage. That's where Puppet
comes in. Jes explains how it works and walks through the process of
setting it up.
</p><p>
And, of course, if you're just looking for some recreation this month, we have
that for you too. If you want to browse YouTube without a browser, John Knight has
you covered with his monthly dose of project announcements. If writing a book is more up your
alley, but you need help with formatting for e-readers, check out Dan
Sawyer's article on e-publishing. He'll walk you through creating and
converting for e-readers.
</p><p>
The only example I recommend you don't follow this month is mine. Although
creating hydrogen gas might sound like fun, it was about as smart as the time
Pete and I tried to loosen the bolts on his truck's gas tank&mdash;with a
blowtorch. I wish I were kidding. Enjoy the cool projects issue!
