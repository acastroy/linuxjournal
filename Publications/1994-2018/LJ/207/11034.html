<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #207, July 2011</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Harry Wei</b></span> has volunteered to be the
official maintainer for all <span   class="bold"><b>kernel
docs in Chinese</b></span>. There were a few bumps along the way. <span   class="bold"><b>Tao Ma</b></span>, at one
point, objected that Harry hadn't demonstrated his qualifications or
translated large amounts of documentation. But, oftentimes
maintainership is based more on a willingness to put in the time, than
on any specific expertise or qualification. Harry said he promised to
do his best, and that was that.
</p><p>
This is actually one of the first and greatest innovations <span   class="bold"><b>Linus
Torvalds</b></span> achieved with Linux. While the GNU folks developed the idea
of free software, they limited themselves by sticking with just a
tight group of core developers, who largely would ignore suggestions
and patches from outside. It was Linus' belief that everyone had
something valuable to contribute that led to the style of open-source
development that now dominates the world.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Miklos Szeredi</b></span> has documented the
<span   class="bold"><b>overlay filesystem</b></span>. The overlay is
an example of a &ldquo;union&rdquo;-style filesystem, in which two distinct
filesystems are silhouetted against each other, so as to appear as a
single one. Where their directory structures overlap, files from both
filesystems appear to the user to be in the same directories.
</p><p>
It's very cool, and very weird, because of the shenanigans that have
to go on behind the scenes to deal with conflict resolution. What do
you do if both filesystems have a file called /home/zbrown/todo.txt?
When new files are created, on which filesystem are they stored? A
variety of such cases have to be handled in ways that make the most
intuitive sense to the user as well as the sysadmin maintaining the
system.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Rob Landley</b></span> has automated some <span   class="bold"><b>kernel documentation</b></span> at
<a href="http://kernel.org/doc" target="_self">kernel.org/doc</a>, which he hopes to continue to improve. The
page now extracts much documentation from the kernel source tree
itself, links to various relevant standards, and also links to other
external documents, both about the kernel and about other related
technologies.
</p><p>
He affirms that there's still a lot of work left to do before the doc
pages are really great. In particular, the automated extraction
process is dependent on there being no errors in the way docs are
housed in the kernel source tree, which is not the case. But hopefully,
the existence of the kernel.org/doc pages will serve as a kind of
regression test that will help others find and fix all those errors.
As they do, the doc pages naturally should improve by reflecting
those fixes.
</p><p>
A number of kernel developers have decided to take on the issue of
<span   class="bold"><b>bufferbloat</b></span>, and <span   class="bold"><b>John W. Linville</b></span> recently created the
<span   class="bold"><b>git://git.infradead.org/debloat-testing.git
tree</b></span>, specifically to
house patches relating to that issue.
</p><p>
Bufferbloat is a problem that may or may not exist within the whole
Internet, caused by hardware engineers at a variety of private
companies who created the physical technology underlying the
Internet. These engineers may have been tempted by the low cost of
RAM to create huge throughput buffers that regulate Internet traffic
under times of heavy load. Proponents of the bufferbloat idea also
speculate that these engineers did not bother to design their hardware
to behave well if these buffers became saturated, because they assumed
the buffers would handle all foreseeable situations. So, as the
Internet has become more and more saturated over time, with video and
other high-data traffic, these invisible buffers have been filling up,
causing the entire Internet to approach a state of general choppiness
in which data no longer is transmitted smoothly from place to place.
</p><p>
The Linux folks are attempting a kind of Herculean challenge. These
buffers could exist anywhere along a network connection. They have not
been acknowledged by the companies that may have created them, and it
is virtually impossible for one system to test for these buffers. But,
the Linux folks believe there are algorithms to be discovered
that can address bufferbloat directly and help return the Internet to
a smooth-flowing state or prevent the further degradation of the
global system.

As Linux users, it seems that we have little problem playing a wide variety of
video formats. That is not always the case with other operating systems.
Certainly with Windows 7, Microsoft has improved the number of video
formats it supports, but it pales in comparison to VLC. If you
want to play an AVI encoded with an obscure codec or watch
a DVD, or if you have a hankering for multicast network video streaming,
the VLC player from VideoLAN supports it all (<a href="http://www.videolan.org/vlc" target="_self">www.videolan.org/vlc</a>).
</p><p>
VLC isn't just for Windows either. OS X and Linux users alike
can take advantage of its awesome compatibility. The best part? VLC is
open source under the GPL! Enjoy video and freedom at the same time.

<h2 class="title">How You Can Have Mosquito Vision</h2>

If you've ever been outside on a summer night, then come indoors to find
you've been attacked by bloodthirsty mosquitoes, you know that those little
buggers must be able to see in the dark. In fact, mosquitoes use infrared
light to hone in on our body's heat in order to find our juicy bits.
</p><p>
Infrared light also is the same light that most television remote
controls use for sending signals. If you've ever tried to troubleshoot
a nonworking remote, you know it's frustrating that you can't see if
the remote is &ldquo;lighting up&rdquo;. Although it's difficult to convince
a mosquito to tell you if your remote is working, it is possible to
convince your cell phone, or any other digital camera, to do so.
</p><p>
Simply look at the infrared emitter at the business end of your remote
through the view-screen of your favorite digital camera (or phone). If the
remote is working, you'll see the light it's giving off very clearly.
It works well and is much easier than training mosquitoes!

The Linux Professional Institute has offered LPIC-1, LPIC-2 and
LPIC-3 training for years. In these tough economic times, making
yourself more employable is always a good plan. Unlike the Red Hat
Certified Engineer certification process, the LPI certs are
platform-agnostic. The requirements include a well-rounded list of objectives
for certification. A cool bonus feature for the LPIC-1 exam is that
it has the exact same requirements as the CompTIA Linux+ certification.
So you can study once and get two certs! For more information, check

Computing environments may revolve around heavy usage of NFS
infrastructure. Network areas are hosted and provided by storage file
servers, with compute servers mounting the exported areas into their
directory tree. Periodically, the mounts expire when not in use and are
removed from the directory tree on local machines.
</p><p>
If NFS traffic between file servers and compute servers is disrupted,
machines holding active mounts will not be able to release them. This could
happen in 
several cases. A potential root
cause for the problem might be a network outage; however, this issue will
be resolved the moment network traffic is resumed. A far more serious
scenario is when a file server stops its service due to malfunction
or coordinated maintenance, including an EOL (End of Life) cycle. Any host
holding active mounts of areas exported by a file server that is no longer
reachable will not release them.
</p><p>
This situation leads to so-called stuck mounts. Any process running on
an affected computer server waiting for NFS activity will remain in
uninterruptible sleep state without any way to kill it. Up to date, the
only sensible solution was to reboot affected hosts. However, critical
computer servers, including infrastructure and interactive-use machines,
cannot be rebooted without prior coordination. This leaves a time window
until the next reboot, during which the affected hosts will continue running
in an unstable state.
</p><p>
We provide a rebootless solution to this problem by bringing up a fake file
server, a dedicated host assigned the same IP like an unreachable file
server, which then rejects the NFS requests from compute servers, freeing
them. The special host uses its own network architecture, allowing it to be
moved to any VLAN (Virtual LAN) used by file servers. The
IP change is done using a Web interface.
(A VLAN is a group of hosts with a common set of requirements that
communicate as if they were attached to the same broadcast domain,
regardless of their physical location. A VLAN has the same attributes as a
physical LAN, but it allows for end stations to be grouped together, even if
they are not located on the same network switch. Network reconfiguration
can be done through software instead of physically relocating devices.)
</p><p>
The stuck NFS mounts solution consists of several key components:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
A dedicated host used for faking the IP addresses&mdash;we use a virtual
machine with minimal hardware requirements. The virtual machine is assigned
a separate NIC in the virtualization server. This host is known as the
Admin server.
</p></li><li><p>
A network infrastructure that supports on-the-fly assignment of the
&ldquo;fake&rdquo;
file server (Admin) to the file server VLANs. Admin is connected directly
to the NFS router using a single standard NFS connection, with a 3Gb
channel to primary port and 1Gb channel to backup port (Figure 1).
</p></li><li><p>
A Web interface for assigning Admin to file server VLANs.
</p></li><li><p>
A mechanism to change the IP address on Admin, which can be automated
(scripted) or manual.
</p></li></ul></div><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11034NFSf1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Connection to NFS Router
</p></div></div><p>
In our site, Admin is a virtual machine hosted on a virtualization server.
The host runs a standard enterprise Linux image; however, it is used
only for IP changes and no other purposes, and is configured with minimal disk
space and memory. The virtual machine is assigned its own NIC in the
virtual server network configuration.
</p><p>
The NFS stuck mounts VLAN change is executed using a Web interface. The GUI
allows system administrators with no networking knowledge or access
permissions to change the VLAN allocation for the specific router port where the dedicated server is connected to the desired VLAN. The GUI has a
static configuration file, with the server name, router name and dedicated
port. Once called through the Web interface, it uses SNMP to collect the
data from the router and present the table in the middle, the current
status and the VLAN drop-down menu. Figure 2 shows a mockup of the Web
interface.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11034NFSf1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Part of the Web Interface for VLAN Change
</p></div></div><p>
On clicking the Change VLAN button, the script, using SNMP, changes the
VLAN allocation for the specific port. Figure
3 shows the network flow.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11034NFSf3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. VLAN Change Diagram
</p></div></div><p>
Stuck mounts usually are identified by indirect symptoms exhibited by
affected hosts, such as increased load due to a large number of processes in
an uninterruptible sleep state or lsof not being able to complete its run.
The first step is to open the Web interface and change the VLAN to that
matching the unreachable file server. Once that's done, data-center
operations technicians are instructed to change the IP address and default
gateway on the Admin server to match that of the unreachable file server.
Alternatively, the IP address and default gateway can be configured
manually by logging in to the machine via the virtualization console and
performing the change. The host IP address can be changed under
/etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-ethx
or ifcfg-eth-idxxx; the default gateway is configured under
/etc/sysconfig/network/routes.
</p><p>
Once those two steps are complete, the network service on Admin needs to be
restarted with <tt  >/etc/init.d/network restart</tt>.
 The &ldquo;fake&rdquo; file server will come up and start
rejecting NFS requests from affected hosts, releasing the stuck processes.
At this stage, system administrators also can try to umount the stuck
mounts.
</p><p>
We encountered a number of challenges in setting up this solution. On the
network side, file servers are connected to routers; whereas compute
servers are connected to switches. This necessitated an innovative approach
by the network operations team, which resulted in the dedicated connection
to the NFS router.
</p><p>
Furthermore, this solution requires allocating site assets to be used only
rarely. We chose the virtual machine because of reduced cost and
higher flexibility in the setup rather than using a physical machine. Finally, the
IP/VLAN change procedure requires discipline and some skill on behalf of
system administrators to use it effectively.
</p><p>
We first tried the stuck NFS solution as a hack by manually changing the IP
address of a standard computer server located on the same segment as the
unreachable file server more than a year ago. The attempt proved
successful,
and we were able to save a number of important infrastructure machines with
stuck mounts, preventing downtime and reboots.
</p><p>
Prompted by this early success, we implemented the full solution and have
used it on a number of occasions. In July 2010, we prevented a number
of Samba servers from being rebooted, alongside another 21 compute servers.
</p><p>
The stuck NFS mounts solution has a direct impact on our ability to recover
from unexpected file server outages. We also are able to mitigate scheduled
file server EOL leftovers without reboots. In fact, one might argue that
the solution creates leniency that may lead to lesser discipline in using
strict file server EOL procedures, which requires all mounts to be removed
before the file servers are shut down.
We believe that the stuck NFS mounts solution does not replace hard work
and adherence to procedures and should be used only in an emergency.
</p><p>
The stuck NFS mounts solution is a valuable asset and a necessity in large
and dynamic environments. It allows us to maintain high uptime of important
machines, without unnecessary reboots due to mistakes or file server
traffic disruptions.
</p><p>
Our solution is simple and effective, and it has proven its worth on several
occasions in real-life circumstances. The implementation is transparent to
users and allows system administrators with no network operations of NFS
permissions or extensive knowledge to recover systems quickly and easily.
We recommend its use as a standard in computing environments that rely on
NFS infrastructure.

<h2 class="title">A Sage Experience</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Joey Bernard</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #207, July 2011</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Several mathematics packages under the GPL are available on-line.
You can find a package to help with almost any work you
need to do, and in a way, you almost are spoiled for choice. But, if your work
covers several areas of research, the one thing you likely are missing is
a uniform interface to these tools. Sage fills that role
(<a href="http://www.sagemath.org" target="_self">www.sagemath.org</a>). Like most
open-source software, Sage is available as packages for Linux, Windows,
Mac OS X and Solaris. You also can download a live CD that boots up in
a Linux environment based on Puppy Linux. And, of course, you always
can download the source code and build it yourself. All of these options are
available for download from the main site. The documentation 
also is very useful.
</p><p>
The basic idea behind Sage is to provide a unified experience
when using the bundled packages. This is done through a Python framework
wrapped around all of these packages. You can use Sage interactively
in two different ways: a graphical interface or a terminal interface. When you start Sage, it starts up a Web server
with a default port 8000. Once it has finished starting up (and it can
take some time on some systems), simply point your browser at
http://localhost:8000 (Figure 1). With this interface, you can create
and manage your worksheets. The terminal interface 
(Figure 2) will be familiar to anyone who has used
the command-line interface to programs like Maple, Mathematica, Maxima and
so on. You also can use Sage in your own
programs. You can link Sage into your own interpreted or compiled code,
or you can write standalone Python scripts. This gives you access to
all of the included libraries and packages, like GMP, PARI or Maxima.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11034sagef1.large.jpg"><img src="11034sagef1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. The starting point in the Web interface is a display of
your worksheets, along with tools to manage those worksheets and make
more.
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11034sagef2.large.jpg"><img src="11034sagef2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. The console session allows you to interact with Sage in a
form that may be more familiar to users of Maxima and Maple.
</p></div></div><p>
If you've used other computer mathematics packages,
Sage basics should be easy to pick up. The assignment operator
is =. The usual comparison operators are available: ==, &lt;=, =&gt;,
&lt; and &gt;. The operators +, * and - mean what you expect. With
division, you need to be more careful when dealing with differences
between reals and integers. The % operator gives you the remainder
from a division operation. If you are interested in the integer quotient,
you can get it by using //. Exponentiation can be achieved using **,
or ^, which is a synonym. You also have access to several mathematical
functions, such as functions like sin(),
cos() and tan(), and basic functions, like sqrt() or exp().
</p><p>
One of Sage's strong points is the available documentation.
From within the system, you can access lots of help. You can pull up a description of
a function, along with examples, with the command
<tt  >func?</tt>. For example,
if you want to know more about the sine function, type:


<pre     class="programlisting">
sage: sin?
Base Class:   &lt;class 'sage.functions.trig.Function_sin'&gt;
String Form:  sin
Namespace:    Interactive
File:         /Users/bernardj/Desktop/Sage-4.6.2-OSX-64bit-10.6.app/
              &#8618;Contents/Resources/sage/local/lib/python2.6/
              &#8618;site-packages/sage/functions/trig.py
Definition:   sin(self, *args, coerce=True, hold=False, 
                  &#8618;dont_call_method_on_arg=False)
Docstring:
       The sine function.
    
       EXAMPLES:
    
          sage: sin(0)
          0
          sage: sin(x).subs(x==0)
          0
          sage: sin(2).n(100)
          0.90929742682568169539601986591
          sage: loads(dumps(sin))
          sin
    
       We can prevent evaluation using the ``hold`` parameter:
    
          sage: sin(0,hold=True)
          sin(0)
    
       To then evaluate again, we currently must use Maxima via
       ``sage.symbolic.expression.Expression.simplify()``:
</pre>
</p><p>
If you don't know the full name of the function, you can try Sage's Tab
completion. It behaves just like the Tab completion in bash, so it should
be comfortable for users of most Linux distributions.
</p><p>
Creating your own functions is easy.
You can define a
function with the command <tt  >def</tt>. Input variables simply need to be listed
in the definition. You don't need to specify type for any variables. The
body of your function follows Python coding rules. Unlike other
programming languages, you don't use special characters (like parentheses)
to define sections of code. Blocks of code are defined by indentation
level. Lines of code at the same indentation level belong to the same
block. As a really silly example, let's say you wanted a function to
calculate the cube of a number. You could define a function called cube
in this way:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sage: def cube(x):
         answer = x * x * x return answer
</pre>
</p><p>
Then, you would be able to call this function just like you would with
any other function:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sage: cube(3) 27
</pre>
</p><p>
Within Sage, there is support for the common fundamental data types:
integers, reals, strings and so on. There also is support for the compound data
type, list. The list is opened with [ and closed with ]. Also, a list
can contain any combination of data types. For example, a list could be
defined as:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sage: a = [1, 5, "a string", 1/2, exp(10)]
</pre>
</p><p>
You can access individual elements with an index. The index is 0-based. So,
to pull out the third entry, you would use:


<pre     class="programlisting">
sage: s[2]
'a string'
</pre>
</p><p>
Use the command <tt  >len</tt> to find the length of your array. You can add
or delete elements with the command <tt  >.append()</tt> or
<tt  >del</tt>. As an example, if
you want to delete the string and tack it onto the end of the array, you
could use:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sage: b = a[2]
sage: del a[2]
sage: a.append(b)
</pre>
</p><p>
A more structured compound data type is the dictionary or associative
array. This is like a list, except each entry has a label along with a
value. You could set up a mapping between letters and numbers with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sage: mapping = {'a':1, 'b':2, 'c':3}
sage: mapping['b']
2
</pre>
</p><p>
As you can see, you also define a dictionary with { and }, rather than
[ and ]. Even more complex data types can be defined by creating a new
class. A class has a couple standard functions you will want to
override, __init__ and __repr__. The function __init__ gets called whenever
a new instance of the class is created. You can place any initialization
code here. The function __repr__ gets called whenever you want a
representation of the object printed.

A common task you likely will want to do is solve equations, either
exactly or numerically. You can do this with the
<tt  >solve</tt> command. 
Define the variables you want to use with the <tt  >var</tt>
command. Here's a simple example:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sage: x = var('x')
sage: solve(x^2 + 3*x +2, x)
[x == -2, x == -1]
</pre>
</p><p>
You also can solve equations with multiple variables:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sage: x, y = var('x', 'y')
sage: solve([x+y==6, x-y==4], x, y)
[[x == 5, y == 1]]
</pre>
</p><p>
If you're more interested in calculus, you can do differentiation and
integration&mdash;for example:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sage: x = var('x')
sage: diff(sin(x), x)
cos(x)

sage: y = var('y')
sage: integral(y, y)
1/2*y^2
</pre>
</p><p>
Sage is capable of handling 2-D and 3-D graphs. You can draw shapes, such
as circles or polygons, by using commands with parameters to define
dimensions. You also can draw graphs of functions with the
<tt  >plot</tt> command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sage: x = var('x')
sage: plot(x^2, (x, -2, 2))
</pre>
</p><p>
This displays your plot immediately. If you want to hold off on the
actual display, you can assign the plot to a variable with:


<pre     class="programlisting">
sage: p1 = plot(x^2, (x, -2, 2))
</pre>
</p><p>
To plot this function, use <tt  >show(p1)</tt>, which is useful if you
want to plot more than one function on the same graph. For example, the
following produces the graph shown in Figure 3:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sage: x= var('x')
sage: p1 = plot(x^2, (x, -2, 2))
sage: p2 = plot(x^3, (x, -2, 2))
sage: show(p1+p2)
</pre>
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11034sagef3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. You can plot multiple functions on the same graph.
</p></div></div><p>
You can write your own Sage scripts for more complex applications. These
can be written in a simple text file. Once you have written one, you can
read it in and run it within Sage with the <tt  >load</tt>
command. For example, to run a script named test1.sage, do:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sage: load "test1.sage"
</pre>
</p><p>
Using <tt  >load</tt>, sage reads in the file only once. If you are working on
developing a script, use the <tt  >attach</tt> command instead. This
attaches the script to your Sage session and reloads it whenever it
changes, which is useful while you develop your own procedures.
</p><p>
The last step you probably will want to do is generate some kind of
documentation around a fabulous discovery you made. Sage includes LaTeX
functionality to allow you to produce really pretty output. You also can
access jsMath for pretty printing mathematical equations. 
</p><p>
This article barely scratches the surface of what you can do with Sage. With nearly
100 packages included, going through the documentation
on the Web site is a must.

Cool Projects is one of our favorite topics at <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span>, and it's one
we've explored quite a few times. There are so many cool projects in our
archives, it's tough to know where to start.
</p><p>
Perhaps I could interest you in the programmable iRobot Create? The Create
is an educational robot brought to you by the same folks who make the
Roomba, so at the very least it'll be a great way to scare your pets and
children! (See &ldquo;Fun with the iRobot Create&rdquo;:
<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/10262" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/10262</a>.)

Maybe you'd like to get super geeky and/or ferment some beer? Either would
be a noble pursuit, so check out Kyle Rankin's article &ldquo;Temper
Temper&rdquo; (<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/10809" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/10809</a>). My favorite quote
says it all: &ldquo;I mean, why wouldn't you power your fridge with Linux if you
had the chance?&rdquo;
</p><p>
And, if you haven't already, you must check out one of my all-time
favorites: &ldquo;Build Your Own Arcade Game Player and Relive the
'80s!&rdquo; by
Shawn Powers (<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/9732" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/9732</a>). 
I dare you to read it and not be nostalgic for the 1980s.
(Unless, of course, you don't remember the 1980s, and then get off my lawn!
Only joking, I love you too.) Just looking at the pictures, I swear I can
smell the rancid spilled Coke and hygienically challenged teenage boys in
the mall arcade. Ah, the good-old days.

<h2 class="title">The Web Proxy Autodiscovery Protocol</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #207, July 2011</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
WPAD certainly isn't new technology. In fact, it's been around for many
years. However, it seems that many system administrators are unaware of
its magic. Simply put, WPAD allows you to offer proxy information to users
in your network without ever touching their computers. The feature is
supported by most browsers, and in general, it &ldquo;just works&rdquo;.
</p><p>
Although proxy information can be sent over DHCP, unfortunately, not all
clients honor those settings. For maximum compatibility, it's best to
have a local DNS record that points the domain &ldquo;wpad&rdquo; to a Web server.
You put a configuration file named wpad.dat in the root level of that
Web server, and clients get proxy information automatically, assuming
they're configured to do so. (Most are by default; this is what your
browser refers to as automatically detecting proxy settings.)
</p><p>
Here's a simple wpad.dat file:

<pre     class="programlisting">
function FindProxyForURL(url, host)
{
   if (isPlainHostName(host) ||
       dnsDomainIs(host, "my.local.network.domain.org") ||
       (host=="127.0.0.1") )
       return "DIRECT";
   else
       return "PROXY my.proxy.server.address:8080";
}
</pre>
</p><p>
For more detailed
information on how to configure your custom wpad.dat file, check out
