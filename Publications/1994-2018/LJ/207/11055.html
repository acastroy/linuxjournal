Parsing cal output.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10cc580.0x11c4358"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Last month, we started a script that worked backward from a day and month
date and figured out the most recent year&mdash;including possibly the current
year&mdash;that would match that date occurring on that particular day. For
example, April 1st as a Friday was most recently in this year, 2011, but
April 1st as a Tuesday? When did that last occur?
</p><p>
To make things interesting, our script is focused on tapping in to one of
the unsung utilities of Linux, cal, and parsing its output to
identify a day for a given date.
</p><p>
As is typical with a shell script, much of the work so far has been
involved in normalizing the input data so that what we hand to the
cal program will work and be understood by the program.
</p><p>
The bigger challenge, however, was to figure out whether a possible date
could be in the current year. Since the program always is looking
backward, it needs to know the current date to compare. That is, I'm
writing this on April 3, 2011. If I check for the most recent April 1 being
a Friday, it should say 2011, but if I check for the most recent May 1
being a Sunday, it should not suggest 2011. That's in the future and
isn't a valid answer.
</p><p>
That's all shown in my previous column, so let's get on to something new:
figuring out how to parse the cal output.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10cc580.0x11c46c8"></a>
Parsing cal Calendars</h2></div></div><p>
For any given month and year, cal produces output similar to this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
    August 2008
Su Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa
                1  2
3  4  5  6  7  8  9
10 11 12 13 14 15 16
17 18 19 20 21 22 23
24 25 26 27 28 29 30
31
</pre>
</p><p>
Let's say we're looking for August 3rd. To search for it in this
output, we need to specify that there should not be a digit before or after
the date. This is doable with a simple regex:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ cal aug 2008 | grep -e '[^0-9]3[^0-9]'
3  4  5  6  7  8  9
</pre>
</p><p>
(As you'll learn later, this is insufficient as a regular expression. If
you're really paying attention, you're already suspecting it's
going to end up being a bit more complicated.)
</p><p>
Now, we need to figure out which digit matches.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10cc580.0x11c4988"></a>
awk to the Rescue</h2></div></div><p>
The basic approach we're going to use is to have awk step
through each field on lines that match the pattern specified by using a
for loop:

<pre     class="programlisting">

{ for (i=1;i&lt;=NF;i++) if ($i~/regex/) print i}

</pre>
</p><p>
We could use this with the grep statement above, but let's save a
command by letting awk do the conditional test too:


<pre     class="programlisting">

$ cal aug 2008 | awk -e '/regex/ { for (i=1;i&lt;=NF;i++)
  if ($i~/regex/ print i }'

</pre>
</p><p>
To test this, let's use a regular expression that tests for the 5th day
of the month:

<pre     class="programlisting">
[^0-9]5[^0-9]
</pre>
</p><p>
This kind of works, but there's a problem. If we search for the 10th,
because it appears at the very beginning of the line, it doesn't match
the regular expression fragment <tt  >[^0-9]10</tt>. The solution means our
regex becomes more complicated, but here it is&mdash;one that works for the
situation where it's possibly either the beginning of the line or the
end of the line:

<pre     class="programlisting">
[^0-9]10[^0-9]|^10[^0-9]|[^0-9]10$
</pre>
</p><p>
The | is a logical &ldquo;or&rdquo; statement, so it's now the
earlier expression <span   class="emphasis"><em>or</em></span> one that has the pattern we seek followed by
not-a-digit, but is at the beginning of the line (the ^ by
itself) <span   class="emphasis"><em>or</em></span> is the pattern preceded by not-a-digit at the end of a line (the
$ notation).
</p><p>
Fortunately, we're writing a script so we won't have to type this in
more than once. Just as well!
</p><p>
There's another wrinkle in this output. We need to know not only in what
field the matching number appears, but also how many fields total are on
the matching line. Why? Otherwise, match 2 above occurring on a
Monday would look exactly like the above, the 2nd occurring on a Saturday.
</p><p>
Here's our test script fragment, so far:


<pre     class="programlisting">
expr="[^0-9]${day}[^0-9]|^${day}[^0-9]|[^0-9]${day}\$"
cal aug 2008 | awk "/$expr/ { print \$0 }"
</pre>
</p><p>
Notice that we need to use double quotes so that the variable $day is
expended, and then $expr is also expanded, which means that we also need to
escape the $0 in this test.
</p><p>
That's not what we want though. The awk statement needs to
be more sophisticated, because we want to know the matching field number
(for example, day of week 1&ndash;7) along with the total number of fields in the
matching line. Ready?


<pre     class="programlisting">

expr="[^0-9]${day}[^0-9]|^${day}[^0-9]|[^0-9]${day}\$"
cal aug 2008 | awk "/$expr/ { for (i=1;i&lt;=NF;i++) {
     if (\$i~/${day}/) { print \"i=\"i\", NF=\"NF }}}"

</pre>
</p><p>
The double quotes add a tiny bit of complication, but really, this is just
a complicated script.
</p><p>
The output, against our August 2008 calendar, looks like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sh match.sh 2
i=2, NF=2
$ sh match.sh 10
i=1, NF=7
$ sh match.sh 19
i=3, NF=7
</pre>
</p><p>
That all makes sense. The next challenge is to figure out what day of the
week we've matched for a given day and number of days in the week.
Remember, day #1 on a three-day week is Thursday, while day #1 in a seven-day week
is Sunday. Confusing, eh? 
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10cc580.0x11c5430"></a>
Day Of Week as an Array</h2></div></div><p>
The fast way to calculate this is to, well, pre-calculate it by creating a
bunch of arrays. Like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
if NF=1 days=[Sat]
if NF=2 days=[Fri,Sat]
if NF=3 days=[Thu,Fri,Sat]
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10cc580.0x11c5590"></a></h2></div></div><p>
and so on. There's a formula at play here, but more important,
there's a pattern: (7-NF)-i is consistent. So day #1 on a three-day week is
(7-3)+1 = 5 = Thursday, while day #1 on a 7-day week is (7-7)+1 = Sunday.
</p><p>
Let's double-check: in Aug 2008, Aug 1 is (7-2)+1 = 6 = Saturday, and
Aug 4 = (7-7)+2 = Monday and Aug 31 = (7-1)+1 = 7 = Saturday.
</p><p>
Uh-oh, that last one's wrong, showing that we need to differentiate
between the first week of the month, in which situation the days are
right-aligned (as it were!), but in the last week of the month, they're
left-aligned.
</p><p>
Ah, another nuance. Crikey, this is a rather tricky to write, isn't
it?
</p><p>
Next month, we'll continue to build the script. Meanwhile, experiment
with awk and regular expressions and see if you can find a more
streamlined solution.
