Is Eben Moglen's FreedomBox the ticket out of Facebook's walled garden?

As entities on the Web, we have devolved. Client-server has become
calf-cow. The client&mdash;that's you&mdash;is the calf, and the Web site is
the cow. What you get from the cow is milk and cookies. The milk is what
you go to the site for. The cookies are what the site gives to you, mostly
for its own business purposes, chief among which is tracking you like an
animal. There are perhaps a billion or more server-cows now, each with its
own &ldquo;brand&rdquo; (as marketers and cattle owners like to say).

This is not what the Net's founders had in mind. Nor was it what Tim
Berners-Lee meant for his World Wide Web of hypertext documents to become.
But it's what we've got, and it's getting worse.
</p><p>
In February 2011, Eben Moglen gave a landmark speech to the Internet
Society titled &ldquo;Freedom in the Cloud&rdquo;
(<a href="http://www.softwarefreedom.org/events/2010/isoc-ny/FreedomInTheCloud-transcript.html" target="_self">www.softwarefreedom.org/events/2010/isoc-ny/FreedomInTheCloud-transcript.html</a>), in which he unpacked the problem. In
the beginning, he said, the Internet was designed as &ldquo;a network of peers
without any intrinsic need for hierarchical or structural control, and
assuming that every switch in the Net is an independent, free-standing
entity whose volition is equivalent to the volition of the human beings who
want to control it&rdquo;. Alas, &ldquo;it never worked out that
way&rdquo;. Specifically:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
If you were an ordinary human, it was hard to perceive that the underlying
architecture of the Net was meant to be peerage because the OS software
with which you interacted very strongly instantiated the idea of the server
and client architecture.
</p><p>
In fact, of course, if you think about it, it was even worse than that. The
thing called &ldquo;Windows&rdquo; was a degenerate version of a thing
called &ldquo;X
Windows&rdquo;. It, too, thought about the world in a server-client architecture,
but what we would now think of as backwards. The server was the thing at
the human being's end. That was the basic X Windows conception of the
world. It served communications with human beings at the end points of the
Net to processes located at arbitrary places near the center in the middle,
or at the edge of the Net. It was the great idea of (Microsoft) Windows in
an odd way to create a political archetype...which reduced the human
being to the client and produced a big, centralized computer, which we
might have called a server, which now provided things to the human being on
take-it-or-leave-it terms.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
True, but let's not forget Netscape's role. The HTTP cookie was created by
Lou Montulli in 1994, when he was working at Netscape on the first
e-commerce servers. The idea was innocent enough: to recall state and save
work by remembering shared data, such as the contents of shopping carts.
Today, cookies are used for many other things, including user tracking,
mostly so advertising can be personalized. The less-polite word for this is
spying. Eben singles out Facebook as an especially egregious offender and
describes its offering this way: &ldquo;I will give you free Web hosting and some
PHP doodads and you get spying for free all the time&rdquo;.
</p><p>
This trade-off is the rule, not the exception. In the study that launched
its &ldquo;What They Know&rdquo; series last year, the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Wall Street
Journal</em></span> said all but
one of the 50 most-popular Web sites installed tracking cookies in users'
browsers. (The only exception, no surprise, was Wikipedia.) One,
Dictionary.com, installed 234 tracking files, of which all but 11 were from
tracking companies.
</p><p>
The end state of this system was forecast with metaphorical precision by
<span   class="emphasis"><em>The Matrix</em></span>, back in 1999. From the standpoint of its business model, the
advertising-supported commercial Web is a machine world in which users are
nothing more than batteries to whom &ldquo;experience&rdquo; is
&ldquo;delivered&rdquo; through
pipes. In that world, advertising companies are the agents, and tracking
cookies are like the electric scorpion that wiggles into Neo through his
navel so he can be followed around.
</p><p>
Eben doesn't want us to go there. So he had a plan: FreedomBoxes
(<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/16/nyregion/16about.html?_r=1" target="_self">www.nytimes.com/2011/02/16/nyregion/16about.html?_r=1</a>). These are
&ldquo;cheap, small, low-power plug servers...the size of a cell-phone charger,
running on a low-power chip&rdquo;. He sees these boxes starting cheap and
dropping in price, eventually costing less than $30 apiece. That's roughly
the price of cell-phone earbuds.
</p><p>
Thus, Eben and friends created the FreedomBox Foundation
(<a href="https://freedomboxfoundation.org" target="_self">https://freedomboxfoundation.org</a>), set up a
KickStarter project
(<a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/721744279/push-the-freedombox-foundation-from-0-to-60-in-30" target="_self">www.kickstarter.com/projects/721744279/push-the-freedombox-foundation-from-0-to-60-in-30</a>) and quickly attracted enough donations to get rolling.
(They asked for $60,000 and got $86,724.) Others jumped on board. Debian,
for example, has its own FreedomBox project
(<a href="http://wiki.debian.org/FreedomBox" target="_self">wiki.debian.org/FreedomBox</a>) to support the foundation's
efforts with working code.
</p><p>
Although Eben didn't aim his appeal to big companies, we can use their
help, especially at the retail level. For FreedomBoxes to be popular,
they'll need to show up where the populace shops. That means we should see
FreedomBoxes on the shelves at Best Buy, Radio Shack and Walmart&mdash;and
not just at, say, Amazon. Hey, companies don't need to be cows any more
than humans need to be calves. When the world fills up with FreedomBoxes,
customers can help companies evolve.
</p><p>
The economic case we need to make is that free customers are more valuable
than captive ones. But, we can't make it if we're still on the ranch. We
need to break out.
