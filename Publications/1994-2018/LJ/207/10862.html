E-publishing for e-readers involves a bit more than merely printing to a
PDF&mdash;at least if you want a professional-looking result.
As always though, open source can help you get from here to there.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1747580.0x183f358"></a></h2></div></div><p>
With Sony e-readers, Kindles, Kobos, Nooks, iPads, smartphones and the new
Nintendo handhelds all giving you the ability to read on the go without
having to cart around a stack of paperbacks, the e-book market is
growing like an alien embryo in a doberman. All the major stores allow
independents to list with them, and the result is, not surprisingly, a lot of
books that look like they weren't edited or typeset at all.
Ever seen a blog with no theme, where the text is blocky with no indents or
proper spacing? A lot of these books look like that.
</p><p>
All these devices have created a demand for content, which means that, as
with HTML in the early days of the Web, there's a demand for people who can
make it look good. There also are independent-minded folks who are
determined to do their own typesetting rather than contracting out the
work, even if it means shelling out a lot of money for programs with which to
do it.
</p><p>
But, this is open source, that wonderful corner of the world where we don't
need no stinking proprietary programs. When it comes to e-books though,
every e-reader device has its own proprietary format. EPUB is the available
open standard, and being an open standard, it's pretty easy to migrate
from EPUB to other formats for other readers (some retailers even will do
that dirty work for you). First though, you have to make an EPUB, which
looks from the outside like a nontrivial task.
</p><p>
It turns out there are about a dozen different ways to make an e-book on
Linux, from OpenOffice.org templates and extensions to HTML-to-EPUB conversion
utilities. You can use Scribus to lay out your e-book, export to PDF,
convert to HTML and convert from there to EPUB. You even can hand-code
the thing.
</p><p>
If you're not familiar with the difficulties and advantages of each
approach, the decision can mean making a choice blindly. Covering
all the options in detail would take a lot more space than I have in this
article, so I concentrate on a method that exposes the
underlying structure of the e-book for fine tinkering while using a GUI
that streamlines the process.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1747580.0x183f6c8"></a>
The Theory</h2></div></div><p>
E-book authoring essentially is a layout and design process that uses
HTML and CSS to create the final output, which is a limited subset of XHTML and XML.
This final output is all stuffed into a single zip file and is designed to be widely readable.
Because of this, working with it can be just different enough from hand-coding
vanilla HTML to become maddening. Nonetheless, to create a proper e-book, you
need, at minimum, the following:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Hierarchical arrangement of content.
</p></li><li><p>
Clickable tables of contents.
</p></li><li><p>
Any graphics should be anchored inline with flowing text.
</p></li><li><p>
The ability to use tables.
</p></li><li><p>
The ability to use indents. (It may seem like a strange item to be on the
list, but one of the
most obvious markers of an amateurish e-book is lack of indentation.)
</p></li></ol></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1747580.0x183fb98"></a>
The Work Flow</h2></div></div><p>
After a lot of tinkering, I settled on a work flow that seems to work well
for most purposes&mdash;an exception may be textbooks and other nonfiction
works that
have highly complex layout requirements. Although I suspect that this work flow
may accommodate such projects, I can't say with confidence that it will
scale that far. There is, of course, one way to find out.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1747580.0x183fca0"></a>
Step 1: the Manuscript</h2></div></div><p>
First things first, laying out your e-book is not the same thing as writing
it. Word processors and writing programs like CeltX have tools designed to
make certain types of writing easier to manage&mdash;take advantage of them.
</p><p>
If you want your e-book to look good, start with a solid, clean manuscript
that won't require editing when you get to the other side. Forget headers
and footers&mdash;they don't translate. There is a way to do them in EPUB,
but it's an optional part of the standard that most e-readers haven't
implemented yet, so it's rarely worth the trouble.
</p><p>
As I'm writing this, the internal structure of EPUB files is difficult to
manage in OpenOffice.org and other word processors, particularly with longer
documents. So, although OpenOffice.org has some extensions to let it export
EPUB, it's much quicker and cleaner to do the layout in a different
program.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1747580.0x183fe58"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Note:</b></p><p>
The definitive resource for all manner of programs and plugins for creating
e-books and converting between e-book formats, including the OpenOffice.org
extensions, is the MobileRead Wiki:
<a href="http://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/E-book_conversion" target="_self">wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/E-book_conversion</a>.
</p></div><p>
For our purposes here, I've chosen Sigil, a purpose-built e-book editor
that works very much like Quanta and other Web-authoring suites. Although
it's still
in its early days, it seems fairly solid, isn't crash-prone, and every tool
included in the stable release works as advertised.
</p><p>
Once you have a clean manuscript in your word processor, export it to HTML.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1747580.0x1840170"></a>
Step 2: Sigil</h2></div></div><p>
To follow along with the rest of this how-to guide, you need
Sigil. The program plays nice with newer distros in its binary form, and
it's a breeze to build from source. You can find everything you need
(including detailed install and build instructions) at
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/sigil" target="_self">code.google.com/p/sigil</a>.
</p><p>
Once installed, run the program. It should work without a hitch,
but if it fails to start, chances are you don't have a current-enough
version of libstdc++. If this is the case, you need to go back and
install from source. The rest of us will wait here and mock your name for
not reading the dependencies list while you catch up.
</p><p>
Sigil will open up looking something like Figure 1. Begin by
importing the HTML of your book using the option under the file menu. Once
done, the fun begins.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10862f1.large.jpg"><img src="10862f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Sigil Opening Screen
</p></div></div><p>
The program has a few basic formatting tools. You can control
paragraph spacing, chapters and so on very simply with the GUI tools, and I
explain how to use them and the structural tools in a bit.
</p><p>
Like most WYSIWYG HTML editors, Sigil lets you edit the preview of
your document directly. If you press the icon with the book and the
brackets (Figure 2), it gives you split-window access to the
underlying markup and CSS. (And, for purposes of brevity in this
article, I'm forced to assume that you know the basics of HTML and CSS. If
you need to get the basics, see <a href="http://www.w3schools.com" target="_self">www.w3schools.com</a> or any one
of a hundred other good, free resources on the Web.)
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10862f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Toolbar Button to Show Underlying HTML and CSS
</p></div></div><p>
You'll notice that your imported HTML looks blocky&mdash;you've probably
lost all your indents, although it's preserved your bolds and italics&mdash;and it
just looks and feels boring.
Well, we're going to fix all that.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1747580.0x1840850"></a>
Step 3: Basic Layout Conventions</h2></div></div><p>
The experience of reading on an e-reader is a mid-point between a paperback
and a Web page, but the appeal of an e-book is that it delivers a more
paperback-like experience than reading on an LCD without the bulk of an
actual paperback.
</p><p>
There are a few layout conventions that differentiate a book from a Web
site, and ignoring them gets you, at best, an e-book that looks like a
vanilla text file with better fonts. (For a resource on good book layout
conventions, see <a href="http://www.members.shaw.ca/nathanieldesign/book_layout.htm" target="_self">www.members.shaw.ca/nathanieldesign/book_layout.htm</a>).

</p><p>
And, now that I've mentioned fonts, let's start there. The standards for the Web
are Arial and Helvetica. They're clear, sans serif and easy to read
even on poorly designed Web sites and dim screens. Aesthetically ennobling,
they're not. Bare functionality is the name of their game, and they do
it remarkably well. For e-books, however, you want a font that mimics the
aesthetic of a paper book, so you'll want to use a proportional serif font
like Garamond, Times New Roman or New Century Schoolbook. To set the
font, edit the CSS like you would for a Web site to specify the font you
need.
</p><p>
You also want to make sure your paragraphs are properly indented. If
you're converting an OpenOffice.org .odt file to HTML, you're going to lose your tab-based
indentations. The reason? In HTML, a tab means precisely nothing. The
only way to get indentations in your e-book properly is to build them into
the CSS. Using margin controls to do it in OpenOffice.org will put the CSS
into your exported HTML, but you also can use the following code to indent
a paragraph:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;p class="sgc-2"&gt; paragraph &lt;/p&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
Another little touch often used, particularly in novels, is the drop
cap&mdash;the large, often stylized capital letter that begins
the first paragraph of a chapter. You can do this too, in HTML, by
applying the following to your CSS:

<pre     class="programlisting">
.dropcap {
    float: left;
    font-size: 3em;
    line-height: 1;
    font-weight: bold;
    margin-right: 0.2em;
}
</pre>
</p><p>
Once applied, you can use a &lt;span class="dropcap"&gt; tag to implement your
drop cap wherever you see fit (Figure 3).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10862f3.large.jpg"><img src="10862f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Drop Cap CSS in Action
</p></div></div><p>
Finally, there's the thorny issue of inline images. Like HTML, EPUB is a
flowing-text format rather than a fixed-text format. And, like HTML, it's
designed that way to accommodate a variety of screen sizes, so that the
customer doesn't get tied to a single device. Anchoring images, thus, can
become a bit of a problem if you use the wrong method.
</p><p>
The &lt;img&gt; tag tells the interpreter where to place your graphic depending
on the align option&mdash;if you don't tell it, it just drops the image in as an
inline element as if it were another character. Normally on a Web site, you
can use top, bottom, left, right and center as your alignment options.
You still can use those here, although top, bottom and center tend to look pretty
ugly when used in an e-book, so I highly recommend using only
<tt  >align="left"</tt> and <tt  >align="right"</tt> if you want the project to look good.
</p><p>
For reference, the EPUB standard supports PNG, JPG, GIF and SVG. Because
it's a vector format, SVG is the only one of these that scales well, so I
recommend using it for diagrams whenever possible. When sizing PNG, JPG
and GIF, bear in mind that most e-book readers are comparatively low
resolution, so you can use them at slightly more than Web-appropriate sizes
without too much worry.
</p><p>
Finally, there are pull-quotes (Figure 4). To pull
these off, you'll need a little CSS and a little HTML. The CSS defines the
pull-quote class, and it goes something like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
.pquote {
    float: left;
    width: 8em;
    background: #ddf;
    font-weight: bold;
    padding: 1em;
    margin: 0 0.5em 0.5em 0;
}
</pre>
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10862f4.large.jpg"><img src="10862f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Pull-Quotes
</p></div></div><p>
Then, to use the pull-quote inline, use this HTML:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;blockquote class="pquote"&gt; pull quote text &lt;/blockquote&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
Tables, the last thing in on the layout checklist, are the easiest to
manage&mdash;simply put them into the code screen the way you would any HTML
tables, and they will render beautifully inline.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1747580.0x1c395a0"></a>
Step 4: Creating the Structure</h2></div></div><p>
The other major defining characteristic of a professional-feeling e-book is
the internal structure. One of the major tools authors use to control
the timing and flow of their prose is structure&mdash;page breaks, chapter
breaks and so on. In e-books, which are generally a flowing-text format, you
use internal data structure to reproduce similar effects. A clickable
table of contents, hard breaks between the chapters and end notes where
applicable are the bare minimum.
</p><p>
The complicated procedures one must go through to create this structure
when exporting from OpenOffice.org via its available extensions (and this
experience is typical of most free authoring solutions) is the reason that
the commercial products on the market tend to sell for upward of $100&ndash;$200.
This is where Sigil shines. It makes short work of this otherwise most
annoying part of the process.
</p><p>
The first thing you'll want to appear in your e-book is the artwork. Move
your cursor to the beginning of your text, and from the Insert
drop-down menu, select Image. For optimal results across readers,
you want cover art that is 590 wide x 750 high, 72ppi or higher resolution,
saved in the RGB colorspace. JPG, GIF and PNG are all supported in the
standard for cover art.
</p><p>
Next, to tag the art as your cover art, you need to go to the left
sidebar, find the cover art image in the Images folder for the
project and right-click on it. A menu will pop up. From the menu,
select Add Semantics and click on the submenu option Cover
art. This will set the tags in the book properly. Now, back in the
main editing pane, position your cursor directly after the art, and press
Ctrl-Enter. This creates a chapter break so that the image will display as
a single-pane page on reader devices.
</p><p>
With the cover art done, it's time to create the rest of the internal
structure. At every chapter break (or anywhere you want a hard break in
the book), create another chapter in the e-book with Ctrl-Enter. You'll
notice that, as happened with the artwork, each Ctrl-Enter creates a
new tab, numbered serially.
</p><p>
Once you have broken all your chapters, it's time to create a table of
contents. Start with your chapter headings (for example, &ldquo;Chapter
1&rdquo;). Highlight the text for your heading, then, in the Select
Heading list box, select Heading 1. Do this
for every chapter heading. For more complex documents, use Heading
2 and onward down the hierarchy&mdash;this will create an outline
when you autogenerate the table of contents.
</p><p>
To autogenerate, go to the Tools menu, and select TOC
Editor. Here you can decide which chapter breaks to include in the
clickable table of contents, and you can edit the chapter titles as they
will appear in that table of contents. Once you're satisfied with the way
it looks, the last thing you need to do is create the metadata to
display on your e-book reader's index.
</p><p>
Under Tools, select Meta Editor. In the window that
pops up, fill in the title, author and language. Use the Add
Basic and Add Advanced buttons to add other relevant fields,
such as the ISBN, publication dates, genres and so forth.
And, believe it or not, you're done.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1747580.0x1c399c0"></a>
Wrapping It Up</h2></div></div><p>
Because of the way e-book authoring works, defining the style that suits
your particular book is far easier than it looks at first glance. A
passing familiarity with CSS and HTML should be enough to allow you to
create eye-catching layouts with transitional artwork and all the
trimmings. Several enterprising folks, such as the group at EPUB Zen
Garden (<a href="http://epubzengarden.com/contribute" target="_self">epubzengarden.com/contribute</a>) have released professional
book templates for noncommercial use, and a number of others are selling
good layout templates. Of course, with a good eye, a bit of patience and
the tools described in this article, you can give your e-books their own
unique look for only the cost of your own labor and expertise.
