Linux box? One of the most impressive applications I've seen
available for Linux is SatTrack 3.1 for Unix by Manfred Bester.
SatTrack is a very powerful tool for satellite tracking and orbit
prediction. It can tell you when a satellite, the Mir Space
Station, or a space shuttle will be overhead, where they are at any
time and when you might be able to see them. It can even control
some external tracking hardware, such as antenna rotors or
telescopes. The program can run from the console or a terminal
window, or if launched inside an xterm, it can bring up a world map
showing the current position of any satellite or group of
satellites. It can do all this, and best of all, SatTrack 3.1 is
free for private, non-commercial use.
</p><p><a href="0212f1.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 1.
SatTrack v3.1 Menu</b></span></a></p><p>As an amateur radio operator, I first became interested in
using SatTrack to track the many amateur radio satellite in
low-earth orbit. These satellites receive an amateur radio signal
on one frequency, amplify it, and retransmit it on another
frequency. Two stations on opposite sides of a continent or an
ocean can communicate through one of these satellites using radios
that ordinarily wouldn't be able to reach each other. Since most of
these satellites are in low earth orbit, however, they pass
overhead infrequently, and then only for several minutes at a time.
Knowing when they will appear where is imperative to successful
communication. To solve this tracking problem, it's Linux and
SatTrack to the rescue!</p><p><a href="0212f2.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 2.
SatTrack v3.1 Multi-Satellite Line
Display</b></span></a></p><p>SatTrack was designed to compile and run on most Unix
operating systems, and it runs quite nicely under Linux. One really
nice feature of the program is that it can operate from a terminal
window, such as a VT100 terminal, or from a Linux virtual console,
if you can't or don't want to use X. On the other hand, if you do
run X, you can pull up a full-color world map that will show you
where any satellite or group of satellites is at the moment, where
the sun is, where the gray line separating the sunlit side of the
planet from the dark side of the planet is, and a graphical
projection the path of the next several orbits of a satellite.
Tools that come with SatTrack can automate the process of
downloading fresh Keplerian two-line elements&mdash;the files that
describe a satellite's orbit&mdash;directly from the Air Force Institute
of Technology's FTP server.</p><p><a href="0212f3.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 3.
SatTrack v3.1 Graphic Tracking Display</b></span></a></p><p>SatTrack is widely used in the space community. According to
the program's home page:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Users of SatTrack V3.1 include NASA's Jet
Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), Johnson Space Center (JSC), Goddard
Space Flight Center (GSFC) and Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC),
the European Space Agency (ESA), the German Aerospace Research
Establishment (DLR), the National Aerospace Laboratory (NLR) of The
Netherlands, the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), the
Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station, a large number of universities
and other institutions, as well as thousands of private users all
over the world.</p></blockquote></div><p>You can find more information about SatTrack, including its
copyright and licensing information and the latest version of the
SatTrack 3.1 distribution at
http://www.primenet.com/~bester/sattrack.html.
</p><p>Compiling SatTrack in a Linux system is fairly
straightforward. Instructions on how to compile the program are
included in the file SatTrack/src/README_MAKE, and I won't repeat
all of them here. The most important options to choose, though, are
in SatTrack/src/Makefile and SatTrack/src/include/sattrack.h.
(These will make sense if you look at the files in question.) In
the Makefile, the machine type I chose is (yes, I actually do have
a 486)</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# i486          (i486 with Linux)
#
CPU             = i486/Linux
CC_CMACH        = -O2 -m486
CC_LMACH        =
CC              = gcc
</pre><p>The user compile-time options I chose were:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
CC_CUSR     = -DREVERSEVIDEO -DSUNTRANSITS
-DXWINDOW
</pre><p>I used the following options for compiling and linking:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
X11         = /usr/include/X11
LX11            = -L/usr/X11R6/lib -lX11 -lXt
-lICE -lSM
# X11R6
</pre><p>In SatTrack/src/include/sattrack.h, the only changes I made were to
define the home directory:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#define SATDIR    "/usr/local/bin/X11" /* directory where SatTrack */
</pre><p>and to change the print command (you might choose to use nenscript
or some other ascii to postscript utility):</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#define PRINTCMD              "a2ps"
#define PRINTOPT              "-nL -nu -c"
</pre><p>After these changes, SatTrack should compile successfully. One
final thing to check after compiling is the write privileges on the
SatTrack/pred/ directory; if you install SatTrack in a common bin
directory, you might want to make that directory world writable or
SatTrack may not be able to write an orbit prediction to a file (or
print it). For simplicity in calling the program, I've defined a
choice in one of my pull-down fvwm menus as follows:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
        Exec    "SatTrack"      exec
/usr/bin/X11/color-xterm -sb -sl 500 -j
-ls -fn 7x14 -geometry 132x26 -T 'SatTrack
for Unix 3.1' -n 'SatTrack' -e
/usr/local/bin/X11/SatTrack/run/sattrack &amp;
</pre><p>Using SatTrack is straightforward. After telling the program your
location and the satellite you're interested in, you are presented
with a list of options. You can compute an orbit projection over
several days. SatTrack will succinctly describe every pass over
your location including times and durations of each pass, the peak
elevation the satellite will reach, and whether it will be visible.
Another option is to display the current position of the satellite.
You can display one satellite at a time or a whole group of
satellites (such as all the amateur radio satellites). SatTrack
will tell you which satellites are currently over your horizon and
how long it will be until satellites enter or leave your field of
view. When appropriate, SatTrack can even tell you the radio
frequency uplink and/or downlink of a satellite, and dynamically
compensate for the Doppler shift! More advanced users can integrate
SatTrack with antenna or telescope pointing hardware to track an
object precisely as it passes overhead. SatTrack is on of very few
satellite tracking program commonly available for any operating
system that can show satellite visibility or actively control
tracking hardware.</p><p>The following are SatTrack Stellite Icons</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="0212f4.jpg"></div><p>U.S. Space Shuttle Icon</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="0212f4b.jpg"></div><p>Space Shuttle Icon</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="0212f4c.jpg"></div><p>MIR Icon</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="0212f4d.jpg"></div><p>International Space Station Icon</p><p>SatTrack is an absolute wonder for tracking satellites. With
the help of SatTrack, I've made my first two-way communication with
another ham radio operator over 1000 miles away using the Russian
amateur radio satellite RS-15, and I look forward to making many
more. Those who are not ham radio operators can find fun uses for
SatTrack as well. Weather satellites, geological survey satellites,
and others are constantly sending image and telemetry data to the
earth. SatTrack can also tell you when satellites might be visible.
Ever seen a space shuttle fly overhead? The Mir Space Station? The
Hubble Space Telescope? With binoculars or a telescope, you might
even see smaller satellites, once SatTrack has told you where and
when to look. Doing a presentation on the Global Positioning
System? Show your audience exactly where the GPS satellites are in
orbit. Need a compelling computer display for that sci-fi epic
you're producing for Film Studies 101? SatTrack can provide
ever-changing graphic disply windows.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb4a580.0xc434d0"></a>Information about SatTrack</h2></div></div><p>Information about SatTrack for Unix is available at
