    Newbie Tip on Finding
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1427580.0x151f348"></a></h2></div></div><p>As a new Linux user, I discovered that I
had a hard time finding my way around the file system. I knew the
<b  >find</b> command was out there, but remembering all
the options required to make it search the right places, find the
right files, and print the right answers was something I couldn't
do, at first. So I made up my own command, using a shell script,
and called it <span   class="bold"><b>fnd</b></span>.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>fnd</b></span> takes one argument, the
name of the file you want to locate, complete with any wildcards
you may wish to include, and pipes its output to
<b  >less</b>, which then allows you to view a large list
of results. What you get, on each line of output, is the complete
path to any file that you're looking for. I find it amazingly
useful (as is a rough familiarity with the <b  >less</b>
command). Here's my script:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
!/bin/bash
find / -iname $1 -mount -print |less
</pre><p>That's it. The <b  >-iname</b> option tells find to
be case insensitive, the <b  >$1</b> is a variable that
substitutes in your command line argument,
<b  >-mount</b> tells <b  >find</b> not to
search directories on other file systems like your CD-ROM (because
mine is wonky and locks up the machine if it is accessed). The
<b  >-print</b> option is required or you don't get any
output. (Get used to it, it's *nix.) The | (pipe) symbol tells
<b  >find</b> to direct its output to the
<b  >less</b> command, so you can see your results in
style. Don't forget the / right after the <b  >find</b>
command, or it won't know where to look. Enjoy. You won't regret
the time you spend keying in this little shortcut, and don't forget
to put it in a bin or sbin directory after using
<b  >chmod</b> to make it executable.  &mdash;Jim

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1427580.0x151fa28"></a>X Term Titlebar Function</h2></div></div><p>In the mail from issue 9, Jim Murphy says that the
<b  >-print</b> option to <b  >find</b> is
necessary to get output from the <b  >find</b> command,
and follows that up with &ldquo;get used to it, it's *nix.&rdquo; Well, he's
part right. Linux does require this. However, any users who work on
other Unix boxes will find slight differences in some of the common
CLI (Command Line Interface) commands. For example,
<b  >find</b> on Solaris does not require the
<b  >-print</b> option to get output. Just food for
thought.</p><p>Second, I have an xterm title bar function that people might
find useful. I'll give the code first, then explain what it
does.</p><p>In your .bashrc (or .kshrc&mdash;note this only works on ksh style
shells) add the following:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
HOSTNAME=`uname -n`
if [ "$TERM" = x"term" ] &amp;&amp; [ "$0" =
"-bash"]
then&lt;\n&gt;
  ilabel () { echo -n "^[]1;$*^G"; }
  label () { echo -n ^"[]2;$*^G"; }
  alias stripe='label $HOSTNAME - ${PWD#$HOME/}'
  alias stripe2='label $HOSTNAME - vi $*'
  cds () { "cd" $*; eval stripe; }
  vis () { eval stripe2; "vi" $*; eval stripe;}
  alias cd=cds
  alias vi=vis
  eval stripe
  eval ilabel "$HOSTNAME"
fi
</pre><p>This does three things (as long as you're in an xterm and
   running bash):</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>When the xterm is first opened, the name of the
current host is displayed in the title bar.</p></li><li><p>When you change directories (using cd), the current
path is displayed in the xterm title bar with the user's $HOME
directory stripped off the front end of the path (to save some
space when you're somewhere in your own directory tree). The path
is preceded by the current host's network name.</p></li><li><p>When you use vi to edit a file, the name of the
file is displayed in the title bar along with the current host's
name. When you exit your vi session, the title bar reverts to the
hostname/path format described in #2 above.</p></li></ol></div><p>I find this very useful for all my ksh-based systems, because it
removed the path from my shell prompt, thus saving me space for
prompt commands. Since bash is a ksh compatible shell, this works
quite well on standard Linux systems.  &mdash;Michael J.

thought you might like a quicker method. I don't know about other
distributions, but Slackware and Red Hat come with the GNU versions
of <b  >locate(1)</b> and <b  >updatedb(1)</b>,
which use an index to find the files you want. The
<b  >updatedb(1)</b> program should be run once a night
from the crontab facility. To ignore certain sub-directories (like
your /cdrom), use the following syntax for the crontab file:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
41 5 * * * updatedb --prunepaths="/tmp /var \
        /proc /cdrom" &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1
</pre><p>This command would run every morning at 5:41 AM, and update
the database with file names from everywhere except the
subdirectories (and those below) listed.
</p><p>To locate a file, just type <b  >locate <i><tt>file
name</tt></i></b>. The file name doesn't have to be
complete; <b  >locate</b> can also do partial matching.
For me, the search typically takes only a few seconds, and I have
tens of thousands of files.</p><p>The <b  >locate(1)</b> command also has regular
expression matching, but I often just pipe it through
<b  >agrep(1)</b> (a faster <b  >grep</b>) to
narrow the search. Thus:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
locate locate | agrep -v man
</pre><p>would exclude the man page, and only show me the binary and
the sources, if I had them on-line. (The <b  >-v</b> flag
excludes the pattern used as an argument.) To get the binary files
alone, along with a complete directory listing, use the following
command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ls -l `locate locate | agrep bin`
</pre><p>The <b  >find(1)</b> command is a great &ldquo;swiss-army
knife&rdquo; (and actually not that bad once you get used to it), but
for the 90% of the cases where you just want to search by file
name, the <b  >locate(1)</b> command is far faster, and
much easier to use.  &mdash;Bill Duncan, VE3IEDbduncan@ve3ied.uucp</p></div></div>
