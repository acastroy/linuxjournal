nevertheless true that occasionally we must force ourselves to deal
with the DOS/MS-Windows world, however indirectly. For some of us
that involves having a dual-boot system (perhaps via LILO&mdash;the
LInux LOader&mdash;or OS/2's Boot Manager), but even those of us who
manage to avoid that fate will sooner or later come across files
that originated on some flavor of DOS or Windows system. More than
likely, a few of those files will end in
<b  >.zip</b>&mdash;and that's where the
<span   class="bold"><b>unzip</b></span> command comes in.
</p><p>unzip is a free utility to process
<span   class="emphasis"><em>zipfiles</em></span>, as these things are generally
called. Zipfiles are actually archives of one or more other files,
almost always compressed to save disk space and/or transmission
time. In this regard they are similar to compressed
<span   class="bold"><b>tar</b></span> archives, which are those
files usually ending in <b  >.tar.Z</b>,
<b  >.tar.gz</b> or <b  >.tgz</b> that one
finds on most Linux ftp sites and many CD-ROM distributions. One
major difference between zip files and tar archives: compressed tar
archives bundle all of the files together and then compress the
result as a single entity; zipfiles compress individual files, then
store them in the archive. This zip file method isn't quite as
efficient in achieving the maximal overall compression, but it does
allow you to list the archive's contents and to extract individual
files without decompressing the whole mess.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x258e580.0x2686978"></a>Listing</h2></div></div><p>How does one actually use unzip to list an archive's
contents? The simplest way is with the <b  >-l</b> option
(for &ldquo;list&rdquo;):</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ unzip -l quake92p.zip

 ------                    -------
 408200                    5 files
</pre><p>You have each file's name (on the right), its uncompressed
size, and the date and time of its last modification. For many of
us, however, especially those long steeped in the terse intricacies
of <span   class="bold"><b>ls</b></span>, this is a little
<span   class="emphasis"><em>too</em></span> short and sweet. For fans of ls, or for
anyone wishing to know more about the details of the archive, unzip
has an entire mode devoted to listing both useful and obscure
zipfile information: zipinfo mode, triggered via the
<b  >-Z</b> option. (On some systems the
<span   class="bold"><b>zipinfo</b></span> command exists as a link
to <span   class="bold"><b>unzip</b></span> and is synonymous with
<b  >unzip -Z</b>, but this is not true of Slackware
distributions as of this writing.) We'll limit ourselves to a
description of the default zipinfo listing format:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ unzip -Z quake92p.zip
Archive:  quake92p.zip   406075 bytes   5 files
-rwxa--     2.0 fat   36064 b- defN 25-Jun-96 13:18 DEICE.EXE

5 files, 408200 bytes uncompressed, 405569 bytes compressed:  0.6%
</pre><p>You will immediately recognize a certain resemblance to the output
of <b  >ls -l</b>. The header line gives the archive
name, its total size, and the total number of files in it; the
trailer gives the number of files listed (in this case all of
them), the total uncompressed and compressed data size of the
listed files (not counting internal zipfile headers), and the
compression ratio. Here the ratio is quite poor, mostly due to the
fact that the largest file (QUAKE92P.1) is stored without any
compression. In the leftmost column are the file permissions. The
next column indicates the version of the archiver, and the one
after that is what tells us the files came from the FAT (DOS) file
system. Next are the uncompressed file size and a column indicating
which files are most likely to be
<span   class="bold"><b>b</b></span>inary and which are probably
<span   class="bold"><b>t</b></span>ext. The next three columns note
the compression method used on each file; the time stamps; and the
full file names.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x258e580.0x2686f50"></a>Extracting</h2></div></div><p>Now that we know what files we have, how do we actually get
the files out? File extraction is as simple as typing
<b  >unzip</b> and the file name:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$unzip quake92p
Archive:  quake92p.zip
  inflating: DEICE.EXE
  extracting: QUAKE92P.1
  inflating: README.TXT
  inflating: INSTALL.BAT
  inflating: QUAKE92P.DAT
</pre><p>Here we've omitted the <b  >.zip</b> suffix; unzip
first looks for the file <b  >quake92p</b> and, not
finding it, checks for <b  >quake92p.zip</b> instead.
What if we wanted only the README.TXT file? No problem. Anything
(well, almost anything) after the zipfile name is taken to be the
name of one of the enclosed files:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$unzip quake92p README.TXT
Archive:  quake92p.zip
 inflating: README.TXT
</pre><p>Here you may notice a little snag. If you now edit this file
in Linux with an editor like <span   class="bold"><b>vi</b></span>,
you'll see what looks like <b  >^M</b> at the end of each
and every line. Or, if you view the file with a pager like
<span   class="bold"><b>more</b></span>, you'll discover that any
line uncovered by the <tt  >--More--</tt> prompt gets
erased immediately. These problems are due to the fact that DOS and
its successors store text files with <span   class="emphasis"><em>two</em></span>
end-of-line characters, CR and LF (a.k.a. carriage return and
linefeed, respectively, or ^M and ^J, or CTRL-M and CTRL-J), rather
than the more efficient single character (LF) used on all Unix
systems. So when a Unix utility&mdash;like an editor or a pager or a
compiler&mdash;looks at a DOS text file, it may behave a little oddly or
die altogether.</p><p>Fortunately there's a simple solution: unzip's
<b  >-a</b> option. Originally a mnemonic for
<span   class="emphasis"><em>ASCII conversion</em></span>, the option these days is
used for all sorts of text-file conversions. As a single-letter
option it does its best to automatically convert files that are
supposedly text, while leaving alone those that are marked binary.
<span   class="bold"><b>Be careful!</b></span> zip and PKZIP don't
always guess correctly when creating the archive, particularly for
certain classes of MS-Windows files, and unzip's &ldquo;text&rdquo;
conversions are <span   class="emphasis"><em>almost always irreversible</em></span>. In
other words, don't extract with auto-conversion and then delete the
original zipfile without first making sure everything is Okay.
unzip does indicate which files it thinks are text when
auto-converting, however:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ unzip -a quake92p
Archive:    quake92p.zip
inflating:  DEICE.EXE               [binary]
extracting: QUAKE92P.1              [binary]
inflating:  README.TXT              [text]
inflating:  INSTALL.BAT             [text]
inflating:  QUAKE92P.DAT            [text]
</pre><p>In this case everything worked as intended. If, for some
reason, zip marked a text file as binary and you want to force text
conversion, simply double the option: <b  >-aa</b>.
</p><p>But wait, there's more! The discriminating Linux user,
happily accustomed to a file system that not only preserves the
case of file names but also distinguishes between names differing
only in case, is not going to settle for a bunch of all uppercase
DOS file names in his or her directories. Enter the
<b  >-L</b> option. If (and only if) the file came from a
single case file system like DOS FAT or VMS, <b  >unzip
-L</b> will convert it to lowercase upon extraction,
thusly:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ unzip -aL quake92p
Archive:  quake92p.zip
  inflating: deice.exe               [binary]
  extracting: quake92p.1             [binary]
  inflating: readme.txt              [text]
  inflating: install.bat             [text]
  inflating: quake92p.dat            [text]
</pre><p>Isn't that nice?
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x258e580.0x2687948"></a>Testing</h2></div></div><p>So now you've just downloaded a whole bunch of zipfiles but
don't want to unpack them just to make sure they're Okay. What's
the solution? Use the <b  >-t</b> option to test
them:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ unzip -t quake92p
Archive:  quake92p.zip
    testing: DEICE.EXE                OK
    testing: QUAKE92P.1               OK
    testing: README.TXT               OK
    testing: INSTALL.BAT              OK
    testing: QUAKE92P.DAT             OK
No errors detected in compressed data of quake92p.zip.
</pre><p>Here we tested only one, and the output is a little too
verbose&mdash;we really want only the one-line summary for each archive.
unzip supports both a <b  >-q</b> option for various
levels of quietness (the more q's, the quieter) and the concept of
wildcards, both for the internal files and for the zipfiles
themselves:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ unzip -tq \*.zip
No errors detected in compressed data of arena2b-grr.zip.
No errors detected in compressed data of PngSuite.zip.
No errors detected in compressed data of libgr2-elf-install.zip.
No errors detected in compressed data of ppmz-7.3.zip.
arithc.c                bad CRC e220fe9c  (should be 1c24998c)
At least one error was detected in macm.zip.
No errors detected in compressed data of xfer-zip151.zip.
No errors detected in compressed data of quake091.zip.
No errors detected in compressed data of quake92p.zip.
No errors detected in compressed data of p93b2200.zip.
</pre><pre     class="programlisting">
8 archives were successfully processed.
1 archive had fatal errors.
</pre><p>Note that the wildcard character (&ldquo;*&rdquo;) is escaped with a
backslash (&ldquo;\&rdquo;). Most shells expand wildcards themselves, and if
we allowed that, unzip would see the command line as a list of
archives; it would treat the first one as the zipfile name and the
rest as files to be tested within the first one. By escaping the
wildcard, we allow unzip to do its own directory search and
wildcard-matching&mdash;which, incidentally, has the advantage that
Unix-style <span   class="emphasis"><em>regular expressions</em></span> (very powerful
wildcards) can be used not only under Linux but under all of the
operating systems for which unzip ports exist, even plain old DOS.</p><p>The other thing to notice is that one of the archives has an
error in it. Perhaps there was a transmission error, or maybe the
original was damaged when it was created; either way, the file
<b  >arithc.c</b> in <b  >macm.zip</b> is
probably not going to be usable. It's always good to know these
sorts of things sooner rather than later.</p><p>There are quite a few other options and modifiers not covered
here; a full tutorial would occupy most of this magazine.
Fortunately, the unzip and zipinfo man pages (<b  >man
unzip</b> and <b  >man zipinfo</b>) contain a
complete listing of all of the options and examples for many of
them. Unfortunately, Slackware 3.0 and earlier don't include the
zipinfo man page. An abbreviated summary of zipinfo's options is
available by typing <b  >unzip -Z</b> . Similarly, a
summary of most of unzip's options can be had simply by typing
<b  >unzip</b> with no parameters.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x258e580.0x267e860"></a>History, Acknowledgments, Pointers and the
Future</h2></div></div><p>unzip, zipinfo, zip and their kin were written by the
Info-ZIP group, an Internet-based collection of strange beings from
another universe who are currently scattered all over the planet.
Yours truly (that would be me) is the principal author of unzip and
zipinfo, but literally hundreds of people have contributed to them.
Originally based on code by Samuel H. Smith, unzip has since been
completely rewritten, with the exception of one routine which is no
longer included by default. Nevertheless, we certainly owe him a
debt of gratitude for getting us into this pickle. It would
probably also be nice to mention the folks at PKWARE, whose PKZIP
and PKUNZIP programs are the source of most of the DOS-originated
zipfiles in the world. Note that Info-ZIP's programs are intended
to be compatible with PKWARE's zipfiles, but they are not clones of
PKWARE's programs. (For example, unzip recreates stored zipfile
directory trees by default, whereas PKUNZIP requires a special
option to do it.</p><p>Note also that while zip and
<span   class="bold"><b>gzip</b></span> (sometimes called &ldquo;GNU
zip&rdquo;) have similar names, a similar heritage&mdash;Jean-loup Gailly and
Mark Adler are the co-authors of the latter and are also
long-standing members of the Info-ZIP group&mdash;and the same
compression engine, the two programs are basically incompatible.
The same goes for unzip and
<span   class="bold"><b>gunzip</b></span>. Jean-loup never foresaw
the confusion that would arise from the similarity, and I was too
late in suggesting the obvious, sick alternative
(<span   class="bold"><b>feather</b></span>*) to get the name
changed.</p><p>On a more serious note, the current version of unzip is 5.2,
and 5.21 will be out by the time you read this. While everything
discussed above works equally well with the previous version
(5.12), there are various new features and other improvements that
make 5.2 worth getting. You can find the latest public releases of
source code and executables at UUNET's anonymous ftp site:</p><p>ftp://ftp.uu.net/pub/archiving/zip/
