    After a short introduction to programmable logic controllers
    (PLCs), see how Linux and the Web can enhance monitoring and control
    of mechanical systems using test machines designed by the
    DuPont-Northwestern-Dow Collaborative Access Team.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a6c580.0x2b643f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>When solving control system problems for
the &ldquo;real world&rdquo;, a toolkit approach to problem-solving often
leads to quicker and more robust solutions. This is one of the
reasons we are using Linux on commercial Intel-based machines at
the DuPont-Northwestern-Dow Collaborative Access Team (DND-CAT) at
the Advanced Photon Source (APS). The APS (see
http://www.aps.anl.gov/) is one of three third generation
synchrotron X-ray sources that will provide the world's most
brilliant source of X-rays for scientific research. The DND-CAT
(see http://tomato.dnd.aps.anl.gov/DND/) is a collaboration formed
by the DuPont Company, Northwestern University, and the Dow
Chemical Company to build and operate scientific equipment at the
APS to study industrial and academically interesting problems in
chemistry, biology, materials science and physics. Linux (like all
Unix systems) is designed around the toolkit paradigm. The tools
which run under Linux provide an excellent framework for building
user interfaces (e.g., Netscape, Java, Tcl/Tk, expect, World Wide
Web daemons), running calculations (e.g., C, C++, FORTRAN, Perl,
pvm) and interacting with external devices (GREAT access to serial
devices, cards in the backplane, and of course, TCP/IP).
</p><p>However, while there are efforts to equip Linux with
real-time capabilities, it is not a &ldquo;real-time&rdquo; operating system.
In addition, using commercial personal computers for control
applications is a mixed blessing at best. While the systems are
powerful, readily available and inexpensive, they also come with a
limited number of slots on the backplane and the machine usually
must be physically close to the process being controlled or
monitored. This can be problematic in situations where the process
takes place in a harsh environment that might cause the hardware to
fail (e.g., high radiation areas, high vibration, etc.). These are
important factors in the design of an entire control system.
However, they are only problems if we expect Linux to provide the
entire solution to the control problem rather than one tool in a
toolkit approach.</p><p>At the DND-CAT, we have been designing systems that use
programmable logic controllers in conjunction with Linux PCs to
provide low cost automation and control systems for scientific
experimental equipment.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a6c580.0x2b645b0"></a>Programmable Logic Controllers</h2></div></div><p>Programmable logic controllers (PLCs) are the unsung heros of
the modern industrial revolution. Long before IBM and Apple were
churning out computers for the masses, factories were being
automated with computerized controllers designed to interface with
the &ldquo;real world&rdquo; (i.e., relays, motors, temperatures, DC and AC
signals, etc.). These controllers are manufactured by many
companies like Modicon, Allen-Bradley, Square D and others. In his
booklet, <span   class="emphasis"><em>History of the PLC</em></span>, Dick Morley, the
original inventor of the PLC, notes that the first PLC was
developed at a consulting company, Bedford Associates, back in
1968. At this time, Bedford Associates was designing
computer-controlled machine tools as well as peripherals for the
computer industry. The PLC was originally designed to eliminate a
problem in control. Before the digital computer, logic functions
were implemented in relay racks where a single relay would
correspond to a bit. However, relays tend to be unreliable in the
long term and the &ldquo;software&rdquo; was hard programmed via
wiring.</p><p>System reliability could be improved by replacing the relays
with solid state devices. This had the advantage that the system
was maintainable by electricians, technicians and control
engineers. However, the &ldquo;software&rdquo; was still in the hard wiring
of the system and difficult to change. The alternative at this time
was using one of the minicomputers being developed, like the PDP-8
from Digital Equipment. While more complex control functions could
be implemented, this also increased the system complexity and made
it difficult to maintain for people on the factory floor.</p><p>Morley designed the first PLC to replace relay racks with a
specialized real-time controller that would survive industrial
environments. This meant that it had to survive tests, such as
being dropped, zapped with a tesla coil and banged with a rubber
mallet. Designed for continuous operation, it had no on/off switch.
The real-time capabilities were&mdash;and for the most part still
are&mdash;programmed into the unit using ladder logic.</p><p>Ladder logic is a rule-based language; an example is given in
Figure 1. The line on the left side of the diagram shows a &ldquo;power
rail&rdquo; with the &ldquo;ground&rdquo; for this rail on the right hand side
(not shown). The rules for the language are coded by completing
&ldquo;circuits&rdquo; in ladder rungs from left to right. In the diagrams,
&ldquo;||&rdquo; corresponds to switch contacts, and &ldquo;()&rdquo; corresponds to
relay coils. Slanted bars through the contacts and coils denote the
complement. The &ldquo;X&rdquo; switch contacts are mapped to real binary
input points, the &ldquo;Y&rdquo; relay coil contacts are mapped to output
points, and the &ldquo;C&rdquo; contacts/coils are software points used for
intermediate operations. In the example, closing X0 and C0 or
opening X0 and C0 will energize the C10 coil thereby closing the
C10 contact. The C10 contact activates Y0 and turns off Y1.</p><p>While this graphical style of programming may be strange for
someone accustomed to programming in C or FORTRAN, ladder logic
makes it easy for non-programmers to write useful applications.
Most PLCs have a large set of functions, including timers,
counters, math operations, bit shifters, etc. They have a wide
variety of input and output devices, including binary and analog
inputs and outputs, motor and temperature controllers, relay
outputs, magnetic tachometer pickups, etc. The number of input and
output points depends on the type and size of the PLC, but can
range from less than 10 for a micro-PLC to over a thousand for one
of the higher-end PLCs. The PLC market has grown over the years and
has been affected by the computer revolution. Today, there are a
number of high quality, inexpensive PLCs on the market. PLCs from
the same vendor can often be networked together. In some cases, a
lower-end PLC can be built for less than $500.00.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a6c580.0x2b64870"></a>PLCs and Linux</h2></div></div><p>In our applications, we have used Linux computers as
interfaces between the PLC and the outside world. Our main purpose
for this was to use tools like Tcl/Tk and the World Wide Web (WWW)
through the Common Gateway Interface (CGI) to control processes in
the PLC. The software used to program our PLCs is Microsoft
Windows-based. Consequently, by having Linux and Windows partitions
on the same hard disk, we can toggle back and forth between MS
Windows, where we program the PLCs, and Linux, where we program and
use the operator interface.</p><p>The real-time operating system inside PLCs is relatively
simple compared to a complex system such as Linux. Consequently,
those portions of the control process which require extremely high
reliability can be programmed into the PLC, leaving Linux available
for other tasks.</p><p>We are using the PLC Direct line of PLCs (see
http://www.plcdirect.com/) for our applications. In order to prove
the reliability of the Linux and PLC Direct combination, we
collaborated with the UNICAT (A University-National Lab-Industry
Collaborative Access Team; see http://www.uni.aps.anl.gov/) to set
up a test system using a Linux-based web server connected to a PLC
Direct 405 PLC. Communication with the PLC is through a multidrop,
packet-based, master/slave protocol that runs over a serial link.
Using the PLC Direct documentation, we implemented this protocol
using Don Libes' expect program over the Linux serial ports, making
the Linux system the master. This gave us the capability to
&ldquo;peek&rdquo; and &ldquo;poke&rdquo; into the PLC memory map. CGI scripts call the
expect program to provide access to the Web.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="1339f2.jpg"></div><p>Photo of the DND-CAT/UNI-CAT Linux/PLC Test Stand</p><p>Net surfers were allowed to close output points and read
input points on the PLC through the WWW interface between March
1995 and July 1996. A photo of that test stand is shown in Figure
2. The PLC monitored digital inputs from the 5 Love controllers,
which measured the temperature in the PLC CPU and closed a contact
if the temperature went above a preset value.</p><p>In addition to the demonstration, we have used the Linux/PLC
combination in three project areas: a simple shutter for a
synchrotron X-ray beamline, a personnel safety system for an
analytical X-ray machine, and an equipment protection system using
a high intensity X-ray beamline at the Advanced Photon
Source.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="1339f1.jpg"></div><p>Simple Ladder Logic Diagram</p><p>Our simplest application with the PLC and Linux involved
interfacing a commercial X-ray beam shutter to our Linux data
collection computer. The hardware for the X-ray shutter is
controlled by two relay-actuated solenoids. When we program the
PLC, we allocate two ranges of control relays to act as an
interface between the PLC and Linux. The program in Figure 1
demonstrates this. The Linux program that would set C0. X0 is
attached to a hardware switch and provides an external input to the
system. The X0 and C0 combination simulate a three way switch, and
Y0 and Y1 actually operate the relays on the shutter. A program on
the Linux side can read C10 to monitor the shutter status. With the
interface between the PLC and Linux defined through control relays,
the actual control process is divided up between the two different
machines.</p><p>Our second project used the PLC as a state machine to monitor
a radiation enclosure for an X-ray generator and X-ray tube. Since
this was a safety device, we enabled the PLC's password function to
lock the program into the PLC CPU. If for some reason we forget the
password, the CPU must be sent back to the manufacturer for reset.
The PLC monitors twelve door contact switches, switches from an
operator panel, X-ray shutter positions, water flow interlocks for
the X-ray tube, as well as providing a buzzer and a fail safe lamp
to notify the operator the X-rays and shutter are on. The PLC also
provides enable signals for the X-ray generator and the X-ray
shutter.</p><p>While the main purpose of the PLC is to protect the operator,
the PLC doesn't have a very good way of notifying the operator of
what has failed should the X-ray interlock trip. This is where
Linux comes in. Using CGI scripts, we wrote web pages that allow
the operator to query the PLC state using a browser. To prevent
unauthorized access to the equipment (only trained people can use
this equipment), we provided a watchdog signal between Linux and
the PLC. An authorized user logs into the Linux system and runs a
protected daemon which starts the watchdog timer in the PLC. The
Linux daemon must continuously restart the watchdog to keep the
X-ray system enabled, and the daemon disables the system when the
user logs out. Linux keeps track of all of the accesses to the
system and sends e-mail to the X-ray generator custodian whenever
an access occurs. Thus, the Linux system acts as the data
collection computer for the instruments attached to the X-ray
generator.</p><p>Our last project is an equipment protection system for an
X-ray synchrotron beamline at the Advanced Photon Source. In this
case, the PLC is monitoring over 70 input points from water flow
meters, vacuum system outputs, and switches from vacuum valves.
Based on the status of these systems, the PLC sends an enable or
disable signal to the APS which permits them to deliver the high
intensity X-ray beam to our equipment. Serious equipment damage can
occur if the APS delivers beam when the systems are not ready. In
this case, we use Linux as a data logger as well as an operator
interface. Every few minutes, Linux polls the PLC to log system
status.</p><p>The PLC itself keeps a log of significant events in
nonvolatile memory in the event of power failures. In order to keep
the PLC in sync with the Linux logs, we use the Network Time Daemon
on the Linux end and once a day reset the real-time clock in the
PLC. In addition to the PLC, Linux processes are monitoring other
devices, like vacuum gauges, through a multiport serial card. If a
system failure occurs, our scientists and engineers can either log
into the Linux system and run expect scripts to diagnose the
problem or use a browser and interact with the Linux/PLC combo via
the Web. At this point, the operator has complete control over
enabling and disabling processes in the PLC.</p><p>In this application, the interface with the World Wide Web is
extremely important. Scientists travel to synchrotron sources from
all over the world to conduct experiments. When the facility is
operational, it runs twenty four hours a day. If our PLC were to
shut the equipment down, it is important to be able to diagnose the
fault, and if possible, return the equipment to operational status
as quickly as possible. By using the World Wide Web, we provide our
scientists and engineers with diagnostic tools they can use from
anywhere using commonly available interface software. I personally
have been able to monitor system status in our PLCs at my desk at
work, my apartment in Chicago and a cyber-cafe in London.</p><p>In general, we have found combining programmable logic
controllers with Linux to be a cost effective and robust method for
providing specialized control systems at the
DuPont-Northwestern-Dow Collaborative Access Team. As we build our
instrumentation, we continue to find new applications for this
combination. We have several more projects in the works, including
using the PLCs to construct intelligent controllers for specialized
machines and using Linux to interface with them. We also plan to
implement the PLC Direct slave protocol under Linux to allow the
PLC to send data directly to Linux daemons, so the PLC does not
need to be polled.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a6c580.0x2b65000"></a>Acknowledgements and Notices</h2></div></div><p>I would like to thank Pete Jemian of the UNI-CAT for
