    This is a quick look at making Linux bootable from EPROM on
    a 486 single board computer.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x263c580.0x2734348"></a></h2></div></div><p>This article describes one way to run
Linux in an embedded system with no hard disk. The application
described is an Operator Interface in a monitor and display system
developed by Boeing Flight Test. The airborne environment requires
something fairly rugged which can withstand common power
interruptions. To meet these requirements we decided to build the
operator interface without a hard disk.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x263c580.0x2734450"></a>Overview</h2></div></div><p>The basic concept includes booting from a solid state disk
(SSD) in <span   class="bold"><b>E</b></span>rasable
<span   class="bold"><b>P</b></span>rogrammable
<span   class="bold"><b>R</b></span>ead-<span   class="bold"><b>O</b></span>nly
<span   class="bold"><b>M</b></span>emory (EPROM), copying a root
file system from EPROM to a RAM disk, loading the operator
interface software from a host and executing it. This article
focuses on the details of how the system works, and on development
techniques used.</p><p>The hardware selected is a VME-based Single Board Computer
(SBC) 80486 with 16M of RAM, a PC104 SSD cable of holding a 4Meg
EPROM, and some other PC104 boards. This SBC has built in BIOS
support for using the SSD. The system uses a programmable keyboard
and a standard VGA display.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x263c580.0x2734768"></a>System Operation</h2></div></div><p>For booting, two options were considered:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>booting DOS, then running the loadlin program (to
load Linux) from autoexec.bat</p></li><li><p>installing LILO and booting Linux directly</p></li></ul></div><p>The advantage of the second option would be a slightly
shorter boot time. However, we implemented the first option,
because we wanted to use a programmable keyboard&mdash;the software for
programming the keyboard runs under DOS.
</p><p>A bit of kernel-hacking was needed to make the system work.
The ramdisk.c code was changed to load from any block device, not
just a floppy (see <a href="0243l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a>,
ramdisk.c). Also, a new block driver was written to read from the
EPROM device (see <a href="0243l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2</a>,
epromdsk.c).</p><p>When deciding how to implement the EPROM device driver, the
first idea was to create an image of a disk in the EPROM. This
would provide a RAM disk of the same size as the EPROM, 3.5MB in
this case (the DOS portion of the SSD takes 1/2 MB). Instead, to
allow a larger RAM disk, a compressed disk image is used. The
compression used is simple&mdash;any sectors which are identical are
only stored once. The primary advantage this gives is blank areas
of the disk image don't need to take up EPROM space. Listing 1
shows the SSD disk compression used.</p><p><a href="0243f1.jpg" target="_self">EPROM Disk Compression</a></p><p>In order to automatically run the operator interface
application, a program was written to replace getty. This program
(dboot.c) will run login for a given user, and set the stdin,
stdout and stderr to the specified virtual console.</p><p>The boot sequence is:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Power up and run memory tests</p></li><li><p>load DOS which executes AUTOEXEC.BAT</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="circle"><li><p>run the keyboard programming application</p></li><li><p>run loadlin&mdash;this reads a linux kernel from the DOS
   disk &amp; executes it</p></li></ul></div></li><li><p>the linux kernel takes over</p></li><li><p>load the RAM disk from the EPROM disk</p></li><li><p>switch the root file system to the RAM disk</p></li><li><p>init will read inittab which executes dboot instead
of getty</p></li><li><p>the operator interface application is
started</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x263c580.0x2735420"></a>Development</h2></div></div><p>After the fun part&mdash;figuring how to make an EPROM driver and
how to boot the system&mdash;the more mundane task of putting together
the EPROM disk contents had to be done. This was done using a
development disk which was partitioned as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>/dev/hda1 - 80MB &ldquo;full&rdquo; Linux system</p></li><li><p>/dev/hda2 - 6MB EPROM development</p></li><li><p>/dev/hda3 - 20MB DOS partition</p></li><li><p>LILO was used to allow booting of either Linux or
DOS.</p></li></ul></div><p>Programming EPROMs is a time-consuming task and to be avoided
as much as possible. As a result, most of the development is done
using the disk.</p><p>The first phase of disk image development was identifying the
required and the desired items. The first step was to come up with
a minimal system and then add the items required for the operator
interface. Not being a Unix expert, coming up with the minimal
system ended up being something of a trial and error process. I
started with what I thought was needed, then tried running it. When
an error occurred because of a missing program or library, that
file was added. This process went on until the system ran
happily.</p><p>The bulk of this was done by copying files from the &ldquo;full&rdquo;
Linux partition to the 6MB partition, booting DOS and using the
loadlin line:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
loadlin zimage root=/dev/hda2 ro
</pre><p>Once the system was fairly stable, the 6MB partition was
loaded into the RAM disk. This is very similar to how the RAM disk
is loaded from EPROM, but development went faster since EPROMs
weren't being programmed. To test the system without programming
EPROMs, the system booted DOS and ran loadlin with the line:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
loadlin zimage root=/dev/hda2 ramdisk=6144 ro
</pre><p>Because of the modification to ramdisk.c, the /dev/hda2 disk image
is loaded into the RAM disk, then the root file system is switched
to the RAM disk. The process of refining the disk image continues
until everything is &ldquo;perfect&rdquo;.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x263c580.0x2735aa8"></a>Programming EPROMs</h2></div></div><p>The process of programming (&ldquo;burning&rdquo;) the EPROMs starts
out by archiving the small disk drive with <b  >tar</b>,
then extracting the files onto a clean (zeroed out) file system. By
putting the file system onto a clean disk, all unused sectors are
zeroed out, and the disk compression works (Listing 1).</p><p>To tar the disk image, the &ldquo;full &rdquo;Linux partition was
booted, and the 6MB partition mounted. By doing this, the proc file
system is not included in the tar. The following commands can be
used:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
mount -t ext2 /dev/hda2 /mnt
cd /mnt
tar -cpf /tmp/eprom.tar *
</pre><p>To create the (uncompressed) disk image, I used a different
   machine with a 6MB RAM disk and the following commands:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/ram count=12288
mke2fs /dev/ram 6144
mount -t ext2 /dev/ram /mnt
cd /mnt
tar -xpf ~/eprom.tar .
dd if=/dev/ram of=~/eprom.dsk count=12288
</pre><p>This creates a file (eprom.dsk) which is a sector-by-sector image
of the disk. The data to be programmed into the EPROMs is the
compressed image. This is done with a program (med.c) which reads
the disk image (eprom.dsk), runs the disk compression, and outputs
a binary file (eprom.img) which will be programmed into the EPROMs.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
med ~/eprom.dsk ~/eprom.img
</pre><p>The EPROM image is then moved to an EPROM programmer and the images
are burned.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x263c580.0x272c700"></a>DOS boot SSD</h2></div></div><p>Fortunately the SBC came with SSD utilities to help build the
disk image. The DOS SSD disk has a bare minimum of files in it: the
DOS boot files, command.com, autoexec.bat, the keyboard loading
program, loadlin and zImage.</p><p><a href="0243l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3</a></p><p><a href="0243l4.html" target="_self">Listing 4</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x263c580.0x272c968"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>The development of what goes on the disk is a large part of
the job, and methods need to be developed to minimize this effort.
Using the EPROM disk is working well in our application.</p></div></div>
