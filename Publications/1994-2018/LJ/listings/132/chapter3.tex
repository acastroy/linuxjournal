\section{Let's Get Started!}

There is no substitute for practical experience when first learning how to program.  So, here is the first Perl program\index{welcome@\texttt{welcome}, the first program}, called \texttt{welcome}:

\pjbstartcode
\begin{verbatim}
    print "Welcome to the Wonderful World of Perl!\n";
\end{verbatim}
\pjbstopcode

\noindent When executed by \texttt{perl}\footnote{We will learn how to do this is in just a moment.}, this small program displays the following, perhaps rather not unexpected, message on screen:

\pjbstartcode
\begin{verbatim}
    Welcome to the Wonderful World of Perl!
\end{verbatim}
\pjbstopcode
