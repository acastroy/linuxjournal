First, read the README.install file.  Then, read the README.bin.dir file.
After this, you should have everything downloaded, installed, and set up.
Then, you can build the example (following README.install).  After that,
follow the instructions in README.run in order to run the example
application.  Make sure you read the README.bin.dir file, which contains
information on running the applications, once built.  In particular,
it stresses that you need a working KORN shell to run the applications,
and the VisiBroker scripts will not work as-is if you simply try to
run them under the Bash shell, which is the Linux default shell.
