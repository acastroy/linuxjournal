# Step #1: Set the network variables:

var HOME_NET 192.168.1.0/24

var HTTP_SERVERS $HOME_NET
var SQL_SERVERS $HOME_NET
var DNS_SERVERS 192.168.1.250/32
var RULE_PATH ./

# Step #2: Configure preprocessors

preprocessor stream4_reassemble
preprocessor portscan: $HOME_NET 4 3 portscan.log

# Step #3: Configure output plugins

# Step #4: Customize your rule set

#   Here's a rule:

Remote Access"; flags:SA; reference:arachnids,129;
reference:cve,CVE-1999-0430; classtype:bad-unknown; sid:513; rev:1;)

#   And here are the paths to text files containing additional rules:

include $RULE_PATH/bad-traffic.rules
include $RULE_PATH/exploit.rules
include $RULE_PATH/scan.rules
include $RULE_PATH/finger.rules
include $RULE_PATH/ftp.rules
