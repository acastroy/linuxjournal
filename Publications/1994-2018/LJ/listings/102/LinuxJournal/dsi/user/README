The directory contains :

1) client - 	a client program to demonstrate (together with server)
		the possibility of controlling processes by DSM module.
2) server -     a server program to demonstrate (together with client)
                the possibility of controlling processes by DSM module.
3) tools  -	various tools to control the DSM module (load policy,
		check alarms, set the node ID).
4) test   -	test programs to measure the performance of the system

Using DSM module to control the local and remote access
-------------------------------------------------------
1) su
2) Load module : /sbin/insmod lsm.o
3) Establish a communication between client and server processes.
   If everything is OK, you should see the message : "Hallo Server" on
   the server's shell.
4) Go to tools directory and start the "CheckAlarm" process.
5) Go to tools directory and start manipulating the policy file.
   a) Local Access Control : On the client side 
     - change the policy for the socket class (class number 2), exp. 0x07 -> 0x04
     - load the new policy, exp. ./UpdatePolicy policy_test
     - the client process should stop sending
     - change the policy for the socket class (class number 2), exp. 0x04 -> 0x07
     - the client process should resume sending
   b) Remote Access Control : On the server side
     - change the policy for the network class (class number 3), exp. 0x01 -> 0x00
     - load the new policy, exp. ./UpdatePolicy policy_test
     - the server process should stop receiving 
     - change the policy for the network class (class number 3), exp. 0x00 -> 0x01
     - the server process should resume receiving


Measure the performance
-----------------------
There are 3 different programs to measure the performance.
Those test are descived in the OLS paper and the article.
	a) fork - measure the performance of the fork system call 
		exp. time fork
	b) dgram - measure the performance of the local access
		exp. time dgram
	c) dgramresp and servresp - measure the performance of 
	   the remote access (client - server).
		exp. time dgramresp
