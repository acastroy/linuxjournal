Listing 2: A simple standalone SOAP server.  This program waits to
receive SOAP requests on port 8080, and hands them to an appropriate
object.

#!/usr/bin/perl -w

use strict;
use diagnostics;            # Remove from 
                            # production code
use SOAP::Transport::HTTP;  # Get the object for
                            # standalone servers

my $SERVER_PORT = 8080;
my $SERVER_NAME = 'localhost';

# Create a SOAP server object
my $soap_server = SOAP::Transport::HTTP::Daemon
    -> new (LocalAddr => $SERVER_NAME, LocalPort => $SERVER_PORT)

    # What is the root directory for our objects?
    # (Remember, the default Perl @INC path will
    # be ignored.)

    # Do *not* use /tmp on a real server!
    -> dispatch_to('/tmp/');                         

# Indicate on which port we're expecting
# SOAP requests
print "SOAP server is waiting on port $SERVER_PORT...\n";

# Now handle the incoming SOAP method call,
# and return an appropriate
# SOAP response.
$soap_server->handle();
