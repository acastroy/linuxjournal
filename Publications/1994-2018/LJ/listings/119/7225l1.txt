Listing 1. A simple wrapper to keep the Visual Tcl code (in gui.tcl)
separate from the main script. The #! line weirdness is a
common way of starting a Tcl/Tk script.

#!/bin/sh
# the next line restarts using wish \
exec wish "$0" "$@"

#
# My own procedures and "pre-gui" code will go here
#

# Load and run the GUI code created by Visual Tcl
#
source gui.tcl

#
# Any "post-gui" code I need can go here
#
