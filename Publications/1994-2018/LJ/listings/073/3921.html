How to program using the Qt windowing system in X.
</i><p>
<i>
by David Watt
</i>
<p>
This article describes the implementation of rtp (real-time
plotter), a live x,y data plotting utility based on the Qt
windowing library. <B>rtp</B> combines live updates with zoom in, auto-scaling,
and auto-tracking modes. It is meant to be used where <B>gnuplot</B> is
limited, such as the termination of a live data pipeline. However, rtp is
small and does not attempt to cover gnuplot's large feature set for
producing publishable data plots.
<p>
The rtp source code is released under the GPL and is available at
<A HREF="ftp://metalab.unc.edu/pub/linux/science/visualization/rtp-1.0.0.tar.gz." TARGET="_blank">ftp://metalab.unc.edu/pub/linux/science/visualization/rtp-1.0.0.tar.gz.</A>
I developed and tested it under Red Hat 6.0, with Qt 1.44. A README file
is included in the package to help you build and use rtp. A screenshot of rtp
is shown in Figure 1.
<p>
<a href="3921f1.jpg"><h4>Figure 1. Rtp Screenshot</h4></a>
<p>
<B>rtp</B> provides real-time updates and basic mouse-driven
resolution selection. However, it lacks gnuplot's ability to send
formatted, titled plots to a printer. <B>rtp</B> is still a simple piece of
software (1200 lines of code) that needs many features added.
By describing its principles here, I hope to provide a useful, gentle
example of an application based on the Qt library and the X Window System.
I also hope to motivate some interested people to do more work on a
Linux-based real-time, interactive data visualization system. This could be
done either by extending rtp or as a completely new project.
<p>
<H3>Viewing Modes</H3>
<p>
Because all of rtp's data comes from STDIN (standard input),
interaction with the user through the X Window System is limited to setting
the viewing mode.
It allows the user to change the viewing mode even as new data points
are being processed. The viewing modes are as follows:
<p>
<ul>
  <li>	Auto scale: the scaling is adjusted when necessary to include all
received data points. This is the default mode and can be selected by pressing
a button on the toolbar.
  <li>	Auto tracking: maintains a fixed scaling, but varies the viewport
offset to track the latest points. This mode is selected by pressing a
button on the toolbar. The scaling will be fixed at what it was before
the toolbar button was pressed.
  <li>	User-defined fixed: maintains a fixed viewport (both scale and offset),
as defined by the user. This mode is selected when the user drags out
a viewport in the plot window with the mouse.
</ul>
<H3>Qt Library</H3>
<p>
I based rtp on the Qt library, because many others in the Linux community
are using it (e.g., KDE) and because of its high-quality documentation.
An HTML tree (guaranteed to be synchronized with the Qt source because it
is automatically generated from the source code and comments) describes
all of Qt's classes and functions. Dalheimer also wrote a book
on Qt programming that is a very helpful introduction (see Resources).
<p>
The Qt library provides a GUI programming environment that is quite
complete. When programming in the Qt environment, no reference to the
underlying XLib library is necessary. Qt's functionality extends
beyond the GUI domain to include container classes that implement several
standard data structures.
<p>
Each of Qt's functional components is packaged as a C++ class, giving C++
wizards much to ponder and tinker with and those of us who like to write
operational code a good tool set. For myself, having about a year of
experience writing production C code with only a college course in C++,
it was fairly easy to learn the Qt C++ framework.
<p>
The Qt library makes integration of independently developed classes
easier through its C++ extensions: ``signals'' and
``slots''. A signal is
a class member function that is undefined at compile time. A slot is a
member function that is specially designated for connection to a signal
at runtime. For example, a GUI button class could have a <B>Push</B> signal.
At runtime, a plot window's slot <B>Render</B> could be connected to the
button's <B>Push</B>. From then on, code that calls the
button's <B>Push</B>
method effectively calls the plot window's <B>Render</B> method.
<p>
Code based on the signals and slots mechanism is easier to read
and maintain than that dealing with runtime function-pointer tables.
(I'd bet the implementation uses a function
pointer or two.) Qt also takes care of annoyances such as stubbing
non-connected signals to an empty function, so you don't get a
segmentation fault from a null pointer.
<p>
The drawback of signals and slots is that they are non-standard C++
extensions using new syntax, so Qt code with signals and slots must be
passed through a preprocessor provided with the Qt library before it can
be compiled. Dalheimer's book explains signals and slots in sufficient
detail for you to start using them.
<p>
<H3>Architectural Requirements</H3>
<p>
In order to provide an acceptable user interface, rtp must quickly respond
to GUI events (i.e., mouse events, etc.) at all times. This requirement would
be easily met if all program activity were directed by GUI events.
For example, an interactive drawing program is entirely GUI-driven,
so its only responsibility is to execute relatively short sequences of
code in response to GUI events.
<p>
<B>rtp</B>'s architecture is complicated by two additional requirements,
beyond
the snappy GUI response. It must quickly update when new data points
are available on STDIN. This feature is what differentiates rtp from
other plot programs, such as gnuplot. It must also deal with the fact
that rendering the data set often takes more time than is acceptable
for a GUI delay. This precludes the use of a simple function call to
render the whole plot.
<p>
<H3>Multiplexing Tasks</H3>
<p>
Fundamentally, there are three ``tasks'' that rtp must multiplex, listed
below from highest to lowest priority:
<p>
<ol>
  <li>	Respond quickly to GUI events. These events come as data from the
X server on a socket.
  <li>	Read data points from STDIN as they become available.
  <li>	Render the data set into the plot window when it needs updating.
</ol>
The Qt library provides mechanisms that support this processing structure.
The first mechanism is the QSocketNotifier class. When we
create a QSocketNotifier object, we pass it the file descriptor of
interest. (The fancy name QSocketNotifier made me think the
class was all tied in with network sockets, when in reality it can work
with most any file descriptor.) In the case of rtp, this is the STDIN file
descriptor (<tt>STDIN_FILENO</tt>). We then connect
QSocketNotifier's
<tt>activated</tt> signal to a particular slot that deals with new data.
<p>
The second mechanism is the QTimer class. This class is
provided to support regularly scheduled background processing, as well
as single-shot timed events. The Qt documentation tells us that by
setting up a QTimer object with zero timeout, we can cause a
function to be called whenever there are no events to process. Again,
the mechanisms for connecting the QTimer to the actual function
that does the background processing are signals and slots.

<h4>Figure 2. rtp Control Flow and Data Processing</h4></center>
<p>
<H3>Components</H3>
<p>
Figure 2 illustrates rtp's control flow and data processing scheme.
The Qt event loop is the control center for the application. It calls
functions in the rtp application as events occur. Each arrow in
the diagram represents a call into a function or library. Note that
only the functions which have names starting with <B>PlotWindow</B> or
<B>RtpRender</B> are actual rtp code. The rtp functions consist of X
event callbacks (such as <B>PlotWindow::paintEvent</B> and friends),
the QSocketNotifier callback (<B>PlotWindow::slotStdinAwake</B>)
and the QTimer callback (<B>RtpRender::slotWorkAwhile</B>).
<p>
XLib is the lowest-level C library provided as an interface to an X server
across a byte-stream socket. It manages both the input side of the
socket, which provides events, and the output side which sends requests
to the server. (Note that Figure 2 shows only the input side.) XLib also
provides certain performance optimizations, such as filtering redundant
events and delaying requests in an internal queue in order to group
requests in large data blocks for efficient socket usage. For details,
see Adrian Nye's classic XLib book in Resources.
<p>
The POSIX <B>select</B> system call is commonly used by applications
that service more than one file descriptor (socket) in a single thread.
<B>select</B> is used by applications, such as rtp, that must respond
to data on any of several file descriptors and do not wish to waste
CPU time by polling. Additionally, Qt uses select's timeout
function to start QTimer-scheduled functions.
<p>
The select call in the Qt library is the only place (to my
knowledge) where the rtp process can block. For newcomers to systems
programming, I should explain what ``blocking'' means. A multitasking
operating system such as Linux must be able to multiplex the execution
of a large number of programs on a smaller number of processors. By trapping interrupts, Linux switches the
processor(s) among running programs in a certain order. This makes it
impossible for a single program to lock the system by entering an infinite loop.
<p>
Because Linux has pre-emptive multitasking, rtp could enter an infinite loop
waiting for either an X event or a data point on STDIN
without locking the system. However, the CPU time spent in this loop
would unnecessarily degrade the performance of the rest of the executing
programs. Therefore, most calls into the kernel for I/O will
``block'' the executing program until the I/O is complete. The program
will be removed from the set of programs run by the CPU. Once the
I/O is done, the program is marked as ``runnable'' and will re-enter
the kernel's run queue to be switched in and out of the CPU along
with other runnable programs.
<p>
<B>select</B> is Qt's way of saying, ``I have nothing to do
until an X event is available, an I/O event occurs on one of the
QSocketNotifier objects, or a timeout from one of the
<tt>QTimer</tt> objects expires.'' From Qt's point of view,
select waits for one of these events to occur, then returns.
<p>
The Qt documentation clearly describes how to use QSocketNotifier
and QTimer to hook into select. However, it does not
fully describe the priority levels of X events vs. other socket events vs.
timer events. In writing a program such as rtp, it is important
to understand these details, because the program's performance greatly
depends on them.
<p>
<H3>Inside Qt's Event Handling</H3>
<p>
In order to understand how the X socket, other sockets and timers are
prioritized, we have to look into the Qt source. Troll makes the Qt
source freely available (see Resources for the URL). The code
we want is in /src/kernel/qapplication_x11.cpp, under the
distribution tree. Note that while Qt source is freely redistributable,
Troll's license prohibits modification, unlike the GPL.
<p>
The function <B>QApplication::processNextEvent</B>, which
is called by the main event loop, services the X socket,
QSocketNotifier sockets and QTimer timers.
QApplication::processNextEvent first checks for an X event
to process. If none is found, it enters the select system call.
<p>
After select returns, QApplication::processNextEvent
dispatches events to all QSocketNotifier objects whose file
descriptors are ready. It then dispatches events to all QTimers
whose timeouts have been reached. The event loop for Qt 1.44 can be
summarized as follows (fd stands for file descriptor):
<p>
<pre>
while (1)
{
   if (X event pending) {
      dispatch X event;
      continue;
   } 
      timeout = minimum of all QTimer times to 
         next event;
      select (X fd, all QSocketNotifier fd's,
         timeout);
      dispatch events to all QSocketNotifier's with
        active sockets; 
      dispatch events to all QTimer's with expired
         times;
}
</pre>
Note that X events get highest priority, in the sense that
as long as there are more X events, the loop will ignore the
QSocketNotifier's and QTimer's events. However, when an X
event is not available, it is possible that Qt will execute <I>every</I>
QSocketNotifier and QTimer event before returning
to X events. This means we must consider the sum of registered
QSocketNotifier and QTimer event processing times as
the worst-case user interface latency.
<p>
<H3>Data Structures</H3>
<p>
From here on, I will refer to the rtp code
in some detail. You may want to download the code from the URL given
earlier and print it out with line numbers.
<p>
All of rtp's non-automatic data structures are embedded within two primary
C++ classes. <B>PlotWindow</B> is derived from Qt's QWidget
and provides all user interface callbacks, as well as the STDIN callback.
These classes are laid out in rtp.h. The important data members of
PlotWindow are:
<p>
<ul>
  <li>	<tt>deque&lt;DoubPt&gt; _points</tt>: the entire set of raw (x,y) data
points received from stdin. <B>deque</B> is a C++ Standard Template
Library class that (among other things) gives the illusion of contiguous
memory layout (array indices, fake pointers that you can increment to
move through the deque) to a dynamically sized block-linked
data structure. Points are kept in the order in which they are received.
  <li>	<tt>QPixmap *_buffer</tt>: the pixmap that is copied into the
plot window whenever the window is painted.
  <li>	<tt>RtpMapping _map</tt>: holds the viewport boundaries, scale
factors and offsets currently in effect for mapping received data points
into the plot window.
  <li>	<tt>QRect *_rubberBox</tt>: if non-NULL, defines the
``rubber''
box that the user is bounding with the mouse to define a new viewport.
Once the user releases the mouse, the box will be deleted from the screen
and the viewport will change.
</ul>
The other important rtp class is <B>RtpRender</B>. Its important data
members are:
<p>
<ul>
  <li>	<tt>QTimer _timer</tt>: activated to call
<B>RtpRender::slotWorkAwhile</B> while a rendering is in progress.
Inactive when rendering is not in progress.
  <li>	<tt>unsigned int _pti</tt>: marks the position in
points as successive calls to RtpRender::slotWorkAwhile progress
through the data.
  <li>	<tt>QPixMap *_privateBuff</tt>: <tt>*_buf. _privateBuff</tt> will be created
for a private rendering (explained below). <tt>_buf</tt> is the pixmap
actually drawn into by RtpRender::slotWorkAwhile. It will equal either
<tt>_privateBuff</tt> for a private rendering or the main repaint
pixmap for an on-line rendering.
</ul>
<H3>How rtp Processes Data Points</H3>
<p>
Data points to plot come in on STDIN. As part of its initial
setup, rtp sets the STDIN file descriptor mode to non-blocking
so that any read of STDIN will not block the program. This allows
us to read stdin in relatively large chunks, increasing efficiency.
<B>rtp</B> then creates a QSocketNotifier for STDIN, registering
PlotWindow::slotStdinAwake as the callback through the
signal/slot mechanism. Here is the code, from line 454 of rtp.c:
<p>
<pre>
fcntl(STDIN_FILENO, F_SETFL, O_NONBLOCK);
QSocketNotifier sn(STDIN_FILENO,
  QSocketNotifier::Read);
QObject::connect(&amp;sn, SIGNAL(activated(int)),
  plotter, SLOT(slotStdinAwake()));
</pre>
When <B>slotStdinAwake</B> (rtp.c, line 100) is called, we know there
is at least one character of data on STDIN (because select returned with STDIN
marked as ready, and all POSIX I/O is character-based). However, simply
reading one character and then returning is very inefficient. For optimal
efficiency, we want to read and process as many characters as possible.
<p>
However, the time spent in slotStdinAwake contributes to the
user interface latency, because no X events can be processed until
slotStdinAwake exits. If we processed as many STDIN characters as
were available and STDIN was receiving points at a faster rate than they
could be processed, we could risk locking out the UI (user interface)
completely. So we
have a classic tradeoff between efficiency and latency. The current
version of rtp attempts to read and process 1024 characters of data per
slotStdinAwake call. However, because the <B>read</B> call
doesn't block, we may not actually process this many characters.
<p>
slotStdinAwake is uglified by the fact that it does its own
buffering and doesn't use the STDIO library. I couldn't tell from the
GNU libc information whether STDIO would work after <tt>O_NONBLOCK</tt> had
been set
on the descriptor. Rather than find out, I took the lazy approach and
wrote my own buffering code.
<p>
<a href="3921l1.html">Listing 1</a>
<p>
When rtp parses a new x,y data point, it will map it into the current
pixmap if it is within the current viewport's range. If the point is
out of range and the plot mode is auto-scale or auto-tracking, the entire
plot must be redrawn at a new scaling and offset. The code in Listing 1
(rtp.c, line 255) handles these cases.
<p>
<H3>How Rtp Renders the Set of Data Points</H3>
<p>
<a href="3921l2.html">Listing 2</a>
<p>
The class <B>RtpRender</B> (defined in rtpRender.c) handles the
details of drawing the set of data points into a pixmap. Because
rendering the entire set can take significant time, RtpRender
sets up a QTimer object with zero timeout to give all
available CPU time to rendering while maintaining snappy UI response.
<B>RtpRender::slotWorkAwhile</B>, the QTimer callback, munches
on points for a fixed interval (100 msec at present), and then returns.
The code in Listing 2 is the guts of RtpRender::slotWorkAwhile
(rtpRender.c, line 274).
<p>
<a href="3921l3.html">Listing 3</a>
<p>
There are two types of rendering operations. A pre-emptive or
on-line rendering draws points directly into the pixmap used
for repaint events. A new on-line rendering is started by calling
<B>RtpRender::newOnlineRender</B>. When this is called, any rendering
that may be in progress is cancelled and the new rendering starts from
scratch, drawing all received points. The code is in Listing 3
(rtpRender.c, line 77).
<p>
When RtpRender::newOnlineRender is called, a pointer to the
pixmap used for repaint is passed in as the <tt>buf</tt> argument.
<tt>_map</tt> is a data structure that contains the scale and offset
factors for the new rendering and is returned to the calling code, so
that new points from STDIN can be directly plotted even as the rendering
progresses.
<p>
A non-preemptive or private rendering first creates a private pixmap,
then draws the points into it. A private rendering is
requested by calling <B>RtpRender::quePrivateRender</B>. The private
rendering does not cancel the current rendering operation if one is
in progress. It waits until the current rendering is complete before
starting. The code is in Listing 4 (rtpRender.c, line 97).
<p>
<a href="3921l4.html">Listing 4</a>
<p>
Because the queuing mechanism is just a boolean flag,
the private rendering queue is only one deep. When
RtpRender::quePrivateRender is called, it will destroy any
pending private rendering operation, but will not interfere with one
already in progress. Note that <tt>_timer</tt> is an object of type
QTimer. If the timer is already active, it means a
rendering is already in progress.
<p>
<B>rtp</B> uses private rendering to update the plot when new data points
force a viewport change in either the auto-scale or auto-tracking mode.
On-line rendering is used to update the plot in response to
user-initiated viewport changes, such as zooming into a moused region. The theory is
new points come in quickly enough that we don't want to start over
each time we get one. However, when the user changes the viewport,
he has no interest in anything but the latest and greatest
plot.
