<p>
The <I>WordPerfect for Linux Bible</I> is an excellent resource for
learning what was once the most common word processor available. Nearly
seven hundred pages of instruction, very clearly written, detail almost
everything you would want to know about the Linux version of WordPerfect.
<p>
A complete version--yes, you read that correctly--of WordPerfect 8
Personal Edition comes on the CD with the book, with over 5,000 clip art
images and 140 fonts, as well as KDE 1.1. This is obviously a bargain,
as the book and CD together are only $40 USD.
<p>
The first chapter covers installation in a reasonably thorough manner.
In Chapter Two, a general overview of the WordPerfect environment is
given in the form of a tutorial on writing a letter. This explains the
basics of text entry in WordPerfect, the Spell-As-You-Go auto-correction
feature, selecting and manipulating text, and saving your document.
<p>
We begin to delve into detail in Chapter Three, which covers the
WordPerfect interface. This includes such things as getting around
the screen, keystrokes, title bars and fine-tuning the document window 
display. In the fourth chapter, we move into formatting, with the
Format-As-You-Go feature, drop caps and QuickFormatting. Chapter Five
goes over WordPerfect help, including the PerfectExpert.
<p>
Part II begins with a cautionary chapter on safeguarding your work--timed 
backups, undo and Corel Versions are all discussed. WordPerfect
actually has a miniature file manager, which is what Chapter Seven covers.
In the eighth chapter, you learn about the wonderful world of Linux
fonts--including the necessity of actually installing them.
Adding clip art and other images to your documents is the subject of
Chapter Nine, as well as inserting line art, boxes, and the WP Draw tools.
Chapter Ten explains how to print your documents the way you want them
printed--booklets, envelopes, print jobs and printer settings are
all here. 
<p>
If you want to take your document and publish it on the Web,
Chapter Eleven is for you. While WordPerfect may not be the most advanced
web editor (and it certainly doesn't try to be), it is useful for 
quick publication, and this chapter will show you how to do just that. 
<p>
Since WordPerfect is predominantly used for writing actual documents, Part
III centers on the tools you would use in penning concise, grammatically
correct prose. Chapter Twelve helps you learn to use the spell
checker, how to find that word on the tip of your tongue that is still
eluding you, and how to write in French, Spanish, German, or any of
the other languages that WordPerfect supports. Editing techniques--text 
selection, finding and replacing, bookmarks and comments--are
discussed in the thirteenth chapter. In Chapter Fourteen, you learn how
to get your pages numbered just right. The fifteenth chapter covers
document formatting in detail: justification, paragraph formatting, 
styles, margins, headers, watermarks and so on. Tables and columns
are explained in Chapter Sixteen.
<p>
For those budding novelists, Part IV covers working with large documents.
This includes bullets and outlines (Chapter Seventeen), document
references such as footnotes, lists and tables of contents (Chapter
Eighteen) and multipart documents (Chapter Nineteen).
<p>
Part V centers on more advanced usage, such as templates, styles in
full detail, calculations and formulas, sorting information, equations
and charting data. The final section focuses on customization: the
WordPerfect preferences, the toolbar and menu customization, and mass
producing with labels and merge. And, of course, macros.
<p>
I would seriously recommend this book for those who are interested in
WordPerfect and its Linux port. Not only does it come with the full
version on CD, but it is well-written, humorous at times and easy
to understand.
