A continuation of our introduction to path variables and elements.
</i><p>
<i>
by Steve Collyer

<p>
In this final article in the series, I'll describe the remaining path
handling functions and point out a few implementation issues. Before I
do that, however, I will describe a utility called <B>makepath</B>. This reads
either standard input or its argument list, builds a colon-separated
path variable (pathvar) from those lines read and echoes it to standard output. For example:
<p>
<pre>
$ makepath /bin /usr/bin /opt/kde/bin
/bin:/usr/bin:/opt/kde/bin
</pre>
<B>makepath</B> is used in several of the pathvar utilities to reconstruct
a pathvar after its path elements (pathels) have been altered. I won't show you the
innards of makepath, as they're somewhat tangential to the main topic
and rather trivial.
<p>
<H3>listpath</H3>
<p>
First, let's look at <B>listpath</B>, which echoes the pathels making up a pathvar
on separate lines, as in:
<p>
<pre>
$ listpath -p MANPATH
/usr/man
/usr/local/man
/opt/CC/man
</pre>
Using listpath has two advantages over merely echoing <tt>$MANPATH</tt>.
First, it's much easier to read the pathels when they appear on separate lines;
and secondly, you can pipe its output through <B>grep</B>:
<p>
<pre>
$ listpath | grep bin 
/opt/kde/bin
/usr/local/bin
/bin
</pre>
There is no option-handling code we did not see in the
<B>addpath</B>
function, so let's look at the main code:
<p>
<pre>
eval echo 
</pre>
This is very simple. We just echo the contents of the specified pathvar
into the <B>colon2line</B> function (included in the tar file mentioned at the
end of this article), which turns the embedded : characters
into newline characters. I described the operation of this piece of
code in some detail in Part 2, so I won't repeat it here.
Take a look at that article
(<A HREF="http://www.linuxjournal.com/lj.issues/issue72/3768.html" TARGET="_blank">http://www.linuxjournal.com/lj.issues/issue72/3768.html</A>)
if you're not sure why the <B>eval</B> is there.
<p>
<H3>delpath</H3>
<p>
We have already seen the addpath function, which performs an idempotent
addition of a pathel to a pathvar. The converse of this behaviour
is provided by <B>delpath</B>, which removes pathels from a pathvar. So,
for example:
<p>
<pre>
delpath /opt/CC/test/bin
</pre>
will remove the /opt/CC/test/bin directory from <tt>$PATH</tt> and:
<p>
<pre>
delpath -e &quot;(bill|steve)&quot; -p MANPATH
</pre>
will remove all pathels matching the <B>egrep</B>-style regular expression
<tt>&quot;(bill|steve)&quot;</tt> from <tt>$MANPATH</tt>. The command
<p>
<pre>
delpath -n
</pre>
removes all non-existent directories from <tt>$PATH</tt>.
<p>
Although delpath is not a function you are likely to need often,
there is one place where it can be useful. Many UNIX machines have
a file called /etc/PATH, which is sourced by /etc/profile. It sets
up a default PATH containing directories required by all users. Too
often, though, /etc/PATH is not modified for years at a time, and the
directories added either no longer exist or are not truly required by
all. In this case, you can call delpath at the start of an appropriate
login script (.profile or .bash_profile) to remove the directories
you do not need.
<p>
Let's look at the delpath code. I'll skip most of the option handling,
as
much of it is identical to that in addpath.
<p>
<pre>
MATCH=&quot;-x&quot;            # default
[ -n &quot;$opt_e&quot; ] &amp;&amp; MATCH= # make grep use regexps
FILTER=              # default
[ -n &quot;$opt_n&quot; ] &amp;&amp; FILTER=&quot;| realpath_filter&quot;
</pre>
Here, we see the final section of the option handling. The
<tt>MATCH</tt> variable
determines whether we handle the supplied path description as
a regular expression or not. It is used later as an option to grep;
<tt>grep -x</tt> tells grep to perform exact string matches.
<p>
The <tt>FILTER</tt> variable implements the <tt>-n</tt>
option, i.e., the ``remove non-existent
directories'' behaviour. If the user supplies the <tt>-n</tt> option, <tt>FILTER</tt>
contains a string which pipes the output of a previous command through
a program called <B>realpath_filter</B>. This program reads directory names
from its standard input and writes the name to standard output only if
it is an existing directory. I'll leave it as an easy exercise for the
reader to implement such a filter.
<p>
The remainder of delpath is as follows:
<p>
<pre>
eval listpath -p $pathvar $FILTER |
  grep -v -E $MATCH &quot;$1&quot;&gt; /tmp/makepath_in.$$
eval $pathvar=$(makepath &lt; /tmp/makepath_in.$$)
rm /tmp/makepath_in.$$
</pre>
The function does its work in three stages. The first command generates a
file in /tmp containing those directories that are not to be deleted. The
second command rebuilds the pathvar from that file using makepath.
Finally we remove the file; we don't want it cluttering up the file system
after the function finishes. (The shell expands <tt>$$</tt> to the process ID of
the shell running the command; I'll assume it is 20610 in this article.)
<p>
Let's look at the first line. Essentially, it uses <B>listpath</B> to break
the appropriate pathvar into separate lines, and grep to remove those
we don't want. It's slightly complicated, however, by the presence
of the <tt>FILTER</tt> variable. Suppose the user types:
<p>
<pre>
delpath -e &quot;^opt&quot;
</pre>
which means ``remove all directories starting with the <tt>opt</tt>
string from
<tt>$PATH</tt>''. In this case, pathvar will contain
<tt>PATH</tt>, while <tt>MATCH</tt> and <tt>FILTER</tt>
will be empty. The first line will therefore expand to:
<p>
<pre>
eval listpath -p PATH |
  grep -v -E &quot;^opt&lt;&quot; &gt; /tmp/makepath_in.20610
</pre>
This is straightforward--listpath writes the pathels in
<tt>PATH</tt> into
the grep command, which we use to echo non-matching lines only
(<tt>-v</tt>).
We redirect the output into our temporary file, which will contain those
pathels not starting with <tt>opt</tt>. In this case, the leading
eval is unnecessary. However, if the user types
<p>
<pre>
delpath -n
</pre>
to remove all non-existent directories from <tt>$PATH</tt>, then the first line
expands to
<p>
<pre>
eval listpath -p PATH | realpath_filter |
grep -v -E &quot;&quot; &gt; /tmp/makepath_in.20610
</pre>
During the initial processing of the line (i.e., before the eval has
forced re-evaluation), the shell saw the pipe symbol preceding the grep,
but it did not see the pipe symbol preceding realpath_filter. As things
stand at the moment, the shell sees the first | as a literal character
and will pass it as an argument to listpath. This happened because
the shell looks for | characters before it expands variables, and the |
character preceding realpath_filter was stored in a variable. The second
evaluation caused by the eval ensures the pipeline that runs the
realpath_filter command is constructed.
<p>
We now have a file containing only the required pathels. The
second line in delpath rebuilds the pathvar from that file, using the
following code:
<p>
<pre>
eval $pathvar=$(makepath &lt; /tmp/makepath_in.$$)
</pre>
This shouldn't cause us too many problems. First, makepath simply reads
the lines in the file, builds a colon-separated pathvar and echoes it.
We run makepath in command-substitution mode (that's the
<tt>$(...)</tt> which I
described in Part 2), so makepath's output is used as the
right-hand side of the variable assignment. The initial eval is
required due to the order in which the shell evaluates a command. Because
it looks for assignment statements before expanding variables, it won't
recognize that the command contains a valid assignment. The eval ensures
the assignment takes place the second time the line is processed.
<p>
<H3>uniqpath</H3>
<p>
Suppose you log on to your UNIX system and discover, for reasons
beyond your control, that PATH is full of duplicate entries. (Humour me. It
does happen. Maybe your system administrator modified /etc/PATH inadvisedly).
Let's
assume these duplicates are making your PATH undesirably long. Is
there anything you can do to clean things up? Yes, you can type at the
prompt:
<p>
<pre>
$ uniqpath
</pre>
This will remove any duplicate entries from your path, leaving the order
of the remaining pathels intact. For example:
<p>
<pre>
$ NEWP=fred:bill:steve:fred:dave:bill
$ uniqpath -p NEWP
$ echo $NEWP
fred:bill:steve:dave
</pre>
Let's skip the options-handling code again, and look at the meat:
<p>
<pre>
npath=$(listpath -p $pathvar | awk '{seen[$0]++;
if (seen[$0]==1){print}}')
    eval $pathvar=$(makepath &quot;$npath&quot;)
</pre>
As usual, <tt>$pathvar</tt> contains the name of the pathvar
we want to
modify. The code is rather similar to that of delpath. The first
line generates a variable (<tt>npath</tt>) containing the unique
path elements,
and the second line rebuilds the pathvar from those elements using
makepath. We don't use an external file to store the pathels,
but keep everything in shell variables. This is done in order
to demonstrate an alternative technique--there is no deeper reason.
<p>
The first line runs listpath to break the pathvar into separate lines
and pipes them through an <B>awk</B> filter which removes duplicate pathels.
You may be wondering why we don't just use the <B>uniq</B> program
instead of
awk's magic. It's because uniq will remove duplicate lines from its
input only if they happen to be adjacent. In our case, the duplicate pathels
will generally not be adjacent, so <B>uniq</B> won't work.
``Aha,'' you say, ``why
not use <tt>sort -u</tt>? That will sort the lines and remove
duplicates.'' True
enough, however, it may also modify the directory search order, if we ran
<B>uniqpath</B> to alter <tt>PATH</tt>. Usually, people care about the order
in which
their PATH directories are searched, and it's a bad idea to modify it.
<p>
Thus, we have the awk solution. This uses a powerful feature of awk known as
an associative array or hash (if you have a Perl background). If you're
a C programmer, you'll know what an array is: a group of objects
of the same type, indexed by an integer. The contents of an array can
be accessed by expressions like values[0] or values[20], which refer to
the first and twenty-first elements, respectively. A hash is rather like
an array which can be indexed by an arbitrary string of characters. So,
in awk notation, we could write
<p>
<pre>
age[&quot;bill&quot;]=27
</pre>
to assign 27 to the hash element indexed by the string <tt>bill</tt>
in the
hash called <tt>age</tt>. Let's look at the awk code shown above.
<p>
Between the single quotes, we have a block of code run each
time awk reads a new line from its standard input. When awk reads
a line, it is stored in a special variable called <tt>$0</tt>, and we
use <tt>$0</tt> as
an index into a hash called <tt>seen</tt>. (We haven't declared
this anywhere--that's okay in awk. Variables spring into existence, with numerical
value 0, when they appear in the code). We use the <tt>seen</tt> hash
to tell
us whether awk has already seen an identical line of input since it started
executing. Let's see what happens in the <tt>NEWP</tt> example
shown above.
<p>
First, listpath splits <tt>NEWP</tt> into lines containing the following strings:
``fred'', ``bill'', ``steve'', ``fred'', ``dave'' and ``bill'', which are read in that
order by awk. <B>awk</B> stores each line it reads in <tt>$0</tt>,
so <tt>$0</tt> takes on
the values ``fred'', ``bill'' and so on, in turn. Each time a line is read,
the corresponding element of the <tt>seen</tt> hash is incremented
(by the line
<tt>seen[$0]++</tt>) and is printed only if it has been seen exactly
once (by the print statement in the <tt>if</tt> block, which prints
<tt>$0</tt> to standard
output by default). If we look at the hash element <tt>seen[&quot;fred&quot;]</tt>, this is
initially 0 and is then set to 1 when awk reads the first ``fred'' line,
remains
at 1 for the next two lines, and is set to 2 when awk reads the second
``fred'' line. It is printed only when it is seen for the first time.
C programmers should note how syntactically elegant this solution
is and how little code is required when compared to the equivalent in C.
<p>
<H3>edpath</H3>
<p>
The final pathvar function we're going to see is <B>edpath</B>.
This breaks
the pathels in a pathvar into separate lines, writes them to a temporary
file and runs an editor on that file. You can edit the pathels to
your heart's content and quit from the editor when you're finished. The
pathvar is then reconstructed from the modified lines in the file. <B>edpath</B>
allows you to perform arbitrary modifications on a pathvar. I use it
most often when I wish to swap the order of directories in <tt>PATH</tt>.
<p>
The code for edpath is fairly straightforward (ignoring once again the
boring details of option handling):
<p>
<pre>
TEMP=/tmp/edpath.out.$$
VAR=\$$pathvar  # VAR=&quot;$LIBPATH&quot; for example
eval export OLD$pathvar=$VAR  # store old path in 
                              # e.g. OLDPATH
listpath -p $pathvar &gt; $TEMP  # write path
                              #  elements to file
${EDITOR:-vi} $TEMP           # edit the file eval
$pathvar=$(makepath &lt; $TEMP) # reconstruct path
/bin/rm -f $TEMP           # remove temporary file
</pre>
Let's skip the first three lines for now. The real work is done by the
block of code starting with listpath. This follows a similar pattern
as delpath and uniqpath. First, we separate the pathels in the pathvar
using listpath, but this time, we redirect the output into a temporary
file. The next line edits that file. The expression <tt>${EDITOR:-vi}</tt> may
be unfamiliar; it means ``Use the value of the <tt>EDITOR</tt>
variable if it is
non-null, else use vi.'' This allows the user to specify his favourite
editor by setting the <tt>EDITOR</tt> environment variable (to Emacs, perhaps)
but uses vi if he has not done so. Note that the <B>edit</B> command is run
in the foreground, so the shell will wait until the editor process
terminates before running any more commands from the shell function.
When this occurs, the modified pathvar will be reconstructed by the
line starting with <tt>eval</tt>. If you read the description of delpath
given above, you'll know how this line works.
<p>
Lines 2 and 3 of the code are a safety net. They store the initial value
of the pathvar to be edited in a new environment variable. If the user
is editing <tt>PATH</tt>, for example, then the code creates a
variable called <tt>OLDPATH</tt>. If the user makes unwanted
modifications to her <tt>PATH</tt>, she can simply type:
<p>
<pre>
$ PATH=$OLDPATH
</pre>
and all will be well.
<p>
<H3>Conclusion</H3>
<p>
UNIX can present a bewildering array of tools and techniques, and
it's almost
impossible for any individual to be intimately familiar with all of them.
In my experience, the best developers carry around a large bag of simple
but useful techniques and are able to combine them rapidly into a
working solution. You don't need to know every detail of every tool to
do useful work, but you do need a bag of tricks you understand.
<p>
