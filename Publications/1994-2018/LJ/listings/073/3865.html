And now for the news...

<p>
Some of the ongoing shifts in the Python community were apparent at the
Eighth International Python Conference (IPC8), held in Washington, DC
this past January. [Note: the Spanish Inquisition was not in attendence.]
For a start, the continued growth of the Python community was obvious.
IPC7, the previous conference, attracted roughly a hundred attendees.
IPC8 was more than twice as large, with around 250 attendees. Much of
this growth came from the increasing popularity of the Zope application
server, which had its own conference track for the first time. This
track drew some 90 people who attended talks on Zope's architecture
and features, designing applications for Zope, and
saw demos of new products such as the Portal Toolkit.
<p>
<H3>Education</H3>
<p>
One interesting new theme emerged at this conference, the idea of using
Python to teach programming.
<p>
Randy Pausch of Carnegie-Mellon University gave a keynote talk about
the Alice virtual reality system (<A HREF="http://www.alice.org/" TARGET="_blank">http://www.alice.org/</A>),
a stunning talk that held out some hope that maybe, just maybe,
these computer things can be useful to people without requiring them to
master Cartesian coordinates or to adjust their thinking to match
the machine's. Alice is a 3D VR system used in a course at CMU, whose
audience is non-technical users without a background in engineering or
computer science. Accordingly, the system has been carefully tested for
usability throughout its development. Python had to be modified slightly
to improve its suitability for novices, but only two serious changes were
made: floating point is automatically used for all numbers in Alice, and
the language was made case-insensitive so that names such as
``Value'' and ``value'' refer to the same variable.
The talk concluded with an impressive
video of four different projects done using Alice, ranging from a ``Calvin
and Hobbes''-inspired sled ride to computer-generated characters who
follow a human aerobics instructor.
<p>
Unfortunately, Alice is available only for Windows, although
a Playstation port is being worked on, and the resulting structural changes
should also provide for a MacOS port. In answer to an audience member's
question about using Alice on the Macintosh, Pausch replied that
you'd have to
purchase VirtualPC for the Macintosh; Alice is efficient enough to
run acceptably under emulation. Therefore, instead of waiting for a
Linux port, you should probably just buy VMware and a copy of Windows.
Alice is exciting enough to be worth it!
<p>
Guido van Rossum's nascent ``Computer Programming for Everybody''
project aims to use Python for teaching by creating a sophisticated
programming environment that helps out novices, writing a CS curriculum
and perhaps modifying the Python language to make it easier to learn.
At the moment, Van Rossum is gearing up to start work on CP4E, thinking about
incremental parsing and type inferencing--and deciding what to teach in
one semester. Van Rossum would like a spell-checker-style mode of operation
for the teaching environment, so that as soon as one types a line of code,
it would be checked and any possible problems noted.
<p>
A birds-of-a-feather session on education had 40 attendees and led
to the creation of an Education SIG that will continue to discuss and
develop teaching aids for Python.
<p>
<H3>Scientific Programming</H3>
<p>
Over the last five years, an increasing number of people have begun using
Python for numeric work. The canonical story told in scientific programming
papers
at Python conferences usually runs something like this: a group has an
existing body of numeric routines, usually written in Fortran or C/C++.
To speed up prototyping, the group decides to write a scripting language
that gives them an interpreted environment to experiment in. However,
along the way, someone discovers Python, and rather than re-invent the
wheel and maintain their own interpreter, they realize it's much easier
just to write a Python interface to the number-crunching code.
<p>
Python's suitability for numeric work stems from three main reasons.
First are the excellent Numeric Python extensions that provide powerful,
multidimensional matrix types.
<p>
The second reason is SWIG, which can parse a C header or Fortran file and
automatically generate a Python wrapper for the C or Fortran functions.
SWIG also supports Perl and Tcl (XXX and Guile?), but here the third
factor comes into play. Python's syntax is simple and relatively
familiar, unlike the shell-influenced structures of Tcl and Perl, or the
parenthesis-heavy Scheme/Lisp syntax that people either love or loathe.
<p>
An excellent example would be the talk ``Using Python to Modernize
Astronomical Software'' by Richard White and Perry Greenfield.
The authors work for the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore,
which is responsible for processing data from the Hubble Space Telescope.
They use an astronomical software environment called IRAF, consisting
of around a million lines of code. IRAF provides a portable, though
not feature-rich, environment for writing analysis software, but
the command language isn't very flexible or easy to use. They started
down the path of writing their own new language, then discovered Python
and decided to use it as the new IRAF command language. Because IRAF
works by running subprocesses for each job, Python needs only to be able
to speak IRAF's interprocess protocol in order to fit into the system.
The Python interface, called PyRAF, will soon be going into beta testing
at a few sites, with final release in a few months. It can also parse and
emulate the old command language to provide backward compatibility.
<p>
<H3>Commercialization</H3>
<p>
The increasing commercial importance of Python was also visible.
Free software generally starts out being experimented with by a few adventurous
users in
their spare time, who then quietly begin using the software for real work.
Early adopters often have to battle reluctant managers who are doubtful
about trying an unfamiliar program, but when the software gains in
popularity, the early adopters are well placed.
<p>
Judging by several announcements, Python is moving smoothly along this
path. The Python Consortium, which provides a way for companies to fund
Python's ongoing development, has grown to two full-member companies
and seven associate members.
<p>
As another example, ActiveState will now be providing enterprise-class
support for Python, as they currently do for Perl. They've
definitely started off on the right foot, joining the Python Consortium
and hiring Mark Hammond and David Ascher. Both have been part of the
Python community for years; Mark Hammond is the primary author of the
Python Windows port and co-author of the O'Reilly <I>Python Programming
on Win32</I>, and David Ascher maintained Numeric Python
for awhile and co-authored <I>Learning Python</I>. Since they've got two
highly skilled developers, I expect to see interesting Python-related
things coming out of ActiveState before too long.
<p>
Several well-known Python developers have formed their own companies.
Fredrik Lundh's SecretLabs AB demonstrated PythonWorks, their commercial
integrated development environment. Neuberger &amp; Hughes presented
WorldPilot, a web-based mail and calendar application built on top
of Zope. Andy Robinson and Aaron Watters announced the formation of
ReportLabs, which will provide consulting services based on PDFgen, their
open-source Python library for creating PDF documents programmatically.
All of these companies have contributed significant pieces of free
software to the Python community.
<p>
<H3>Developer's Day</H3>
<p>
Happily, commercialization hasn't diluted the conference's strong
technical slant. As a few weeks of reading comp.lang.python will tell
you, Python programmers tend to be inveterate language hackers, curious
to explore new programming language ideas and to apply them to Python.
Two fascinating, though challenging, talks were presented that discussed
potential new directions for Python. John Aycock's ``Aggressive Type
Inference'' talk described a type inferencing system for Python, then
tested its accuracy by running it on a number of sizable Python programs
such as IDLE, Gadfly and Grail. This confirmed Aycock's hypothesis that
most variables in Python programs can have a consistent type inferred for
them. Programmers rarely use the same variable name for both a list and
an integer, and such polymorphism is usually confined to a few sections
of code.
<p>
Christian Tismer's ``Stackless Python'' presentation was even
more exciting.
The current Python interpreter does a C function recursion for every
Python function call, which means you can recurse only so deeply
before filling up the C stack. Tismer performed some major surgery
on the Python interpreter's virtual machine, allowing implementation of
various language features such as continuations, generators, co-routines
and microthreads. Christian even suggested it would be possible to
pickle an entire interpreter state, ship it to an interpreter on another
machine, unpickle it and resume the thread of execution.
<p>
Another IPC tradition has been Developer's Day, where lively free-for-all
sessions give participants a chance to discuss future development over
a higher-bandwidth medium than a mailing list. This year, sessions
covered such topics such as internationalization, documentation tools,
XML software and compiler tools.
<p>
<H3>Next Year</H3>
<p>
The conferences have previously alternated between East Coast and West
Coast cities, but the upcoming 9th conference will break that pattern
by being in Washington DC again, in November 2000. That's quite soon, so start
working on papers now!
