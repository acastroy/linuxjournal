Listing 2. This runs simulations in parallel on many computers.
The runtime is consistent but can be inefficient.

#! /bin/bash
for pair in host1/test1 host2/test2 \
            host2/test3 host5/test4
do test=`basename $pair`
   make $test
   ssh `dirname $pair` vvpstdin \
       < $test > $test.out &
done
wait; make
