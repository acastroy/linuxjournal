Listing 1. master.cfg for Virtual Hosts

# Master.cfg File for all local Virtual Hosts 
# Requires additional .cfg files for individual 
# sites or pages. Created by Gaelyne R. Gasson
# for "Analyzing Web Stats with Analog"
# Customise to suit your requirements. 
# Turn DEBUG and WARNINGS on to debug and solve 
# mysteries. For use with cron scripts, once you
# are satisfied with your set up, these should be
# turned off, otherwise you will receive email
# with warnings and information in it each time
# cron job is run. If using multiple log files,
# WARNINGS L will turn off warnings about 
# the duplicated dates/double counting. According 
# to the author this is a warning message only and 
# has no effect on Analog's analysis

# TIMECOLS affect how Reports are displayed and 
# what information is included with it, as 
# described below. The PpRrBb format is a good 
# way to initially see all available formats in
# use before deciding on the format you prefer. 
# You can also set each of the time reports 
# separately with the appropriate command, such 
# as HOURCOLS or MONTHCOLS etc.). Lowercase 
# letters refer to percentages:
#    P=Pages  R=Requests  B=Bytes
# // p = pages r =  requests b = bytes.

# ALLGRAPH allows you to decide whether or not the

# NonTime related reports have floor and sortby 
# commands. Floor limits the amount and type of
# data. The type can be: r=request, p=page, 
# b=bytes, d=date, x=random, a=alphabetical
# If you use a floor, the sortby format should
# match the floor type. I use requests for all 
# floor limits on nontime reports and also use 
# requests for the sortby commands.
