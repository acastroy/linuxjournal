// IDL. In file PushString.idl
// This is a very simple idl file.  It defines a single interface, called
// PushString, and PushString contains a single function, which takes a
// single in paramter of type string, which is mapped in c++ to a const
// char * (see file PushString_i.h, for the pushStr declaration in the
// implementation).

interface PushString
{
	boolean pushStr(in string inStr);
};
