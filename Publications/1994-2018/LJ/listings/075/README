To run this software, you need a Linux system which supports sound.
You also need the GNU C compiler and the Tcl/Tk interpreter installed
on your system if you want to use the GUI.

This application hands over the sound via /dev/dsp. You can control
the sensitivity of your sound card's input via /dev/mixer with a
program like smix.

Compile the source dmm.c like this:

  gcc -O2 -Wall -ansi -pedantic -o dmm dmm.c -lm

There should not be a single error or warning during compilation.
Now, run the program like this:

  wish -f embed.tcl | dmm | wish -f out.tcl

Finally, read the article in the Linux Journal for learning how to
apply this software.
