These scripts are required to run the book store demo program.  Each script
is in a seperate file so you can look at the source. 

Before you run the install script you need to run the installpubs2 script 
located in the /opt/sybase/scripts directory.  You can do this by typing:

isql -Usa -i /opt/sybase/scripts/installpubs2

at the command line.

You can now run the install script in the this directory.  You can do this
by typing:

./install-book database password

Where database is the name of your Sybase database and password is the sa 
password for your database.
