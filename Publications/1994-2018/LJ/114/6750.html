Try these effects to give your photos a classic and timeless
appearance.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a56580.0x1b4e1e8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
One of the much-touted advantages of digital cameras over film cameras
is, at least at low ISO levels, a silky smooth absence of grain
in images. Grain in traditional film prints or scans is
the result of several factors, but the main culprit is the design of
film itself: light-sensitive particles laid down in emulsion layers
on celluloid. The larger these particles are, the more sensitive the
film is to light and the faster it is considered to be. This
determines the film's ISO rating. Higher sensitivity
comes at a price; the larger the particles, the more easily they can be
seen as grain in developed prints. Some high-speed black-and-white films, such as Kodak T-Max 3200, are especially grainy and are
preferred by photographers who like the visual effect the grain
structure adds to the photograph.
</p><p>
With digital, you can get film grain's counterpart,
sensor noise. I usually want to reduce
noise in my digital images, but sometimes I want that
gritty, grainy film look, as seen in art houses,
street photography and old photos. In this article,
I describe a nifty trick for simulating
film grain in an otherwise grainless digital image.
</p><p>
Another classic photography staple that has made the transition to
digital imaging is sepia toning. Sepia toning originally was
developed to extend the archival life of early black-and-white
silver-based prints. The process has the effect of converting the
silver grains in the print to silver sulphide, which is more stable than
silver and thus slows the inexorable process of chemical deterioration.
In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, it also provided a
more pleasing color than straight black and white due to the poor
quality of photo papers at the time, which were likely to be some shade
of brownish-white.
</p><p>
In the traditional sepia-toning process, the developed print is gently
agitated in a bleach solution to convert some or all of the silver from
its metallic state. After rinsing, the print is soaked in sepia toner
until all the bleached silver is toned to the desired degree. Finally,
the print is washed again to remove excess toner and then dried.
With the transition to digital imaging and the use of archival pigmented
inks, sepia toning is done these days almost exclusively for aesthetic
reasons. A sepia photograph has a timeless, classic
feel to it. With a powerful bitmap image-editing program such as The GIMP
and a decent photo-quality color inkjet printer, you can achieve excellent
quality sepia toning without the hassle of working up to your arms in
toxic, smelly chemicals.
</p><p>
In this tutorial, I also show you how to accomplish the
vignette effect, another popular holdover from the portrait
world. Vignette in this case does not refer to a &ldquo;gradually faded oval
cutout&rdquo;, one popular definition of the term. Rather, I mean, lens
vignetting, where a special lens or lens hood is used to achieve a gradual
light falloff toward the corners of the image frame.

Simulating Film Grain</h2></div></div><p>
Most of the menus in The GIMP are accessed by clicking the right-most
mouse button in an image window. In the description that follows, a
right-click is abbreviated RC. If I describe a GIMP action to invoke, I
will mention the series of menus or a keyboard shortcut in
parentheses. For example, open the image (RC&rarr;File&rarr;Open), means
right-click in the image window and choose File, and from that menu
choose Open. If a keyboard shortcut makes more sense, I list the
combination of keys to press; for example, copy the image (Ctrl-C) means
press and hold the Ctrl key and press C.
</p><p>
To start with, I assume you have a photo with artistic
potential loaded into The GIMP, as shown in Figure 1.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6750f1.large.jpg"><img src="6750f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1. A Photo with Timeless and Classic Potential
</p></div></div><p>
If you are like me and want to use the effect
in black and white, the first step is
to convert it from color. An easy way to do the conversion
is to perform a mode change to grayscale
(RC&rarr;Image&rarr;Mode&rarr;Grayscale), which provides reasonably
pleasing results for a large percentage of
images. For some images, though, other approaches
may yield better results. For the ultimate
in flexibility, try a custom mix using the
Channel Mixer plugin (RC&rarr;Filters&rarr;Colors&rarr;Channel
Mixer), with the Monochrome option selected.
A tutorial on converting to black and white is at
<a href="http://mmmaybe.gimp.org/tutorials/Color2BW" target="_self">mmmaybe.gimp.org/tutorials/Color2BW</a>.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6750f2.large.jpg"><img src="6750f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. After Mode Change to Grayscale and Back to RGB
</p></div></div><p>
Once you have a decent-looking black-and-white image, you are ready to proceed.
If you used a
standard grayscale mode change, as I did here, you need to put the
image back in RGB mode (RC&rarr;Image&rarr;Mode&rarr;RGB).
</p><p>
Click on the foreground color swatch in The GIMP toolbox to bring up the
color selection dialog. Dial in the color red = 128, green = 128, blue = 128,
as shown in Figure 3, and click OK. This selection should make the foreground swatch
in the toolbox a neutral gray, as shown in Figure 4.

Figure 5. The Layers Dialog after Addition of the Film Grain Layer
</p></div></div><p>
Now bring up the Layers dialog (Ctrl-L) and click on the button for a
new layer, circled at the bottom of Figure 5. Give it the name Film
Grain and choose the option to fill it with the foreground color. Once
you click OK, you should see nothing but a solid gray color in the image
window as the newly created layer obscures the image in the layer below.
Now, change the blending mode of the layer to Overlay (circled at the
top of Figure 5), and you should see your image again. The blending
mode is an attribute of a layer that describes how it combines with the
layers below it to form a composite image. In Overlay mode, anything
lighter than neutral gray lightens the image and anything darker darkens
it. Our layer is completely neutral gray at this point, so there is no
visible difference from the background image.
</p><p>
With the Film Grain layer selected in the Layers dialog, bring up the
Scatter HSV filter by right-clicking in the image window and selecting
Filters&rarr;Noise&rarr;Scatter HSV from the pop-up context menus. This filter
adds a noise pattern to the neutral gray layer, which overlays to the image below it, creating a grain-like pattern.
</p><p>
Here's a not-too-technical interpretation of the filter parameters for
the purpose of creating grain:

<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Value: think of this as the master control for the
granularity and intensity of the grain. Increasing this
increases the contrast in the grain and the cluster size of some
introduced noise, making the simulated grain seem larger and darker.
</p></li><li><p>
Hue: if Saturation (see below) is set to 0, this has little
effect other than to change the (random) pattern of the grain.
Play with it until you see a pattern you like.
</p></li><li><p>
Saturation: set this to 0 unless you want to add colored grain
(a color image, for example). If colored grain is what you want,
adjust this as well as the Hue control.
</p></li><li><p>
Holdness: the fine-tune control for the
granularity and intensity of the grain. Adjust this after you've
made a change to the other controls. Higher amounts make the grain
finer and less noticeable.
</p></li></ul></div>
</p><p>
Play with the parameters until you see an interesting grain pattern
in the preview window of the filter, as shown in Figure 6, and then click
OK. When the filter finishes, you should see your image take on a grain
pattern. If you don't like the look, Undo (Ctrl-Z) and reapply the
filter with different settings (Shift-Alt-F). You probably don't want
to go too light on the effect here, because the next steps will soften
the grain and mute its effect.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6750f6.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>Figure 6. The Noise/Scatter HSV Filter Showing Typical Film Grain Parameters
</p></div></div><p>
Although you could stop at this step with decent results, there is room
for improvement. If you examine a traditional grainy black-and-white photo, you can see that film grain tends to be most noticeable in the
mid-tones and is much less so in the shadows and highlights. What we need
is a way to control the blending so the highlights and shadows of
the background layer get less of the grain effect. If you read my
earlier tutorial on layers and layer masks (see &ldquo;Fixing Photo Contrast
with The GIMP&rdquo;, <i  >LJ</i>, April 2003), you might remember that we can control
the blending of layers using a layer mask. The lighter a pixel is
in the layer mask, the more opaque the corresponding pixel is in the
upper layer; the more opaque it is, the stronger its effect is when
blending with a pixel in the layer below. The trick to achieving the
desired effect is to make our layer mask be a half-inverted copy
of the background image. Read on, and you'll see what I mean.
</p><p>
In the Layers dialog, right-click on the Film Grain layer and choose Add
Layer Mask. In the Add Mask Options dialog, choose White (Full Opacity)
and click OK. Now click on the Background layer. Return your
mouse focus to the image window and do a select all and then copy
(Ctrl-A followed by Ctrl-C is the quickest). Return to the Layers
dialog, and click on the layer mask icon in the Film Grain layer; it's the
little white square next to the layer thumbnail, circled in Figure
7. Then, move your mouse focus back to the image window and paste
(Ctrl-V). In the Layers dialog, click the Anchor button to anchor the
pasted image into the layer mask. After this step, your Layers dialog
should resemble Figure 7.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6750f7.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6750f8.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 8. The Curves Dialog, Half-Inverting the Layer Mask
</p></div></div><p>
With the layer mask still selected, if you just pasted
into it, bring up the Curves dialog by right-clicking in the image
window and selecting Image&rarr;Colors&rarr;Curves. Click to add a control point
in the middle of the linear graph. Then grab the right (upper) endpoint
and drag it down to the lower right bottom, as shown in Figure 8. What
you are doing is half-inverting the layer mask, making all highlights
into shadows, so the mid-tones are the brightest part of the
image. You also may want to drag the midpoint straight up a bit as I
have done here to boost the brightness of the midtones&mdash;keep an eye on
the image window while you are doing this so you can see the effect of
the boost on the grain. When you're all done click OK; you should see a
subtle difference in the way the grain shows up in the shadows and
highlights. Overall, the grain effect is subdued somewhat, which is
why we didn't want to go too subtle in the previous step.
</p><p>
To see the effect of the layer mask more clearly, hold the Ctrl key
and click the layer mask icon in the Layers dialog. A little red
outline should display around the icon, and the image window changes
to show the blend without the effect of the layer mask. Ctrl-click
the icon again to toggle the effect of the mask back on.
</p><p>
As a last step, consider applying a bit of Gaussian Blur to smooth
the grain a little. Click the grain icon in the Layers dialog to
select it, then go
back to the image window and RC&rarr;Filters&rarr;Blur&rarr;IIR Gaussian Blur.
Be aware that if you use anything other than a very small blur radius you
counteract the effect of adding the grain in the first place and
end up with a noisy, but not noticeably grainy image. A value between
1 and 3
should be sufficient if you used a high Value setting
in the Scatter HSV filter. If you like the grain the way it is, skip the
blurring step. The result I obtained in Figure 9 used the HSV Scatter
settings shown in Figure 6 and a Gaussian Blur with a radius of one pixel.

Sepia Toning</h2></div></div><p>
Now that we have an artistic-looking black-and-white photo, let's
sepia-tone it to add a more timeless and classic look.
In the Layers dialog, make sure the Film Grain layer is selected,
and click on the duplicate layer button at the bottom of the dialog;
the entire layer is duplicated, including the layer mask.
Double-click on the name Film Grain copy and change it to Sepia
Tone. Change the blend mode of the new layer to Color;
this applies the hue and saturation of the Sepia Tone layer
with the value (luminance) of the composite layers below. Finally,
click on the layer thumbnail icon in the Sepia Tone layer to
select it, as opposed to its layer mask.
</p><p>
Click on the foreground color swatch in the main GIMP toolbox to bring
up the Color Selection dialog, as you did before. Dial in
the color (red = 162, green = 138 and blue = 101) and click OK. You should see
the color swatch change to a hue of brown. Once you have this technique
down, you can experiment with different tinting colors, but this
is a good starting point.
</p><p>
Select the Fill tool (paint bucket) in The GIMP toolbox window and
move your mouse focus to the image window. Do a select all (Ctrl-A), and
click once in the window to fill it with the new color. Your Layers
dialog should look something like Figure 10, and the image should take on
an overall sepia tint, as shown in Figure 11.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6750f10.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div><p>
The use of the same layer mask in the Sepia Tone layer as the Film Grain
layer is deliberate. In the traditional wet-darkroom process, the sepia
toning occurs most in the mid-tones, and the lighter and darker areas appear
to be less brown. You can use the same Ctrl-click trick on the layer
mask to see its effect on the sepia toning. If you prefer the stronger
sepia cast that you achieve without the layer mask, simply right-click
on the layer and select Delete Layer Mask.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a56580.0x1f48640"></a>
Vignetting</h2></div></div><p>
Time to add our final effect to make this image really stand out. We'll
add a vignette, a sort of spotlight effect that draws the viewer's
eye to the subject of the photograph by creating a gradual darkening
moving radially away from the main subject. If a vignette is done subtly
and properly, the viewer is not consciously aware of the
manipulation. It is a
technique particularly well suited to portraits.
</p><p>
In the Layers dialog, make sure that the Background layer is selected
and click on the duplicate layer button at the bottom of the dialog.
Double-click on the name Background copy and change it to Vignette.
Right-click on the Vignette layer and add a layer mask with
White (Full Opacity).
</p><p>
In The GIMP toolbox, click on the tiny versions of the black and white
color swatches to restore the default foreground to black. Now
double-click the Blend (Gradient) tool to select it and open the
Tool Options dialog. In the dialog, select Radial as the Gradient type.
Go back to the image window and click down in the center of the area
where you want the center of the vignette spotlight to be, then drag
outward toward a corner and release. In this example, I clicked in the
baby's chin and dragged nearly to the upper-right corner. The only
change you should notice is a radial gradient that appears in the layer
mask icon, as shown in Figure 12.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6750f12.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

Figure 13. Adjusting Levels to Finish the Vignette Effect
</p></div></div><p>
Go back to the Vignette layer in the Layers dialog and click on the
layer icon to select it instead of the layer mask. Now, go to the image
window and bring up the Levels dialog (RC&rarr;Image&rarr;Colors&rarr;Levels). Move
the middle (gray) slider to the right a bit and release it, as shown in
Figure 13. Check the effect in the image window and readjust the slider
until you are satisfied with the effect, then click OK. You can see my
final result in Figure 14; the vignette draws the eye to the baby's face
and adds a pleasing shadowy contrast overall.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6750f14.large.jpg"><img src="6750f14.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 14. The Finished Image with All Effects Applied
</p></div></div><p>
If you need to redraw your gradient to try a different spotlight effect,
simply select the Vignette layer mask icon, click the Blend tool and
try again in the image window; the new gradient replaces the old.
</p><p>
Time to sit back and have some fun evaluating your handiwork. Try
clicking the eye next to the various layers in the layers dialog to
toggle their visibility on and off&mdash;an easy way to preview the
different effects we have discussed. If you like the image better
without one of the effects, delete that layer by selecting it and
clicking the trash can icon.
</p><p>
If you want to do further image editing on the photo, it might be a good
idea to save your work under a new name at this point or duplicate the
image (Ctrl-D) and flatten it (RC&rarr;Layers&rarr;Flatten Image).
</p><p>
It's a good idea to give yourself
a check-pointed result that you can start over with if further edits
go awry. You can experiment with changing the hue and saturation, punch
up the contrast with levels and curves or do any other desired edits
at this point on the flattened version.
</p><p>
I hope I've given you a sense of the power of image layers in this
article. Although a layered approach to image editing requires more
memory resources, it pays off in great flexibility. So, slap some
extra memory in your Linux box and build yourself a layered
antique masterpiece.
