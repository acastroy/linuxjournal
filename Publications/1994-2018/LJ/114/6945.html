Securing Your Network against Kazaa</h1></div><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Chris Lowth</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #114, October 2003</div></div><div><p>
The Kazaa peer-to-peer system is sneaky in getting around
firewalls, but not sneaky enough.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x237a580.0x2472240"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Kazaa is the most popular file-sharing application in use
today. Applications like it are known as peer-to-peer, or P2P, and
allow users to search for and download files from each other.
Kazaa apparently is
used most often for sharing audio files in violation of
copyright law.
</p><p>
Kazaa's proprietary network protocol, known as FastTrack, has been
licensed to the developers of a number of similar
products, including iMesh and Grokster. A
stripped-down version of Kazaa called
KazaaLite also is available. Plenty of other P2P applications exist, but the FastTrack
family is by far the most popular, as well as the most difficult to block
with packet-filtering firewalls, such as Linux's iptables.
</p><p>
Many network managers would like to block P2P
traffic at their firewalls because of its high
bandwidth usage, the security implications of
uncontrolled file exchanges and potential legal
action by copyright holders. This is not as easy
as it might sound. A search on the Internet for information on blocking FastTrack traffic
using iptables yields answers like &ldquo;block port 1214&rdquo;, &ldquo;write a policy
and discipline miscreants&rdquo; or &ldquo;it can't be done&rdquo;. Blocking port 1214
used to work with early versions of FastTrack but doesn't with recent
ones. Something more sophisticated is required. Although some
&ldquo;proxying&rdquo;
firewalls are able to block FastTrack traffic, iptables-based firewalls
have issues that need resolving.
</p><p>
This article introduces a new open-source project called P2Pwall
that develops software for preventing P2P clients on your network
from making contact with peers on the outside. Its ftwall component
blocks FastTrack traffic. More components will be written in due course
to control other P2P protocols, and we invite you to become involved as a developer. The software has been tested with the following FastTrack clients: Kazaa
2.1.1, Kazaa 2.5, KazaaLite 2.0.2, iMesh 4.1 (build 132) and Grokster
1.7.

Firewalls Struggle with FastTrack</h2></div></div><p>
Modern Linux distributions include Netfilter and the iptables
utilities. These components work together to allow Linux systems to be
used as simple but effective firewalls; however, the FastTrack network
protocol presents them with some interesting challenges:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
It doesn't use fixed port numbers.
</p></li><li><p>
It is not limited to conversing with a small number of peers. It
holds a cache of 200 peer addresses and tries to connect to all of
them when it starts. The list changes regularly and is different on
every machine.
</p></li><li><p>
The peer-finding logic is not dependent on a central directory.
</p></li><li><p>
Key parts of the protocol employ strong encryption.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Firewalls traditionally use one of two philosophies. The first is
strict and blocks all ports except specific ones as required. The
second is permissive and asymmetric and allows almost unlimited
outbound connections while blocking almost all inbound ones. With both
of these approaches, the port-agile FastTrack seeks out and exploits
legitimately open ports. It can even exploit port 80. The strict
paradigm plus a port-80 proxy is required to block FastTrack, but
this approach is too restrictive for networks that want to retain a
permissive paradigm while blocking P2P traffic.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x237a580.0x2472a28"></a>
The P2Pwall Project's ftwall Program</h2></div></div><p>
The P2Pwall Project aims to address these issues by providing
a number of tools and documents that enable the filtering of P2P
traffic. The FastTrack filter ftwall is the first
such tool and is available for download under the GPL from <a href="http://p2pwall.sourceforge.net" target="_self">p2pwall.sourceforge.net</a>. ftwall interacts with iptables using the QUEUE target. It analyses
the packets being forwarded through the firewall and decides whether
they should be forwarded or discarded, based on an understanding of the
characteristics of the FastTrack protocol. It tries to prevent any
FastTrack traffic from leaving, and hence entering, the network.
</p><p>
ftwall's role is to block outbound FastTrack connections only on the
assumption that inbound connections are already blocked by iptables
rules. Many firewalls already
use blanket blocks on inbound connections with a limited number of
server connections enabled. However, if a FastTrack client on the inside
connects to a peer on the outside, the outsider can call back in to
the insider over the established connection. So, if we can rely on the
firewall to block inbound connections and on ftwall to block outbound
ones, we have a solution; however, we need to have both bits in place.
</p><p>
Installing and configuring ftwall is a matter of downloading the sources,
compiling them and writing a few iptables rules. A possible complication is that one optional enhancement to the logic
requires the ip_string module to be present in the kernel.
The module currently is
considered experimental and therefore is not included in many
Linux distributions. You probably will have to add it yourself if you want
to use it. See the P2Pwall Web site for more information.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x237a580.0x2472c38"></a>
The iptables QUEUE Target</h2></div></div><p>
When an iptables rule specifies QUEUE as a target, any packets matched by
the rule are put into a queue for collection by an application
such as ftwall. The program can then drop the packet or pass it
back to Netfilter for further checking and forwarding. A typical rule for invoking this mechanism looks like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
iptables -A FORWARD -p tcp -i eth0 -dport 123 \
     -syn -j QUEUE
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x237a580.0x2472d98"></a></h2></div></div><p>
With this rule in place, all SYN packets from the network connected to
eth0 and destined for port 123 on a remote host are passed to the
program first. The program reads the packets and returns its
verdict using the libipq library and ip_queue module.
</p><p>
QUEUE is a standard part of the iptables software delivered with most
popular distributions. To verify that it is available on your system,
type <tt  >insmod ip_queue</tt> and check that no error message
is displayed. For more details, see the Netfilter FAQ at <a href="http://www.netfilter.org/documentation/FAQ/netfilter-faq-4.html" target="_self">www.netfilter.org/documentation/FAQ/netfilter-faq-4.html</a>.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x237a580.0x2472fa8"></a>
How ftwall Works</h2></div></div><p>
In order to explain the workings of ftwall, the description needs to go
hand in hand with a partial explanation of FastTrack's connection logic.
FastTrack connects to peers using three distinct approaches:
a flood of UDP packets, parallel TCP/IP connections
and a more traditional TCP/IP connection pattern. The
software switches between modes if it believes it is being blocked.
ftwall endeavors to keep clients running in the first mode for as long
as possible, because this is the easiest to identify and allows a list
of the peer addresses to be built up.
</p><p>
When a client starts, it sends large numbers of UDP packets through the
firewall that are identifiable by their length and content. Netfilter
queues these for processing by ftwall (Figure 1). Then, ftwall
takes internal notes of the source and destination addresses of the
packets and spoofs a reply to the client, thus preventing it
from concluding that UDP packets are being blocked by the firewall
and keeping it running in the first mode for a little longer.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6945f1.large.jpg"><img src="6945f1.jpg"></a></div><p>
The iptables rule to set up this queuing, assuming eth0 is the home
network interface, is:

<pre     class="programlisting">
iptables -A FORWARD -p udp -i eth0 -j QUEUE
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x237a580.0x24732c0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
When FastTrack receives the spoofed reply, it tries to use UDP
to request some extra setup information and then attempts to make a
TCP/IP connection to the same address. These UDP and TCP packets are
passed to ftwall, which now knows that the destination addresses refer
to FastTrack, and so it drops them (Figure 2). Other UDP non-FastTrack
packets and TCP/IP SYN packets are returned to Netfilter for further
checks and forwarded to their destination.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6945f2.large.jpg"><img src="6945f2.jpg"></a></div><p>
The rule to queue SYNs to ftwall is:

<pre     class="programlisting">
iptables -A FORWARD -p tcp -i eth0 --syn -j QUEUE
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x237a580.0x2473580"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The client repeats this UDP and SYN sequence for a while&mdash;usually (but
not always) until all the addresses it knows about have been attempted
at least once. This means that all these addresses now also are known
to ftwall as ones that should be filtered.
</p><p>
After a while, the client changes tack and switches to the parallel TCP/IP
connection logic with strong data packet encryption. ftwall continues to
block connections to addresses it noted during phase one. For any other
addresses, the only clue that identifies them as FastTrack connections
is the high number of SYN packets seen over a short period. If ftwall
relied solely on the UDP packets to do the blocking, it would be defeated,
particularly if the client hadn't tried all its known addresses in the
first phase. The solution to this problem is a time lock.
</p><p>
In this new mode, the client mixes TCP/IP connection attempts to addresses
that ftwall already knows about with others that haven't yet been revealed
(if there are any). ftwall keeps a note of the time when the most recent
known address was attempted and blocks all TCP/IP connections from
the same source IP address for a configurable time after this. Each SYN packet
sent to a known address resets the timer. Provided these connections
are attempted frequently enough, ftwall continues to block them.
</p><p>
This logic has the side effect that all TCP/IP connections from
a rogue workstation are blocked while FastTrack is running there,
including accesses to Web and FTP sites. It can be argued that
this is acceptable because the user of the workstation is breaking the
organization's policy. Once the client application is closed, the timer
ceases to be refreshed, and TCP/IP connections will be allowed again once
it has expired. This takes two minutes with the default configuration.
</p><p>
After FastTrack has been working in this mode for a while, it appears to
come to the conclusion that the parallel style of connection attempt is
causing a problem, and it switches to its third mode. Now it slows down the rate
of connection attempts and uses the
more traditional approach of trying one address at a time, with a few
seconds of timeout on each one. This new approach frustrates the logic
we have built so far, and the client eventually breaks through. This
can take over an hour to achieve, but clients that don't reveal all
known addresses early on stand a reasonable chance of establishing a
connection during this phase. And once a single connection is established,
a completely new set of addresses is downloaded, and we are no better off
than we would have been if no blocking was employed in the first place.
</p><p>
To defeat this third mode, ftwall needs more information to allow it to
determine whether FastTrack is still in use. One way it can do this is
with a little more spoofing. From time to time, ftwall sends the
client a UDP packet that is a copy of the one that the client itself
uses to open communications with a peer (Figure 3). If the FastTrack
software is running on the workstation, it replies with a packet
that can be recognized easily, thus causing the lock timer to be reset.
The relatively small number and size of these probe packets means
the impact on network usage is minimal.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6945f3.large.jpg"><img src="6945f3.jpg"></a></div><p>
Because this packet is not for forwarding to a public address but
destined for the firewall itself, an iptables rule in the INPUT chain
is required to pass it to ftwall. The rule to use is:

<pre     class="programlisting">
iptables -A INPUT -p udp -i eth0 -j QUEUE
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x237a580.0x24739f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
This keeps the client off-line permanently but is a little inefficient. If
we choose the right time-lock timer, sending these UDP packets when
it is half expired is all that is required to maintain the timer at a
value that keeps the client blocked.
</p><p>
The final piece of the puzzle is a safety net that should not, in theory,
be required. The logic described above depends on a set of recognizable
UDP packets providing ftwall with the information it needs, but we need
to consider what happens if these UDP packets don't arrive&mdash;if the user
has disabled UDP transmission using the workstation's firewall software,
for example. In this case, we have nothing that can be used to determine
the addresses of peers being contacted.
</p><p>
However, we still have one option: inspect all TCP/IP data packets in an attempt to detect the actual
transfer of files. FastTrack's use of encryption is limited to
connection handshaking and searches. The shared files are transferred
using clear-text HTTP, although this is not limited to port 80. The HTTP
request headers include a number of fields that identify the FastTrack
user, protocol and the address of a supernode, a node that provides index
information. If these packets are queued for ftwall's inspection, it identifies
those that look like the beginning of a FastTrack file download. From
the information held in the HTTP headers, ftwall adds the target IP
address and the supernode address to its list of blocked addresses
and adds the client address to the list of those to which the time-lock
logic is applied.

Installation Overview</h2></div></div><p>
The install process for ftwall is described in depth in the INSTALL
file included with the software and on the project Web site, but in
summary, the steps are as follows:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Download sources from <a href="http://P2Pwall.sourceforge.net" target="_self">P2Pwall.sourceforge.net</a> and unzip them.
</p></li><li><p>
Install the libipq library, if it is not already installed. On
some systems, including Red Hat 7.x and 8, this means obtaining the iptables sources and compiling them.
</p></li><li><p>
Compile and install ftwall by running <tt  >make</tt> and
<tt  >make install</tt>.
</p></li><li><p>
Add an entry to the bootloader directory, /etc/rc3.d, to launch
ftwall.
</p></li><li><p>
Verify that the QUEUE mechanism is available, and add it if
not. Most recent Linuxes already have this in place, but it can be added
to those that don't by patching and rebuilding the kernel.
</p></li><li><p>
Create the iptables rules in the INPUT and FORWARD chains.
</p></li><li><p>
If you want to invoke the belt and braces option of inspecting
the HTTP headers of the file downloads in case UDP is blocked on your
network, add the string module to the kernel and
iptables as well. This involves a kernel patch and rebuild.
</p></li><li><p>
Reboot.
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x237a580.0x286c5e8"></a>
Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
With ftwall running on the firewall, FastTrack traffic is blocked from
reaching the Internet. Provided your firewall also blocks inbound
connections,
your network is Kazaa-proof. FastTrack clients in the network still can
talk to each other, but file sharing with external peers is prevented.
</p><p>
This approach has the limitation of being focused solely on FastTrack;
however, the P2Pwall Project aims to extend its reach to address other
P2P protocols in the future. If you want to get involved with
the project in any way, please e-mail me at <a href="mailto:chris@lowth.com">chris@lowth.com</a>.
</p><p>
ftwall works with the FastTrack clients available at the time of
this writing. It is possible the FastTrack protocol will change in future,
in which case ftwall may need to be modified to match.
