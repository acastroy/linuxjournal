Compressing Web Content with mod_gzip and mod_deflate</h1></div><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Stephen Pierzchala</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #114, October 2003</div></div><div><p>
Compressing Web content can produce a
much faster site for users. Here's how to
set it up and measure your success.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10a3580.0x119b240"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Reducing costs is a key consideration for every IT budget. One of the items
looked at most closely is the cost of a company's bandwidth. Using content
compression on a Web site is one way to
reduce both bandwidth needs and cost. With that in mind, this article
examines some of
the compression modules available for Apache, specifically, mod_gzip for Apache 1.3.x and 2.0.x
and mod_deflate for Apache 2.0.x.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10a3580.0x119b348"></a>
Content Compression Basics</h2></div></div><p>
Most compression
algorithms, when applied to a plain-text file, can reduce its size
by 70% or more, depending on the content in the file.
When using compression algorithms, the difference
between standard and maximum compression levels is small, especially when you
consider the extra CPU time necessary to process these extra compression
passes. This is quite important when dynamically compressing Web
content. Most software content compression techniques use a compression
level of 6 (out of 9 levels) to conserve CPU cycles. The file
size difference between level 6 and level 9 is usually so small as to be
not worth the extra time involved.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10a3580.0x119b450"></a>
Compression in HTTP</h2></div></div><p>
For files identified as text/.* MIME types, compression
can be applied to the file prior to placing it on the wire. This
simultaneously reduces the number of bytes transferred and improves
performance. Testing also has shown that Microsoft Office,
StarOffice/OpenOffice and PostScipt files can be GZIP-encoded for
transport by the compression modules.
</p><p>
Some important MIME types that cannot be GZIP encoded are
external JavaScript files, PDF files and image files. The problem with
Javascript files mainly is due to bugs in browser software, as these
files are really text files and overall performance would benefit by
being compressed for transport. PDF and image files already are
compressed, and attempting to compress them again simply makes them
larger and leads to potential rendering issues with browsers.
</p><p>
Prior to sending a compressed file to a client, it is vital that the
server ensures the client receiving the data correctly understands and
renders the
compressed format. Browsers that understand
compressed content send a variation of the following client request
headers:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
<tt  > Accept-encoding: gzip</tt>
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >Accept-encoding: gzip, deflate</tt>
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Current major browsers include some variation of this message with
every request they send. If the server sees the header and
chooses to provide compressed content, it should respond with the
server response header:
</p><pre     class="screen">
Content-encoding: gzip
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10a3580.0x119b978"></a></h2></div></div><p>
This header tells the receiving browser to decompress the
content and parse it as it normally would. Alternatively, content
may be passed to the
appropriate helper application, based on the value of the Content-type header.
</p><p>
The file size benefits of compressing content can be seen easily by
looking at a couple of examples, one an HTML file (Table 1) and the other a
PostScript file (Table 2). Performance improvements are examined later
in this
article.
</p><p>
mod_deflate for Apache versions 2.0.44 and earlier comes with the compression
ratio set for best speed, not best compression. This configuration can
be modified using the tips found at <a href="http://www.webcompression.org/mod_deflate-hack.php" target="_self">www.webcompression.org/mod_deflate-hack.php</a>. Starting with
Apache 2.0.45, a configuration directive is included.

Configuring mod_gzip</h2></div></div><p>
The mod_gzip module is available for both
Apache 1.3.x and Apache 2.0.x.[3], and it can be
compiled into Apache as a dynamic shared object
(DSO) or as a static module. The compilation for a DSO
is simple; from the uncompressed source directory,
perform the following steps as root:
</p><pre     class="screen">
make APXS=/path/to/apxs
make install APXS=/path/to/apxs
/path/to/apachectl graceful
</pre><p>
mod_gzip <span   class="emphasis"><em>must</em></span> be loaded last in the module list, as
Apache 1.3.x processes content in module order, and compression is the
final step performed before data is sent.
mod_gzip installs itself in the httpd.conf file, but it is commented
out.
</p><p>
A basic configuration for mod_gzip in the httpd.conf should include:
</p><pre     class="screen">
mod_gzip_item_include mime ^text/.*
mod_gzip_item_include mime \
    ^application/postscript$
mod_gzip_item_exclude mime \
    ^application/x-javascript$
mod_gzip_item_exclude mime ^image/.*$
mod_gzip_item_exclude file \
    \.(?:exe|t?gz|zip|bz2|sit|rar)$
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10a3580.0x11938b8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
This allows PostScript files to be GZIP-encoded,
while not compressing PDF files. PDF files should not be compressed;
doing so
leads to problems when attempting to display the files in Adobe Acrobat
Reader. To be even more careful, you may want to
exclude PDF files explicitly from being compressed:
</p><pre     class="screen">
mod_gzip_item_eclude mime ^application/pdf$
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10a3580.0x1193a18"></a>
Configuring mod_deflate</h2></div></div><p>
The mod_deflate module for Apache 2.0.x is included with the source for
this server, which makes compiling it into the server rather simple:
</p><pre     class="screen">
./configure --enable-modules=all \
    --enable-mods-shared=all --enable-deflate
make
make install
</pre><p>
With mod_deflate for Apache 2.0.x, the GZIP encoding of documents can be
enabled in one of two ways: explicit exclusion of files by extension or
explicit inclusion of files by MIME type. These methods are specified
in the httpd.conf file. Explicit exclusion looks like:
</p><pre     class="screen">
SetOutputFilter DEFLATE
DeflateFilterNote ratio
SetEnvIfNoCase Request_URI \.(?:gif|jpe?g|png)$ \
    no-gzip dont-vary
SetEnvIfNoCase Request_URI \
    \.(?:exe|t?gz|zip|bz2|sit|rar)$ \
    no-gzip dont-vary
SetEnvIfNoCase Request_URI \.pdf$ no-gzip dont-vary
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10a3580.0x1193c28"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Explicit inclusion looks like:
</p><pre     class="screen">
DeflateFilterNote ratio
AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/*
AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE application/ms* \
    application/vnd* application/postscript
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10a3580.0x1193d88"></a></h2></div></div><p>
In the explicit exclusion method, the same exclusions are present as in the
mod_gzip file, namely images and PDF files.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10a3580.0x1193e90"></a>
Compressing Dynamic Content</h2></div></div><p>
If your site uses dynamic content&mdash;XSSI, CGI and the
like&mdash;nothing special needs to be done to compress the output of these modules.
As mod_gzip and mod_deflate process all outgoing content before it is
placed on the wire, all content from Apache that matches either the
MIME types or the file extensions mapped in the configuration directives
is compressed.
</p><p>
The output from PHP, the most popular dynamic scripting language for
Apache, also can be compressed in one of three possible ways:
using the built-in output handler, ob_gzhandler; using the built-in ZLIB
compression; or using one of the Apache compression modules.
Configuring PHP's built-in compression is simply a matter of compiling
PHP with the --with-zlib configure option and then reconfiguring the
php.ini file.
</p><p>
Below is what the output buffer method looks like:
</p><pre     class="screen">
output_buffering = On
output_handler = ob_gzhandler
zlib.output_compression = Off
</pre><p>
The ZLIB method uses:
</p><pre     class="screen">
output_buffering = Off
output_handler =
zlib.output_compression = On
</pre><p>
The output buffer method produces marginally better compression, but
both methods work. The output buffer, ob_gzhandler, also can be added on
a script-by-script basis, if you do not want to enable compression
across the entire site.
</p><p>
If you do not want to reconfigure PHP with ZLIB enabled, the
Apache compression modules can compress the content generated by PHP. I
have configured my server so that Apache modules handle all of the
compression, and all pages are compressed in a consistent manner,
regardless of their origin.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10a3580.0x1194200"></a>
Caching Compressed Content</h2></div></div><p>
Can compressed content be cached? The answer is an unequivocal yes. With
mod_gzip and mod_deflate, Apache sends the Vary header, indicating
to caches that this object differs from other requests for the same
object based on certain criteria&mdash;user-agent, character set and so on. When
a compressed object is received by a cache, it notes that the server
returned a Vary: Accept-Encoding response. This response indicates it
was generated based on the request containing the
Accept-Encoding: gzip header.
</p><p>
Caching compressed content can lead to a situation where a cache stores two copies of the
same document, one compressed and one uncompressed. This is a design
feature of HTTP 1.1, and it allows clients with and without the ability to
receive compressed content to benefit from the performance
enhancements gained from local proxy caches.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10a3580.0x1194360"></a>
Logging Compression Results</h2></div></div><p>
When considering the logging methods of mod_gzip and mod_deflate, there
really are no comparisons. mod_gzip logging is robust and
configurable and is based on the Apache log format. This allows
mod_gzip logs to be configured for analysis basically any way you
want. The default log formats provided when the module is installed
are shown below:
</p><pre     class="screen">
LogFormat "%h %l %u %t \"%r\" %&gt;s %b mod_gzip: \
    %{mod_gzip_compression_ratio}npct." \
    common_with_mod_gzip_info1
LogFormat "%h %l %u %t \"%r\" %&gt;s %b mod_gzip: \
    %{mod_gzip_result}n In:%{mod_gzip_input_size}n \
    Out:%{mod_gzip_output_size}n \
    Ratio:%{mod_gzip_compression_ratio}npct." \
    common_with_mod_gzip_info2
LogFormat "%{mod_gzip_compression_ratio}npct." \
    mod_gzip_info1
LogFormat "%{mod_gzip_result}n In:%{mod_gzip_input_size}n \
    Out:%{mod_gzip_output_size}n \
    Ratio:%{mod_gzip_compression_ratio}npct." \
    mod_gzip_info2
</pre><p>
Logging allows you to see the file's size prior to and after
compression, as well as the compression ratio. After tweaking the log formats to
meet your specific configuration, they can be added to a logging
system by specifying a CustomLog in the httpd.conf file:
</p><pre     class="screen">
CustomLog logs/gzip.log common_with_mod_gzip_info2
CustomLog logs/gzip.log mod_gzip_info2
</pre><p>
Logging in mod_deflate, on the other hand, is limited to one configuration
directive, DeflateFilterNote, which is added to an
access_log file. Be careful about doing this in your production logs, as
it may cause some log analyzers to have issues when examining your
files. It is best to start out by logging compression ratios to a separate
file:
</p><pre     class="screen">
DeflateFilterNote ratio

LogFormat '"%r" %b (%{ratio}n) "%{User-agent}i"' \
    deflate
CustomLog logs/deflate_log deflate
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10a3580.0x1194620"></a>
Performance Improvements from Compression</h2></div></div><p>
How much improvement can you see with compression? The difference in
measured download times on a lightly loaded server indicates
the time to download the base page (the initial HTML file) improved by
between 1.3 and 1.6 seconds across a slow connection.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6802f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Time Required to Download the HTML Page with and without Compression
</p></div></div><p>
The time for the server to respond to a client
requesting a compressed page is slightly slower. Measurements show that the median response
time for the server averaged 0.23 seconds for the uncompressed page and
0.27 seconds for the compressed page. However, most Web server
administrators should be willing to accept a 0.04 increase in response
time to achieve a 1.5 second improvement in file transfer time.
</p><p>
Web pages are not completely HTML, however. So, how do improved HTML (and CSS)
download times affect overall performance? The graph below shows that
overall download times for the test page were 1&ndash;1.5 seconds better
when the HTML files were compressed.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6802f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Time to Download the Page with Images
</p></div></div><p>
To emphasize the value of compression further, I ran a test on a Web
server to see what the average compression ratio would be when
requesting a large number of files. In addition, I wanted to determine
what the affect on server response time would be when requesting large
numbers of compressed files simultaneously. There were 1,952 HTML files
in the test directory, and I checked the results using cURL across my
local LAN (Tables 3 and 4). The files I used were the top-level HTML files from the Linux Documentation
Project. They were installed on an Apache 1.3.27 server running
mod_gzip. Minimum file size was 80 bytes and maximum file size was 99,419
bytes.
</p><div class="table"><a name="N0x10a3580.0x1194ba0"></a><p class="title"><b>

As expected, the first byte download time was slightly higher with the
compressed files than it was with the uncompressed files. But this
difference was in milliseconds and is hardly worth mentioning in terms
of on-the-fly compression. It is unlikely that any user, especially
dial-up users, would notice this difference in performance.
</p><p>
That the delivered data was transformed to 43% of the original file size
should make any Web administrator sit up and take notice. The compression
ratio for the test files ranged from no compression for files that were
less than 300 bytes to 15% of the original file size for two Linux
SCSI Programming HOWTOs. Compression ratios do not increase in a linear
fashion when compared to file size; rather, compression depends heavily
on the repetition of content within a file to gain its greatest
successes. The SCSI Programming HOWTOs have a great deal of repeated
characters, making them ideal candidates for extreme compression.
</p><p>
Smaller files also did not compress as well as larger files, exactly for
this reason. Fewer bytes means a lower probability of repeated bytes,
resulting in a lower compression ratio.
</p><div class="table"><a name="N0x10a3580.0x14a9a00"></a><p class="title"><b>
Table 5. Average Compression by File Size (in Bytes)</b></p><table     summary="&#10;Table 5.

The data in Table 5 shows that compression works best on files larger than
5,000
bytes. Below that size, average compression gains are smaller, unless a
file has a large number of repeated characters. Some people argue that
compressing files below a certain size wastes CPU cycles.
If you agree with these folks, using the 5,000 byte value as floor value
for compressing files should be a good starting point. I am of the
opposite mindset. I compress everything that comes off my servers
because I consider myself an HTTP over-clocker, trying to squeeze every
last bit of download performance out of the network.
</p><p>
mod_deflate does not have a low-end boundary for file size, so it
attempts to compress files too small to benefit from
compression. This results in files smaller than approximately 120 bytes
becoming larger when processed by mod_deflate.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
With a few simple commands and a little bit of configuration, an Apache
Web server can deliver a large amount of content in a
compressed format. These benefits are not simply limited to static
pages; dynamic pages generated by PHP and to other dynamic content
generators can be compressed by using the Apache compression modules.
When added other performance-tuning mechanisms and appropriate
server-side caching rules, these modules can reduce substantially necessary
bandwidth for a very low cost.
