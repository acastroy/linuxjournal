collection of tools, most created by the author's company, which
range from allowing simple configuration control over the look and
feel of your entire site to remote creation of and updating pages
on the site to shopping carts and simple database facilities. It is
not a book about running and configuring web servers or teaching
the Common Gateway Interface (CGI) protocol.
</p><p>The introductory preface and first chapter address the
motivation behind the book and a few of the benefits of using some
form of automation in maintaining your web site. Next are two
chapters discussing some of the alternatives (and alternative
proprietary software) to the author's CGI-oriented approach to
automation.</p><p>The majority of the tools provided are, in fact, Perl CGI
programs created by the author's company. These tools are
officially free. While the license in the book states that you are
not allowed to redistribute them without permission, you are
allowed to use and install them as many times and for as many
clients as you wish. This seemed a bit contradictory, so I asked
the author for some clarification. He responded with the following
statement (used with permission):</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>I don't do courts, but the intent of the license
is to prevent people from putting our utilities on shareware
CD-ROMs without the supporting text. It's more of a support issue
than an ownership one. I wrote the book because these things were
far too useful to keep to ourselves.</p></blockquote></div><p>Chapters 4 and 5 mark the transition into the main part of
the book by providing a short justification for why Perl is the
language of choice, and a brief introductory overview of Perl
basics. This overview is not intended as a guide to the Perl
programming language, but merely to acquaint the user with some of
the essentials so that later sections on configuring and
customizing Perl scripts will be less daunting to the
inexperienced.
</p><p>The remaining chapters provide a tool-by-tool installation
and instruction manual. There are too many tools to cover them all
with any detail, so I will very quickly run through the remaining
chapters and follow with my general impressions.</p><p>Chapter 6 covers SiteWrapper, a package that wraps your site
so that all of your pages are served by a CGI program. Chapter 7
introduces Tickler, a program for soliciting e-mail addresses of
visitors and notifying them of content changes. Chapter 8 follows
with a discussion of the freely available Majordomo mailing list
software for creating and maintaining mailing lists.</p><p>Chapter 9 addresses tracking visitors with discussions of the
Trakkit tool (requires SiteWrapper) and the freely available
Analogue program. Chapter 10 covers a Shopping Cart package (a
modified SiteWrapper program) along with some order processing
utilities.</p><p>Chapter 11 covers WebPost, the utility which, according to
the author, sparked the book. This system allows you to create,
edit, delete or upload pages to your site and automatically
generate or update the cross links among pages.</p><p>Chapter 12 provides three search utilities for your site,
depending on whether you are using SiteWrapper, WebPost or neither.
Chapter 13 covers the AddaLink tool for creating and maintaining a
hot list of links. Chapter 14 covers QuickDB, a simple text-based
database engine with a browser interface for adding, editing and
deleting entries.</p><p>Chapter 15 presents a Bulletin Board utility, and also
discusses using FrontPage for a Discussion Board. Chapter 16 takes
the next step by covering a couple of freely available Chat
programs.</p><p>Chapter 17 provides a couple of search engine agents, one to
submit a URL to a multitude of search engines and two more which
report your location on the search engines. The final chapter
presents BannerLog and ClickThru, tools which track and log
click-throughs and page views of banner ads on your site.</p><p>I set up a dummy site on my Linux box for installing and
trying out a few of the provided utilities. The installation
instructions in each chapter are divided into UNIX and NT sections
and are relatively simple to follow. However, some unfortunate
problems arose.</p><p>There are .zip files for each package, and non-zipped
directories for each of the packages on the CD-ROM. A mild
inconvenience is that some of the .zip files were created with
extraneous path information included, and the individual files in
the non-zipped directories are riddled with ^M characters. The
author has created a web site where you can find problem reports
and corrections, and &ldquo;cleaner&rdquo; versions of the source files for
downloading. The site is located at
http://www.world-media.com/toolkit/.</p><p>Another inconvenience is that every Perl script must be
checked (and possibly edited) for the proper path to Perl on your
system, there is no script provided to automate this task, although
writing one would be trivial for any experienced Perl programmer.
Note that even if the first script you examine has the proper path,
others definitely will not&mdash;so you must check and edit those with
the incorrect path for your system.</p><p>More serious problems arise with the Perl code. None of the
<span   class="bold"><b>open</b></span> calls for reading and writing
files are consistently checked for success or failure. You'll first
notice a problem when you install the SiteWrapper package and try
to change the color scheme of your site with the included
SiteColors program. The installation guide omits mentioning that
your server will need write access to the tagfile.dat file where
the color scheme is stored. Since the program does not check the
return value of the open call, it will fail silently, your color
scheme will not be updated and no error will be present in your
server's logs. I'd seriously recommend locating all calls to the
open function in all .cgi scripts and adding at least a
<b  >||die&nbsp;"$!";</b> statement to those that don't
have it.</p><p>Other deficiencies with the Perl scripts are that they are
not <b  >-w</b> clean (for warnings), won't compile with
the &ldquo;strict&rdquo; pragma, do not use <b  >-T</b> for taint
checking and use the older cgi.pl library rather than the CGI.pm
module for Perl 5.</p><p>Even with the above comments and concerns, the packages are,
for the most part, easy to install and get working. Installation
and configuration of the basic SiteWrapper package took less than
an hour, including time spent checking and cleaning the source code
and creating simple header and footer files and a couple of dummy
pages. When using this system, every page is served from a CGI
program, even essentially static pages. This method allows for a
great deal of flexibility and a centralized configuration style of
management, but could become costly in terms of server load if your
site is large or heavily trafficked.</p><p>I had a little more trouble getting the WebPost system
running properly, mainly because I chose to set it up in a
subdirectory of the SiteWrapper directory and a few issues were
involved in getting the two packages to play nicely together. Once
it was set up, however, it worked as advertised. While I found
parts of the interface to be a bit clunky for creating web pages,
it is a functional way to create and edit pages remotely using a
browser.</p><p>Other tools were less problematic to install, Trakkit for
example&mdash;I was tracking and logging myself within a few minutes of
unpacking the package.</p><p>On the whole, if you are looking for instant &ldquo;shrink-wrap&rdquo;
automation software with point-and-click setup and configuration,
you'll be disappointed. However, typical Linux users accustomed to
file-based configuration should have little trouble with these
tools, especially if they already have some experience with Perl
programming. The programs are not stellar examples in their present
incarnation, but they can provide an inexpensive automation system
for budding webmasters willing to get their hands dirty with a
little Perl code. Hopefully, many of the concerns mentioned above
will be addressed in a future edition.</p></div></div>
