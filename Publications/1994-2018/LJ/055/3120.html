    If anybody had suggested to me then
    that the paper was going to motivate something like the Netscape
    source release, I would have wondered what they'd been smoking.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27c1580.0x28b93a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>Back in March, Netscape announced their
intention to release the source code of Navigator. Since that time,
we've seen once again that very few things are as powerful as an
idea whose time has come.
</p><p>I'm reminded of this every time I surf the Web. The Open
Source meme is everywhere. It seems you can't open a technical or
business magazine these days without tripping over an admiring
article about Linux&mdash;or an interview with Linus Torvalds&mdash;or an
interview with...er...me.</p><p>Half by accident, I've ended up near the center of all the
crazy and wonderful things now happening. When I composed &ldquo;The
Cathedral and the Bazaar&rdquo; a little over a year ago, I was aiming
to explain the Linux culture to itself and to explore some
interesting and somewhat heterodox ideas about software
development. If anybody had suggested to me then that the paper was
going to motivate something like the Netscape source release, I
would have wondered what they'd been smoking.</p><p>But that's exactly what happened, and I soon found myself in
the role of leading advocate and semi-official
speaker-to-journalists for a hacker community suddenly feeling its
oats. I decided to take that job seriously, because somebody needed
to do it and I knew how and nobody else was really trying very
hard. I had the advantage of experience; I'd been in this role
before, for lesser stakes, after the <span   class="emphasis"><em>New Hacker's
Dictionary</em></span> came out in 1991.</p><p>The point of all this personal stuff is that I've had an
almost uniquely privileged view of the early days of the
open-source revolution&mdash;as an observer, a theorist, a communicator
and an active player in helping shape some of the major
events.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27c1580.0x28b9660"></a>We've come a long way, baby...</h2></div></div><p>In this essay, I intend to do three things. One, celebrate
the incredible victories of the last few months. Two, share my
thinking about the battles being fought right now. And three,
consider where we need to go in the future and what we need to do,
to ensure that open source is not a mere fad but a genuine
transformative revolution that will change the rules of the
software industry forever.</p><p>When you're living on Internet time, it can be hard to
remember last week, let alone last year. Take a moment and think
back to New Year's Day, 1998. Before the Netscape announcement.
Before Corel. Before IBM got behind Apache. Before Oracle and
Informix and Interbase announced they'd be porting their flagship
database projects to Linux. We've come a long way, baby!</p><p>In fact, we've come an astonishingly long way in a short
time. Six months ago, &ldquo;free software&rdquo; was barely a blip on the
radar screens of the computer trade press and the corporate
world&mdash;and what they thought they knew, they didn't like. Today,
&ldquo;Open Source&rdquo; is a hot topic not just in the trade press but in
the most influential of the business newsmagazines that help shape
corporate thinking. The article in <span   class="emphasis"><em>The
Economist</em></span> in July was a milestone; another was the
August issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Forbes</em></span> with an explanation of
the concept as their cover story and a picture of Linus on the
cover.</p><p>The campaign also went after corporate endorsement of
open-source software. We've got it, in spades. IBM&mdash;IBM!&mdash;is in our
corner now. The symbolism and the substance of that fact alone is
astounding. [Apache is the web server shipped with their Web Sphere
product.]</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27c1580.0x28b9920"></a>We haven't shot ourselves in the foot...</h2></div></div><p>The last six months are also notable for some things I had
feared would happen, but did not. Despite initially sharp debate
and continuing objections in some quarters, the hacker community
did not get bogged down in a loud and divisive factional fight over
the new tactics and terminology. Bruce Perens and I and the other
front-line participants in the Open Source campaign did not get
publically savaged for trying to gently lead the community in a new
direction. No one burnt us in effigy for actually
succeeding.</p><p>The maturity and pragmatism with which the community backed
our play made a critical difference. It has meant that the story
stayed positive. We have been able to present open source as the
product of a coherent and effective engineering tradition, one able
to sustain the momentum and meet the challenge of what the
corporate world considers &ldquo;real support&rdquo;. It has denied the
would-be bashers and Gates worshipers among the press the easy
option to dismiss us all as a bunch of fractious flakes.</p><p>We've all done well. We've gotten our message out and we've
kept our own house in order&mdash;and all this while continuing to crank
out key advances that undermine the case for closed software and
increase our leverage, such as Kaffe 1.0. What comes next?</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27c1580.0x28b9ad8"></a>Toward World Domination</h2></div></div><p>I see several challenges before us.</p><p>First: The press campaign isn't over by any means. When I
first conceived it back in February, I already knew where I wanted
to see positive stories about open source: the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Wall
Street Journal</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Economist</em></span>,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Forbes</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Barron</em></span> and the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>New York Times</em></span>.</p><p>Why those? Because if we truly desire world domination, we
must alter the consciousness of the corporate elite. That means we
need to co-opt the media that shape decision-making at the highest
corporate levels of Fortune 500 companies. Personally, all the
press interviews and stuff I've done have been aimed toward the one
goal of becoming visible enough to those guys that they would come
to us wanting to know the Open Source community's story.</p><p>This has begun to happen (besides the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Forbes</em></span> interview, I was a background source
for <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Economist</em></span> coverage)--but it's nowhere
near finished. It won't be finished until they have all gotten and
spread the message, and the superior reliability/quality/cost
advantages of open source have become common knowledge among the
CEOs, CTOs and CIOs who read them.</p><p>Second: When I first wrote my analysis of business models,
one of my conclusions was that we'd have our best short-term
chances of converting established &ldquo;name&rdquo; vendors by pushing the
clear advantages of widget frosting. Therefore, my master plan
included concerted attempts to persuade hardware makers to open up
their software.</p><p>Although my personal approaches to a couple of vendors were
unsuccessful, Mr. Eid Eid's (then president of Corel Computer)
speech at UniForum made it clear that CatB and the Netscape example
had tipped them over the edge. Subsequently, Leonard Zubkoff scored
big working from the inside with Adaptec. So, we know this path can
be fruitful.</p><p>A lot more evangelizing remains to be done. Any of you who
work with vendors of network cards, graphics cards, disk
controllers and other peripherals should be helping us push from
the inside. Write Bruce Perens (bruce@pixar.com) or me
(esr@thyrsus.com) if you think you might be positioned to help;
combination Mister-Inside/Mister-Outside approaches are known to
work well.</p><p>Third: The Interbase/Informix/Oracle announcements and SGI's
official backing for Samba open up another front. Actually, we're
ahead of my projections here; I wasn't expecting the big database
vendors to roll over for another three months or so. That third
front is the ability to get open-source software into large
corporate networks and data centers and in roles outside of its
traditional territory in Internet services and development.</p><p>One of the biggest roadblocks in our way came from people who
said &ldquo;okay, so maybe Linux is technically better, but we can't get
real enterprise applications for it.&rdquo; Well, somehow I don't think
we'll be hearing that song anymore. The big database announcements
should put the &ldquo;no real applications&rdquo; shibboleth permanently to
rest.</p><p>Our next challenge is to actually get some Fortune 500
companies to switch over from NT to Linux or *BSD-based enterprise
servers for their critical corporate databases and to go public
about doing it.</p><p>Getting them to switch shouldn't be very hard, given the
reliability level of NT. Waving a copy of John Kirch's white paper
(http://www.kirch.net/unix-nt.html) at a techie might be
sufficient. In fact, I expect this will begin to happen swiftly
even without any nudging from us.</p><p>However, that is only half the battle. Because the ugly
political reality is this: the techies with day-to-day operational
responsibility who are doing the actual switching are quite likely
to feel pressure to hide the switch from their NT-leaning bosses.
Samba is a huge win for these beleaguered techies; it enables
open-source fans to stealth their Linux boxes so they look like
Microsoft servers that somehow miraculously work well.</p><p>There's a problem with this, however, that's almost serious
enough to make me wish Samba didn't exist. While stealthing
open-source boxes will solve a lot of individual problems, it won't
give us what we need to counteract the attack marketing and
FUD-mongering (fear, uncertainty and doubt) that we'll start seeing
big-time (count on it) as soon as Microsoft wakes up to the
magnitude of the threat we actually pose. It is not enough to have
a presence; we need a visible presence&mdash;visibly succeeding.</p><p>I have a challenge for anyone reading this with a job in a
Fortune 500 data center: start laying the groundwork now. Pass the
Kirch paper around to your colleagues and bosses. Start whatever
process you need to get an Oracle- or Informix- or
Interbase-over-Linux pilot approved&mdash;or get prepared to just go
ahead and do it on the &ldquo;forgiveness is easier than permission&rdquo;
principle. Some of these vendors say they're planning to offer
cheap evaluation copies; grab them and go!</p><p>I and other front-line participants in the Open Source
campaign will be doing our best to smooth your path, while working
the media to help convince your boss that everyone's doing it, and
that it is a safe, soft option that will look good on their
performance report. This, of course, will be a self-fulfilling
prophecy.</p><p>Fourth: Finally, of course, there's the battle for the
desktop&mdash;Linus' original focus in the master plan for world
domination.</p><p>Yes, we still need to take the desktop. The most fundamental
thing we need for that is a zero-administration desktop
environment. Either GNOME or KDE will give us most of that; the
other must-have, for the typical non-techie user, is an absolutely
painless setup of Ethernet, SLIP and PPP connections.</p><p>Beyond that, we need a rock-solid office suite, integrated
with the winning environment, including the &ldquo;Big Three&rdquo;
applications&mdash;spreadsheet, light-duty database and a word
processor. I guess Applixware and StarOffice come close, but
neither are GNOME- or KDE-aware yet. Corel's port of WordPerfect
will certainly help.</p><p>Beyond repeating these obvious things, there's not much else
I'll say about this, because there's little the Open Source
campaign can do to remedy the problem directly. Everyone knows that
native office applications, well-documented and usable by
non-techies, are among the few things we're still missing. Looking
around Sunsite, I'd say there might be a couple of promising
candidates out there, like Maxwell, a WYSIWYG word processor, and
Xxl, a powerful spreadsheet. What they mainly need, I'd guess, is
documentation and testing. Would somebody with technical writing
experience please volunteer?</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27c1580.0x28ba478"></a>We're winning!</h2></div></div><p>Yes, we're winning. We're on a roll. The Linux user base is
doubling every year. The big software vendors are being forced to
take notice by their customers. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Datapro</em></span> even
says Linux gets the best overall satisfaction ratings from managers
and directors of information systems in large organizations. I
guess that means not all of them are pointy-haired bosses.</p><p>The explosive growth of the Internet and the staggering
complexity of modern software development have clearly revealed the
fatal weaknesses of the closed source model. The people who get
paid big bucks to worry about these things for Fortune 500
companies have understood for awhile that something is deeply wrong
with the conventional development process. They've seen the problem
become acute as the complexity of software requirements has
escalated, but they've been unable to imagine any
alternative.</p><p>We are offering an alternative. I believe this is why the
Open Source campaign has been able to make such remarkable progress
in changing the terms of debate over the last few months. It's
because we're moving into a conceptual vacuum with a simple but
powerful demonstration&mdash;that hierarchy, closure and secrecy are
weak, losing strategies in a complex and rapidly changing
environment. The rising complexity of software requirements has
reached a level such that only open source and peer review have any
hope of being effective tactics in the future.</p><p>The article in <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Economist</em></span> was titled
&ldquo;Revenge of the Hackers&rdquo;, and that's appropriate&mdash;because we are
now remaking the software industry in the image of the hacker
culture. We are proving every day that we are the people with the
drive and vision to lead the software industry into the next
century.</p></div></div>
