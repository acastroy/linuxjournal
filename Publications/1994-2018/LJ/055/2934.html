        A look at how one company is moving ahead by using Linux to provide Internet services to its clients.
      </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2aa3580.0x2b9b450"></a></h2></div></div><p>When you call an 800 number to complain
about a dead bug in your cereal or to ask why your new modem
doesn't work on your old 486, chances are you're not talking
directly to the manufacturer of the product. As companies
throughout the '80s and '90s have continued to shed those business
functions not considered core strengths, the vertical market of
call-center outsourcing has grown rapidly. Ruppman Marketing
Technologies in Peoria, Illinois is one of the pioneers in this
industry, having answered telephone calls for client firms for 26
years. As the Internet's expansion into mainstream usage has become
impossible to ignore, it look to expand its market to customer
service over the Internet.</p><p>I was hired in April 1997 to oversee this new territory.
Ruppman (&ldquo;Rules for Writers&rdquo;) as well as many of its competitors
had made vague and hesitant steps toward answering e-mail inquiries
from web sites and sending brochures requested through web forms,
but our CEO entrusted me with leap-frogging such timid steps and
positioning Ruppman for the inevitable time when people would more
likely check a web site for answers than call an 800 number.</p><p>I came in with a hobbyist Linux background, and it was
immediately clear to me that the development budget was limited and
a broad range of technologies was available to deploy in a finite
amount of time. Linux was the only solution with the flexibility
and price to achieve our goals.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2aa3580.0x2b9b608"></a>Injecting Advanced Technology</h2></div></div><p>Ruppman had advanced infrastructure in its traditional areas
of phone switches and routing, but had evolved its data
infrastructure rather haphazardly. The company had a hodge-podge of
Internet access methods, including:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Dial-up Compuserve and AOL</p></li><li><p>A UUCP e-mail exchange with a local ISP</p></li><li><p>A leased 256KB on a small Microsoft Exchange server
from another ISP</p></li></ul></div><p>Indeed, there was a growing number of Microsoft Exchange
users in the absence of an official e-mail client standard.
</p><p>First, we ordered and set up a Dell Poweredge 2200 (Pentium
II, 200MHz, 64MB RAM) with Caldera OpenLinux to be our e-mail
post-office (using Sendmail) and primary domain name server (using
BIND). We finalized a deal to install a firewall from AT&amp;T.
Now, we had a unified Internet gateway, and could shut off all the
other expensive or insecure conduits, thus removing the need for
modems in the offices (see Figure 1). This also allowed us to take
full advantage of our registered ruppman.com domain name,
standardizing our e-mail addresses to the format
<span   class="emphasis"><em>firstname.lastname</em></span>@ruppman.com.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2934f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

Figure 1. Ruppman's Internet connectivity before (top half)
and after (bottom half).
</p></div></div><p>Using Sendmail also allowed us to implement a common client
requirement. When Ruppman handles customer e-mail, clients want it
to appear as if they are handling the e-mail themselves. For this
reason, it is unsuitable for Widget Inc. to point its customers to
widget@ruppman.com. They would rather use
customerservice@widget.com. This is easy enough for incoming mail,
but we have to mask outgoing mail from Ruppman representatives to
Widget's customers. This was done by, among other things, adding
the rule in <a href="2934l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a> to an mc
configuration file for Sendmail, then compiling the mc file with m4
and installing it as /etc/sendmail.cf. (See the Mail HOWTO for
information on customizing Sendmail rules.)</p><p>Clients also wanted such features as auto-replies to e-mail
queries and selected audit copies of outgoing mail. Also, many
clients' volume required more than one representative, using either
subject-based routing or a shared mailbox. Microsoft Exchange could
handle some of these functions, but we needed more flexibility and
were concerned about standards compliance. The client mailboxes
were all set up as IMAP mailboxes on a Linux server, which gives us
the following advantages:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>All incoming mail is delivered through a procmail
recipe which allows us to send courtesy responses, keep detailed
records and set up mail routing of any complexity.</p></li><li><p>Outgoing mail was sent as a blind copy (bcc) to a
special account, <span   class="emphasis"><em>audit</em></span>, which runs a Python
script to select a random subset of outgoing messages to forward to
client contacts.</p></li><li><p>Since IMAP allows all messages to be stored on the
server, it makes shared mailboxes easy to access and manage.</p></li></ul></div><p>The e-mail representatives use Netscape Communicator as an
IMAP client, but because of bugs in its IMAP client interface, we
are evaluating alternatives.
</p><p>Our new Internet architecture has the additional advantage
that we have a way to allocate Internet access costs to departments
according to usage. We implemented a Python script on the main
Linux server to parse the firewall logs collected by syslogd and
produce a report of bytes used per department.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2aa3580.0x2b9c0b0"></a>Sharing Information</h2></div></div><p>Building an Intranet soon became our next initiative. We
installed the Apache WWW server and the Samba Netbios server on the
same Dell Linux server. Samba was used to export Linux directories
as public shares from the largely Windows 95 user base, or as
password-protected private shares for Internet Services, our
department. Other departments started attaching data to our
Intranet at an amazing rate. Clearly, this simple but powerful
technology had filled a big need for information-sharing tools.
Both Apache and Samba functions are heavily used throughout the
company and have held up quite well. In fact, although we have
since off-loaded some functions to other servers, for several
months one Pentium Pro-based server running Linux ran mail, DNS,
central logging, IMAP, SMB and WWW for over 1000 users with little
or no downtime.</p><p>We used native Linux tools such as the DBM database and
Python utilities such as the calendar suite to add useful content
to the Intranet as well. We publish a phone list, which is
frequently updated, and a list of Ruppman clients. We keep a
calendar of Internet Services activities and schedules on the
Intranet and access to a database of people with proxy access to
the Internet.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2aa3580.0x2b9c210"></a>Development</h2></div></div><p>These systems quickly brought Ruppman to a point of basic
Internet competence, but far more was required. Preparing for the
future of customer service on the Internet involved quite a bit of
application development, so a team was assembled in my group for
this purpose.</p><p>The development team began using a combination of C, C++ and
shell scripts, but we quickly settled on Python as our overall
development language. Our lead software engineer and I had used C++
as the cornerstone of our previous careers, but we soon came to
admire Python's expressive power, comprehensive library and clean
syntax. We purchased a Compaq ProLiant 2500 (Pentium II, 300MHz,
64MB RAM) as a development server and failover backup. We
anticipated running SCO UNIX on it, but being used to the broad
toolset that comes with Linux distributions, we found SCO UNIX to
be woefully inadequate in comparison. Efforts to compile or install
our favorite tools proved so cumbersome that we quickly abandoned
SCO for Caldera OpenLinux. Unfortunately, we then found that Compaq
servers are not well-suited for Linux. Compaq adds many proprietary
features for its ManageWise server management suite and has not
ported the &ldquo;agents&rdquo; for these features to Linux, so much of the
machine's design has to be bypassed in order to run Linux. Perhaps
for this reason, this machine has proved rather slow running Linux,
and we are in the process of replacing it with a Dell Poweredge
4200 (Dual Pentium II, 300MHz, 64MB RAM).</p><p>The first major development task was to create an Internet
dealer locator. This popular web site feature is an application
that allows the customer to enter his or her address or zip code,
and receive a list of nearby dealers or service centers. Ruppman
already had such an application running on a mainframe for
telephone representatives, but Internet Services decided to build a
locator from scratch using an object-relational database and a
geographic-matching (geo-matching) module. We chose PostgresSQL as
the database, because it is object-relational and supports spatial
relationships (r-trees). It also has a native Python interface,
PyGres. The resultant application is heavily disk-I/O bound, and we
ended up buying a Sun Ultra Enterprise (Dual UltraSPARC2, 250MHz,
128MB RAM) for its high-bandwidth backplane and its hardware
scalability. I have since come to learn more about comparable
Linux-based setups on Alpha and even Sun boxes.</p><p>Another product developed in my group is a Usenet and web
monitoring service, where we search Usenet and the WWW on behalf of
clients for consumer discussion of their company or product. First,
we clip articles according to a search engine, then our
representatives check the clips for relevance. We set up a Linux
server and installed NNTP on it, so that /var/spool/news can be
searched with a Python script that invokes a recursive
<span   class="bold"><b>grep</b></span>. Hits are then accumulated in
a file which is combed by a representative using a custom web
interface.</p><p>Many of the powerful web-based applications that were
developed so rapidly and at such low cost by my group at Ruppman
quickly caught the attention of other departments. Accounting had
been trying to implement technology to automatically track employee
labor, and had been burned by their experience with an expensive
and unsuitable vendor product. They asked us if we could implement
a solution. We quickly put together a system that kept increments
of time and the codes identifying tasks in a PostgresSql database
on a Linux server. Employees can enter their hours through a web
interface driven by Javascript and Python CGI, hosted on the Linux
Intranet web server (see Figure 2). They can also view the results
in a familiar time-sheet format. Supervisors can then review and
approve the entries. Once a week, a
<span   class="bold"><b>cron</b></span> job computes overtime and
sends a report of the approved records to accounting, where they
are imported into the JD Edwards accounting software.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2934f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div><p>Managing all of these projects and moving them from
development server to production soon became a confusing task.
Since most of our projects were web-based, we had to move HTML
files to the correct HTTPD document directories on the correct
servers, CGI executable files had to be specially handled, and we
had to maintain libraries of common Python modules. We adopted CVS
for revision control, but we couldn't find a general utility to
manage even most of our needs, so we wrote a custom tool in Python
and Javascript (see Figure 3). The development manager, as we call
it, reads a configuration file on the development server which
keeps a list of projects, source files and destination locations
for publication. It then allows the user to view projects, publish
files from the projects, and interface to version control.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2934f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2aa3580.0x2b9c8f0"></a>Keeping Current</h2></div></div><p>Keeping daemons and applications up to date on a production
server is an important part of security and standards adherence.
The widespread availability of Linux news and resources has helped
us greatly in this regard. We often found when working with other
departments that servers based on other operating systems tended to
suffer from version lag. Some NT servers were not patched to
protect against the rampant teardrop denial-of-service attack, and
we found that a mission-critical HP 9000 box was running daemons
from 1994, including Sendmail, which is often a hacker target. Most
of the time, the reason for the lag was that updates are not easy
to keep track of or even apply for such environments as NT and
HP-UX. To some extent it is a matter of system administrator
vigilance, but the Linux community makes it exceptionally easy to
stay responsible.</p><p>However, we recently decided that keeping up the aging RPM
set from Caldera OpenLinux 1.1 files was becoming an excessive
chore. Our tests had shown some advantages to the features of the
GNU glibc library, so we upgraded all of our Linux machines to Red
Hat 5.0. Besides problems with Disk Druid and the strange fact that
the install doesn't set up the /etc/hosts and in.ftpd files
properly, we've been very satisfied with the new distribution. The
disadvantage is that we lose the benefit of Caldera's Novell
Directory Services client, just as the rest of our organization is
migrating to Novell Intranetware.</p><p>In all, Ruppman has proven a remarkable test case for the
suitability of Linux in real business applications. The exceptional
robustness of Linux has enabled us to maintain a high service level
within our group, and its flexibility and broad toolset have
enabled us to quickly solve a wide variety of problems that would
require a lengthy research and a significant investment under other
platforms. The most common reservation about Linux from IT types
involves technical support, but in almost a year, we have never had
to call Caldera or Red Hat. We solved almost every one of our
problems with a query on http://www.dejanews.com/, an excellent
Usenet archive and search engine. While I have been very lucky to
receive little management interference with my technology choices,
I am convinced that if Linux advocates can sneak our favorite OS
into a moderately visible application, its low cost and high
performance will begin breaking down barriers to its acceptance. I
hope my experiences at Ruppman provide some inspiration in that
direction.</p></div></div>
