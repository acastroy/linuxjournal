    I like the product, and seeing it available for free on my favorite
    operating
    system was like having Christmas in July.
    </p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3110f1.jpg"></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b3a580.0x1c32500"></a></h2></div></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Manufacturer: Informix</p></li><li><p>URL: http://www.informix.com/</p></li><li><p>Price: Free</p></li><li><p>Reviewer: Fred Butzen</p></li></ul></div><p>On Thursday, July 23, 1998, Linux took a stride closer to the
business mainstream. Informix, in response to a groundswell of
demand among its users, released its port of Informix to Linux.
</p><p>For me personally, this was an important development. I have
worked with Informix for over 15 years, and first used it on an
Altos 586 under Xenix. I like the product, and seeing it available
for free on my favorite operating system was like having Christmas
in July.</p><p>What follows are my first impressions of Informix on
Linux.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b3a580.0x1c329d0"></a>Informix Release Under Linux</h2></div></div><p>The Informix release consists of the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The Informix Standard Engine is Informix's older
technology, which uses the file system to manage data. The Standard
Engine is adequate for development work and for managing small- to
mid-sized databases. It does not require the resources or
management that Informix Online does, but it is not robust enough
for enterprise-level work.</p></li><li><p>Informix Connect is a set of libraries which manage
connections to the database over a network.</p></li><li><p>Informix ESQL/C is a kit of libraries, header
files, and utilities that let you write C programs that interact
with the Informix engine.</p></li></ul></div><p>To download the package, you must register with Informix
first. Informix then e-mails you a serial number and key required
for installing the package. The package is free; however, you must
still pay for technical support and for runtime licenses to run the
bits you develop on customers' machines.
</p><p>Most significantly, the package does not include ODBC or JDBC
drivers. However, Informix CLI includes a Visigenic ODBC driver as
part of its development kit. To register to download this
development kit, check out
http://www.intraware.com/shop/product.html?PLNK=000111. No Linux
version is available yet, but kits are now available for Win95, NT
and various other flavors of UNIX.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b3a580.0x1c32df0"></a>First Impressions</h2></div></div><p>Installation and configuration was straightforward, since I'm
familiar with Informix. (See the sidebar &ldquo;Informix Installation
and Configuration&rdquo; for details.)</p><p>Informix offers an SQL engine that is fully compliant with
SQL-2 standards. It also offers a stored-procedure language (a
rather poor one, in my opinion) and triggers.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b3a580.0x1c32f50"></a>Test Environment</h2></div></div><p>I tested Informix on Red Hat 5.0, using the 2.0.29 kernel on
a home-brew machine, running a 100 MHz 486 with a 2GB SCSI disk and
32MB of RAM.</p><p>A reliable source has tested Informix with Debian 2.0 and its
libc5 development package, and reports that Informix works fine on
the simple tests to which he subjected it.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b3a580.0x1c330b0"></a>Testing</h2></div></div><p>To test Informix, I ran the programs with my
<span   class="bold"><b>baseball</b></span> database that I prepared
for the book <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Linux Database</em></span>. This set
exercises common features of SQL, both in interpreted SQL and in
SQL/C.</p><p>I found that Informix performs as one expects a major
commercial package to perform&mdash;without error. I could not get it to
crash, return erroneous data or otherwise mess up. On these fairly
limited exercises, I found its speed to be more than
acceptable.</p><p>One problem, however, is that as I exercised Informix, I
found that the SQL daemon <span   class="bold"><b>sqlexecd</b></span>
spawned dozens of zombie processes. Clearly, work remains to be
done.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b3a580.0x1c33370"></a>Pluses and Minuses</h2></div></div><p>Informix on Linux offers a number of pluses to anyone who
develops database applications under Linux:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The main plus, of course, is name recognition: It
is well-known and has credibility among potential customers that
other packages, such as Yard or mysql, do not. This may not be
fair, but it is nonetheless true.</p></li><li><p>Informix is a full, robust implementation of SQL-2.
Even the best freeware packages have limitations in their
implementation of SQL that require workarounds.</p></li></ul></div><p>However, Informix has some serious drawbacks as well:
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The package offered is Informix's trailing-edge
technology. It does not offer the Online engine, data blades or
Informix's other enterprise-scale tools. Informix's standard-engine
product is a good, solid package, but it is not where the action
is.</p></li><li><p>The only interface language offered so far is C. If
you wish to build web interfaces with Perl, this package will not
help you (although there may be a third-party package available
that includes a Perl interface to Informix).</p></li><li><p>Documentation is particularly helpful in getting
Informix up and running. However, it is hard to come by&mdash;you must
either purchase documentation, which is expensive, or download and
print it, which is also expensive.</p></li><li><p>Your customers still have to purchase a runtime
license for Informix, which can be quite expensive. When you add in
the cost of connectivity tools (ODBC, et al.), a customer can
easily spend thousands of dollars per installation.</p></li></ul></div>

In conclusion, my first impression is that Informix on Linux is a
solid, useful package. It is not clear just how many opportunities
it will open up for Linux database developers. However, Informix's
port to Linux raises Linux's reputation among people who have
power&mdash;always a reason to celebrate.
