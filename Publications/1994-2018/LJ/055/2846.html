    Mr. Konchady presents some of the benefits of using Java
    over CGI as well as the basics of managing a departmental
    database with Java.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e4d580.0x1f453f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>In 1996, Sun released a version of the
Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) kit. This package allowed
programmers to use Java to connect, query and update a database
using the Structured Query Language (SQL). The use of Java with
JDBC has advantages over other database programming environments.
Programs developed with Java and JDBC are platform and vendor
independent, i.e., the same Java program can run on a PC, a
workstation, or a network computer. Also, the database can be
transferred from one database server to another and the same Java
programs can be used without alteration. This article discusses how
JDBC can be used with the MySQL database. (See &ldquo;At the Forge&rdquo; by
Reuven Lerner in the September, October and November 1997 issues of
<i  >LJ</i>.)
</p><p>A number of technologies have been developed for databases,
such as transaction processing, triggers and indexes, which are
supported by JDBC. However, these topics are beyond the scope of
this article. Since the JDBC package is relatively new, the tools
that database developers expect, such as report generators, query
builders and form designers are available. In the near future, more
tools should be available. Despite the lack of tools, it is
possible to develop highly interactive web pages using the JDBC API
without much complexity.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e4d580.0x1f455b0"></a>Design</h2></div></div><p>The idea behind JDBC is similar to Microsoft's Open Database
Connectivity (ODBC). Both ODBC and JDBC are based on the X/Open
standard for database connectivity. Programs written using the JDBC
API communicate with a JDBC driver manager, which uses the current
driver loaded.</p><p>Two architectures can be used to communicate with the
database (see Figure 1). In the first one, the JDBC driver
communicates directly with the database. The driver connects to the
database and SQL statements on behalf of the Java program. Results
are sent back from the driver to the driver manager and finally to
the application.</p><p>In the other, the JDBC driver communicates with an ODBC
driver via a &ldquo;bridge&rdquo;. A single JDBC driver can communicate with
multiple ODBC drivers. Each of the ODBC drivers execute SQL
statements for specific databases. The results are sent back up the
chain as before.</p><p><a href="2846f1.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 1.
Database Communication Architecture</b></span></a></p><p>The JDBC/ODBC bridge was developed to take advantage of the
large number of ODBC-enabled data sources. The bridge converts JDBC
calls to ODBC calls and passes them to the appropriate driver for
the backend database. The advantage of this scheme is that
applications can access data from multiple vendors. However, the
performance of a JDBC/ODBC bridge is slower than a JDBC driver
alone would be, due to the added overhead. A database call must be
translated from JDBC to ODBC to a native API.</p><p><a href="2846f2.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 2.
Accessing a Database from an Applet</b></span></a></p><p>Fewer operations are required to use a JDBC driver without a
bridge. In Figure 2, the steps to access a database using a JDBC
driver from an applet are shown. The Gwe JDBC driver is used with
the MySQL database. The JDBC driver classes are first downloaded
from the Gwe host site. Next, the applet logic passes a JDBC call
to a driver manager which in turns passes the call to a JDBC
driver. The JDBC driver opens a TCP/IP connection with the MySQL
database server. Data is transferred back and forth via the
connection. When database processing is complete, the connection is
closed.</p><p>The JDBC API can be used in applets and stand-alone
applications. In addition to the usual restrictions for applets,
only connections from the same server from which the applet was
downloaded are accepted. If the web server and database server are
not on the same machine, the web server must run a proxy service to
route the database traffic. Stand-alone applications can give
access to local information and remote servers.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e4d580.0x1f45a80"></a>Installation</h2></div></div><p>Installation of the JDBC driver for the MySQL database is
simple. The software can be downloaded from Gwe Technologies at
http://www.gwe.co.uk/. The copyright statement allows the
redistribution of source and binary, but is not identical to the
GNU license. Download the file, exgweMysqlJDBC.0.9.2-src.tar.gz. It
contains the source and class files for the Gwe MySQL JDBC
driver.</p><p>The use of JDBC requires access to java.sql classes which
were not available in the pre-1.1 Java Development Kit. These
classes have been renamed and included in the /exjava directory.
Another directory, /exgwe, contains the source and classes for the
Gwe MySQL JDBC driver. These classes make use of the classes in the
exjava directory. Add the directory in which the tar file was
unpacked to the CLASSPATH environment variable, and installation of
the JDBC driver is complete.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e4d580.0x1f45be0"></a>A Sample JDBC Program</h2></div></div><p>This example, shown in <a href="2846l1.html" target="_self">Listing
1</a>, assumes you have some familiarity with Java. The Java
code loads the JDBC driver class, establishes a connection with a
database, builds an SQL statement, submits the statement and
retrieves the results. A database and a table populated with some
data must exist.</p><p>In the first executable line, the class object for the JDBC
driver is loaded by passing its fully qualified name to the
<span   class="bold"><b>Class.forName</b></span> method. This method
loads the class, if it is not already loaded, and returns a Class
object for it. In the next line, the database URL string is
constructed in the form
<b  >jdbc:<i><tt>subprotocol_name</tt></i>:
hostname:<i><tt>port</tt></i>/<i><tt>database_name</tt></i>/<i><tt>other
parameters</tt></i></b>. The subprotocol name is
<b  >mysql</b>, since we are using the MySQL database.
The host name is <b  >localhost</b> in this example, but
can also be an Internet host name or IP address. The port number
for the MySQL server is <b  >3306</b> and the name of the
database is <b  >test</b>. Other parameters can be passed
in the database URL, such as user ID and password.</p><p>A connection object is obtained via a call to the
<span   class="bold"><b>getConnection</b></span> method of the driver
manager, allowing use of the JDBC driver to manage queries. The
user ID and password are in clear text in the file. The password is
encrypted by the JDBC driver before passing the information to the
MySQL server. A statement object is required to issue a query. The
statement object is obtained by calling the
<span   class="bold"><b>createStatement</b></span> method of the
connection object.</p><p>The SQL query is stored in a string and passed to the
<span   class="bold"><b>executeQuery</b></span> method of the
statement object, which returns a <b  >ResultSet</b>
object containing the results of the query. The
<span   class="bold"><b>next</b></span> method of the
<b  >resultSet</b> object moves the current row forward
by one. It returns false after the last row. This method must be
called to advance to the first row, and can be called in a loop to
retrieve data from all matching rows. The
<b  >resultSet</b> object contains a number of methods to
extract data from a row. For example, to retrieve a string, the
<span   class="bold"><b>getString</b></span> method is used.
Similarly, to retrieve an integer, the
<span   class="bold"><b>getInt</b></span> method is used. Other
methods to retrieve a byte, short, long, float, double boolean,
date, time and a blob are included. The
<span   class="bold"><b>getBytes</b></span> method can be used to
retrieve a binary large object (blob). The parameter to these
methods is either an integer or a string. The integer is the column
number of the row retrieved. Not all columns of a table need to be
retrieved. The string is the name of the column label.</p><p>Once data has been extracted from the
<b  >resultSet</b> object, it is closed. Another SQL
query can be issued and the <b  >resultSet</b> object can
be reused. The statement object can also be reused. The statement
and connection objects are closed when database retrieval is
complete. This simple example illustrates the process of retrieving
data from a database table. It is also possible to update tables
and obtain information about tables. When updating tables, the
<span   class="bold"><b>executeUpdate</b></span> method of the
statement object is used. For example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
String query = "update test_table set phone =
        999-9999 ";
query += "where name = \"John Smith\"";
stmt.executeUpdate( query );
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e4d580.0x1f466e0"></a>Database Metadata</h2></div></div><p>JDBC can be used to obtain information about the structure of
a database and its tables. For example, you can get a list of
tables in a particular database and the column names for any table.
This information is useful when programming for any database. The
structure of a database may not be known to the programmer, but it
can be obtained by using metadata statements&mdash;SQL statements used
to describe the database and its parts.</p><p>Two types of metadata can be retrieved with JDBC. The first
type describes the database and the second type describes a result
set. The <b  >DatabaseMetaData</b> class contains over a
hundred methods to inquire about the database, some of which are
quite exotic. A common method is the
<span   class="bold"><b>getTables</b></span> method.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
DatabaseMetaData dmd = con.getMetaData();
ResultSet rs = dmd.getTables( null, null, null,
        new String[] {"TABLE"} );
</pre><p>The parameters passed to getTables are, in order, a catalog
(group of related schemas), a schema (group of related tables)
pattern, a table name pattern and a type array. Some of the types
include table, view and system table. If <b  >null</b> is
passed, no pattern is used to limit the metadata information
retrieved. Some of the other methods include
<span   class="bold"><b>getDataProductVersion</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>getTablePrivileges</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>getDriverName</b></span>. The result set
<b  >rs</b> contains information about all the tables in
the database. Each row contains information about a table. For
example, the third column of any row of the result set is the table
name string.
</p><p>Useful metadata can be obtained about a result set after the
execution of a query. When a result set is obtained after the
execution of a query, the metadata statements can be used to
extract information such as the number of columns, column types and
width.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery("Select * from test_table");
ResultSetMetaData rsmd = rs.getMetaData();
</pre><p>The <span   class="bold"><b>rsmd.getColumnCount()</b></span>
method returns the number of columns in the test_table and the
<span   class="bold"><b>rsmd.getColumnLabel(i)</b></span> method
returns the name of the <span   class="emphasis"><em>i</em></span>th column. Similarly,
the <span   class="bold"><b>rsmd.getColumnDisplaySize(i)</b></span>
method returns the width of the <span   class="emphasis"><em>i</em></span>th column. A
number of other methods described in the JDBC API can be used to
extract all types of information about a table.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e4d580.0x1f3d6a8"></a>Example</h2></div></div><p>At Mitre, we collect information from the Internet using
commercial search engines such as Altavista and Lycos for a variety
of topics. This information is stored as a collection of text
documents for any topic and can be searched via keywords. We use
the public-domain search engine Glimpse from the University of
Arizona to index and search the document collection.</p><p>Some of the document collections can be fairly large (over
1500 documents). If a common keyword is entered, the list of
matching documents will be large. We display the results from the
search engine using Java and JDBC to avoid scanning long lists of
matching documents. Java was used to build a 3-D space and plot
circles at locations representing the frequency of the occurrences
of keywords in a document. JDBC was used to retrieve the titles of
the documents stored in a table. Passing all the titles of all
documents in the collection as parameters to the Java applet would
significantly increase the time to load the applet.</p><p><a href="2846f3.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 3.
Documents Represented as Circles in 3-D
Space</b></span></a></p><p>Glimpse returns the frequency of occurrence of a keyword in a
document. We use that number to locate a circle representing the
document in 3-D space (see Figure 3). Each axis represents a
keyword. If fewer than three keywords are entered, documents will
be displayed in a plane or on a line. If more than three keywords
are entered, three or fewer keywords must be chosen in order to
display matching documents.</p><p>The frequency of occurrence of keywords is normalized for
each axis, and the frequencies of keywords in documents are passed
as parameters to the applet. The color of the circle was computed
based on the position of the circle in the three axes. Red is used
for documents on the z-axis, green for documents on the y-axis and
blue for documents on the x-axis. Brighter shades of the three
primary colors are used for documents with higher keyword
frequencies. A mix of the primary colors is used for circles which
contain more than one keyword.</p><p>JDBC is used to retrieve the titles for documents containing
non-zero occurrences of the keywords. This number is usually fewer
than the total number of documents when a fairly unique keyword is
used. When the mouse is located over the document, a window is
displayed with the document's title. Sometimes, more than one
document can have the same frequency of occurrence of a keyword. In
such cases, the window displays multiple titles of documents. The
color of the circle changes to white to indicate the document where
the mouse is located. An option to click on a box in the window is
provided and will retrieve the text corresponding to the document
in a separate window.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e4d580.0x1f3da18"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>This article has described the basics of working with JDBC
under Linux: the design of JDBC, the installation of JDBC for MySQL
and example code to retrieve/store data. Metadata statements can be
used to interrogate the structure of a database and its tables.
Finally, we looked at an example using a search engine with JDBC
and Java. Viewing the results from a Java applet made the user's
task more interesting than it would have been through a CGI
program.</p><p>The listing referred to in this article is available by
