projects operating within the Linux community, and you will find
SGML. The Linux Documentation Project, the Debian Documentation
Project and others are using SGML as the primary tool in producing
consistently structured and styled documentation. The search for a
more sophisticated replacement for HTML has led to the development
of XML, which is based heavily on SGML. XML has nearly all of the
power and features of SGML, but will probably be much better
supported because of the web-driven market for browsers and
editors. For this reason, XML will probably replace SGML in many
applications.
</p><p>SGML and XML both provide a means of describing the structure
of a document. SGML and XML rely on definitions called DTDs,
Document Type Definitions, that describe document structure.</p><p>In this book, David Megginson competently explains the
process of good quality DTD design. While the title suggests it is
XML-specific, it is not. SGML and XML have so many similarities
that it is possible to describe both simultaneously, highlighting
differences between the two where they arise. This book is another
in the Charles F. Goldfarb series, and in it, Mr. Megginson
describes document structuring using both SGML and XML, managing to
avoid confusing the reader during the process. The book has four
main parts, and includes a CD-ROM with software that implements XML
parsers, and a selection of modern and popular DTDs.</p><p>Part One provides some background on XML, describes how it is
different from SGML and examines five popular and useful DTDs. This
chapter isn't for people with no prior SGML or XML experience and
isn't designed to teach you either, but if you are familiar with at
least one of them, it will assist you in learning about the other.
The chapter on DTD syntax clearly illustrates the differences and
similarities between the two. DTDs examined in detail are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>ISO-12083</p></li><li><p>DocBook</p></li><li><p>Text-Encoding Initiative (TEI)</p></li><li><p>MIL-STD-38784 (CALS)</p></li><li><p>HyperText Markup Language (HTML 4.0)</p></li></ul></div><p>The first four of these are in common use and have inspired
many other DTD designs. The CALS table design, for example, has
been borrowed many times and used in other DTDs.
</p><p>Part Two covers the principles of DTD analysis. The core
material of the book begins in these chapters. They describe how to
critically analyse a DTD from three important perspectives: ease of
learning, ease of use and ease of processing. The ease with which a
particular DTD can be learned is critically important in having a
DTD accepted by authors. If the DTD is difficult to learn, authors
will tend not to use it, use only a small subset of it, or worse,
misuse it by bending it to suit their needs. Mr. Megginson
describes how to analyse the ease of learning of a DTD with the aim
of instructing you how to design easy-to-learn DTDs.</p><p>The chapter entitled &ldquo;Ease of Use&rdquo; describes how to analyse
a DTD to determine if it will be easy for authors to use when they
are writing their documentation. Some of the issues explored are
the naming of tags and attributes, when to use a new tag and when
to add an attribute to an existing tag, and structural issues that
can simplify or complicate an author's job.</p><p>The chapter on ease of processing is of particular interest
to those who publish and develop processing tools. A DTD may be
easy for the author to learn and use, but this doesn't always
translate into something that is easy to process into printed or
published form. The lessons are mostly common sense applied to the
specific task of DTD design.</p><p>The third part of the book covers a number of advanced DTD
maintenance and design issues. It will be of interest mostly to
people who intend to use SGML or XML for purposes other than
publishing, such as database systems or other information
management applications. The first topic covered is that of DTD
compatibility. I mentioned earlier that the CALS table design had
been borrowed for use in other DTDs. When DTDs are similar, it is
fairly simple to translate a document from one DTD to another. This
is very useful if you wish to exchange documentation with a group
which has a different DTD. This chapter describes how to identify
compatibility and the advantages of keeping compatibility in mind
when designing a DTD.</p><p>The second topic extends this discussion to exchanging
document fragments. A document fragment might be a single chapter
or paragraph from a book. If you wish to share portions of a
document with a group using a different DTD, you will find useful
tips in this chapter on ways to simplify the task.</p><p>The final topic in this section is DTD customisation. DTD
customisation is the process of taking an existing DTD and
modifying it to suit your specific purposes. Designing a
sophisticated DTD can be a complex task. Often, there is little
reason to design a DTD from scratch; an existing DTD may provide
95% of what you need, requiring only a small amount of
customisation to fully meet your needs. This can save a lot of time
and provides advantages in terms of document exchange and
compatibility. This chapter describes how to customise DTDs, and
how to design DTDs that are easy to customise. The DocBook DTD, for
example, was designed with hooks in place that allow for easy
customisation.</p><p>The fourth and final part of the book covers DTD design using
a technique called Architectural Forms. Architectural Forms allow
DTD designers to specify the method by which their DTD should be
translated into one or more other DTDs. Architectural Forms allow
you to write documents which are simultaneously valid for a number
of different DTDs. This section of the book describes the concepts
and the implementation of Architectural Forms and offers useful
hints and advice to designers wishing to use this facility. I found
this part of the book a little difficult to comprehend, but that
was almost certainly due to my limited exposure to applications
requiring use of this advanced technique. I'm confident that anyone
with an application for Architectural Forms will find the
information presented to be a good introduction to the
topic.</p><p>I am pleased to report that the CD-ROM includes Linux
versions of the XML parsing software. Two XML parsers are provided.
The first is a precompiled version of the popular &ldquo;SP&rdquo; parser.
The second is a Java-based XML parser called &ldquo;Aelfred&rdquo;. Each DTD
described in the book is included in its SGML form, as well as a
number of links to useful resources on the Internet. The CD-ROM
provides some HTML-based documentation, but is otherwise not well
documented. I am left with the impression that the CD-ROM was a
last-minute addition to the book; nevertheless, it does provide
tools to allow the reader to experiment with the techniques
described, and to that end it is adequate.</p><p>I found <span   class="emphasis"><em>Structuring XML Documents</em></span> to be
an interesting and informative book that I will certainly be using
as a reference in the future. David Megginson has done a nice job
of concisely capturing a lot of material while keeping the pace
slow enough to allow one to absorb the information fairly
comfortably. The book is ideal for both SGML or XML designers, and
SGML designers should not be misled by the title. I recommend that
anyone with an interest in DTD design, especially those involved
with Linux-related documentation projects, take a look at this
book. It is certain to be of assistance in your efforts.</p></div></div>
