    init is the driving force that keeps our Linux box alive and is
    also the one that can put it to death. This article
    summarizes why init is so powerful and how you can instruct it to
    behave differently from its default behaviour. (Yes, init is powerful,
    but the superuser rules over init.)
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2814580.0x290c348"></a></h2></div></div><p>In UNIX parlance, the word &ldquo;init&rdquo;
doesn't identify a specific program, but rather a class of
programs. The name &ldquo;init&rdquo; is used generically to call the first
process executed at system boot&mdash;actually, <span   class="emphasis"><em>the
only</em></span> process that is executed at system boot. When the
kernel is finished setting up the computer's hardware, it invokes
init and gives up controlling the computer. From that point on, the
kernel processes only system calls without taking any decisional
role in system operation. After the kernel mounts the root file
system, everything is controlled by init.
</p><p>Currently, several choices of init are available. You can use
the now-classic program that comes with the SysVinit package by
Miquel van Smoorenburg, <span   class="bold"><b>simpleinit</b></span>
by Peter Orbaek (found in the source package of util-linux), or a
simple shell script (such as the one shown in this article, which
has a lot less functionality than any C-language implementation).
If you set up embedded systems, you can even run the target
application as if it were init. Masochistic people who dislike
multitasking could even port
<span   class="bold"><b>command.com</b></span> to Linux and run it as
the init process, although you won't ever be able to restrict
yourself to 640KB when running a Linux kernel.</p><p>No matter which program you choose, it needs to be accessed
with a path name of /sbin/init, /etc/init or /bin/init, because
these path names are compiled in the kernel. If none of them can be
executed, then the system is severely broken, and the kernel will
spawn a root shell to allow interactive recovery (i.e., /bin/sh is
used as the init process).</p><p>To achieve maximum flexibility, kernel developers offer a way
to select a different path name for the init process. The kernel
accepts a command line option of <b  >init=</b> exactly
for that purpose. Kernel options can be passed interactively at
boot time, or you can use the <b  >append=</b> directive
in /etc/lilo.conf. Silo, Milo, Loadlin and other loaders allow
specifying kernel options as well.</p><p>As you may imagine, the easiest way to get root access to a
Linux box is by typing <b  >init=/bin/sh</b> at the LILO
prompt. Note that this is not a security hole <span   class="emphasis"><em>per
se</em></span>, because the real security hole is physical access to
the console. If you are concerned about the
<b  >init=</b> option, LILO can prevent interaction using
its own password protection.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2814580.0x290c870"></a>The Task of init</h2></div></div><p>Now we know that <span   class="bold"><b>init</b></span> is a
generic naming, and almost anything can be used as init. The
question is, what is a real init supposed to do?</p><p>Being the first (and only) process spawned by the kernel, the
task of init consists of spawning every other process in the
system, including the various daemons used in system operation as
well as any login session on the text console.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>init</b></span> is also expected to
restart some of its child processes as soon as they exit. This
typically applies to login sessions running on the text consoles.
As soon as you log out, the system should run another
<span   class="bold"><b>getty</b></span> to allow starting another
session.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>init</b></span> should also collect
dead processes and dispose of them. In the UNIX abstraction of
processes, a process can't be removed from the system table unless
its death is reported to its parent (or another ancestor in case
its parent doesn't exist anymore). Whenever a process dies by
calling <span   class="emphasis"><em>exit</em></span> or otherwise, it remains in the
state of a zombie process until someone collects it.
<span   class="bold"><b>init</b></span>, being the ancestor of any
other process, is expected to collect the exit status of any
orphaned zombie process. Note that every well-written program
should reap its own children&mdash;zombies exist only when some program
is misbehaving. If init didn't collect zombies, lazy programmers
could easily consume system resources and hang the system by
filling the process table.</p><p>The last task of init is handling system shutdown. The init
program must stop any process and unmount all the file systems when
the superuser indicates that shutdown time has arrived. The
<span   class="bold"><b>shutdown</b></span> executable doesn't do
anything, it only tells init that everything is over.</p><p>As we have seen, the task of init is not too difficult to
implement, and a shell script could perform most of the required
tasks. Note that every decent shell collects its dead children, so
this is not a problem with shell scripts.</p><p>What <span   class="emphasis"><em>real</em></span> init implementations add to
the simple shell script approach is a greater control over system
activity, and thus a huge benefit in overall flexibility.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2814580.0x290ce48"></a>Using /bin/sh as a Minimal Choice</h2></div></div><p>As suggested above, the shell can be used as an init program.
Using a bare shell (<b  >init=/bin/sh</b>) simply causes
a root shell to open in a completely unconfigured system. This
section shows how a shell script can perform all of the tasks you
need to have in a minimal running system. This kind of tiny init
can be used in embedded systems or similar reduced environments,
where you must squeeze every single byte out of the system. The
most radical approach to embedded systems is directly running the
target application as the init process; this results in a closed
system (no way for the administrator to interact, should problems
arise), but it sometimes suits the setup. The typical example of a
non-init-driven Linux system is the installation environment of
most modern distributions, where /sbin/init is a symbolic link to
the installation program.</p><p><a href="3109l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a> shows a script
that can perform acceptably as init. The script is short and
incomplete; in particular, note that it runs only one getty, which
isn't restarted when it terminates. Be careful if you try to use
this script, as each Linux distribution chooses its own flavour of
getty. Type <b  >grep getty /etc/inittab</b> to know what
you have and how to call it.</p><p>The script has another problem: it doesn't deal with system
shutdown. Adding shutdown support, however, is fairly easy; just
bring everything down after the interactive shell terminates.
Adding the text shown in <a href="3109l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2</a>
does the trick.</p><p>Whenever you boot with a plain
<b  >init=/bin/sh</b>, you should at least remount the
root file system before you do anything; you should also remember
to do <b  >umount -a</b> before pressing
<b  >ctrl-alt-del</b>, because the shell doesn't
intercept the three-finger salute.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2814580.0x290d2c0"></a>simpleinit, from util-linux</h2></div></div><p>The util-linux package includes a C version of an init
program. It has more features than the shell script and can work
well on most personal systems, although it doesn't offer the huge
amount of configurability offered by the SysVinit package, which is
the default on modern distributions.</p><p>The role of simpleinit (which should be called init to work
properly) is very similar to the shell script just shown, with the
added capability of managing single-user mode and iterative
invocation of console sessions. It also correctly processes
shutdown requests.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>simpleinit</b></span> is interesting to
look at, and well-documented too, so you might enjoy reading the
documentation. I suggest using the source distribution of
util-linux to get up-to-date information.</p><p>The implementation of simpleinit truly is simple, as its name
suggests. The program executes a shell script (/etc/rc) and parses
a configuration file to determine which processes need to be
respawned. The configuration file is called /etc/inittab, just like
the one used by the full-featured init; note, however, that its
format is different.</p><p>If you plan to install simpleinit on your system (which most
likely already includes SysVinit), you must proceed with great care
and be prepared to reboot with a kernel argument of
&ldquo;init=/bin/sh&rdquo; to recover from unstable situations.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2814580.0x290d580"></a>The Real Thing: SysVinit</h2></div></div><p>Most Linux distributions come with the version of init
written by Miquel van Smoorenburg; this version is similar to the
approach taken by System V UNIX.</p><p>The main idea is that the user of a computer system may wish
to operate his box in one of several different ways (not just
single-user and multi-user). Although this feature is not usually
exploited, it is not so crazy as you might imagine. When the
computer is shared by two or more people in one family, different
setups may be needed; a network server and a stand-alone
playstation can happily coexist in the same computer at different
runlevels. Although I'm the only user of my laptop, I sometimes
want a network server (through PLIP) and sometimes a netless
environment to save resources when I'm working on the train.</p><p>Each operating mode is called a &ldquo;runlevel&rdquo;, and you can
choose the runlevel to use at either boot or runtime. The main
configuration file for init is called /etc/inittab, which defines
what to do at boot, when entering a runlevel or when switching from
one runlevel to another. It also tells how to handle the
three-finger salute and how to deal with power failure, although
you'll need a power daemon and a UPS to benefit from this
feature.</p><p>The inittab file is organized by lines, where each line is
made up of several colon-separated fields:
<b  >id:runlevel:action:command</b>.</p><p>The <b  >inittab(5)</b> man page is well written
and comprehensive as a man page should be, and I feel it is worth
repeating one of its examples&mdash;a stripped-down /etc/inittab that
implements the same features and misfeatures of the shell script
shown above:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
id:1:initdefault:
rc::bootwait:/etc/rc
1:1:respawn:/sbin/getty 9600 tty1
</pre><p>This simple inittab tells init that the default runlevel is
&ldquo;1&rdquo;, at system boot it must execute /etc/rc, and when in runlevel
1 it must respawn forever the command
<b  >/sbin/getty&nbsp;9600&nbsp;tty1</b>. You're not
expected to test this script out, because it doesn't handle the
shutdown procedure.
</p><p>Before proceeding further, however, I must fill in a couple
of gaps. Let's answer two common questions:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>&ldquo;How can I boot into a different runlevel than the
default?&rdquo; Add the runlevel on the kernel command line; for
example, type <b  >Linux&nbsp;2</b> at the LILO prompt,
if &ldquo;Linux&rdquo; is the name of your kernel.</p></li><li><p>&ldquo;How can I switch from one runlevel to another?&rdquo;
As root, type <b  >telinit&nbsp;5</b> to tell the init
process to switch to runlevel 5. Different numbers indicate
different runlevels.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2814580.0x290dc60"></a>Configuring init</h2></div></div><p>Naturally, the typical /etc/inittab file has many more
features than the three-line script shown above. Although
<b  >bootwait</b> and <b  >respawn</b> are the
most important actions, several other actions exist in order to
deal with issues related to system management. I won't discuss them
here.</p><p>Note that SysVinit can deal with
<b  >ctrl-alt-del</b>, whereas the versions of init shown
earlier didn't catch the three-finger salute (i.e., the machine
would reboot if you pressed the key sequence). Those interested in
how this is done can check <span   class="emphasis"><em>sys_reboot</em></span> in
/usr/src/linux/kernel/sys.c. (If you look in the code, you'll note
the use of a magic number 672274793: can you imagine why Linus
chose this number? I think I know the answer, but you'll enjoy
discovering it yourself.)</p><p>Let's look at how a fairly complete /etc/inittab can take
care of everything required to handle the needs of a system's
lifetime, including different runlevels. Although the magic of the
game is always on display in /etc/inittab, several different
approaches to system configuration can be taken, the simplest being
the three-line inittab shown above. In my opinion, two approaches
are worth discussing in some detail; I'll call them &ldquo;the Slackware
way&rdquo; and &ldquo;the Debian way&rdquo; from two renowned Linux distributions
that chose to follow them.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2814580.0x2904808"></a>The Slackware Way</h2></div></div><p>Although it has been quite some time since I last installed
Slackware, the documentation included in SysVinit-2.74 tells me
that it still works the same. It has fewer features but is much
faster than the Debian way. My personal 486 box runs a
Slackware-like /etc/inittab just for the speed benefit.</p><p>The core of an /etc/inittab as used by a Slackware system is
shown in <a href="3109l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3</a>. Note that the
runlevels 0, 1 and 6 have a predefined meaning. This is hardwired
into the init command, or better, into the shutdown command part of
the same package. Whenever you want to halt or reboot the system,
init is told to switch to runlevel 0 or 6, thus executing
/etc/rc.d/rc.0 or /etc/rc.d/rc.6.</p><p>This works flawlessly because whenever init switches to a
different runlevel, it stops respawning any task not defined for
the new runlevel; actually, it kills the running copy of the task.
In this case, the active task is /sbin/agetty.</p><p>Configuring this setup is fairly simple, as the roles of the
different files are clear:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>/etc/rc.d/rc.S is run at system boot, independently
of the runlevel. Add to this file anything you want to execute
right at the start.</p></li><li><p>/etc/rc.d/rc.M is run after rc.S is over, only when
the system is going to runlevels 2 through 5. If you boot at
runlevel 1 (single user), this script is not executed. Add to this
file anything you run only in multiuser mode.</p></li><li><p>/etc/rc.d/rc.K deals with killing processes when
going from multi-user to single-user mode. If you add anything to
rc.M, you'll probably want to stop it from rc.K.</p></li><li><p>/etc/rc.d/rc.0 and /etc/rc.d/rc.6 shut down and
reboot the computer, respectively.</p></li><li><p>/etc/rc.d/rc.4 is executed only when runlevel 4 is
entered. This file runs the &ldquo;xdm&rdquo; process, to allow graphic
login. Note that no getty is run on /dev/tty1 when in runlevel 4
(this can be changed if you wish).</p></li></ul></div><p>This kind of setup is easy to understand, and you can
differentiate between runlevels 2, 3 and 5 by adding proper
<b  >wait</b> (execute once while waiting for
termination) and <b  >respawn</b> (execute forever)
entries.
</p><p>By the way, if you haven't guessed what &ldquo;rc&rdquo; means, it is
the short form of &ldquo;run command&rdquo;. I had been editing my .cshrc and
.twmrc files for years before being told what this arcane &ldquo;rc&rdquo;
suffix meant&mdash;some things in the UNIX world are handed down only by
oral tradition. I feel I'm now saving someone from years of being
in the dark&mdash;and I hope I won't be punished for defining it in
writing.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2814580.0x2904f98"></a>The Debian Way</h2></div></div><p>Although simple, the Slackware way to set up /etc/inittab
doesn't scale well when adding new software packages to the
system.</p><p>Let's imagine, for example, that someone distributes an
<span   class="bold"><b>ssh</b></span> package as a Slackware add-on
(not unlikely, as <span   class="bold"><b>ssh</b></span> can't be
distributed on official disks due to the illogical U.S. rules about
cryptography). The program <span   class="bold"><b>sshd</b></span> is
a stand-alone server that must be invoked at system boot; this
means the package should patch /etc/rc.d/rc.M or one of the scripts
it invokes to add ssh support. This is clearly a problem in a world
where packages are typically archives of files. In addition, you
can't assume that rc.local is always unchanged from the stock
distribution, so even a post-install script that patches the file
will fail miserably when run in the typical user-configured
computer.</p><p>You should also consider that adding a new server program is
only part of the job; the server must also be stopped in rc.K, rc.0
and rc.6. Things are now getting quite tricky.</p><p>The solution to this problem is both clean and elaborate. The
idea is that each package which includes a server must provide the
system with a script to start and stop the service; each runlevel
will then start or stop the services associated with that runlevel.
Associating a service and a runlevel can be as easy as creating
files in a runlevel-specific directory. This setup is common to
Debian and Red Hat, and possibly other distributions that I have
never run.</p><p>The core of the /etc/inittab used by Debian 1.3 is shown in
<a href="3109l4.html" target="_self">Listing 4</a>. The Red Hat setup
features exactly the same structure for system initialization, but
uses different path names; you'll be able to map one structure to
the other. Let's list the roles of the different files:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>/etc/init.d/boot is the exact counterpart of rc.S.
It typically checks local file systems and mounts them, but the
real thing has many more features.</p></li><li><p>/sbin/sulogin allows root to log in to a
single-user workstation. Shown in Listing 4 only because
single-user mode is so important for system maintenance.</p></li><li><p>/etc/init.d/rc is a script that runs any start/stop
script belonging to the runlevel being entered.</p></li></ul></div><p>The last item, the <span   class="bold"><b>rc</b></span>
program, is the main character of this environment: its task
consists in scanning the directory
<b  >/etc/rc$runlevel.d</b> and invoking any script
located in that directory. A stripped-down version of rc would look
like this:
<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/sh
level=$1
cd /etc/rc.d/rc$level.d
for i in K*; do
        ./$i stop
done
for i in S*; do
        ./$i start
done
</pre>


What does this mean? It means that /etc/rc2.d (for example)
includes files called <b  >K*</b> and
<b  >S*</b>; the former identifies services that must be
killed (or stopped), and the latter identifies services that must
be started.
</p><p>Okay, but I didn't explain where the K* and S* files come
from. Each software package that must run for a particular runlevel
adds itself to all the /etc/rc?.d directories, as either a start
entry or a kill entry. To avoid code duplication, the package
installs a script in /etc/init.d and several symbolic links from
the various /etc/rc?.d directories.</p><p>To show a real-life example, lets's see what is included in
two rc directories of Debian:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
rc1.d:
K11croni        K20sendmail
K12kerneld      K25netstd_nfs
K15netstd_init  K30netstd_misc
K18netbase      K89atd
K20gpm          K90sysklogd
K20lpd          S20single
K20ppp
rc2.d:
S10sysklogd     S20sendmail
S12kerneld      S25netstd_nfs
S15netstd_init  S30netstd_misc
S18netbase      S89atd
S20gpm          S89cron
S20lpd          S99rmnologin
S20ppp
</pre><p>The contents of these two directories show how entering
runlevel 1 (single-user) kills all the services and starts a
&ldquo;single&rdquo; script, and entering runlevel 2 (the default level)
starts all the services. The number that appears near the K or the
S is used to order the birth or death of the various services, as
the shell expands wild cards appearing in /etc/init.d/rc in
alphanumeric order. Invoking an <b  >ls -l</b> command
confirms that all of these files are symbolic links, such as the
following:
<pre     class="programlisting">
rc2.d/S10sysklogd -&gt; ../init.d/sysklogd
rc1.d/K90sysklogd -&gt; ../init.d/sysklogd
</pre>


To summarize, adding a new software package in this environment
means adding a file in /etc/init.d and the proper symbolic link
from each of the /etc/rc?.d directories. To make different
runlevels behave differently (2, 3, 4 and 5 are configured in the
same way by default), just remove or add symbolic links in the
proper /etc/rc?.d directories.
</p><p>If this seems too difficult and discouraging, all is not
lost. If you use Red Hat (or Slackware), you can think of
/etc/rc.d/rc.local like it was autoexec.bat&mdash;if you are old enough
to remember the pre-Linux age. If you run Debian, you could create
/etc/rc2.d/S95local and use it as your own rc.local; note, however,
that Debian is very clean about system setup, and I would rather
not suggest such heresy. Powerful and trivial seldom match&mdash;you
have been warned.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2814580.0x2905a40"></a>Debian 2.0</h2></div></div><p>At the time of writing, Debian 2.0 is being released to the
public, and I suspect it will be in wide use by the time you read
this article.</p><p>Although the structure of system initialization is the same,
it is interesting to note that the developers managed to make it
faster. Instead of executing the files in /etc/rc2.d, the script
/etc/init.d/rc can now source (read) them, without spawning another
shell. Whether to execute or source them is controlled by the file
name: executables whose name ends in <b  >.sh</b> are
sourced, the other ones are executed. The trick is shown in the
following few lines:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
case "$i" in
        *.sh)
            # Source shell script for speed.
            (
            trap - INT QUIT TSTP
            set start; . $i
            ) ;;
        *)
            # No sh extension, so fork subprocess.
            $i start ;;
   esac
</pre><p>The speed benefit is quite noticeable.
