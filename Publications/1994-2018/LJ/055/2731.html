    If a web server goes down, here's one way to save time and
    minimize traffic loss by configuring multiple hosts to serve
    the same IP address.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb90580.0xc88500"></a></h2></div></div><p>Imagine yourself as the System
Administrator for a fairly large web site. It's 5:00 AM on a Monday
morning. You're awakened by a page from Big Brother. One of three
web servers has just dropped off the network. Suddenly, a third of
your traffic is going unanswered. What can you do? The commute to
the office isn't a short one, and by the time you get there, you'll
already have dropped thousands of hits, which could mean lost
revenue, decreased productivity or a missed deadline. Whatever the
case may be, someone is going to be affected. As you begin your
journey into work, you wonder how this problem could have been
prevented.
</p><p>In fact, a number of solutions are available, many of which
require expensive hardware or software. This article outlines a
simple and effective method of achieving the same functionality in
a cost-effective manner. This method uses a router and the loopback
interfaces of your Linux web servers. We achieve high availability
by configuring multiple hosts to be capable of serving traffic for
the same IP addresses at any given time. Conventionally, we think
of virtual IP addresses as being assigned to Ethernet interfaces.
However, no two Ethernet interfaces can share the same IP address.
We're able to assign the same IP addresses to multiple hosts by
binding them to loopback interfaces instead. For instance, a SYN
packet, destined for one of these loopback interfaces, travels
across the wire to a router that decides the next packet hop based
on its routing table. The packet is then forwarded to the next
hop&mdash;the Ethernet interface on one of many redundant web servers.
Then, the packet is forwarded from the Ethernet interface to one of
the configured loopbacks on the system. An ACK (acknowledgement)
will travel along the same path in reverse. The packet originates
on the loopback interface, is forwarded to the Ethernet interface,
then back to the router to be sent on its journey back to the
original host that sent the SYN packet. Again, the beauty of this
scheme is the ability to configure multiple hosts with the same IP
address bound to loopback interfaces. By doing so, we've enabled
ourselves to redirect traffic for a particular IP address or even
an entire subnet by simply changing a route in that last hop
router. This saves time and minimizes traffic loss. The process can
even be automated using simple shell scripts.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb90580.0xc88660"></a>Configuring the Linux Kernel</h2></div></div><p>The kernel must be configured to support IP aliasing. IP
aliasing is the process of binding multiple IP addresses to a given
network interface, thus creating &ldquo;virtual&rdquo; interfaces. Under
Linux, interface names are assigned linearly. For example, the
first loopback interface is called lo, the second lo:1, the third
lo:2 and so on. You can see which interfaces are configured on your
system by typing:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/sbin/ifconfig
</pre><p>Configure the kernel with support for TCP/IP, network
aliasing and IP aliasing. Under Linux 2.0.x, this is accomplished
by answering &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to the following kernel configuration options:
<pre     class="programlisting">
Network aliasing (CONFIG_NET_ALIAS) [Y/n/?] y
TCP/IP networking (CONFIG_INET) [Y/n/?] y
IP: aliasing support (CONFIG_IP_ALIAS) [Y/m/n/?] y
</pre>


</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb90580.0xc88870"></a>Our Network</h2></div></div><p>Our fictitious network will consist of four machines,
although you could support the same functionality with as few as
two boxes or as many as you anticipate needing. Four boxes will
allow us to serve a hefty amount of traffic and still allow plenty
of room for growth. Having all four machines handling traffic for a
single web site will provide some load balancing as well, using
&ldquo;round robin&rdquo; DNS. If you ever exceed the capacity of your web
servers, adding additional machines is a simple task.</p><p>We'll take the class C address 192.168.1.0 and apply a 27-bit
subnet mask which will yield 8 subnets and 240 usable hosts.</p><p>Note that according to the RFC, the upper and lower subnets
will not be usable. Some operating systems will not allow you to
configure an interface using an address that falls into one of
these subnets. Some routers require you to enable this feature
implicitly. For example, Cisco requires that the router be
configured with the command <b  >ip subnet-zero</b>. This
is implementation-dependent, although I have yet to see a UNIX or
Microsoft-based host that had a problem utilizing all subnets. If
you are unable to use all eight subnets or you are an RFC
compliancy fanatic, this configuration will yield 6 subnets and 180
unique hosts.</p><p>Traffic can be spread across our 4 hosts for up to 30
different web servers quite easily. It also leaves us with four
free subnets for future expansion. Using subnets allows traffic to
be redirected from one machine to another with a few simple
commands. However, your requirements may not call for an
implementation as large as the one in our example. The same
functionality can be achieved using host routes, so instead of the
routing table having an entry for an entire subnet, the entry is
for a single IP address using a 32-bit subnet mask. I'll try to
explain the differences where applicable.</p><p>While here, we can use a subnet for the Ethernet interfaces
of our web servers from our class C; namely, 192.168.1.1 for our
router and 192.168.1.2, 192.168.1.3 and 192.168.1.4 for our web
servers. Under Red Hat, this is done by editing the
/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/eth0 file to look something like
this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
DEVICE=eth0
IPADDR=192.168.1.2
NETMASK=255.255.255.224
NETWORK=192.168.1.0
BROADCAST=192.168.1.31
ONBOOT=yes
</pre><p>You'll also want to edit the /etc/sysconfig/network file to
configure the appropriate default route. Mine looks like this:
<pre     class="programlisting">
NETWORKING=yes
HOSTNAME=foohost.foo.com
DOMAINNAME=foo.com
GATEWAY=192.168.1.1
GATEWAYDEV=eth0
</pre>


Interface configuration varies from distribution to distribution,
so your mileage may vary.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb90580.0xc88c38"></a>Setting Up Our Router</h2></div></div><p>The router should be set up so that it has an interface on
the same subnet as the web servers. In our example, we'll assign
one interface on the route to IP address 192.168.1.1. This will be
the default route for our web servers.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb90580.0xc88d40"></a>Our First Web Site</h2></div></div><p>Now, suppose you've secured your first contract with
Widgetco, Inc. and they'd like you to set up their web site at
http://www.widgetco.com/. Registration for this domain, which is
outside the scope of this article, should already be completed. The
first thing to do is configure the addresses on the loopbacks of
the web servers. On our Red Hat machines, we configure them using
/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-lo:[1-655536]. We want each of
our hosts to be capable of serving traffic for any of the other
hosts at any given time, so each web server will have the other web
servers' loopback IP addresses bound to its loopback. Remember that
we used our first subnet for the Ethernet interfaces of our web
servers, so starting with the second subnet, we'll pick one address
out of each of four subnets. We'll take 192.168.1.33, 192.168.1.65,
192.168.1.97, and 192.168.1.129 and bind them to loopbacks on all
of the web servers. This is where redundancy comes in. As an
example, /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-lo:1 should look
something like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
DEVICE=lo:1
IPADDR=192.168.1.33
NETMASK=255.255.255.224
NETWORK=192.168.1.32
BROADCAST=192.168.1.63
ONBOOT=yes
</pre><p>Our /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-lo:2 should look
like this:
<pre     class="programlisting">
DEVICE=lo:2
IPADDR=192.168.1.65
NETMASK=255.255.255.224
NETWORK=192.168.1.64
BROADCAST=192.168.1.95
ONBOOT=yes
</pre>


and so on for all four loopbacks. Again, do this on each web server
using the same configuration files. Having multiple hosts which use
the same IP addresses won't be an issue, since they are on
loopbacks.
</p><p>You should be able to run the following command to bring up
your newly created interfaces on each host:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/etc/rc.d/init.d/network start
</pre><p>To make sure your loopback interfaces have been configured,
run:
<pre     class="programlisting">
/sbin/ifconfig
</pre>


If everything has been done correctly, your output will look
something like <a href="2731l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a>.
</p><p>At this point, you should be able to ping the four addresses
bound to the loopbacks from the host they were configured on. The
next step is to set up the routing table on the router so that it
knows how to get to these loopback interfaces. We'll set up a route
for each of the four subnets, pointing to each of the four
hosts.</p><p>An example for a Cisco router might look like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ip route 192.168.1.32 255.255.255.224 192.168.1.2
ip route 192.168.1.64 255.255.255.224 192.168.1.3
ip route 192.168.1.96 255.255.255.224 192.168.1.4
ip route 192.168.1.128 255.255.255.224 192.168.1.5
</pre><p>If you're using Linux as your router, it will look like this:
<pre     class="programlisting">
/sbin/route add -net 192.168.1.32 netmask\
255.255.255.224 192.168.1.2
/sbin/route add -net 192.168.1.64 netmask\
255.255.255.224 192.168.1.3
/sbin/route add -net 192.168.1.96 netmask\
255.255.255.224 192.168.1.4
/sbin/route add -net 192.168.1.128 netmask\
255.255.255.224 192.168.1.5
</pre>


Basically, this information tells the router that the next hop for
a packet bound for any host on the 192.168.1.32 subnet is the
Ethernet interface of our first host, 192.168.1.2. The next hop for
a packet bound for any host on the 192.168.1.64 subnet is the
Ethernet interface of our second host, 192.168.1.3. Routing table
entries are also set up for our third and fourth subnets, which
point to the third and fourth hosts, respectively. Setting up these
entries will differ depending on which hardware you've chosen to
act as your router. It's a good idea to become familiar with the
process of adding and removing routes on your hardware. At this
point, you should be able to ping the loopback interfaces on your
web servers from the router. Other machines utilizing this router
should be able to access the loopback interfaces as well. Using
TELNET to get to 192.168.1.33 should get you a login prompt on the
first host, while 192.168.1.65 should get you to the second and so
on.
</p><p>Now, we'll set up DNS so that www.widgetco.com is served by
our web server rotation. For Red Hat Linux, we place the following
in /var/named/widgetco.com:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
@ IN SOA ns1.widgetco.com. hostmaster.widgetco.com.
(
 1998020100 ; serial (yyyymmddnn)
 86400 ; refresh (every day)
 3600 ; retry (every hour)
 1209600 ; expire (2 weeks)
 86400 ) ; minimum TTL (half day)
 IN NS ns.foo.com.
www IN A 192.168.1.33
         IN     A       192.168.1.65
         IN     A       192.168.1.97
         IN     A       192.168.1.129
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb90580.0xc89370"></a>Configuring Apache</h2></div></div><p>Apache should be configured in /etc/conf/httpd.conf for Red
Hat Linux to listen on each of the loopbacks that we've configured.
Let's look at a simple example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;VirtualHost 192.168.1.33 192.168.1.65 192.168.1.97
192.168.1.129&gt;
ServerName www.widgetco.com
DocumentRoot /www/www.widgetco.com
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
</pre><p>This tells Apache to listen on all four of our loopback
interfaces, set the <b  >ServerName</b> and set up the
<b  >DocumentRoot</b> from which Apache will provide
content for www.widgetco.com. Though Apache will not see traffic on
all four interfaces during normal operation, configuring Apache to
listen beforehand will allow us to redirect traffic from one web
server to another on the fly.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb90580.0xc895d8"></a>Redirecting Traffic</h2></div></div><p>Redirecting traffic from one machine to another is fairly
simple. It's just a matter of changing what your router thinks is
the next hop for a given subnet or host. For example, if we need to
reboot our first web server, we could redirect traffic to the
second with the following Cisco router commands:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
no ip route 192.168.1.32 255.255.255.224
ip route 192.168.1.32 255.255.255.224 192.168.1.3
</pre><p>All traffic that was going to 192.168.1.2 is now rerouted to
192.168.1.3, the second web server, and we've dropped only the
packets that were sent between the first and second router
configuration commands. If your router is running Linux, you can
write a simple shell script that changes these routes for you
automatically. A few lines of Expect can change routes in a
dedicated hardware router.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb90580.0xc89790"></a>Other Applications?</h2></div></div><p>This method of traffic redirection is not limited to web
servers. Other applications using IP, and which could benefit from
high availability, can utilize methods similar to the ones we've
covered. A few examples include DNS, FTP and mail servers.</p></div></div>
