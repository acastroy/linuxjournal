Forge&rdquo; column in <i  >LJ</i> is consistently
outstanding. I subscribe to <i  >LJ</i> because I am
interested in Linux. When I first saw Reuven's column I passed it
up, as I had no interest in web development. I read &ldquo;At the
Forge&rdquo; one day while bored, and found it to be truly well-written
and interesting. I began reading each installment, and I enjoyed
learning from them. One day I realized I had learned quite a bit
and decided web development looked fun. To shorten the story, I
recently put up my first page. I plan on reviewing my
<i  >LJ</i> back issues to read ATF columns I may have
missed. I want my page to be an interactive data collection point
for a project I am working on. Thank you, Reuven, for the
informative, clear and interesting writing that got me
started.</p><p>&mdash;George Saich gsaich@ibm.net</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25d7580.0x26cf4a8"></a>August Issue</h2></div></div><p>A friend gave me his copy of your August issue, and I was
impressed with the quality of your magazine. I am surprised,
though, that in Mr. Pruett's article on demand graphing, he did not
mention the products of Visual Engineering (http://www.ve.com/).
Their Java classes are available free to anyone, and these classes
create graphs on the fly without much ado. My job is to fill in the
cracks of a network management system that products such as
Openview and Tivoli leave, and I have found VE's tools and a little
Perl scripting to be essential in this endeavor. By the way, I am
in no way affiliated with VE; I just like their tools.</p><p>&mdash;Jeffrey Absher jeffab@flash.net</p><p>My article tried to show one method for creating web graphs
using widely available Open Source tools. I didn't mention Visual
Engineering's tools because I knew nothing about them. I've since
looked at demos on their web site. I'll stick with my method, as
the Open Source tools I use work very well. However, I encourage
others to look at VE's tools for themselves. They might be a good
fit, particularly if you need dynamic plots in a web
browser.</p><p>Every solution has trade-offs: VE's products are written in
Java, which is still not well-supported in older browsers. When I
first started using the <span   class="bold"><b>gnuplot</b></span>
method three years ago, Java was still perking. Also, VE's
Java-based graphs must be converted to GIFs before they can be
printed. VE provides this capability, but it's another hoop to jump
through. While VE makes their source code available, they do so at
too high a cost for many users. I'm still biased toward Perl and
CGI-based Open Source tools and see no compelling reason to toss
Java into the mix.</p><p>I'd like to thank the readers who suggested I look at FLY
(http://www.unimelb.edu.au/fly/), an Open Source program written by
Martin Gleeson that creates GIFs on the fly and uses the GD
graphics library. FLY operates on a much lower level than gnuplot,
so you'll have to construct your plots from graphics primitives
like <span   class="bold"><b>circle</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>line</b></span>. Again, every solution has
its trade-offs. Experienced programmers may want to skip FLY and
simply use the GD library directly, with a language like C or
Perl.</p><p>Finally, thanks are due to the many readers who noted that
the latest stable beta version of gnuplot (available at
http://science.nas.nasa.gov/~woo/gnuplot/beta/) supports GIF
natively, removing the need for a conversion using
<span   class="bold"><b>ppmtogif</b></span>.</p><p>&mdash;Mark Pruett pruettm@vancpower.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25d7580.0x26cf920"></a>Netscape Interview</h2></div></div><p>I enjoyed the August '98 interview with the Netscape people.
It was quite a shot in the arm for the Linux community. Although I
work in the computer industry with NT, I have been a Linux user
since 0.99 and would like to see it become more mainstream.</p><p>While things are really coming along, I think we in the Linux
community should take a mature leadership role and stop making
petty, unfounded potshots at Microsoft.</p><p>A case in point is the article from the same issue called
&ldquo;Migrating to Linux, Part 1&rdquo;. With all due respect to Mr.
Jacobowitz, anyone who has ever used NT would know that this
article was laced with little lies based on anti-Microsoft
mythology. I am surprised that all of the &ldquo;computer scientists&rdquo;
at <i  >LJ</i> did not catch this.</p><p>I am sure that even Marc Andreessen would agree that we have
to be more mature in the way we deploy and market Open
Source.</p><p>&mdash;Brad Schroeder brads@interlog.com</p><p>I have reread my article, and I assure you that my experience
with MS Windows NT Workstation 4.0 was exactly as described
therein. If an NT professional discovers it was my &ldquo;pilot error&rdquo;
that caused my troubles, I'd be happy to accept responsibility and
learn from my mistakes. Also, I harbor no personal resentment
towards Microsoft, and I still occasionally use a few of their
products, some of which are quite exceptional. However, I do agree
with the general theme of your letter: Microsoft bashing is
inappropriate behavior for the Linux/Open Source community. Let's
concentrate on Linux's strengths rather than the weaknesses of the
commercial alternatives.</p><p>&mdash;Norman M. Jacobowitz normj@aa.net</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25d7580.0x26cfc90"></a>Linux and <span   class="emphasis"><em>Saving Private
Ryan</em></span></h2></div></div><p>This is a story about how Linux helped in <span   class="emphasis"><em>Saving
Private Ryan</em></span>. I thought your readers might be interested
in how Linux supported the National D-Day Memorial Foundation both
very inexpensively and reliably.</p><p>A friend, James Ervin, and I had been involved in the
installation of our local Internet access through the cable TV
company, Bedford Cablevision, as well as the installation of Linux
for web servers, mail servers and firewalls. In Bedford, Virginia,
where we live is a small organization called the National D-Day
Memorial Foundation. We set up a web presence for them on the
Internet with the cable company's help. We put together a computer
(an AMD 5x86-based server) for about $350 and installed Linux for a
firewall, web and mail server. They had some web pages donated by a
graphics design shop, Howlin' Dog Designs. The day after the cable
company installed the cable and cable modem, the pages were up on
the Internet on their own server. Initial requests for web pages
(http://www.dday.org/) were few, about 2000 per month.</p><p>A while later, they were contacted by a company called
DreamWorks which wanted to do a movie related to D-Day. Support was
provided by the Foundation to DreamWorks and eventually the movie
was released. Their web traffic then increased to about 2000
requests per day, and Linux has faithfully borne the load. That is
the story of how Linux worked behind the scenes during the making
of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Saving Private Ryan</em></span>.</p><p>&mdash;Rich Kochendar ferrich@photon.cablenet-va.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25d7580.0x26cffa8"></a>Compliment for Michael Hughes</h2></div></div><p>I just finished setting up an extra PC as my new router to
the Internet. I used the instructions from the article &ldquo;Getting in
the Fast Lane&rdquo; by Michael Hughes in the June 1998 issue (#50), and
although I used a regular modem instead of a cable modem, I was
able to connect to the Internet within hours of playing with the
kernel and <span   class="bold"><b>ipfwadm</b></span>. I must say I
was excited to get it working and especially to browse my PC web
site from the Internet using the DHCP address from my ISP. I even
sent this e-mail from one of the PCs on my internal network. Keep
up the good work, guys.</p><p>&mdash;Danny M. dannym@tiac.net</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25d7580.0x26d0160"></a>Red Hat 5.1</h2></div></div><p>I just wanted to write and let everyone know that Red Hat 5.1
is excellent! From start to finish, the installation was seamless.
I recommend novice users buy the boxed version made by Red Hat; it
comes with e-mail support, a nice book, a boot disk and a set of
three CDs. Not bad for $54.99; the book included is worth that
price if you are a novice. Now that I have migrated to Linux, I
find myself chanting &ldquo;Cool, It Works with Linux!&rdquo;</p><p>&mdash;Michael T. McGurty mmcgurty@ovis.net</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25d7580.0x26d02c0"></a>Re: How Many Distributions?</h2></div></div><p>I was in total shock when I read the Editor's remarks &ldquo;How
Many Distributions?&rdquo; in the September 1998 issue of
<i  >Linux Journal</i>. It seems to me to be the most
anti-Linux message I have ever read. What gives you the right to
tell the Linux community what is good for it? Isn't that why we
don't like Bill Gates? He feels like he should lead the computer
industry in the direction he sees fit.</p><p>What would have happened if someone had told Red Hat there
were too many distributions? What if someone had told Linus
Torvalds there were already too many x86 UNIX kernels? After all,
BSD, Minix, SCO and Solaris (x86) already existed.</p><p>If someone wants to start up a new distribution, my hat is
off to them. It's much harder to start up a distribution today and
have it succeed than it was just two or three years ago. This is
partly due to how great the current distributions are. If a new
distribution has binary compatibility problems, no one will want to
use it. This should encourage them to make sure their distribution
complies with the Filesystem and Binary Compatibility Standards
that have been proposed.</p><p>Linux is about individuality. I prefer Red Hat, FVWM 1.X and
vi. Why should I use Caldera, KDE and Emacs? Too many people are
caught up in Red Hat vs. Caldera, KDE vs. Gnome, vi vs. Emacs. Who
cares? They all work with Linux! That's what is so great about it
all. I can have an operating system tailored to me. People who
enjoy Linux should express themselves in whatever manner they like,
whether it's creating a new distribution or creating a new
resources page.</p><p>Maybe I'll express myself by creating a new Linux magazine. I
understand there's quite a monopoly in that area.</p><p>&mdash;Pete Elton elton@wizard.com</p><p>The purpose of that column was to express my opinion, not to
dictate to the Linux community.</p><p>Actually, we do have competitors&mdash;in Germany, Spain, Korea
and Japan. I've also heard rumors of Linux magazines in Italy and
India &mdash;Editor</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25d7580.0x26d0688"></a><i  >LJ</i> in Canada</h2></div></div><p>A friend at work brought his <i  >LJ</i> August
'98 issue in for me to look through. I bought a previous one a few
months ago, but never received any notification of the free issue.
I've been trying to find a place that actually carries the
distribution.</p><p>However, when I was in Kingston, Ontario, Canada, I did find
such a place. At the grand opening of a new bookstore called
Chapters, <i  >LJ</i> sold out in two days while all
these other MS Windows magazines sat there collecting dust. The
same held true for the three shelves of Linux books. By the second
week, word had spread that they carried Linux books, and the
shelves were soon bare.</p><p>&mdash;Richard Jones Rich_Jones@wmg.com</p></div></div>
