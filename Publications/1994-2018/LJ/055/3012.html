time. That's a bold, hard-to-prove statement for a web server when
compared to the amazing success of the Apache HTTP Server. Before
you stop reading, you should consider that there is nothing wrong
with having two subtly different, yet very good tools.
</p><p>Apache is designed from the ground up to be a simple, open,
secure, high-performance HTTP server, and it pays up in spades.
Apache is the natural choice for almost all web administrators
weaned on NCSA CERN or a commercial HTTP server like Netscape.
However, Apache is not exactly intuitive to configure, the
configuration in question being three flat text files. Apache also
suffers from a monolithic structure (albeit plug-in modularity is a
new option if you compile it in) which requires recompiling the
source code when making changes or adding modules (such as proxy,
database access, etc.).</p><p>Roxen takes a different approach to HTTP server design. Roxen
is easily installed and configured. The user need only do the
normal <b  >./configure</b> and <b  >make</b>
sequences after unpacking the tar file and reading the README file.
This has worked flawlessly a dozen times for me on Intel Red Hat
4.2 and 5.0 machines. After compiling the Pike interpreter (we'll
get to that), the installation script tells you to point your
browser to http://localhost:<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span>/,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> being some random unassigned port where the
configuration interface server listens for your browser.</p><p>Pointing a browser to that URL brings up the on-line,
web-centric configuration interface. The first screen sets the
configuration, user and password information for subsequent
configuration sessions. Immediately, virtual servers can be added,
and adding a virtual server is a snap. My usual sequence is to find
a free IP and bind the hostname.domain to it. Next, I create the
aliased Ethernet interface with
<span   class="bold"><b>netcfg</b></span> specifying the chosen IP. I
switch to the Roxen configuration interface, and using simple,
point-and-click menus, add a new server binding it to the interface
just created. Roxen automatically detects this and does a reverse
lookup for me. Voil&aacute;--I have an instant virtual server. The
whole process took less time than making a cup of coffee.</p><p>When creating the server, Roxen asks questions about the kind
of server desired. The choices consist of Bare Bones, Standard, IPP
(Internet Presence Provider), Proxy or a copy of the configurations
for any current servers in the system. This gives lots of
flexibility when working with more than just a few virtual
servers.</p><p>Each of the four choices is a certain set of loaded modules
for each server. Modules can be mixed and matched to make custom
servers. Modules, also written in Pike, can be loaded and unloaded
on the fly, and all modules have a standard configuration interface
that plugs into the server configuration interface. Modules include
the file system, authentication, database access, CGI and FCGI
execution, on-the-fly graphics manipulation and more.</p><p>So how is this marvelous server put together? Roxen is
written in the Pike language. Pike is an interpreted, threaded,
C-like language based on an older programming language for MUD
systems. Pike is fully developed and has a graceful, clean style so
much like C that any C programmer can pick it up in minutes. This
makes writing custom Roxen modules a snap. Pike's home page has
excellent, intelligently written documentation that is completely
cross-referenced and includes a handy function index where many old
familiar buddies from the ANSI C libraries can be found.</p><p>The downside is that Pike, being a byte code interpreted
language, is slower than compiled and optimized C by a noticeable
margin. Roxen 1.1 is also a bit buggy, and Roxen 1.2 is still in
beta. Having dabbled in 1.2 (which installed
<span   class="emphasis"><em>just</em></span> as cleanly as 1.1), I found it very cool
with many new modules, some of which are not available for Apache,
such as on-the-fly wizard generators and automatic table formatting
of SQL-retrieved data. A new update module contacts the Roxen
central server in Sweden and upgrades the server and all the
modules to the newest debugged versions, and offers to download any
<span   class="emphasis"><em>new</em></span> modules Idonex has created as well. 1.2
also uses the new threading built into the latest version of Pike,
increasing its performance for high or eccentric load systems and
allowing it to take advantage of multiprocessor systems.</p><p>The most powerful module in the Roxen set is the Roxen Markup
Language (RXML). RXML looks like HTML, and it is written directly
into the HTML code. When a client retrieves a document from the
server, the server first parses the document for RXML tags,
changing the HTML output based on the tags used. This is basically
server-side scripting with server-side includes in Apache parlance,
but cleaner. For example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;if user=jane&gt;
&lt;gtext scale=0.5 nfont="arial" fg="blue"
bg="white"&gt;Hi there Jane.&lt;/gtext&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;else&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Hey get outta here!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/if&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;/html&gt;
</pre><p>The <b  >&lt;if&gt;&lt;else&gt;&lt;/if&gt;</b>
construct outputs different HTML depending on whether the client
fetching the page has authenticated itself as the user
<b  >jane</b>. The <b  >&lt;gtext&gt;</b> tag
takes the text and renders a gif image of it on the fly, replacing
the <b  >&lt;gtext&gt;</b> tag with an
<b  >&lt;img&gt;</b> tag whose
<span   class="bold"><b>src</b></span> is the generated image. Many
options to gtext are available, including transparency, sizes,
bevels, automatic Javascript mouse responses and more. Check out
Roxen's home page for an example, or the American Association for
the Surgery of Trauma web page, where I used gtext and RXML
extensively.
</p><p>Roxen's extreme ease of use and modularity make it a powerful
tool for web managers of all needs. The GNU GPL license for Roxen
and Pike makes the price just right. Like all good GPL software,
Pike and Roxen are backed by an active, sharp Internet crowd of
Pike programmers and Roxen-heads eager to help you with your
questions. Idonex also offers various levels of support for very
reasonable prices. The Roxen Server comes pre-packaged with a
manual and other non-GPL goodies (like 128-bit SSL) from
Idonex.</p><p><a href="3012s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>This article was first published in Issue 31 of LinuxGazette.com,
