    An overview of what is needed to make your favorite application
    Perl-enabled and how to avoid some obstacles along the way.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cc7580.0x1dbf450"></a></h2></div></div><p>This article describes my experience
embedding Perl into an existing application. The application
chosen, <span   class="bold"><b>sc</b></span>, is a public-domain,
character-based spreadsheet that often comes as part of a Linux
distribution. The reason for choosing sc was twofold. First, I use
sc for any spreadsheet-type tasks I have. Second, I was somewhat
familiar with the source, because I once added code in order to
format dates the way I wanted. Besides, I always thought it would
be nice if sc had some sort of macro language&mdash;everything should be
programmable in some way.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cc7580.0x1dbf5b0"></a>Getting Started</h2></div></div><p>The first thing I did was to get the sc 6.21 source and
compile it on my machine. This ensured that everything worked from
the start, before I started making modifications to the
code.</p><p>The next thing was to add the necessary code to sc.c to embed
the Perl interpreter. The basics of this were:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Add the following include files
<pre     class="programlisting">
        #include &lt;EXTERN.h&gt;
        #include &lt;perl.h&gt;
</pre>

</p></li><li><p>Add the variable for the Perl interpreter
<pre     class="programlisting">
        static PerlInterpreter *MyPerl;
</pre>

</p></li><li><p>Put the code shown in
<a href="2901l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a> in
<span   class="bold"><b>main</b></span> in the file sc.c.</p></li><li><p>Update Makefiles to use the correct parameters.
This consisted of adding CC options and linker options derived from
the following commands:
<pre     class="programlisting">
        perl -MExtUtils::Embed -e ccopts
        perl -MExtUtils::Embed -e ldopts
</pre>


These commands give you the compiler and linker options that your
version of Perl was compiled with.</p></li></ul></div><p>Nothing else needs to be done; the Perl interpreter is now in
the code. Obviously you can't do anything yet, but you can work out
any compilation problems. Right away, I had a few problems with
some <b  >#define</b> statements and a prototype for
main. <b  >EXT</b> and <b  >IF</b> were the two
offending <b  >#define</b>s. I fixed these by appending
&ldquo;sc&rdquo; to the end of them wherever they occurred in the original sc
code, to make them unique. If you were writing an application from
scratch, it would not be a bad idea to prepend a common prefix to
each <b  >#define</b>.</p><p>Perl, on the other hand, expected main to have a third
argument, <b  >env</b>, so I added it. I am still not
sure where this argument comes from, but it doesn't seem to create
any problems.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cc7580.0x1dbfea0"></a>Running Perl Code</h2></div></div><p>Once the base interpreter compiled successfully, I needed a
way to call the functions. I looked at the sc source and found that
one of the keystrokes, <b  >ctrl-k</b>, was free for my
use. I used this as my &ldquo;call Perl&rdquo; key-command macro, with macros
from 0 to 9 defined. This combination calls predefined Perl
subroutines called sc_macro_[0-9], when defined. The code in
<a href="2901l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2</a> adds this
functionality.</p><p>The function
<span   class="bold"><b>call_sc_perl_macro</b></span> checks first to
see if the subroutine exists with
<span   class="bold"><b>perl_get_cv</b></span>. If null is not
returned, it calls the function which has the name
<span   class="bold"><b>sc_macro_#</b></span> where # is a digit from
0 to 9.</p><p>The <span   class="bold"><b>perl_call_va</b></span> function
comes from Sriram Srinivasan's book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Advanced Perl
Programming</em></span>, published by O'Reilly. This code was used
to expedite my ultimate goal of embedding Perl into sc. The code
for perl_call_va can be found in the file ezembed.c.</p><p>With sc compiled, I proceeded to test the interpreter by
creating dummy macros in the file sc.pl to write some data to
temporary files. Everything worked fine, which told me the Perl
interpreter was working inside of sc.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cc7580.0x1dc0318"></a>Automating sc</h2></div></div><p>With a working Perl interpreter embedded into sc and the
ability to call Perl &ldquo;macros&rdquo;, the interfaces to the C functions
in sc needed to be created to do useful work. Fortunately, sc is
laid out nicely enough that, for the most part, all one has to do
is wrap an already existing function and interface with its
internal command parser.</p><p>The first thing I thought might be useful is to move the
current cell around. Without that ability, I would be able to
operate only on a single cell, which is not very useful. Besides,
it was one of the least complicated sections of code and provided a
good start.</p><p>The code for <span   class="bold"><b>sc_forward_row</b></span>
is shown in <a href="2901l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3</a> and found in
sc_perl.c. Before I describe this code, let me give you a quick
overview of how Perl treats scalars. Each scalar has many pieces of
information, including a double numeric value, a string value and
flags to indicate which parts are valid. For our purposes, the
scalar can hold three types of values: an integer value (IV), a
double value (NV) and a string value (PV). For any scalar value
(SV), you can get to their respective values with the macros SvIV,
SvNV and SvPV.</p><p>Now, in the Listing 3 code, XS is a Perl macro that defines
the function. dXSARGS sets up some stuff for the rest of XSub, such
as the variable <b  >items</b> that contains the number
of items passed to Xsub on the Perl argument stack. If the argument
count does not equal 1, XS_RETURN_IV returns 1 to Perl to indicate
an error. Otherwise, the top element of the Perl argument stack,
ST(0), is converted to an integer value and passed to the
<span   class="bold"><b>forwrow</b></span> function.</p><p>Note that all of the XSub code was generated by hand. Some of
this work can be done with Perl's
<span   class="bold"><b>xsubpp</b></span> or with a tool called
<span   class="bold"><b>swig</b></span>, but in this case, I felt it
was simpler to code it myself.</p><p>Finally, tell the Perl interpreter about this Xsub with the
statement:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
newXS("sc_forward_row",sc_forward_row,"sc_perl.c");
</pre><p>The first argument is the name of the subroutine in Perl. The
next argument is the actual C routine (in this case they are the
same, but they don't have to be). The last argument is the file in
which the subroutine is defined, and is used for error messages. I
chose to create all of the <span   class="bold"><b>newXS</b></span>
functions by parsing my sc_perl.c file with a Perl script, so that
I would not have to do two things every time I added a new XSub.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cc7580.0x1dc08f0"></a>Dynamic Loading of Modules</h2></div></div><p>The next thing I wanted was the ability to dynamically load
other Perl extensions such as the Tk extension, database extensions
or anything else that might prove useful. This requires an
<span   class="bold"><b>xs_init</b></span> function in place of the
<b  >NULL</b> in perl_parse as shown below.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
perl_parse(MyPerl, xs_init, 2, my_argv, env);
</pre><p>To create the xs_init, I used the following code:
<pre     class="programlisting">
perl -MExtUtils::Embed -e xsinit -- -o - &gt;xs_init.c
</pre>


The function of xs_init is to initialize the statically linked
extension modules. The only module I statically linked is the
DynaLoader module. With this module, we can dynamically load
everything else. When I initially did this, I had numerous
problems. They turned out to be linked to the version of Perl I was
using (5.003_07). After I installed 5.004_04, everything worked
fine.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cc7580.0x1dc0bb0"></a>Other Problems</h2></div></div><p>One of the first problems I ran into was the fact that Perl
redefined <span   class="bold"><b>yypars</b></span> to be
<span   class="bold"><b>Perl_yypars</b></span>. I fixed this by
putting new <b  >#define</b> statements around places
where I used sc's yypars. This created a lot of compiler warnings,
but did allow the code to compile correctly.</p><p>The other problem I encountered was with the SvIOK and SvNOK
macros. These check an SV for a number or an integer, or more
precisely, they check to see if the double-value portion of an SV
is valid at that point in the code.</p><p>Originally, I had the SvIOK and SvNOK macros around any code
to which I was expecting to send an integer. The problem is this
will not accept code like the following,</p><pre     class="programlisting">
sc_put_num_val("34.3"); # this is in perl
</pre><p>because it is being passed a string value and the number part
of the SV was not valid at that time. The SvIV and SvNV macros will
convert this to a number even if it is not a valid string. I was
parsing strings from a file using regular expressions, and the
value I would get in $1 would be a string, even though it was
numeric. Once I realized SvNV would produce a number for me, my
test script started working.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cc7580.0x1db77b0"></a>Summary</h2></div></div><p>This example is not the cleanest implementation of embedding
Perl into an application. It was meant as a quick solution to a
problem. With an embedded Perl interpreter, sc is quite a bit more
powerful than before. One example included with the source is a
mortgage calculator that grabs the interest rates form the CNN
Financial News web site. With all the Perl modules available, the
possibilities are endless.</p><p><a href="2901s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
