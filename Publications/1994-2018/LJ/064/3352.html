distributed program suitable for tasks such as photo retouching,
image composition and image authoring. The GIMP is very closely
related to Adobe Photoshop in terms of purpose and functionality,
and some would say it is superior (one can't argue this in terms of
its cost). The GIMP represents a significant contribution to Linux
in its quest to become a viable desktop platform, because for many
desktop users, an image editing program such as the GIMP is
considered a &ldquo;must have&rdquo; application. A book such as
<span   class="emphasis"><em>The Artists' Guide to the GIMP</em></span> is needed for
programs like the GIMP to reach the widest possible audience, and
so Michael J. Hammel, the book's author, and SSC have contributed
to the success of the GIMP, and indirectly, to Linux as a platform
by bringing this book to publication. I hope this is the first of
many such books to follow.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a35580.0x2b2dd40"></a>Overview</h2></div></div><p>The first impression I had upon receiving the book was its
extensive use of color artwork and the quality of paper upon which
it was printed. Having written a book on image processing, I know
how expensive it can be to print books in this manner. Often, to
reduce printing costs, a publisher will opt to print the color
images together as a series of color plates bound somewhere near
the center of the book. The difficulty with such an approach is it
forces readers to skip back and forth between the text being read
and the supporting illustrations, which isn't always convenient.
SSC did readers of this book a favor by opting not to take the
cost-saving approach; as a result, the book is full of color
images, each located within a page of the relevant text.</p><p>The book begins with an introduction that discusses in detail
issues such as minimum hardware and software requirements of
systems running the GIMP. Much of the information could probably
have been summarized neatly by a table or two that divulged the
minimum and recommended amounts of memory, disk space and so on
needed to run it. In the video requirements section, I sensed some
minor confusion with regard to X11. I believe the graphics
primitives used by Xt/Motif and Gtk+/Gdk are essentially the same
(contrary to the author's claim), as both reside above, and make
use of, Xlib. As a result, the graphics performance should be
nearly identical, regardless of the toolkit used. The whole point
is somewhat moot anyway, since the GIMP is not and never will be a
Motif program.</p><p>Another source of minor confusion was the discussion of the X
Shared Memory Extension. This extension can be taken advantage of
by the GIMP only when both the X server and the GIMP are executing
as processes on the same machine. This is the true reason an X
terminal (for example, the NCD model that was mentioned in the
book) could never take advantage of the extension&mdash;if an X terminal
is involved, the server and the GIMP client are separated by a
network connection, effectively executing on separate hosts. Also,
if users are running the client on a UNIX/Linux host connected to
an X server running locally on a desktop UNIX/Linux host which
supports the shared memory extension, the GIMP still cannot take
advantage of the extension, because a network connection separates
the client and the server from each other.</p><p>Somewhere in Chapter 1, the author mentions how to start the
GIMP from the command line by typing <b  >gimp</b>. The
<b  >--display</b> argument is mentioned, but none of the
other command-line arguments (<b  >-h</b>,
<b  >-v</b>, <b  >-b</b>, <b  >-n</b>
and so forth) are mentioned and neither is the fact that you can
type <b  >gimp -?</b> to obtain a usage report. I think a
detailed book on any program that can be run from a command-line
should cover each of the supported command line arguments in
detail.</p><p>Most Linux users can skip the software requirements section,
since the GIMP will be provided in a ready-to-run configuration
with their Linux installation. For users of other systems (such as
Solaris) or those of you wanting to get the sources and build the
GIMP yourselves, helpful information is provided near the end of
Chapter 1 to get you started.</p><p>Chapter 2, &ldquo;GIMP Basics&rdquo;, was misnamed. A better title
might have been &ldquo;Image Basics&rdquo;. The chapter is short and provides
a variety of information, including a basic discussion of raster
graphics, color spaces, image and pixel organization, file formats
and brief introductions to the GIMP's selection tools and layers.
The discussion of image file formats was okay; the discussion of
color spaces and pixel organization less so, but still adequate.
Since the rest of the chapter dealt mainly with image and color
space issues, the discussion of scanners seemed out of context. The
same can be said regarding the discussion of layers and selection
tools.</p><p>Chapter 3 is essentially a tour of significant portions of
the GIMP user interface. It starts by listing various menu items
available. Readers will want to skim this section in order to get
an idea of how the menu items are organized, but plan to refer back
to it later as a reference. I strongly suggest you launch a copy of
the GIMP, open an existing image or create a new one, and play
along as you read this chapter, trying out each menu item as it is
discussed. The chapter continues with a discussion of some of the
GIMP's dialogs, providing screen shots to illustrate each dialog.
Even so, it is a good idea to practice bringing each dialog up;
this will help you get savvy with the user interface much quicker.
The chapter ends with a tutorial, which you can probably skip if
you followed my suggestion and experimented with the GIMP as you
read.</p><p>Chapter 4 covers the tool box, which is the main application
dialog of the GIMP. Each button in the tool box is introduced and
explained. I think this chapter, like Chapter 3, is a good one to
skim and then return to later after the book has been read more
completely. It has a reference-like organization and some of the
terms introduced in the chapter may not be entirely clear until
more detail provided later in the book has been read. This is
especially true for those readers new to the GIMP and inexperienced
with Photoshop or image manipulation programs in general. Chapter 4
ends with a &ldquo;tutorial&rdquo;, which to me seemed more like a quiz and
an invitation to play with certain features than a tutorial.</p><p>Chapter 5, &ldquo;Selections&rdquo;, does a great job of describing the
various selection tools available in the GIMP and presents many
tips and tricks regarding their use. The tutorial at the end of the
chapter was well-designed, far better than the one at the end of
Chapter 4, I felt. Chapter 6 presents a similarly detailed
treatment of GIMP layers and channels. Another well-designed
tutorial follows the material presented in Chapter 6. I think much
of the power and overall coolness of the GIMP derives from features
described in these two chapters, so you will want to study them
carefully.</p><p>Chapter 7, &ldquo;Colors and Text&rdquo;, discusses tools that can be
used to perform image enhancements such as color balance changes,
contrast enhancements, brightness modifications and histogram
stretching. A concise description of the text tool dialog is
presented, and the chapter finishes up with a look at Script-Fu
logos. After a short description, each of the 21 logos supplied
with the GIMP is illustrated. These logos look very cool, and I was
compelled to try them out. I ran into font problems with most of
the logos; this problem should have been anticipated by the author
and help provided. I went to the index to see if there was an entry
for &ldquo;font&rdquo; or &ldquo;fonts&rdquo; (a topic discussed a few pages earlier in
the section entitled &ldquo;Text Tool Dialog&rdquo;). None was found.
Scanning the table of contents, I found Appendix C, &ldquo;Adding Fonts
to the System&rdquo;, but no information to help me with my problem was
provided.</p><p>By the way, a button in the Script-Fu logos dialog that could
be used to bring up a simplified font selection dialog similar to
the text tool would be a great addition. Having to type in the name
of the font and the font size seems like a rather crude way of
doing things.</p><p>Chapter 8 covers drawing tools including pens, brushes,
pencils and airbrush tools. The discussion seemed complete;
however, the explanation of airbrush tool controls would have been
a bit clearer with some example illustrations. Palettes (both
indexed and RGB) and the tools that support them are discussed, and
the chapter ends with a look at GFig, a plug-in intended to enhance
the drawing capabilities of the GIMP.</p><p>Since I am running out of space for this review, I'll just
take a quick look at the remaining chapters. Chapter 9 is a short
chapter that covers transformations such as cropping, rotation and
the like. Chapter 10 covers gradients and ends with a good tutorial
on the subject. Chapter 11, &ldquo;Scanning, Printing and Print Media&rdquo;,
ends Part 1 of the book. I don't have a scanner, and my printer was
already configured for use with my Linux system, so the chapter did
not hold much interest for me (at least not yet&mdash;someday I will
want to hook up a scanner, and this chapter is where I will
start).</p><p>Following Chapter 11 is Part 2 of the book, which covers
various Script-Fu effects. Each of the 12 chapters in this section
is short, on the order of a few pages, and covers a specific
Script-Fu effect. The chapters are more to be looked at than read;
most of the content is provided by a series of before/after
screenshots which show the discussed effect being applied to an
image. I suggest using these chapters as a catalog of the effects
that are available, and when you find one you like, use the example
provided in the book as a starting point for your own
creations.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a35580.0x2b2e528"></a>Final Impressions</h2></div></div><p>If you are serious about learning the GIMP, you will find a
way to put this book on your bookshelf. If you are looking for
something to teach you the GIMP via a series of examples or
tutorials that build upon each other, you may need to look
elsewhere. The book goes further than the typical &ldquo;Learn XYZ in 21
Days&rdquo; book and is a comprehensive reference to the GIMP and its
operation that will prove itself useful to many readers. However,
in the next edition I would like to see a chapter or two that takes
readers through a detailed sample project, such as the creation of
a complex image similar to the <i  >Linux Journal</i>
cover art Michael has produced in the past. This would help
solidify the concepts presented throughout the book and give many
readers a springboard for creating works of their own.</p></div></div>
