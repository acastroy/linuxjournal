    A cross-platform commercial application is giving away their
    source&mdash;here's the story.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13e4580.0x14dc3f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>There is a growing number of quality
open-source efforts for both word processors and office suites.
Both GNOME and KDE are actively developing a variety of office
applications. Although these efforts may end up with
commercial-quality applications (and some of the developers are
being paid to work full-time on them), they are not being developed
by a for-profit company.
</p><p>AbiSource is currently developing the open-source word
processor, AbiWord. AbiSource is indeed a business, rather than a
network of volunteer open-source developers: their goal is to be
profitable using paid employees as the core team of
developers.</p><p>Although the other open-source efforts are a great asset to
Linux in general (as are commercial companies distributing free
binaries), a company releasing source code for their only
application deserves a closer look.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13e4580.0x14dc5b0"></a>AbiSource</h2></div></div><p>AbiSource began in January of 1997 as a contracting firm with
no plans for creating products. The company decided to shift its
focus toward product development, but it was not until early 1998
when the Open Source movement gained momentum that they developed a
new business plan. By the end of 1998, they had already released
the first developer version of AbiWord under the GNU General Public
License (GPL).</p><p>AbiSource's mission is &ldquo;to become the leading provider of
open-source desktop productivity applications.&rdquo; Their plan is to
develop a cross-platform, open-source office suite called AbiSuite.
Their first application under development is the word processor
AbiWord.</p><p>AbiSource is betting 100% of their future on Open Source. One
of the difficulties in open-source development is getting volunteer
developers involved. (Netscape's Mozilla browser development is
still almost entirely done by Netscape/AOL engineers.) Asked how to
rate the success of AbiSource's open-source development model,
AbiSource founder Eric W. Sink replied,</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>People tend to look at projects like Apache and
Linux with the assumption that community development is a panacea.
When you sit down to duplicate their experiences in the application
space, the first thing you do is resolve to eliminate all obstacles
which would prevent widespread community participation in the
development. After that, you realize just how successful Apache and
Linux are. It's not enough to <span   class="emphasis"><em>let</em></span> the
community participate. You've got to create something cool enough
that others find it attractive. We're just now getting to the point
where our project has serious participants beyond the original core
group.</p></blockquote></div><p>Open-source development has already helped the progress of
AbiWord. A volunteer developer provided a BeOS port. Others
provided translations to allow AbiWord to be localized for four
languages other than English.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13e4580.0x14dc8c8"></a>AbiWord</h2></div></div><p><a href="3545f1.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 1.
AbiWord Screenshot</b></span></a></p><p>What separates AbiWord (see Figure 1) from the other
open-source word processors available for Linux? It is also
available for Windows and is a WYSIWYG (what you see is what you
get) editor.</p><p>Open Source software for Windows is uncommon. Sure, you can
download plenty of free software for Windows, but source code for
Windows applications is the exception rather than the rule. I
suppose we can thank Microsoft for not bundling a free compiler
with each version of Windows. What's an end user going to do with
source code and no compiler? Even AbiWord requires Microsoft Visual
C++ ($109 and up) to build.</p><p>AbiWord's source code is approximately 90% cross-platform and
around 10% platform-specific. After evaluating the wxWindows
cross-platform GUI toolkit (and nearly choosing it), they decided
to implement their own cross-platform library. AbiWord is written
in C++ and uses the GTK toolkit for its UNIX GUI (and the Win32 API
for its Windows GUI). Ports are underway for both BeOS and
Macintosh. In fact, you can see the directories &ldquo;beos&rdquo; and
&ldquo;mac&rdquo; in the latest source code tree.</p><p>Windows users expect word processors to be WYSIWYG. This
allows the user to see what the printed document will look like, as
they edit it. In the UNIX world, this is more difficult to
accomplish, and therefore less common. In order to achieve WYSIWYG
under Linux, you need to use Type 1 PostScript fonts for both
display and printing. (PostScript is a page description programming
language for printers.) Many X servers (such as XFree86 for Linux)
include PostScript fonts, but do not include the associated metric
files needed to use the fonts for printing. AbiWord users are
required to install a set of fonts taken from GhostScript (an Open
Source PostScript interpreter) and update their X server
configuration to recognize the new fonts. The PostScript fonts are
used by the X server to display the text and by AbiWord to generate
PostScript output to the printer. As of AbiWord 0.5.5, installing
the PostScript fonts involves hand editing files, but this process
will be automated in future releases.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13e4580.0x14dcbe0"></a>The Business Model</h2></div></div><p>Unlike Netscape, AbiSource does not have millions of dollars
in other product sales to fund development. Until AbiWord 1.0 is
ready, AbiSource will have to rely on a combination of revenue from
their previous contracting work and funding from outside sources.
AbiSource currently has some investors and is in the process of
looking for more.</p><p>When AbiWord 1.0 ships to end users later this year,
AbiSource will begin offering services and support to generate
revenue. There is a large and always-growing demand for desktop
office tools. Eric believes AbiWord will attract users &ldquo;who value
the advantages offered by community-developed Open Source
software.&rdquo;</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13e4580.0x14dcd40"></a>Future Development</h2></div></div><p>Although I found AbiWord 0.5.5 stable enough to write this
article, it is still considered a developer release. AbiWord 1.0
should be available by the end of the year. AbiSource plans to
continue development of its AbiSuite software. The next application
will be AbiFile, a personal database manager and then a
presentation manager called AbiShow. Gnumeric (the spreadsheet
under development for the GNOME project) will serve as AbiCalc.
AbiSource's role in Gnumeric development will be to make it
cross-platform. Additionally, support for importing and exporting
documents in formats like RTF, MS Word, Word Perfect and HTML will
be a high priority. These tools will be developed as modules and
will be ideal opportunities for outside developers to contribute to
the project.</p><p>Asked where he sees the company in a few years, Eric
replied,</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>We expect to succeed. The existence of a
full-featured, cross-platform, open-source office suite will bring
substantial change to the software industry. We expect to be the
company that brings that change. It's going to be a fun
ride.</p></blockquote></div><p><a href="3545s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
