offer an Internet connection with a high download speed to a local
computer network. It is based on a small computer running Caldera
OpenLinux that includes a receiver card to connect to a DirecPC
dish. You connect the system to your local network via Ethernet.
The system then routes outbound traffic to your ISP via a 56K
modem. Inbound traffic is received via the satellite disk and
routed back to the appropriate host on your local network.

</p><p>All your local network does is treat the Helius box as a
gateway. It then handles all the interaction to ensure your traffic
is routed properly. The result is much like an ADSL connection to
the Internet with IP masquerading thrown in, so you can connect a
whole network to the Internet with only one IP address.</p><p>The system works just the way an experienced Linux hacker
would expect. It takes advantage of Linux's built-in masquerading
and demand-dial capabilities. You connect the internal modem to a
phone line, the receiver card to a DirecPC dish and the 10BaseT
Ethernet port to your local network. When a system on your local
network requests something from the Internet, the Helius box calls
up your ISP, sends out the data and waits to receive data via the
dish. When the data is received, the Helius box then routes it back
to the requesting system on your local network.</p><p>You may be thinking that this system is the same as the one
offered by DirecPC&mdash;it is not. The standard DirecPC system offers
connectivity for a single PC, not a network. That is fine for a
single home user, but not for a multiple-system network.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2431580.0x2529df0"></a>Installing the System</h2></div></div><p>Helius offers installs for under $200, but I elected to do
the install myself. After all, why not get the full experience?
Helius sent me a dish and I went out and bought a dish installation
kit for $60. It included the necessary cables, connectors and even
a compass to aim the dish.</p><p>I hooked up the dish and did a preliminary aim based on
numbers furnished by Helius. I then hooked up a keyboard and
monitor to the Helius system. (They don't come with it and are
needed only for the dish install.) Armed with a primitive but
effective program and an assistant, I got the system up and
running. This process took a few minutes and mostly consisted of me
yelling out numbers to my assistant while she moved the
dish.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3526f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2.
</p></div></div><p>Once up, I connected the system to my network and the phone
line and was off and running. I set the gateway addresses on the
machines on my network to correspond to the address of the Helius
box and started talking to the Internet. That was it. The Helius
box dialed my ISP and routed packets without incident.</p><p>As far as performance, I had trouble finding sites that would
test the capabilities of the system. Helius claims transfer rates
of up to three megabits per second. I saw rates of 37KB per second
doing an FTP access to SSC's FTP server and a 31KB per second
transfer rate to the same server while simultaneously saving Usenet
news. With my usual transfer rates at 4KB per second on my 56K
modem, I am rather pleased with these new rates.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2431580.0x252a1b8"></a>Who Needs It?</h2></div></div><p>While this system is not the answer for everyone, it
certainly has an audience. If you are a small company or school
that needs an Internet connection with high download bandwidth,
this is an ideal system. In an area where ADSL is available, you
need to evaluate the pros and cons of DSL versus this wireless
technology. If DSL is not available in your area, this system seems
like an easy win.</p><p>Handling tens of users is easily attained with a minimal
setup and monthly cost.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2431580.0x252a318"></a>Costs</h2></div></div><p>The system costs $2499 for up to 30 concurrent users. This
includes 90 days of support/maintenance. Extended support is
available in the US for $299/year. Add to this the cost of the
dish, about $300, and if you elect to, about $180 for
installation.</p><p>In addition to the cost of the system, you need to pay for
monthly service from DirecPC and your ISP. DirecPC charges
$109.99/month for the first 200 hours of connectivity and $.99 for
each additional hour. ISP costs vary. What I see in Seattle is
around $20/month for the first 100 hours, $.50/hour after that.
Thus, for under $200/month you can get 200 hours of on-line time
with a fast download transfer rate.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2431580.0x252a478"></a>Is the Helius Satellite Router for You?</h2></div></div><p>This question boils down to, &ldquo;do you need a fast download
system for a network?&rdquo; If so, the Helius Satellite Router is an
ideal solution. It is capable of talking to a UNIX/Linux-, Windows-
or Macintosh-based network, easy to install and performs well at a
reasonable cost.</p></div></div>
