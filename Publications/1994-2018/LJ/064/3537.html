settled down. All the major distributions now seem to have an
offering with a 2.2 kernel and glibc 2.1, and work has started on
the 2.3 kernel. I am looking forward to a journaling file system,
but it will undoubtedly require a particular format when it is
introduced. After transitioning from a.out to ELF, then from libc5
to glibc, I should be used to it, but it is still mildly annoying.
It is probably a good idea though, as it allows me to get rid of
the chaff. I also have a few packages that compiled under
glibc-2.0.7 which will not compile under glibc-2.1, but I am
hopeful these will be patched soon.

</p><p>The particular version of Open Business Management I
downloaded (the latest at the time) is not complete, but has most
of the required functionality. The documentation (TODO file) points
to much work yet to be done, but this package will have a great
deal of potential once it is nearer to completion. Separate web
pages allow you to insert, find or modify company, contact or deal
information. The use of &ldquo;themes&rdquo; is a nice touch and allows
anyone to tailor the look, although it is not as important as the
missing administration module. It requires Apache, php3 compiled
with MySQL, MySQL and a web browser.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x275d580.0x28558c8"></a>gensig:</h2></div></div><p><a href="http://www.geeks.com/~robf/gensig" target="_self">http://www.geeks.com/~robf/gensig/</a>
</p><p>Need or want to have different signature lines?
<span   class="bold"><b>gensig</b></span> will read a text file (one
is included with <span   class="bold"><b>gensig</b></span> as an
example) and go through selecting successive lines for each new
outgoing mail message. The program looks for tag lines in files in
various locations, including (first) the user's home directory, so
each user can have his own tag-lines file, or the generic one can
be expanded. It requires glibc.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x275d580.0x2855b30"></a>xchat:</h2></div></div><p><a href="http://xchat.linuxpower.org" target="_self">http://xchat.linuxpower.org/</a>
</p><p>IRC is not a program I use much. I personally find it too
time-consuming and intrusive. I much prefer e-mail or a forum such
as <span   class="bold"><b>wwwthreads</b></span> (below) to handle
communication. However, <span   class="bold"><b>xchat</b></span> is a
very friendly program for first-time IRC users. The program comes
with several preselected servers programmed in, but can be easily
changed. The program opens in two boxes: one for chatting, the
other to manage connections. It requires gtk+1.2, glib-1.2, libgdk,
libgmodule, libdl, Xext, X11, libm, libnsl, libdb, libpthread and
glibc.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x275d580.0x2855d98"></a>wwwthreads:</h2></div></div><p><a href="http://www.wwwthreads.org" target="_self">http://www.wwwthreads.org/</a>
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>wwwthreads</b></span> provides all the
functionality of forums found on bulletin boards. Any number of
forums can be created, and users may be designated administrators
for boards. Posts can be public or private, and forum users can
elect to have forum messages e-mailed at each posting or only for
private postings. Administration, posting and reading are all done
through a web interface, making administration simple. This program
should be fast and powerful, capable of handling large message
loads and thousands of messages due to its use of a MySQL server as
the back end. It requires Apache, MySQL, Perl 5 and the Perl
modules DBI, DBD, Data Dumper and Data ShowTable.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x275d580.0x2855fa8"></a>NetLED:</h2></div></div><p><a href="http://mars.ark.com/~mbevan/products/netled.shtml" target="_self">mars.ark.com/~mbevan/products/netled.shtml</a>
</p><p>Most systems have Ethernet cards with a link light on them.
The problem is, the link light is on the card and can be seen only
from the back of the system, an inconvenience at best.
<span   class="bold"><b>NetLED</b></span> allows you to use the LEDs
on the keyboard to indicate the status of the network as seen by
<span   class="bold"><b>ifconfig</b></span>. By default, the &ldquo;caps
lock&rdquo; key indicates send, &ldquo;scroll lock&rdquo; indicates receive, and
&ldquo;number lock&rdquo; indicates carrier. This can be changed as desired
via a configuration file. It requires glibc.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x275d580.0x2856210"></a>ntop:</h2></div></div><p><a href="http://www-serra.unipi.it/~ntop" target="_self">http://www-serra.unipi.it/~ntop/</a>
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>ntop</b></span> is to the network as
<span   class="bold"><b>top</b></span> is to your system. That
statement may be selling ntop short. The
<span   class="bold"><b>curses</b></span> version certainly shows a
top kind of view of your network and is configurable just like top,
but it can also be viewed with a web browser and has pages of
colorful, easy-to-read data. This program tells you almost
everything about your network. Be careful; this program presents a
possible security vulnerability if non-privileged users are allowed
access. Since it can <span   class="emphasis"><em>see</em></span> all network traffic
and read passwords passed in the clear, it is in effect sniffing
your network. It requires ncurses, libpthread and glibc.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x275d580.0x2856528"></a>stickerbook:</h2></div></div><p><a href="http://users.powernet.co.uk/kienzle/stickers/index.html" target="_self">users.powernet.co.uk/kienzle/stickers/index.html</a>
</p><p>This sticker book is an excellent program for children 3 to 7
years of age. It is even easy to use for adults who have not yet
mastered the GIMP. The program can be configured to have a large,
easy-to-use pointer that is constrained to the program box. Three
scenes are available, and the author is looking for assistance in
creating a few more. It is about time we have something for little
hands. My four year old has been logging in for almost a year, but
could only play with the screen saver, and even that with some
difficulty since it is a small icon and smaller pointer. Now I may
never get a chance to use my own system.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x275d580.0x28566e0"></a>xhangglider:</h2></div></div><p><a href="http://plaza.harmonix.ne.jp/~redstar" target="_self">http://plaza.harmonix.ne.jp/~redstar/</a>
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>xhangglider</b></span> is a cute little
