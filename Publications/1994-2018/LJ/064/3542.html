<b  >mkinitrd /boot/initrd-2.2.5.img 2.2.5</b>, the
system returns:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
mount: the kernel does not recognize /dev/loop0 as a block device
Can't get a loopback device
</pre><p>What should I do? What has gone wrong? &mdash;Mun Hon Tham,
mhtham@cyberway.com.sg
</p><p>For some reason, automatic module loading is broken (you
could do <b  >modprobe loop</b> to load the module by
hand). I am willing to bet you installed all the updates from the
Red Hat FTP site, including the new modutils from the 2.2
directory. Unfortunately, modutils has a completely broken kerneld
that causes the message you are seeing. I do not know why Red Hat
hasn't taken that broken package off their FTP site. In the
meantime, all you need to do is downgrade to the previous modutils
by typing:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
rpm -U --force modutils-version.i386.rpm

must be below cylinder 1023. My hard drive has 1400 cylinders. How
do I find out which cylinders are not being used and if /boot will
fit below cylinder 1023?</p><p>I will be using a dual-boot system with a DOS partition. My
hard drive is 10.9GB and DOS/Windows is the primary partition,
using 4.5GB. Can you help? &mdash;Jason Hipsher,
Jclive@netscape.net</p><p>The most important factor that slips up new users is LBA mode
drives. Logical Block Addressing translates cylinders into heads,
dividing one by two and multiplying the other by two, so the
numbers still work but you have fewer cylinders.</p><p>The problem is that with a 10GB drive, you most
likely do not have 1400 cylinders. You probably have far
more, and LBA is enabled on your drive (this is done in your BIOS
and is normally enabled by default). You cannot turn it off without
reloading your DOS/Windows partition.</p><p>You may be able to use the &ldquo;linear&rdquo;
addressing feature in LILO to get around this problem, but it
doesn't always work. A neat trick I use to get around the issue is
to create a small (8MB is usually more than enough) partition at
the very start of my drive to store my kernels. You may need
PartitionMagic or some other partition-manipulation tool to do this
without loss of data, but it will give you a place to store files
that is guaranteed to be lower than the 1024th cylinder. You can
then mount this at boot time (I put it under /img), so you can
store your kernels there. Linux itself can be anywhere on the
drive.  &mdash;Chad Robinson, chadr@brt.com</p><p>Using the installation's
<span   class="bold"><b>fdisk</b></span> (or disk druid), create the
partitions you will need with the first one for DOS/Windows. Then
separate a small (64-128MB) partition for swap and the rest for
Linux. When you finish your installation, make sure you pick &ldquo;MBR
install&rdquo; for LILO.  &mdash;Mario Bittencourt, mneto@argo.com.br</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15fc580.0x16f4768"></a>X Windows vs. X11</h2></div></div><p>What, if any, is the difference between X11 and X Windows? It
seems as though both terms can be used interchangeably, but at the
same time, it seems as if they are different servers. Is X Windows
a shell or server on top of X11, or are they entirely different? I
am not talking about look and feel, but the basic meaning.  &mdash;Chris,
kender_kin@hotmail.com</p><p>The terms are often used interchangeably, which can be
confusing. The &ldquo;official&rdquo; name for X is &ldquo;The X Window System&rdquo;.
Some purists get irritated when people say &ldquo;X Windows&rdquo;, but it's
usually safe to say &ldquo;X&rdquo;.</p><p>You are actually talking about the same program. What's
different is that the first term (X11) refers to the specific
version of X. You're actually missing part of it&mdash;an Rx is usually
included after it. For example, X11R5 refers to a popular and still
commonly seen release. X11R6 is what most new Linux distributions
are shipping with now (in the form of XFree86, an open-source
distribution of X).  &mdash;Chad Robinson, chadr@brt.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15fc580.0x16f4920"></a>Another X Question</h2></div></div><p>When I type <b  >startx</b>, the response I get
is:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
X11TransSocketUNIXConnect : Can't connect: errno = 111
giving up
xinit: Connection refused(errno 111) unable to connect to X server
xinit: no such process(errno 3) server error
</pre><p>Now, this is kind of irritating&mdash;I have used XF86config, but
it doesn't seem to have the driver for the SIS6215 (4MB RAM). We
have had X up, but only after we made some adjustments&mdash;we could
view it in only 16 colors. Since this is just the 2.0.36 kernel, is
there a chance that I must upgrade it? Do I need to get the
XFree3.3.3 version to get this thing alive? (The school's hardware
is a P166, SIS6215 videocard, Digital screen.) Do I have to
reconfigure everything, or maybe install the new kernel
and XFree version?  &mdash;Mathias Bakkejord,
chenrazee@hotmail.com
</p><p>The newer the X version you use, the better your chances of
finding a driver designed for your card. Upgrading your Linux
kernel won't help here, although there are other good reasons to do
so.</p><p>However, you can probably get your card working in at least
256-color mode by using the SVGA driver. This is a good idea
anyway, since it will give you a chance to learn what the clock
rate and refresh settings for your card and monitor need to be. It
would be a good idea to try this before trying to find a specific
driver for your card.  &mdash;Chad Robinson, chadr@brt.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15fc580.0x16f4be0"></a>Changing the Login Prompt</h2></div></div><p>I would like to change the pre-login banner on my Red Hat 5.1
system; however, each time I change /etc/issue, &ldquo;the system&rdquo;
changes it back. How do I get around this? &mdash;Philip Lowe,
uplowe@mcs.drexel.edu</p><p>The banner file /etc/issue is created by the script file
/etc/rc.d/rc.local which runs whenever the machine is booted. In
order to modify the issue file, you'll need to edit the relevant
lines in rc.local; either comment out the lines that overwrite the
current issue file, or incorporate your changes so the script
generates the file you are after. The lines in question are
documented with comments, so you should have no problem finding the
lines to change.  &mdash;Vince Waldon,

OpenLinux 2.2 and have configured KDE, etc. I want to use
<span   class="bold"><b>kppp</b></span> to dial up to the Internet.
However, when I attempt to dial up, I get an error message
indicating &ldquo;Sorry, the modem is busy.&rdquo;</p><p>I have run LISA to install the modem on /dev/ttys1 (Com Port
2). I have tried setting kppp to /dev/modem/ and several other tty
devices (when set to ttys0, I get a different message indicating
the modem cannot be found). The modem is an internal US Robotics,
56K modem (not a winmodem). All attempts to
access the modem (e.g., via Test Modem in the kppp setup) result in
the same message.</p><p>I have referenced several texts, including the <span   class="emphasis"><em>kppp
Handbook</em></span> and followed all the tips; but the modem still
has the same problem. I have researched the Internet newsgroups
where several other people have mentioned this issue, but no one
seemed able to answer the question.  &mdash;Shannon Brown,
linux@rubicongulch.com</p><p>Make sure you have no lock file for your modem. Your first
attempts to set it up may have accidentally terminated a process
before it could remove its lock file. You normally find these in
/var/spool/locks, depending on the program that creates the lock.
You should probably use /dev/ttyS1 (note the upper case S) to
access your modem if it is on COM2 (or /dev/ttyS0 for COM1).  &mdash;Chad
Robinson, chadr@brt.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15fc580.0x16f5000"></a>Enabling lockd</h2></div></div><p>I don't know how to use PCNFSD to enable
<span   class="bold"><b>lockd</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>share</b></span>. Red Hat technical support
refuses to answer me. Where can I get documentation and how can I
implement lockd? &mdash;Joan Cartigny, cartigny@bourely.com</p><p>Last I checked, the tech support you get with a Red Hat box
is installation tech support, not detailed configuration. If you
need configuration tech support, you need to purchase a support
contract with Red Hat, LinuxCare or another provider.</p><p>Are you sure you mean PCNFSD which is used only by
some DOS/Windows clients? If you mean NFS, you need to use
<span   class="bold"><b>knfsd</b></span> to get lockd
support, and for this, you should use a 2.2.x kernel. You can
upgrade yourself, or get Red Hat 6.0 which includes them by
default.  &mdash;Marc Merlin, marc@merlins.org</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15fc580.0x16f52c0"></a>KDE and Slackware</h2></div></div><p>I'm trying to install KDE. When I try to run it, it says I'm
missing libstdc++2.9. I asked about this on a mailing list and was
told that I was probably missing a C compile library. I then added
every C compiler listed in disk d1 to my Slackware 3.6
installation. Still didn't have libstdc++2.9. On an official KDE
site, it says I'm supposed to edit the .xinitrc file, but when I
attempt to do that in <span   class="bold"><b>vi</b></span>, it says
.xinitrc is not a regular file and then declines to edit it.</p><p>Any and all information about the Slackware 3.6 installation
of KDE would be helpful.  &mdash;Lisa Zuckerman,
blueink@netzero.net</p><p>This is bad news because .xinitrc is a regular text
file&mdash;perhaps yours is corrupted.</p><p>Slackware is missing many recent libraries and is still using
libc5. If you grabbed KDE binaries, they are most likely compiled
against glibc, and they won't work on your machine. libstdc++ is a
C++ library that comes with glibc, I believe.</p><p>You can find and install all the libraries yourself, but I
recommend switching distributions. The most recent ones have KDE
built-in. Slackware is usually a year behind, although a more
recent version of Slackware may help.  &mdash;Marc Merlin,
marc@merlins.org</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15fc580.0x16f5580"></a>Font Problems Across Platforms</h2></div></div><p>I have MkLinux installed on my Macintosh notebook computer
(PB 3400/200). When I am at work, I like to use my Sun (Ultra 2) to
display Windows from my powerbook. To do this, I use telnet to get
to my powerbook from the Sun:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
setenv DISPLAY <span   class="emphasis"><em>SunComputerName</em></span>
</pre><p>At the Sun prompt, I type:
<pre     class="programlisting">
xhost + <span   class="emphasis"><em>MacName</em></span>
</pre>


Now I can display xv, Netscape, xterms, Ghostview, etc. to my nice
Sun video monitor. But I can't seem to get Applixware or LyX to do
the same. Applixware complains that it doesn't know the font path
(X-Server problem&mdash;unable to access fonts). LyX displays a window
with a splash screen, but it dies as soon as I try to open a
document or start a new one.  &mdash;Vince D. Dupperron, vince@shellus.com
</p><p>You are apparently missing fonts on the Sun machine. I
believe Applixware has some documentation on how to run the
application remotely or over NFS. The idea is that you must install
the required fonts on your Sun. LyX probably has the same
problem.  &mdash;Marc Merlin, marc@merlins.org</p></div></div>
