    Remote sensing software is being developed using the Open
    Source model by the web project at remotesensing.org.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb0b580.0xc03558"></a></h2></div></div><p>Wouldn't you like to fly through space
like Peter Pan and view the earth from above, explore another
country, and find out what exotic places are like while never
leaving your own home? That is what satellite and aerial images
from space can provide for you. The technology exists to do this,
but it would take thousands of technologists to develop the
programming capabilities for the average global consumer to access
such a &ldquo;View of the World&rdquo;. This has long been a quest for
governments and researchers around the globe. The problem is
satellite and aerial images are geospatial data and contain more
raw data and information than can be easily dealt with.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb0b580.0xc03660"></a>The Fascination with the Earth from
Space</h2></div></div><p>Everyone is fascinated with images from space which provide
close up views of earth. Whether the image is used to study the
commodities market for agriculture or provide outstanding graphics
to help us catch the bad guy in a spy novel or a stunning backdrop
for a James Bond movie, we all want to see more. Today's satellite
and aerial technology allows us to see the earth from space with
increasing detail. Typically, scientific applications of this earth
imagery are making their way into the commercial world through real
estate offices, investment banks, flight simulators and even the
placement of wireless signal towers. Several new high-resolution
satellites will be added this year to provide images where one
pixel will represent one square meter of the earth's surface.
Earlier satellites provided only 28- and 10-meter resolution. This
much resolution means even more data to manage.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb0b580.0xc03768"></a>Technology Brings Space to Our Industry</h2></div></div><p>How can the average consumer take advantage of this exotic
information from space? Until now, he couldn't, but ImageLinks,
Inc., of Melbourne, Florida, a division of AGIS, is changing all
this with a web site for open-source development of remote-sensing
software. Mark Lucas, the chief technical officer of ImageLinks,
Inc. struck a harmonious chord among programmers worldwide when he
opened remotesensing.org. Remote sensing is the term used to refer
to images collected by remote cameras and other sensors from space.
These cameras are located on satellites and high-altitude
airplanes.</p><p>Only with the advent of the Linux operating system could an
open-source project like this be considered. Linux provides the
software for porting applications and a platform for development.
Without Linux, Mark Lucas might not have been able to propose the
adoption of the open-source development model for the
remote-sensing software industry.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb0b580.0xc038c8"></a>Open Source Development Brings Space to Your
Doorstep</h2></div></div><p>remotesensing.org is currently consolidating existing
open-source remote sensing and GIS tools as well as developing new
libraries and applications. Currently, three separate development
efforts are at the site:</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>LIMP</b></span>, the large image
manipulation program, is headed up by Valient Gough and will evolve
into the centerpiece for subsequent image processing applications.
Val is the author of OrthoVista and works for StellaCore
Corporation.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>GeoTIFF</b></span> is led by Frank
Warmerdam for the development of the leading commercial standard
for geospatial tiff files. Frank was the chief architect for PCI's
ImageWorks, GCPWorks, GeoGateway technology and most of the
existing GeoTiff code. He works as a contract developer.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>DEMtools</b></span> is led by Brian
Maddox and is a collection of conversion programs, libraries and
tools for handling the topographic elevation data sets used in
remote sensing. Brian works as a computer scientist for the USGS
Mid-Continent Mapping Center.</p><p>With over 250 exceptional programming contributors and
business specialists, Mark Lucas stated:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>We have really made a big hit in the remote
sensing community. There are thousands of people in this industry
who just don't have the resources and technology to develop the
software applications and algorithms alone. But with hundreds of us
working together, we will be able to develop the keys to unlock the
data to make it easy to access and view by the average (or
unscientific) global consumer. Whether the consumer just wants to
see a picture of his own backyard or view the deforestation of the
Brazilian rain forest or the B-9 iceberg near the South Pole, he
will be able to do this, and it won't cost him thousands of dollars
for the software.</p></blockquote></div><p>Open-source software development enables the development of
software algorithms without spending thousands of dollars for
commercial applications. Open-source software development speeds up
the development time, produces high-quality code and allows for the
maintenance and distribution of the software to be completed by
users from around the world on the Net. The tools and source
available at remotesensing.org will be released under an
open-source license and the absolute beauty of this is that it's
free.
</p><p>Also, remotesensing.org provides a place for open
communication between academics, government organizations,
entrepreneurial developers and the business community. It has long
been a problem to establish communication between these diverse
groups. remotesensing.org has already begun to bridge these gaps as
is demonstrated by the highly influential participants eagerly
sharing their ideas, along with valuable code. This prestigious
group of participants consists of NASA engineers, well-known
remote-sensing business specialists, developers from well-known
software companies and progressive student programmers at leading
universities around the world.</p><p>The site already has a well-established program for
development. ImageLinks, Inc. created and hosts remotesensing.org.
Current work includes:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Collecting changes</p></li><li><p>Helping authors synchronize their work</p></li><li><p>Operating discussion forums (mailing lists and
newsgroups)</p></li><li><p>Coordinating bug lists</p></li><li><p>Keeping track of and publicizing &ldquo;work in
progress&rdquo;</p></li><li><p>Providing &ldquo;roadmaps&rdquo; to the code and projects
based on the code</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb0b580.0xc04268"></a>The Highway Ahead</h2></div></div><p>What does this mean for the remote-sensing community and the
global consumer? An unparalleled opportunity exists to allow the
average consumer to see and understand information about our world
that otherwise might not be possible for many years. The flood of
raw data about our earth does us no good if we cannot turn it into
information which provides broad uses to impact our socioeconomic
problems in this borderless world.</p><p>remotesensing.org is dedicated to providing the world with
affordable data and information capabilities to allow us to take
better care of the world. What better way to do this than to bring
the finest minds together in the Open Source world which Linux has
created and allow them to do just that&mdash;create?</p><p><a href="3418s1.html" target="_self">Acknowledgments</a></p></div></div>
