put on a good show for the Linux community. Bigger and better than
ever, Linux Expo again doubled in size and attracted top speakers
such as Dr. Peter Braam of Carnegie Mellon University) and Dr.
Theodore Ts'o, of MIT, who now works for VA Linux Systems. Big
business was there too, represented by such companies as IBM,
Hewlett Packard and SGI (formerly Silicon Graphics), as well as the
usual Linux vendors, such as SuSE, Caldera, VA Linux Systems,
Enhanced Software Technologies, Cygnus and many others.

</p><p>I talked to Dave McAllister of SGI about their involvement in
Linux and Open Source and found SGI to be much more committed to
this community than I would have suspected. They released their
most robust and scalable file system, XFS, to the community in an
effort to aid Linux in reaching what he called &ldquo;Enterprise
level&rdquo;. This is certainly something that was applauded by everyone
I talked to at the show.</p><p>One of the most exciting announcements before the show was
O'Reilly's and HP's sourceXchange.com web site. I attended a
discussion about this site, which is designed to aid in getting
needed open source developed by obtaining sponsors who will pay
developers to write the code they need and then release it to the
public. This is an idea whose time has come, as another group has
also started a web site for the same purpose&mdash;this one is
CoSource.com from a couple of independents, Bernie Thompson and
Norman Jacobowitz, who write for <i  >LJ</i>. It's
obvious that Bernie, Norman and O'Reilly are committed to the
community and wish to drive open source development, but I was a
bit suspicious of HP. When I asked about HP's motives for
involvement in this project, Wayne Caccamo told me HP felt this
project was inevitable and wanted to take a leadership role
<span   class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span> they wanted to &ldquo;ingratiate&rdquo; themselves
to the Open Source community&mdash;talk about honesty! After that
remark, I was ready to believe anything. I'm looking forward to
seeing how both these sites work out. (For more on this subject,
see Bernie Thompson's article in this issue, &ldquo;Market Making in the
Bazaar&rdquo;.)</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3557f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div><p>There were the usual fun things to do, such as a chili pepper
sauce contest and a paintball contest pitting vi against Emacs once
more. Once again vi won, proving it is the best editor available or
that its advocates are the best shots. More than one group bought
blocks of tickets to a local showing of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Star Wars&mdash;The
Phantom Menace</em></span>. The ALS (Atlanta Linux Showcase) group
invited me to go along with them. Fun movie.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3557f4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div><p>I especially enjoyed my booth time talking to current and
future readers and authors. In particular, it was a pleasure to
finally meet Alan Cox and Telsa Gwynne.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3557f6.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div><p>Alpha Processor, Inc., a Samsung company, announced they were
joining Linux International; Richard Payne and Guy Ludden presented
a check to Jon &ldquo;maddog&rdquo; Hall. I got the picture and then took
several others of Jon, including one with a people-size Tux, who
was roaming the show floor.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3557f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div><p>Compared to LinuxWorld, Linux Expo came across as more
polished, more &ldquo;we've done this before successfully&rdquo;. LinuxWorld
had a lot of glitz&mdash;electricity and energy filling the air&mdash;that
just wasn't there at Linux Expo. I think this mostly had to do with
the fact that it wasn't the first time for these guys&mdash;the
experience showed. The speakers all like Linux Expo better, as the
Expo paid their travel expenses while LinuxWorld left them to get
there on their own. LinuxWorld had more people and more vendors,
but they also have the advantage of being in Silicon Valley.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3557f7.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div><p>Evan Leibowitz described the Expo as &ldquo;the show where Linux
lost its innocence&rdquo; due to two unpleasant situations that arose.
One was Pacific HiTech's being kicked out for passing out t-shirts
without buying booth space. The other was the use of the Red Hat
trademark without permission, by LinuxCare on their poster
parodying a Palm Pilot ad. No matter which side you took on these
incidents&mdash;the calling of lawyers certainly signals the &ldquo;end of
innocence&rdquo;.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3557f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div><p>The show was definitely a success. I talked to Bob Young on
the last day, and he certainly seemed pleased with how it had
turned out. See my interview with Bob in this issue. For vendor
announcements, see &ldquo;UpFront&rdquo;.</p></div></div>
