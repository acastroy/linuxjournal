    Terminal and xterm prompts can be created incorporating
    standard escape sequences to give user name, current working
    directory, time and more.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc65580.0xd5d348"></a></h2></div></div><p>Descended from the Bourne shell, Bash
(Bourne Again Shell) is a GNU product that is the standard
command-line interface on most Linux machines. It excels at
interactivity, supporting command-line editing, completion and
recall. It also supports configurable prompts&mdash;most people realize
this, but may not realize how useful it can be.
</p><p>Most Linux systems have a default prompt in one color (gray)
that includes your user name, the name of the machine you are
working on and your current working directory. In addition, you can
display even more information, use ANSI colors and manipulate the
title bar of an xterm to provide useful information.</p><p>Beyond looking cool, prompts are also useful for keeping
track of system information. One idea with appeal to many is the
use of different color prompts on different machines. If you have
several xterms open on different machines or if you tend to forget
which machine you are working on, you'll find this a great
reminder.</p><p>To change your prompt, you need a basic understanding of
shell programming and UNIX utilities. The more you know, the more
complex the prompts you will be able to create.</p><p>The appearance of the prompt is governed by the shell
variable <b  >PS1</b>. Command continuations are
indicated by the <b  >PS2</b> string, which can be
modified in exactly the same way. Since controlling it is exactly
the same, I'll mostly be modifying the <b  >PS1</b>
string. (<b  >PS3</b> and <b  >PS4</b> strings
are also available, but are never seen by the average user. See the
Bash man page if you're interested in their purpose.) To change the
way the prompt appears, change the <b  >PS1</b> variable.
For experimentation purposes, the <b  >PS1</b> string can
be entered at the prompt to show the results immediately. Doing so
affects only your current session. If you want to make a permanent
change, modify the ~/.bashrc file by adding the new definition of
<b  >PS1</b>. If you have root permission, you can modify
the <b  >PS1=</b> line in the /etc/profile file. On some
distributions (Red Hat 5.1 at least), the /etc/bashrc file
overrides the /etc/profile setting of <b  >PS1</b> and
<b  >PS2</b>.</p><p>My default prompt includes my user name &ldquo;giles&rdquo;, the name
of my work machine &ldquo;nikola&rdquo; and my home directory /home/giles.
The simplest prompt is a single character. I can change my default
prompt to a simple $ by typing:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
[giles@nikola giles]$ PS1="$ "
</pre><p>I use the quotes to force a space after the prompt, making it
more readable.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc65580.0xd5da80"></a>Escape Sequences</h2></div></div><p><a href="3215s1.html" target="_self">Bash 2.02 Man Page</a></p><p>Many escape sequences are offered by the Bash shell for
insertion in the prompt. See the sidebar which shows the Bash 2.02
man page.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ PS1="\u@\h \W&gt; "&lt;\n&gt;
giles@nikola giles&gt;
</pre><p>This example creates a prompt that is close to the default on
most Linux distributions. I wanted a slightly different appearance,
so I changed it to include the time by typing:
<pre     class="programlisting">
giles@nikola giles&gt; PS1="[ ][\u@\h:\w]$ "&lt;\n&gt;
[21:52:01][giles@nikola:~]$
</pre>


Bash also provides an environment variable called
<b  >PROMPT_COMMAND</b>. The contents of this variable
are executed as a regular Bash command just before Bash displays a
prompt.
<pre     class="programlisting">
[21:55:01][giles@nikola:~] PS1="[\u@\h:\w]$ "&lt;\n&gt;
[giles@nikola:~] PROMPT_COMMAND="date +%H%M"
2155
[giles@nikola:~] ls
bin   mail
2156
[giles@nikola:~]$ unset PROMPT_COMMAND
[giles@nikola:~]
</pre>


In this example, I changed <b  >PS1</b> by eliminating
the escape sequence, so that time was no longer a part of the
prompt. Then I used <b  >date +%H%M</b> to display the
time in a format I like better. At the end, I used the
<span   class="bold"><b>unset</b></span> command to remove the
<b  >PROMPT_COMMAND</b> environment variable.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc65580.0xd5df50"></a>External Commands</h2></div></div><p>As I discuss the use of external commands in prompts, I'll
use the <b  >$(command)</b> convention for command
substitution; that is,</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$(date +%H%M)
</pre><p>means &ldquo;substitute the output from the <b  >date
+%H%M</b> command here.&rdquo; This works in Bash 1.14.7 and 2.0+.
In some older versions of Bash, you may need to use backquotes
(<b  >`date +%H%M`</b>). Backquotes can be used in Bash
2.0+ but are being phased out in favor of <b  >$()</b>,
which nests better. If you are using an earlier version of Bash,
substitute backquotes wherever you see <b  >$()</b>. If
the command substitution is escaped (i.e.,
<b  >\$(command)</b> ), then use backslashes to escape
BOTH your backquotes (i.e., <b  >\`command\`</b>).
</p><p>You don't want to insert much material from an external
command into the prompt, as a prompt of great length may be
created. You also want to use a fast command, because it will be
executed each time your prompt appears on the screen. Delays in the
appearance of the prompt while you are working can be
annoying.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
[giles@nikola:~]$ PS1="[\$(date +%H%M)][\u@\h:\w]$ "[2159][giles@nikola:~]$
</pre><p>Note the backslash before the dollar sign of the command
substitution. Without it, the external command is executed exactly
once: when the <b  >PS1</b> string is read into the
environment. For this prompt, it would display the same time no
matter how long the prompt was used. The backslash prevents
immediate shell interpretation of the command, so
<span   class="bold"><b>date</b></span> is called each time a prompt
is generated.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc65580.0xd5e528"></a>Shell Scripts</h2></div></div><p>Linux comes with many small utility programs such as
<span   class="bold"><b>date</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>grep</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>wc</b></span> which allow you to manipulate
data. If you wish to create complex combinations of these programs
within a prompt, it may be easier to make a shell script and call
it from the prompt. An example of a small shell script used within
a prompt is given in Listing 1.</p><p><a href="3215l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1. Shell Script for Use in
Prompt</a></p><p>I keep this as a shell script in my ~/bin directory, which is
in my path. Use it in a prompt in this way:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
[2203][giles@nikola:~]$ PS1="[\u@\h:\w (\$(lsbytesum) Mb)]\$ "[giles@nikola:~ (0 Mb)]$ cd /bin
[giles@nikola:/bin (4.498 Mb)]$
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc65580.0xd5e898"></a>Non-Printing Escape Sequence</h2></div></div><p>Non-printing escape sequences can be used to produce
interesting effects in prompts. to use these escape sequences, you
need to enclose them in \[ and \], telling bash to ignore this
material while calculating the size of the prompt. failing to
include these delimiters results in line editing code placing the
cursor in the wrong place, because it doesn't know the actual size
of the prompt. escape sequences must also be preceded by \033[ in
bash prior to version 2 or by either \033[ or \e[ in later
versions.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc65580.0xd5e9a0"></a>xterm title bar</h2></div></div><p>this example modifies the title bar of an xterm window. if
you try to change the title bar of an xterm with your prompt when
you are at the console, you'll produce garbage in your prompt. to
avoid this problem, test the <b  >term</b> environment
variable to determine if your prompt is going to be in an xterm. if
the shell is an xterm, the shell variable
(<b  >${titlebar}</b>) is defined. it consists of the
appropriate escape sequences, and <b  >\u@\h:\w</b>,
which puts
<span   class="emphasis"><em>user</em></span>@<span   class="emphasis"><em>machine</em></span>:<span   class="emphasis"><em> working
directory</em></span> in the xterm title bar. this is particularity
useful with minimized xterms, making them more rapidly
identifiable. the other material in this prompt should be familiar
from previous prompts we've created.</p><p><a href="3215l2.html" target="_self">listing 2. Function to Set
Titlebar</a></p><p>Listing 2 is a function that can be incorporated into
~/.bashrc. The function name can then be called to execute the
function. The function, like the <b  >PS1</b> string, is
stored in the environment. Once the <b  >PS1</b> string
is set by the function, you can remove the function from the
environment by typing <b  >unset proml</b>. Since the
prompt can't change from being in an xterm to being at the console,
the <b  >TERM</b> variable isn't tested each time the
prompt is generated.</p><p>I used continuation markers (backslashes) in the definition
of the prompt to allow it to be continued on multiple lines. This
improves readability, making it easier to modify and debug.</p><p>I define this as a function because this is how the Bash
Prompt package deals with prompts: it is not the only way to do it,
but it works well. As the prompts you use become more complex, it
becomes more and more cumbersome to type them in at the prompt and
more practical to create them in a text file. To test this example
at the prompt, save the function as a text file called &ldquo;proml&rdquo;.
The Bash <span   class="bold"><b>source</b></span> command can be
used to read the prompt function by typing:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
[giles@nikola:~ (0 Mb)]$ source proml

</pre><p>To execute the prompt function, type:
<pre     class="programlisting">
[giles@nikola:~ (0 Mb)]$ proml
</pre>


</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc65580.0xd559c0"></a>Color Text</h2></div></div><p>As mentioned before, non-printing escape sequences must be
enclosed in <b  >\[\033[ and \]</b>. For color escape
sequences, they must also be followed by a lowercase m. To include
blue text in the prompt:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
PS1="\[\033[34m\][\$(date +%H%M)][\u@\h:\w]$
"
</pre><p>The blue color that starts with the 34 color code is never
switched back to the regular gray, so any text you type after the
prompt is still in the color of the prompt. This is also a dark
shade of blue (very hard to read), so combining it with the bold
code might help:
<pre     class="programlisting">
PS1="\[\033[1;34m\][\$(date +%H%M)][\u@\h:\w]$\[\033[0;37m\] "
</pre>


The prompt is now in light blue, and it ends by switching the color
back to gray, which is the color most of us expect when we type.
</p><p><a href="3215s3.html" target="_self">Bash Color
Equivalences</a></p><p>Background colors can be set by using 44 for Blue background,
41 for a Red background, etc. No bold background colors are
available. Combinations can be used, e.g., Light Red text on a Blue
background: <b  >\[\033[44;1;31m\]</b>. Other codes
available include 4 for Underscore, 5 for Blink, 7 for Inverse and
8 for Concealed.</p><p><a href="3215l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3. elite
Function</a></p><p>The prompt I use most of the time is based on one called
&ldquo;elite2&rdquo; in the Bash Prompt package, which I have modified to
work better on a standard console (Listing 2). (The original uses
special xterm fonts.) I define the colors as temporary shell
variables for the sake of readability&mdash;it is easier to work with.
The <b  >GRAD1</b> variable is a check to determine what
terminal you are on, and it needs to be done only once. The prompt
you see looks like Figure 1.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3215f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. My Prompt
</p></div></div><p>The Bash Prompt package is available in beta at
http://bash.current.nu/ and is the work of several people,
co-ordinated by Rob Current. The package offers a simple way to use
multiple prompts or &ldquo;themes&rdquo;. Several of these prompts use the
extended VGA character set, so they look bad unless used with
special xterm fonts. The &ldquo;fire&rdquo; theme shown in Figure 2 requires
these fonts. See <span   class="emphasis"><em>Stumpy's ANSI Fonts</em></span> page at
http://home.earthlink.net/~us5zahns/enl/ansifont.html for
instructions on installing and using these fonts.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3215f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Fire Prompt from the Bash Prompt Package
</p></div></div><p>You can change the prompt in your current terminal using the
example elite function by typing <b  >source elite</b>
(assuming the elite function file is in your path) followed by
<b  >elite</b>. This leaves you with an extra function
(elite) in your environment space&mdash;if you want to clean up the
environment, type <b  >unset elite</b>.</p><p>This would seem like an ideal candidate for a small shell
script, but a script doesn't work here because a script cannot
change the environment of your current shell&mdash;it can change only
the environment of the subshell it runs in. Environment variables
of your current shell can be changed by environment functions. The
Bash Prompt package puts a function called
<span   class="bold"><b>callbashprompt</b></span> into your
environment, and while they don't document it, it can be called to
load any Bash Prompt theme on the fly. It looks in the theme
directory it installed, sources the function you requested, loads
it, then unsets the function.
<span   class="bold"><b>callbashprompt</b></span> wasn't intended to
be used this way and has no error checking, but it works quite
well.</p><p><a href="3215s2.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
