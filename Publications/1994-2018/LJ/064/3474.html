    Improving the way your site handles &ldquo;new&rdquo; labels using
    the popular Apache modules mod_perl.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a9b580.0x2b93558"></a></h2></div></div><p>Last month, we looked at those pesky
&ldquo;new&rdquo; labels that webmasters like to put on their sites. The
intention is good, pointing us to documents we are unlikely to have
seen before. In practice, the &ldquo;new&rdquo; labels are artificial,
telling us when the document was last published, rather than
whether it is actually new to us.
</p><p>The techniques we explored last month&mdash;server-side includes,
CGI programs, and templates&mdash;were interesting, but inefficient and
slow. This month, we will look at ways to speed up our performance
by using <span   class="bold"><b>mod_perl</b></span>, the Perl module
for the Apache server.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a9b580.0x2b93710"></a>What Is mod_perl?</h2></div></div><p>We have discussed mod_perl on previous occasions in this
column, but it is worth giving a quick introduction for those of
you who may have missed it. The Apache server is built of modules,
each of which handles a different part of the software's
functionality. One of the advantages of this architecture is that
it allows webmasters to customize their copy of Apache, including
or excluding modules as necessary. It also means programmers can
add functionality to Apache by writing new modules.</p><p>One of the most popular modules is mod_perl, which puts a
copy of the Perl language inside the Apache server. This provides
functionality on a number of levels, including the ability to set
the configuration directives in Perl (or conditional, depending on
whether or not certain Perl code executes). More significantly, it
allows us to write Perl modules that can modify Apache's
behavior.</p><p>When I say &ldquo;behavior&rdquo;, I mean both the behavior users see,
displaying documents and responding to HTTP requests, and that
which takes place behind the scenes, ranging from the way
authentication takes place to the way logging is done.</p><p>Each invocation of a CGI program requires a new process, as
well as start-up time. By contrast, mod_perl turns your code into a
subroutine of the Apache executable. Your code is loaded and
compiled once, then saved for future invocations.</p><p>When we first think about what happens to an HTTP request
when it is submitted to Apache, it seems relatively simple. The
request is read by Apache, passed to the correct module or
subroutine and returned to the user's browser in an HTTP response.
In fact, each request must travel through many (over a dozen)
different &ldquo;handlers&rdquo; before a response is generated and sent.
<span   class="bold"><b>mod_perl</b></span> allows us to modify and
enhance any or all of these handlers by attaching a Perl module to
it. The handler most often modified is called PerlHandler. Other
more specific handlers are given other names, such as
PerlTransHandler (for URL-to-filename translation) and
PerlLogHandler (for log files).</p><p>This month, we will look at a number of PerlHandlers that
will make it possible to create truly useful &ldquo;new&rdquo; labels for our
web sites.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a9b580.0x2b93a28"></a>A Simple Version</h2></div></div><p>The first PerlHandler we will define is rather simple: it
puts a &ldquo;new&rdquo; label next to any link on a page. This is not a
particularly difficult task or a good use of mod_perl. However, it
does gently ease us into writing a Perl module for mod_perl, and it
will form the basis for future versions we will write.</p><p>Our module begins much the same as any other module,
declaring its own name space (Apache::TagNew, in this case), then
importing several symbolic constants from the Apache::Constants
package. The module defines a single subroutine, called
&ldquo;handler&rdquo;. This is the conventional way to define a handler under
mod_perl; that is, create a module with a &ldquo;handler&rdquo; subroutine,
then tell Apache to use that module as a handler for a particular
directory.</p><p>We instruct Apache to invoke our handler in the configuration
file httpd.conf. For example, my copy of httpd.conf says the
following:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
PerlModule Apache::TagNew
&lt;Directory /usr/local/apache/share/htdocs/tag&gt;
SetHandler perl-script
PerlHandler Apache::TagNew
&lt;/Directory&gt;
</pre><p>The PerlModule directive tells Apache to load the
Apache::TagNew module. The &lt;Directory&gt; section tells Apache
that the /tag subdirectory of my HTML content tree should be
treated specially, using the
<span   class="bold"><b>handler</b></span> method of Apache::New
instead of the default content handler. Once we activate our module
by restarting our server (or by sending it a HUP signal), any file
in the /tag directory will be handled by Apache::TagNew, rather
than Apache's default handler.
</p><p>The first thing handler must do is retrieve the Apache
request object, traditionally called <b  >$r</b>. This
object is the key to everything in mod_perl, since it allows us to
retrieve information about the HTTP request, the environment, and
the server on which the program is running. We also use
<b  >$r</b> to send data back to the user's
browser.</p><p>Our method is expected to return one of the symbols we
imported from Apache::Constants. Returning <b  >OK</b>
means we successfully handled the query, data has been returned to
the user's browser, and Apache should move to its next stage of
handling the request. If we return <b  >DECLINED</b>,
Apache assumes our module did not handle the request and it should
find some other handler willing to do the job. There are a variety
of other symbols we can return, including
<b  >NOT_FOUND</b>, which indicates that the file was not
found on our server.</p><p><a href="3474l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1.</a></p><p>In Apache::TagNew (see Listing 1), we normally return
<b  >OK</b>. We return <b  >NOT_FOUND</b> if an
error occurs when opening the file, and <b  >DECLINED</b>
if the file does not have a MIME type of &ldquo;text/html&rdquo;. Hyperlinks
are going to appear only in HTML-formatted text files, so we can
save everyone a bit of time and energy by letting another handler
take care of other file types.</p><p>The rest of the handler works by reading the contents of the
file, then replacing them with our new and improved version. We
append a &ldquo;new&rdquo; label after every &lt;/a&gt;, which comes after
each hyperlink. In this way, every hyperlink is tagged as
new.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a9b580.0x2b941b8"></a>Printing &ldquo;New&rdquo; on New Files</h2></div></div><p>Of course, the point of this project is not to print &ldquo;new&rdquo;
next to all links, but rather next to new ones. In order to do
that, we will need to look at each link in sequence and check to
see if it is on our system. If it is, we will check when the
associated file was last changed. If that file was changed within
the last week, we will tag it as new; otherwise, we will leave it
alone.</p><p><a href="3474l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2.</a></p><p>In order to do this, we will write another subroutine, which
takes care of identifying a link and adds the appropriate text when
necessary. That is, the subroutine will take a URL as input and
will output either the same URL or the URL with a &ldquo;new&rdquo; label
appended. Listing 2 is our new version of Apache::TagNew and it
contains just such a subroutine, called
<span   class="bold"><b>label_url</b></span>. The label_url
subroutine expects to be invoked with three arguments:
<b  >$r</b>, the Apache request object,
<b  >$url</b>, the URL of the hyperlink in question, and
<b  >$text</b>, the text that goes between the &lt;a&gt;
and &lt;/a&gt; tags of the hyperlink.</p><p>We can know whether a file has changed only if it is on our
system. Rather than parse through the URL, I decided to take the
simple way by checking whether the URL in question begins with
&ldquo;http://&rdquo;. If it does, then we assume the URL points to a file on
a different system, and we ignore it, returning the URL and text in
their original states.</p><p>If the URL begins with any other characters, it is assumed to
point to a file on our system. We use <b  >$r</b> to
retrieve the value of the document root directory, namely the
directory under which all URLs are stored. This module will work
regardless of whether your web documents are under
/usr/local/apache/share/htdocs, /etc/httpd/htdocs or even
/usr/local/bin. <b  >$r</b> retrieves the information
from the httpd.conf file, which also means the module does not need
updating if you decide to move the document root.</p><p>We then check to see whether the file was modified within the
last seven days, using Perl's <b  >-M</b> operator to get
the last modification time. Luckily for our purposes,
<b  >-M</b> returns its result in days rather than
seconds; so, we can simply compare the returned result with 7 and
add the label as necessary. If the file was unmodified in the last
seven days, the <b  >$label</b> variable remains
undefined and turns into the empty string later.</p><p>Our program returns the modified URL, much as it did in the
previous version of Apache::TagNew.</p><p>We can evaluate this subroutine over every hyperlink in a
document with <b  >s///</b>, Perl's substitution
operator. We give <b  >s///</b> three modifiers:
<b  >g</b> performs the operation globally,
<b  >i</b> ignores case and <b  >e</b> replaces
the initial text with the result of evaluating the
substitution:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$contents =~
s|&lt;a\s+href=['"]?(\S+?)['"]?\s*&gt;([\s\S]+?)&lt;/a&gt;
|label_url($r, $1, $2)|eigx;
</pre><p>The above regular expression is difficult to understand, so
let us examine what it does in greater detail. We make the regexp
more readable with the &ldquo;x&rdquo; modifier, which allows us to insert
whitespace inside of it. We look for the opening &lt;a&gt; and
closing &lt;/a&gt; tags and extract from them the URL, which is
grouped inside the first set of parentheses, and the link text,
which is grouped inside the second set of parentheses. We use
Perl's non-greedy operators to ensure we get only the necessary
text. Otherwise, such things as quotation marks might be included
in our link text.
</p><p>We then invoke the subroutine label_url. We pass it three
arguments: <b  >$r</b> (the Apache request object),
<b  >$1</b> (the URL we grabbed from the first set of
parentheses) and <b  >$2</b> (the link text we grabbed
from the second set of parentheses). Whatever label_url returns is
substituted for the text we originally found. In this way, we can
optionally insert a label into the text of the document.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a9b580.0x2b94c60"></a>Storing Information Across Sessions</h2></div></div><p>The above system has several advantages, but it fails to keep
track of when users went to a particular link. In other words, it
is terrific at keeping track of a countdown timer for a particular
URL, tagging it as new for the first seven days. But once again, we
want to produce a &ldquo;new&rdquo; label when the document is new to a
particular user. What if I have not visited a site in three months?
Then all of the content is likely to be new, and &ldquo;new&rdquo; labels
will be on everything. By contrast, if I visited the site two hours
ago, only those labels that have changed since my visit will look
different.</p><p>Keeping track of such information would require us to keep
state across HTTP requests, so that we could keep track of which
links were seen by a particular user. Unfortunately, HTTP is a
stateless protocol, which means we cannot save such information.
HTTP requests and responses take place in a vacuum, neither storing
information for the next transaction nor retrieving information
from a previous transaction.</p><p>HTTP's stateless nature has created problems for web
programmers and designers who wish to create useful applications
and has led to a number of clever solutions. Perhaps the most
famous solution is the use of HTTP cookies, which allow a web
server to store information on the user's computer. Each time the
user submits an HTTP request to that server, all cookies previously
stored are sent along with the request.</p><p>Cookies can store information in several ways. One is by
putting the information inside the cookie, thus giving the server
immediate access to further details about the user as part of the
request. But this quickly becomes cumbersome if you have too much
data. For this reason, it is common to use a table in a relational
database to keep track of user information. If we define a primary
key (i.e., a column guaranteed to be unique) for that table, we can
store as much information as we like in the table.</p><p>Accessing a table in this way can be cumbersome, since it
involves many database storage and retrieval operations. Luckily,
we can use the Apache::Session module to handle such things.
Apache::Session works with mod_perl programs to store and retrieve
information across HTTP transactions.</p><p>We can retrieve the cookie in our handler using the
<span   class="bold"><b>header_in</b></span> method. Notice how we
are working with the raw cookie, meaning we must use
<b  >s///</b> to retrieve the value of interest:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
my $id = $r-&gt;header_in('Cookie');
$id =~ s/SESSION_ID=(\w*)/$1/;
</pre><p>Once we have done this, we can use Apache::Session::DBI, the
module that connects sessions to a database table. We use Perl's
<span   class="bold"><b>tie</b></span> routine, which creates a
connection between a variable and a module, to provide a seamless
connection:
<pre     class="programlisting">
tie %session, 'Apache::Session::DBI', $id,
      {
       DataSource =&gt; 'dbi:mysql:test',
       UserName   =&gt; 'username',
       Password   =&gt; 'password'
      };
</pre>


You might recognize the three attributes in the above code fragment
from DBI, the Perl database interface. DBI works with many
different relational databases, thanks to its use of database
drivers for specific databases. The above example uses the MySQL
database, which I use for many of my database tasks. This example
uses the &ldquo;test&rdquo; database to store our session information. While
&ldquo;test&rdquo; is a good place for demonstration databases, you would be
wise to put production databases somewhere else.
</p><p>Apache::Session cannot create a table in MySQL for you.
Before using the above code, you will need to create a table in
which Apache::Session can store its session information. Here is
the recommended table definition, from the Apache::Session::DBI
manual pages:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
CREATE TABLE sessions (
     id char(16),
     length int(11),
     a_session text
    );
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a9b580.0x2b8ba70"></a>Using Apache::Session</h2></div></div><p>Once our handler has retrieved the user's ID from a cookie
and established a connection with the database, we can store and
retrieve session information at our convenience.</p><p>We can store information about this user in
<b  >%session</b>, the hash to which we tied
Apache::Session. Each time our handler is invoked, we can retrieve
information about this user based on his or her ID. For example, we
can store a value with:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$session{"foo"} = "bar";
</pre><p>We can then retrieve that value in a later session with:
<pre     class="programlisting">
my $stuff = $session{"foo"};
</pre>


While our program appears to be storing and retrieving values in
<b  >%session</b>, it is actually retrieving them from
the database using DBI&mdash;which means that, so long as we ensure each
user has a unique ID, we can keep everyone's values separate.
</p><p>Since we have what amounts to a hash that extends across
sessions, how can we store information on which URLs we have
visited and when? The easiest way is to use the URL as a key into
<b  >%session</b>, then store the last time the user
visited the site. For example, we can store the URL with the
following code:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
my $document_uri = $r-&gt;uri;
$session{$document_uri} = time;
</pre><p>We want to retrieve this information when determining whether
a user has recently visited a particular link. In order to do that,
we will modify label_url so that it expects a fourth argument, a
reference to <b  >%session</b>. This way, label_url will
be able to retrieve session information about the URL in question.
We create the reference by preceding <b  >%session</b>
with a backslash (<b  >\%session</b>) before passing it
to label_url. We then dereference the copy of
<b  >%session</b> as follows, at the beginning of
label_url:
<pre     class="programlisting">
my $session = shift;
my %session = %{$session};
</pre>


The full code of a working version of Apache::TagNew, including the
label_url subroutine, is in Listing 3.
</p><p><a href="3474l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3.</a></p><p>The rest of label_url is largely the same, except for a
portion in the middle where we test to see if the URL begins with a
slash (/). We must be sure to store and retrieve the same key from
<b  >%session</b>; otherwise, we will get false readings
regarding when we last visited the URL. Since we store the URL
based on <b  >$r</b>&rarr;<b  >uri</b>, which
always begins with a slash and is relative to our server's root URL
directory, we should retrieve the URLs in the same way.</p><p>We do this by getting the current URL and removing everything
following the final slash:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$current_directory =~ s|^(\S+/)[\w.]+$|$1|;
</pre><p>What is left is indeed the current directory, to which we can
prepend the URL:
<pre     class="programlisting">
$url = $current_directory . $url;
</pre>


Now we can retrieve the session information about that URL,
confident we are using the same set of keys for retrieval as we did
earlier for storage. We retrieve session information about when we
last viewed the file in question, turning it into a number of days
relative to right now:
<pre     class="programlisting">
my $last_time = (time - $session{$url}) / 86400;
</pre>


Then we retrieve the modification timestamp of this file, by
prepending
<b  >$r</b>&rarr;<b  >document_root</b> (the
full path name leading to each file on the web site, normally
invisible to users) to the file. We can easily determine its
modification date:
<pre     class="programlisting">
my $full_filename = $r-&gt;document_root . $url;
my $ctime = -M $full_filename;
</pre>


Finally, we compare <b  >$ctime</b> (the number of days
since the file was modified) with <b  >$last_time</b>
(the number of days since the user last saw the file). If the
former is smaller than the latter, we add the label:
<pre     class="programlisting">
if ($ctime &lt; $last_time)
{
$label = "&lt;font color=\"red\"&gt;New!&lt;/font&gt;"";
}
</pre>


This module seems to do a good job of labeling new documents on a
user-by-user basis. As long as users enable cookies, they should be
able to get an accurate reading of which files they have not seen
in a long time.

needs, the Web is surprisingly primitive&mdash;for instance, in the way
&ldquo;new&rdquo; documents are labeled on web sites. This month, we have
seen how mod_perl allows us to personalize our site a bit more,
showing people what is actually new from their perspective, rather
than from the webmaster's perspective. I hope you also noticed how
advanced some of these tools have become; with a little more than
100 lines of Perl code, we were able to make a substantial change
to our web server that had little impact on performance, but
provided great benefit to our users.</p><p><a href="3474s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
