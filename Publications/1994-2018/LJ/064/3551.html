Precision Insight is operating &ldquo;With funding from Red Hat and
XGI&rdquo;. In fact it is &ldquo;SGI&rdquo;, not &ldquo;XGI&rdquo;, that's co-funding PI's
work. SGI has also donated the GLX X Window/OpenGL integration
source code to XFree86, and PI is using that code as one component
of the OpenGL infrastructure they're developing. More on this is
available at
<a href="http://www.sgi.com/software/opensource/glx" target="_self">http://www.sgi.com/software/opensource/glx/</a>.
Thanks.</p><p>&mdash;Jon Leech ljp@oddhack.engr.sgi.com</p><p>Oops, that was a bad one&mdash;my apologies to SGI for not
catching this typo &mdash;Editor</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2023580.0x211b450"></a>Intellectual Property in a GNU
Environment</h2></div></div><p>Having used Linux since before kernel 1.1.13, I've found a
very long list of reasons why various businesses don't develop more
software on Linux. Nowadays, the reason is never performance or
reliability. One reason is well-known; that is, how does one go
about marketing in an open-systems environment without giving away
key rights or simply being unable to enforce those rights? Secrecy
is usually less expensive than a court battle.</p><p>An issue recently mentioned to me is that of knowing how to
interpret what a developer will owe to others. The example in mind
is OpenGL in X. My interpretation is that for dynamically linked
applications requiring some form of OpenGL-compliant display
libraries, it is not an issue for the developer, but instead for
the user (unless the developer ships the libraries with the
application). What I would like to see is a series of articles on
intellectual property rights of developers, and to what extent
these rights may affect marketing when a business (versus
individual) must pay for using (not selling) various utilities and
libraries used by a common distribution.</p><p>If, as a business, I use PPP utilities or generic NE2000
drivers but don't sell them, do I need to pay for them? If I use
<span   class="bold"><b>gawk</b></span> as installed from my
distribution, when do I need to pay for it? Can I use XFree as a
business, without paying? Will my OpenGL application cause a
liability to my end user who has Mesa? And so on. I would like to
see a lengthy discussion worthy of showing to my employers.
Thanks.</p><p>&mdash;Dan Stimits stimits@idcomm.com</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>As a start, read the article &ldquo;Licenses and

(<i  >LJ</i>, May 1999), was both insightful and
delightful. Marjorie Richardson was able to convey Larry's obvious
passion, joy, intellect and humor.</p><p>It was also refreshing to see one of the key figures of the
Open Source community unashamedly mention God. Yes, there are some
of us using Linux who realize that the ultimate in &ldquo;open source&rdquo;
is the Bible.</p><p>Larry may not have become a missionary, but he's used his
God-given talents in a very good way.</p><p>&mdash;Bob Nelson bnelson@netcom.com</p><p>Actually, Larry was able to convey his passion, intellect,
joy and humor himself. I just provided him with the medium in which
to express it. I enjoyed doing the interview very much&mdash;he's truly
a delightful man &mdash;Editor</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2023580.0x211bad8"></a>Standards</h2></div></div><p>I just finished reading the article &ldquo;Distributions Take a
Stand on Standards&rdquo;, and all I have to say is that all of this can
be likened to Scotland when it was fighting the English (the movie
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Braveheart</em></span> comes to mind). Microsoft (MS) is
the English wanting to rule everything, and the Linux community is
the Scottish. The clans of Scotland weren't unified and easily fell
to the English. That is what is happening with Linux today. The
different distributions are the clans. No one is trying to unite
them. Linux falls to MS because it can't stand up to MS. Linux may
be winning some battles, but MS is winning the war, and it's easy
to see why. Take a look at both armies. One is well-organized and
well-structured. The other is made up of small clans, fighting for
the same main goals, but refusing to unite for the greater
good.</p><p>Caldera seems to be the William Wallace of Linux. It looks
like they will be the ones to take the lead and unite the different
distributions. I am going to stand with their banner in my hands&mdash;I
am going to give my money to Caldera henceforth.</p><p>Linux needs a leader for standardization. Stampede Linux was
quoted as saying too much of a good thing can be bad, but I have to
say that Linux in its present state is a bad thing. I am a user for
about five months now, and have bought both Red Hat 5.2 and
Mandrake 5.3. I am very disappointed in both of them. I am not able
to get my printer to work, because neither distribution works with
a HP 722c. I know this printer is designed mostly for Windows, but
programs are available that will make this printer work with Linux.
Neither of the distributions support this program. If the major
distributions want to pull together and make a standard for Linux,
they need to put these small programs in their distributions and
support them. If this was the case, Linux would gain more support
from computer users in the world than it does.</p><p>&mdash;Troy Davidson clandaith@netzero.net</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2023580.0x211bd40"></a>Layout</h2></div></div><p>I love your high-quality magazine and look forward to each
issue. Only one complaint: you've started putting a thick black
border around the feature article pages. The ink sticks to my
fingers and gets smudged all over the pages, making it much less
appealing to read. Please get rid of the borders! I would also like
Metro-X to get rid of all the black on their back page ad, which
also smudges all over the place, but I guess that's another letter
to be written to their marketing department. Or maybe your whole
magazine is just too hot to read! Thanks.</p><p>&mdash;Walter Cooke wcooke@paragon.bm</p><p>We added the border to call attention to the feature
section&mdash;makes it easy to find. The smudge factor did not occur to
us and doesn't happen on the copies we receive. However, yours is
not the only complaint we have received and we are talking to the
printer about possible solutions. Perhaps we need to rethink this
one. Thanks for your comments &mdash;Editor</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2023580.0x211bef8"></a>Compounding Errors?</h2></div></div><p>I will be the first to admit there are no absolutes in this
world, but the comment offered by Shawn McMahon in the Letters
section, <i  >Linux Journal</i>, June 1999 issue
concerning PCI modems not working in Linux, is absolutely wrong.
Unfortunately, your response to his letter was likewise in error,
thereby perpetuating this misinformation. You stated, &ldquo;PCI modems
are basically Windows-only.&rdquo; I realize you used a caveat in your
response; however, as the (in my opinion) pre-eminent and
&ldquo;first-class&rdquo; leader in Linux-related magazines/journals, you
should do a little more research before making blanket statements
that are inaccurate.</p><p>I am limiting my comments to one modem only for obvious
reasons, but I must tell you that &ldquo;some&rdquo; PCI modems work equally
well in Linux and Windows. For example, I recently installed a US
Robotics/3Com V.Everything PCI modem in one of my computers, and
have not experienced any problems with it whatsoever. I configured
the modem to use com2 when operating in an MS Windows environment,
and /dev/ttyS1 when using Linux. I connect to my ISP consistently
at 48,000 bps (probably due to the antiquated wiring of our local
telco) regardless of the OS I am running.</p><p>I enjoy perusing your journal immensely; in fact, I anxiously
await its arrival every month. When it finally gets here, I scurry
into my &ldquo;library&rdquo; and don't come out for an hour, much to the
chagrin of the rest of the family. Kudos to all at
<i  >LJ</i>! Keep up the good work!</p><p>&mdash;Greg Bailey gsbailey@foto.infi.net</p><p>Sorry, everyone I talked to about Shawn's letter agreed he
was right. With so much hardware available today, no one can know
everything. Congratulations on finding a PCI modem that works for
Linux and you &mdash;Editor</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2023580.0x211c210"></a>Linux in Schools</h2></div></div><p>A Linux lab was constructed in December 1998 by a volunteer
group of Linux users in Tucson, Arizona for Corbett Elementary
school. <span   class="emphasis"><em>All</em></span> machines within the lab run only
Linux, except for the district's server console&mdash;we were not given
permission to remove Windows 95 from it, unfortunately. Even if it
isn't the first Linux lab in a public school within the U.S., it's
most likely the first in an elementary school (K-6). It contains 32
Compaq Pentium 90s, one AST Pentium 90 server, one 486 DX-33
Ethernet switch, one Gateway 486 DX/2-66 print server and one
Compaq Pentium 200 MMX (district)&mdash;all running Slackware 3.6 and
4.0. The lab officially opened late January 1999, and the students
love it. Some were having too much fun with XBill though, so we had
to remove the gore. The entire district, which constitutes 105
schools, pipes out to the Net on a single T1&mdash;not everything can be
perfect. On that note, I'm the network administrator for this
lab.</p><p>&mdash;James Daniel root@phreaked.net</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2023580.0x211c3c8"></a>Linux Standards and Distributions</h2></div></div><p>I think your article &ldquo;The Distributions Take a Stand on
Standards&rdquo; by Norman Jacobowitz (June 1999) does not prove a
thing. No vendor in his right mind would state that they will not
go along with existing and upcoming Linux standards and invent
their own for &ldquo;product improvements&rdquo;. Not even Microsoft did so
before introducing new proprietary software solutions.</p><p>At the moment, it's all about market share for a huge
upcoming market and who's best in keeping up a good &ldquo;front show&rdquo;
while thinking about how to get the biggest piece of the pie in the
back office. What do you think about new software for Linux labeled
as running on &ldquo;Red Hat Linux&rdquo;? Check out
<a href="http://www.kai.com/C_plus_plus/download.html#intel_linux" target="_self">www.kai.com/C_plus_plus/download.html#intel_linux</a>.</p><p>I think Linux needs an independent organization like the OMG
for CORBA. At the moment, there is not even one &ldquo;Linux Standard&rdquo;.
How do you explain to your customer which Linux configuration your
software runs on? Some distributions know how to use this fact for
their own benefit and could cause standards to go down the drain in
a few years. Greetings from Germany.</p><p>&mdash;Roland Koeckel roland.koeckel@gmx.de</p><p>The Linux Standards Base, written about in &ldquo;The Past and
Future of Linux Standards&rdquo; by Daniel Quinlan in that same issue,
is striving to become that independent organization you are
wanting &mdash;Editor</p></div></div>
