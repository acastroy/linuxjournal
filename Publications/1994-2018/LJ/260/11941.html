<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #260, December 2015</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Linux capabilities</b></span> are one of the more fluid and less defined regions of
kernel development. <span   class="bold"><b>Linus Torvalds</b></span>
typically has no trouble violating <span   class="bold"><b>POSIX</b></span>
standards if he sees a better way of doing something. In the case of
filesystem capabilities, however, there's no standard to violate. The best
we've got is a POSIX draft document that was discarded before becoming
official. So really, anyone with a good idea can come along and make big
changes in that part of the kernel.
</p><p>
Filesystem capabilities refer to a finer-grained set of permissions than
the traditional choice between running something as a regular user or
running as root.
</p><p>
Recently, <span   class="bold"><b>Eric W. Biederman</b></span> and <span   class="bold"><b>Andy Lutomirski</b></span> found themselves tackling
filesystem capabilities from opposite directions. Eric wanted to allow a
process that's been granted one set of capabilities to invoke system calls
using an even more constrained set of capabilities. Presumably, the goal
would be to increase security by preventing system calls from being abused
for nefarious purposes. And, Andy wanted to allow one process to allow a
completely separate process to perform system calls on its behalf. This
might allow the formation of system call services to centralize all system
call usage and make it easier to secure those uses.
</p><p>
The discussion went round and round. Eric's idea, as he later clarified,
was actually a bit broader than it appeared at first glance&mdash;he wanted to
convert the Linux implementation of POSIX capabilities into &ldquo;Real
Capabilities&rdquo;. The term Real Capabilities refers to a computer science
concept that pre-dates POSIX capabilities. It refers to the idea of giving
a process some sort of token that allows it to perform a specified action
on a specified object.
</p><p>
Ultimately, nothing about capabilities, or any new patches in that area, can
have real clarity until they go into the kernel. Before then, there's
always the possibility that they'll violate something important or aim in
the wrong direction. But, it's cool to watch Eric and Andy, and lots of
other folks, trying to figure it out.
</p><p>
One recurring problem with Linux is the need for <span   class="bold"><b>backward compatibility</b></span>.
Actually, this affects virtually the whole Open Source world, but Linus
Torvalds takes a particular strict stance on the issue with regard to the
Linux kernel. If there's a compiled piece of user software out in the wild
that relies on a kernel feature, even a dumb kernel feature, then future
kernels have got to support that feature, so that the piece of user software
will continue to run after a kernel upgrade.
</p><p>
It makes sense. But as Andy Lutomirski recently said, the result was a
batch of features that existed only to support old programs. And by
carrying these features perpetually into the future, he said, newer
software ran the risk of accidentally using those features or even
becoming reliant on them.
</p><p>
He proposed allowing new software to turn off those
compatibility features explicitly, but that turned out to be more complex than he'd
originally thought. Specifically, one of his cornerstone ideas&mdash;granting
the ability of newer software to turn off the <span   class="bold"><b>vsyscall</b></span> page&mdash;was not easy
to arrange. Andy's initial idea was to have the compiler identify at
compile time software that used newer versions of <span   class="bold"><b>libc</b></span>, and then have that
piece of software elect to disable <span   class="bold"><b>vsyscall</b></span> at runtime. But, he didn't see
a good way to accomplish that, and <span   class="bold"><b>Brian
Gerst</b></span> pointed out that vsyscall
was globally shared and couldn't be shut off for individual processes.
</p><p>
This actually turned out not to be 100% true. Although Andy agreed that
vsyscall was shared globally, the mechanisms to execute it were all
emulated in the kernel, and those could be disabled on a per-process basis.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Rich Felker</b></span> proposed another workaround for vsyscall's global availability.
He said the kernel could simply unmap all means of executing vsyscall. Any
older software that tried to access it would generate a page fault, which
the kernel could then catch and emulate vsyscall just for that program.
</p><p>
But, Andy didn't go for that idea. He said that modern instrumentation tools
might want to read the targets of calls, and a page fault would prevent
that. Any vsyscall solution, Andy said, had to maintain compatibility for
those tools.
</p><p>
On the other hand, as Rich said, those modern tools might never be used on
ancient binaries in practice. And even if they were, it might be possible
to code up specific kernel workarounds for each use case in a less
invasive way than trying to come up with a complete solution for vsyscall.
</p><p>
It's a robust debate, complicated by the fact that it's difficult to know
for sure if anyone is actually running old binaries that depend on this or
that kernel compatibility feature. But, Andy made it clear that cleaning out
compatibility features was not really his primary goal, so much as it was
to eliminate potential security holes. Apparently, <span   class="bold"><b>Google's Project Zero</b></span> had
identified more exploits:
<a href="http://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2015/08/three-bypasses-and-fix-for-one-of.html" target="_self">googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2015/08/three-bypasses-and-fix-for-one-of.html</a>.
</p><p>
The Linux <span   class="bold"><b>framebuffer</b></span>, once a bastion of innovation, is now on the chopping
block, in favor of the <span   class="bold"><b>Direct Rendering
Manager</b></span> (DRM) subsystem. The <span   class="bold"><b>fbdev</b></span>
maintainer, <span   class="bold"><b>Tomi Valkeinen</b></span>, has asked everyone to stop submitting new fbdev
drivers and to aim their efforts at DRM instead.
</p><p>
It was not as uncontroversial as you might think. It turned out, as folks
like <span   class="bold"><b>Thomas Petazzoni</b></span> said, that it still
was easier to write very simple
drivers for fbdev, than it was for DRM. Just in terms of lines of code,
<span   class="bold"><b>Geert Uytterhoeven</b></span> noticed that the simplest fbdev drivers were just a few
hundred lines of code, while the simplest DRM drivers might require a
couple thousand.
</p><p>
No one argued that this would be a permanent problem. If anything, the
discussion highlighted the need to write some supporting libraries for DRM
and help speed up the ultimate elimination of fbdev.

I freely admit I learned about this app from my wife. In fact, I saw a
few nostalgic posts on her Facebook timeline and investigated where they
came from. It turns out she had installed an app called Timehop. I
normally wouldn't write about something that at first glance seems like
an ego-stroking shot of nostalgia, but I had so much fun looking at the
posts it dug up, I couldn't help myself.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11941androidf1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
Timehop is a free app in the Google Play Store. Once you install it,
you're guided through connecting to all the major social-media networks
(Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and a few others I didn't recognize). Then,
using some sort of popularity algorithm (or magic, I'm not sure which),
it finds funny and/or memorable posts and photos from the past and shows them to
you. You are able to share those old posts from the app and allow others
to experience your little hit of nostalgia as well.
</p><p>
I still feel a little silly sharing this app with the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span>
community. But really, it's so much fun, if you're having a bad day, give
it a try and see if a three-years-ago-you can cheer you up. I know two-year-ago
Shawn made me smile!

<h2 class="title">Chromebookify Your Laptop Now!</h2>

A few years ago there was a project designed to boot generic laptops so
they functioned as Chromebooks. It was a cool project, but unfortunately,
the compatibility wasn't great, and it wasn't reliable to use on a daily
basis. Although Chromebooks are old news these days, it still would be quite
useful to transform aging laptop computers into Chromebooks. Because they
have such low system requirements, older laptops running the ChromeOS
can become quite useful again.
</p><p>
Thanks to the folks at Neverwhere, you can get the CloudReady
installer that installs Chromium onto a wide variety of laptops from
various manufacturers. (A long list of tested models is available at
<a href="http://go.neverware.com/certifiedmodels" target="_self">go.neverware.com/certifiedmodels</a>.) I actually have a Dell D420
that is getting very long in the tooth as a Linux machine, but as
a Chromebook, it's still quite effective. If you have an aging laptop,
give CloudReady a try. It's free, and you even can boot off USB to check
it out before installing.

<h2 class="title">Non-Linux FOSS: Airsonos</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #260, December 2015</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
I love Sonos. There probably are some audiophiles reading this who rolled their eyes
at my lack of auditory prowess, but honestly, the speakers sound wonderful to my
1980s-damaged eardrums. Granted, the Wi-Fi-enabled speakers are very expensive, thus
limiting my supply. I'm amazed at the ability for the speakers to sync
a single audio source throughout my house perfectly without the need for wires. At all.
</p><p>
The problem (apart from the price tag) is the limited options for music sources.
You can stream radio stations, Pandora radio and even MP3 music files from a
central network-accessible server. For my family of teenage girls, however, the
inability to stream via Airplay (yes, my family has many Apple products) is a
showstopper. So in their upstairs bathroom there's a $300 speaker on the shelf,
and they just listen to their phone speakers while in the shower. It breaks my
heart. Sonos offers line-in options for its larger speakers, but it's really a
kludge and doesn't work well.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11941fossf1.large.jpg"><img src="11941fossf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
Enter Airsonos. An open-source project, Airsonos is a Node.js-based application
that runs on a server and probes the network for on-line Sonos speakers. It then
creates Airplay devices for each speaker, and an iPhone or iPad easily
can stream to a Sonos speaker. I personally run Airsonos as a Docker app, and it's
a &ldquo;set it and forget it&rdquo; sort of application. In fact, Airsonos has all the
makings of an Editors' Choice award-winning project:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
It's open source.
</p></li><li><p>
It runs on a Linux system.
</p></li><li><p>
It's easily Dockerized.
</p></li><li><p>
And, it solves a real problem in an awesome way!
</p></li></ul></div><p>
So, this month's Editors' Choice award goes to Airsonos, with shared award status
to the Dockerized app version maintained by &ldquo;justintime&rdquo;&mdash;thank you for making
my nerdy world a better place!

I'm just starting out in the world of development, and many of the projects
I'm interested in exploring are written in Node.js. If you're an old hand
at such things, you already know that which version of Node you use on
a particular application is vitally important. (This is actually one of
the reasons Docker is so amazingly amazing when it comes to deploying
Node apps, but I digress.)
</p><p>
For folks like me, the version issue can be confusing and
frustrating. Thankfully, I ran across a simple tool with a simple name:
n. Once you have Node.js installed on your system, using n, it's possible
to download and make active a very specific version of the program, so
your specific application works properly. In fact, when I was installing
the NOMP stratum server for Bitcoin mining recently, I had to use n to
try more than a dozen versions before I found the one that worked as expected.
</p><p>
Node.js is a powerful, incredible language that is used by many smart
developers. Those of us who are just getting started, however, are easily
intimidated by version needs. If that describes you, or if you understand the
nuances but just want a quick and easy way to manage it, check out n
today. There are instructions on the Github page: <a href="https://github.com/tj/n" target="_self">https://github.com/tj/n</a>.

<h2 class="title">Symbolic Algebra Everywhere</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Joey Bernard</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #260, December 2015</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Previously in this space, I have covered software packages like Maxima
that can be used to solve symbolic mathematics problems. Several
packages are available that can do those types of calculations. 
In this article, I discuss Xcas/Giac. Xcas is the GUI interface
to the system. Giac is the command-line program that provides access
to the core engine. Xcas has the functionality to handle symbolic algebra,
two-dimensional and three-dimensional graphing, spreadsheets and
statistics. It even has its own programming language that you can use
to add extra functionality of your own. Although you can use the default
interface that comes with Xcas, you also can link the CAS (Computer
Algebra System) engine as a shared library to your own C++ code. 
</p><p>
Packages are available for many different Linux distributions, but they
usually aren't available via the default package management systems. For
example, in Ubuntu, you need to add an APT source that points to the
home page for Xcas. Then you can use the following to install it on your system:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo apt-get install giac python-giacpy
</pre>
</p><p>
Once it is installed and you start it up, Xcas asks what mode you
want to work in. You can select from spreadsheet, CAS, programming or
geometry. Whenever you start a new session within Xcas, you get this
same initial interface. If you want to change it later, 
select the Cfg&rarr;General Configuration menu option. This pops
up a new window where you can select the Level option. If you choose
the CAS option, you get the starting window shown in Figure 1.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11941xcasf1.large.jpg"><img src="11941xcasf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. This the opening window in CAS mode.
</p></div></div><p>
To open a new tab with the same level, click the 
File&rarr;New Session menu item. You also can open a new tab using any of the
available levels, or modes, using menu commands. They are a bit hard to
find though. For example, you can get a new spreadsheet with the 
Spreadsheet&rarr;New Spreadsheet menu item. 
</p><p>
There is far too much functionality
available within Xcas to explain how everything works in such a
short article, but I'll try to cover some of the most interesting
parts.
</p><p>
Let's start by looking at the command level. This operates in a form
similar to the worksheet in Maple or Mathematica. You start with the
first empty command line and enter the mathematical expression you want
to evaluate. Pressing Enter runs the command, displays the output in
a new pane, and creates a new command line and drops the cursor there,
ready for your next command. This style should be comfortable to anyone
with even a little bit of experience. 
</p><p>
The keyboard panel at the bottom
of the window gives you a selection of common elements that you will
likely use within your commands. If you don't need to use it, you can
remove that pane by clicking the Kbd button at the top of your session
window. 
</p><p>
The library of available commands is very large. Luckily, you can
find the majority of them by clicking on the Cmds menu item. Here, you
can find sections for several different areas, such as complex numbers,
group theory, calculus or probability.
</p><p>
No system has everything that you may possibly need
when you start doing any kind of scientific computing. This means that
you need to be able to add new functionality of your own devising. With
Xcas, you can create a new function by clicking on the Prg&rarr;New
program menu item. This pops up a new window where you can define
the name, arguments, locals and a return value. Once you are happy with
these settings and click the OK button, you will get a new program pane
with a template ready for you. You then can add in any other code that
is required by your new functionality. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11941xcasf2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. You can create your own functions in Xcas.
</p></div></div><p>
There are menu options within the
programming pane to help you with the syntax of programming structures,
such as loops, conditionals and IO. In Xcas, functions need to be compiled
before they can be used. This compiling step happens when you click the
OK button in the programming pane. If there are any errors, you will
get a message in the output pane. If there are no errors, you will get a
&ldquo;Success compiling&rdquo; message.
</p><p>
You can include graphics inline within a session. If you want a general
graphics pane, click the Geo&rarr;New figure 2d or
Geo&rarr;New figure 3d menu item. This gives you a graphics pane along with an
associated command pane where you can enter the plotting commands you
want drawn. If you have a specific item drawn, you can select one of the
other items in the Geo menu section. For example, if you want to graph a
function, you can go to Geo&rarr;Graph&rarr;Function. This 
pops up a new window where you can enter the function you want to graph,
along with the limits of the independent variable. When you
click OK, you get the graph drawn inline within your current session.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11941xcasf3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Graphing functions is pretty easy.
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11941xcasf4.large.jpg"><img src="11941xcasf4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Graphs show up inline within your session.
</p></div></div><p>
Xcas is designed to be reasonably good at interacting with other CAS
software. With this idea in mind, it is no surprise that you can import
and export worksheets using several different formats. Xcas will handle
Maple and Mu PAD file formats fairly well. It also can handle the file
format used by TI calculators (like the TI-89 or the Voyage 200). With
this type of support, you should be able to share your work with many
other people.
</p><p>
With Xcas, you can work on almost any system that you have access to. You
can use your Linux system to do major amounts of work, and then you can
continue that work on your Android or Apple device, or even use your Texas
Instruments calculator. Although the interface is a bit confusing, and the
learning curve is rather steep, there is no denying just how powerful
Xcas is.
