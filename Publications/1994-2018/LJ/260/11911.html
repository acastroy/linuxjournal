Boasting more than a half-million users worldwide, welcome to the Linux
forum that really feels like a community: LinuxQuestions.org.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbf7580.0xcef250"></a></h2></div></div><p>
For many of us, our introduction to computing is being placed in front
of a machine where the only challenge is figuring out the Windows user
experience paradigm. Getting started with Linux, on the other hand,
requires a bit more effort, a fair amount of trial and error, and perhaps
some colorful language along the way. 
</p><p>
When I got started with Linux (Red
Hat 9 specifically) back in 2003, the process was quite involved. Before
beginning the installation process, I did significant research and took
copious notes (by hand, as I recall) on hard drive repartitioning and
configuration of master boot records. The sense of accomplishment that
resulted the first time Red Hat booted successfully faded quickly as
I realized that much still needed to be done: getting X working on my
hardware, configuring audio drivers, getting dial-up networking to work and
so on. For each issue, the process was the same. Working under Windows,
use the Internet to research the process (and take notes) and download
the necessary packages/patches. I then would reboot into Red Hat and
attempt what I had researched. When I failed&mdash;and I did, many
times&mdash;I would take careful notes about what I did and what the logs and error
messages said. Then I would reboot into Windows and scour the Internet
support forums for people having the same problem and repeat the process.
</p><p>
Thanks to the near-ubiquity of the Internet, this process now is much more
streamlined. The plethora of really good and free virtualization platforms
have eliminated the need to &ldquo;risk&rdquo; your primary computer to try something
new and different. The willingness of hardware manufacturers to work
with kernel developers has led to the major subsystems (audio, video,
Wi-Fi and so on) just working in most cases. 
</p><p>
The thing that hasn't changed,
and probably never will, is the need to look to the community for support
and guidance. Even the most comprehensive documentation can't possibly
cover every scenario, and so it's through the sharing of our experiences
(successes and failures) that we all learn.
</p><p>
Today, if you do a Google search for an error or issue installing or
configuring Linux, the results you get will be full of support forum posts
from other users who had the same problem and (hopefully) a solution. At
least a couple of those links will point to posts at the various forums at
LinuxQuestions.org. With more than a half-million registered users around the
world and two-dozen forums covering a wide range of topics, LQ is one of
the largest and most active user support sites around. 
</p><p>
Earlier this year,
LinuxQuestions.org celebrated its 15th anniversary, and to commemorate
this milestone, I spent some time with its founder and maintainer,
Jeremy Garcia.
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Brian Conner: Tell me about yourself&mdash;where you're from, what you do
for a living, hobbies and so on.</em></span>
</p><p>
Jeremy Garcia: I'm from Buffalo, New York, and in addition to running The
Questions Network (currently LinuxQuestions.org, AndroidQuestions.org
and ChromeOSQuestions.org), I do consulting around both implementing open
source and building sustainable communities. Outside the tech realm, I
enjoy running, traveling, local history and am a bit of a foodie. I'm
also a Bills and Sabres fan, which has proven challenging during the
past decade.
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>BC: How did you get your start with computers and Linux (the obligatory
&ldquo;what was your first distro&rdquo; question)? And, what is your current
distro?</em></span>
</p><p>
JG: Computers, programming and technology in general always
have fascinated me. As for Linux specifically, while I was in high school, I
started working for a local ISP that used UNIX almost exclusively. The
&ldquo;UNIX way&rdquo; just clicked and made a lot of sense to me. It wasn't long
before I wanted to run something similar at home. The ISP used SCO
(fairly ironic in retrospect), so home use really wasn't an option for
licensing and cost reasons. Searching for an alternative quickly lead me
to Linux. I purchased <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Linux Bible</em></span> from a local bookstore, so my first
distro was Yggdrasil. I've used Linux as my main OS ever since. I like
to tinker and understand how things work, so the fact that I could get
an operating system that allowed me not only to <span   class="emphasis"><em>see</em></span> how things worked,
but also to <span   class="emphasis"><em>modify</em></span> how things worked, enthralled me. I moved to Slackware
about a year later and have used Debian, Red Hat, SUSE, Fedora, Mandrake,
Conectiva and a few others as my main distro through the years. I currently
use Ubuntu on my desktop, but I have been considering alternatives.
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
BC: For those who don't know, what is LinuxQuestions.org?</em></span>
</p><p>
JG: LQ is an on-line Linux community. The forum is the most well known
aspect, but we have a wiki, tutorials, news and more. More than 30
distributions officially participate, so it has a little different vibe
from some of the single distro fora. We focus on being friendly and
welcoming to Linux newbies and veterans alike.
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
BC: What prompted you to start LQ?</em></span>
</p><p>
JG: I had just gotten my first real Linux job, and I wanted to give
something back to the community. I had been using Linux for a while at
that point and wanted to offer help to existing and potential users. I
figured someday the site would grow to maybe a few hundred people, so
to say it has grown far beyond my initial expectations is a monumental
understatement.
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
BC: Earlier this year, LQ celebrated its 15th anniversary. Surely you
didn't expect it would become what it has. Do you remember what your
expectations were at launch time?</em></span>
</p><p>
JG: As I mentioned, when I started the site, my initial expectations were
fairly modest. I really just wanted to give something back to a community
that I felt had given me quite a bit. I put a ton of work into the site,
but I did so because I enjoyed it, not because I expected any long-term
gains. We got a chance to exhibit at LinuxWorld in New York a few years
in, and the feedback we got was really energizing. We had mods fly in
from multiple countries, and people from all over the world visited our
booth to tell us how much they liked the site, explain how much it had
benefited them or just stopped by to say hello because they wanted to meet
us. It was a humbling experience, and one that has happened many times
since. If you'd have told me when I founded the site that I'd have
experiences such as that one, I'd certainly not have believed you.
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
BC: Relating to the last question, would you care to hazard a guess
where LQ will be 15 years from now?</em></span>
</p><p>
JG: Projecting that far out is extraordinarily difficult, especially when
the Internet is involved. What I can say is that LQ will do everything
it can to remain relevant while staying true to our ethos. We've built
up a huge knowledge base through the years, and keeping that available to
the community for posterity is important to me.
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
BC: Tell us about the hardware and software platform that LQ runs on
currently and how it has evolved during the last 15 years.</em></span>
</p><p>
JG: LQ started on a single dedicated Pentium Pro server co-located at the
aforementioned ISP. It's had a couple iterations since, and we're actually
working on an infrastructure refresh now. The site currently runs on bare-metal RHEL servers and uses nginx and MariaDB.
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
BC: In your estimation, what's the biggest achievement (or
accomplishment) of LQ so far?</em></span>
</p><p>
JG: That's a difficult question. I'm proud that we've remained friendly
and true to our initial goals despite how much we've grown&mdash;that's
a testament to our great mod team. I'm also proud of how many people
we've helped through the years. I've heard from many members that they
would have given up on Linux if it weren't for LQ. That's a testament
to our great members.
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>BC: Surely there have been some low points along the way. Any
particular occurrences that you were able to learn from as you moved
forward?</em></span>
</p><p>
JG: We've been lucky in this regard I think. When a fellow Linux forum
went under, some in the LQ community felt the sudden influx of new
members would impact our culture, but I think it made us stronger. We
did have some DB corruption about ten years ago that looked grim, but we
were able to recover with minimal data loss.
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
BC: Has the success of LQ opened any doors that wouldn't have been
available to you otherwise (speaking at cons, meeting interesting
people)?</em></span>
</p><p>
JG: Absolutely. I've gotten to meet Linus and a variety of other
open-source luminaries. I've gotten to speak at conferences, judge the LinuxWorld awards, be on a variety of panels, be on the board of Linux Fund,
have my own magazine column&mdash;too much to list really. The Open Source
world is full of smart, energetic, talented people. I'm absolutely a
better person for having been exposed to it. I've also made quite a few
good friends along the way.

Jeremy Garcia with Linus Torvalds at LinuxWorld in 2003
</p></div></div><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
BC: Meeting Linus so early in the life of LQ, must have been a huge
thrill. Did you get a chance to talk with him? Does he have an account
at LQ (and does he use it)?</em></span>
</p><p>
JG: Linus stopped by many of the booths in the .org pavilion, and we got
to chat with him for a while, so it was definitely an experience. He
mentioned that he was familiar with the site and had ended up there a
few times after searching for solutions to non-kernel problems, although
I don't think he has an account.
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
BC: With more than 500,000 registered users, LQ has to be one of the
largest non-distro-specific Linux user support forums. Why do you think
LQ has become so popular? Along those lines, the LQ community is one
of the most positive and supportive I've experienced. Any thoughts on
how you've managed to avoid the trolling and newb-bashing that seems
to happen on other support forums?</em></span>
</p><p>
JG: I think our success is very much due to the fact that we
<span   class="emphasis"><em>are</em></span>
friendly, positive and supporting. I explicitly set that welcoming tone
very early on, as I knew the Linux community had a reputation among some
for being rough on new users. The mods very much picked up on that and
have kept that ethos alive during our growth. With that culture now
ingrained, new members pick up on it and reciprocate.
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
BC: One of my favorite things about LQ, which I suspect often
is overlooked, is the direct link to &ldquo;Zero Reply Threads&rdquo; in the right-side
menu. I feel this is a great way for an experienced Linux user to jump in
and help those users who are, perhaps, most in need. Do you keep an eye
on the traffic to this page? And, has it had the desired effect? Also,
I noted that the listing is limited to posts from the last 30 days. Was
this time frame chosen for practical reasons or philosophical
ones?</em></span>
</p><p>
JG: I absolutely concur with your assessment; if you're an experienced
Linux user and are looking for a challenge, that link is a great place to
start. Answering &ldquo;Zero Reply Threads&rdquo; is something we actively
promote, and
we'll occasionally have dedicated Zero Reply Drives, which do measurably
impact the number of threads that haven't received a response. Returning
results from the last month seemed like a reasonable default, but you
can arbitrarily change the duration.
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
BC: The landscape of Linux is in a perpetual state of change&mdash;new and
changing distros, applications being forked, applications being
abandoned&mdash;how is this constant flux reflected in the LQ community, if
at all? And,
does it provide any challenges to you and the maintainers of LQ?</em></span>
</p><p>
JG: I don't think it presents us with any specific challenges. I think
the ever-changing landscape of the Open Source world is one thing that
keeps it fresh and interesting.
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
BC: Could you pull back the curtain a little bit on the annual LQ
Members Choice Awards? Linux users as a group tend to be very loyal to
their distro and preferred apps, so I imagine the voting and comments
can get heated.</em></span>
</p><p>
JG: With our large and varied member base, the MCA discussions 
certainly can get heated&mdash;especially when it comes to certain
categories, such
as desktop distro, text editor and a couple others. I started the annual
polls on a bit of a whim, and it's been really interesting to watch them
grow each year. It's also been rewarding to see how enthusiastic some
of the past winners have been.
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
BC: In addition to LQ, you are one of the principles of the <span class="emphasis"><em>Bad
Voltage</em></span> podcast. Please tell us about <span class="emphasis"><em>Bad
Voltage</em></span> and how it came to
be.</em></span>
</p><p>
JG: <span   class="emphasis"><em>Bad Voltage</em></span> is a podcast that myself, Jono Bacon, Bryan Lunduke and
Stuart Langridge have been doing for almost two years. Every two weeks,
we deliver an amusing (sometimes NSFW) take on technology, Linux, open
source, politics, music and anything else we think is interesting. I've
been friends with Jono for many years after seeing him at one too
many conferences and was introduced to Stuart through him. We tossed
the idea around for a bit after a suggestion from Jono and agreed that
Bryan complimented the team nicely. We recorded a pilot episode to see
if the idea was worth exploring further, and all of us knew it had some
potential right then. I think we've really hit our stride, and we recently
performed our first live show at SCALE in Los Angeles. We have another
live show coming up in Fulda, Germany. Check out <a href="http://badvoltage.org" target="_self">badvoltage.org</a> for more.

BC: What's the best way for an experienced Linux user
to get involved with LQ community? And, what is your advice to someone
just getting started with Linux?</em></span>
</p><p>
JG: We're always looking for experienced Linux users to help answer
questions. There is a continual stream of new and interesting challenges
to solve in the forum, so if you want to help the Linux community, I think
LQ is a great place to do so. As for those wanting to get started with
Linux, I'd say jump right in. Linux distributions have never been more
approachable, and if you get stuck, you can always head over to LQ for
help.
