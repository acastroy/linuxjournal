I recently had a problem trying to install the NVIDIA driver for
my machine. It seemed the latest driver had stopped supporting my graphics
card, and after updating my kernel, I was out of a driver. The question,
obviously, was &ldquo;which card did I have?&rdquo; But, I didn't
remember. If
you have to name the chipset of your motherboard, specify the CPU in
your box or get any other kind of hardware-related information, Linux
provides several utilities to help you. In my case, I quickly could get
the full ID of my graphics card, confirm that it really was getting a
bit long in the tooth and decide that a newer one wasn't such a bad idea.
</p><p>
In this article, I discuss several ways of getting hardware data
for your machine. In the most time-honored Linux shell way, I show how
to work with several command-line utilities, but if you prefer using a
GUI, I also include some graphical programs. And,
if you want to get into the nitty-gritty details, I give some
pointers on how to get that information by using the /proc or /sys
filesystem.

Glossary</b></p><p>
Working with hardware means dealing with several acronyms, and I must
admit, I had been using at least a couple of them without remembering
precisely what they meant. Here's a list of definitions you'll
surely need:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
ACPI (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface): related to power aspects.
</p></li><li><p>
AGP (Accelerated Graphics Port): a channel to allow attaching a video
graphics card (not typically seen since around 2008).
</p></li><li><p>
APM (Advanced Power Management): older than ACPI, also related to power
issues.
</p></li><li><p>
ATA (AT Attachment): &ldquo;AT&rdquo;, as in the old IBM AT, a standard to
connect storage devices, superseded by SATA in 2003.
</p></li><li><p>
BIOS (Basic Input/Output System): firmware used when booting an
Intel-compatible PC.
</p></li><li><p>
DMA (Direct Memory Access): a feature that allows giving hardware access to
RAM, independently of the CPU.
</p></li><li><p>
DMI (Desktop Management Interface): a framework for keeping track of
devices in a computer.
</p></li><li><p>
IDE (Integrated Drive Electronics): an interface standard that later
evolved into ATA.
</p></li><li><p>
IRQ (Interrupt ReQuest): a hardware signal that allows an interrupt handler
to process a given event.
</p></li><li><p>
PCI (Peripheral Component Interconnect): a bus standard for attaching
varied hardware devices to a computer, created in 1992.
</p></li><li><p>
UEFI (Unified EFI&mdash;Extensible Firmware Interface): a 2005 replacement
for BIOS, which deprecated the previous 1998 EFI standard.
</p></li><li><p>
USB (Universal Serial Bus): a standard bus defined in 1995 to allow
connecting all kinds of peripherals to a computer.
</p></li><li><p>
PATA (Parallel ATA): the new name for ATA, after SATA came out.
</p></li><li><p>
PCIe (PCI Express): a high-speed serial bus that replaced PCI and AGP in
2004.
</p></li><li><p>
RAID (Redundant Array of Independent&mdash;originally,
&ldquo;Inexpensive&rdquo;&mdash;Disks): a data storage virtualization
technology that combines several drives to work as a single one for
performance improvement and/or data redundancy. There are several RAID
schemes, including RAID 0 (&ldquo;striping&rdquo;), RAID 1
(&ldquo;mirroring&rdquo;), RAID 5 (&ldquo;striping + parity&rdquo;) and
RAID 10 (&ldquo;striping + mirroring&rdquo;).
</p></li><li><p>
SATA (Serial ATA): a bus interface to connect storage devices, currently
used in practically all PCs.
</p></li><li><p>
SCSI (Small Computer System Interface&mdash;pronounced
&ldquo;scuzzy&rdquo;): a set of standards for connection of devices and
transfer of data between computers and peripherals.

The <tt  >ls</tt> Command Family</h2></div></div><p>
Let's start the command-line work with a set of several utilities,
whose names all start with <tt  >ls</tt> (Table 1). Some of
these commands provide overlapping information
(<tt  >lsdev</tt> or <tt  >lshw</tt>,
for instance), but by using all of them, you can get a pretty clear idea
of whatever may be inside your Linux box.
</p><div class="table"><a name="N0x2986580.0x2a7f850"></a><p class="title"><b>Table 1. The ls* family of commands lets you access all aspects of

Let's start with CPU information. The <tt  >lscpu</tt> command provides data on
the CPUs in your box. You can opt to include all CPUs, whether off-line
or on-line, with the <tt  >-.all</tt> parameter, or you can select
<tt  >--online</tt>
and <tt  >--offline</tt>. The <tt  >--parse</tt> option
lets you choose what CPU
characteristics to list, including number, socket, cache data, maximum
and minimum speed (in MHz) and more. In my case, you'll see 
that my machine has a somewhat old single-socket, four-core, Intel
Core 2 Quad CPU, at 2.66GHz:

</p><p>
(Note: you can get most of this information by examining the
/proc/cpuinfo file or by browsing the /sys/bus/cpu/ directories; see the
DIY with /proc and /sys sidebar for more on this.)
</p><p>
Let's move on to block devices, such as hard disks, or CD and DVD
units. The <tt  >lsblk</tt> command produces information on all available block
devices (see Listing 1 for an example). As you can see, I have three hard
disks and a ROM (DVD) device. The three disks are known as /dev/sda,
/dev/sdb and /dev/sdc; the ROM device is /dev/sr0. The disks are
466GB, 149GB and 2.7TB in size. You can get a little information about
partitioning too; for instance, you can see that the first two disks
have a swap area enabled, but the third one doesn't. You also can get
the mountpoints (/, /disk-laptop and /disk-data) for the three disks.

There are many possible optional arguments, but the most typically used are
<tt  >--paths</tt>, which produces full device paths, and
<tt  >--topology</tt>,
if you are interested in internal details, such as physical sector size,
I/O scheduler name and so on. You can get owner, group and permissions
information with <tt  >--perm</tt>, as shown below (and, if you
really want detailed
information, try <tt  >--output-all</tt>, which will list about
50 columns' worth of data): 

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt; lsblk --perm
NAME      SIZE OWNER GROUP MODE
sda     465.8G root  disk  brw-rw----
|__sda1     4G root  disk  brw-rw----

|__sdc1   2.7T root  disk  brw-rw----
sr0      1024M root  cdrom brw-rw----
</pre>
</p><p>
For SCSI devices, you can add <tt  >--scsi</tt> to
<tt  >lsblk</tt>, but there's
also the more specific <tt  >lsscsi</tt> command. The basic 
information it produces is shown below, and it includes all available SCSI
devices.
In my case, it shows the three hard disks and the optical reader I already
found with <tt  >lsblk</tt>, plus three card readers. Note that you also get
more information on specific brands and models. For example, I have two
Western Digital hard drives (WD5000AAKS and WD30EZRX), plus a Maxtor
laptop drive (STM316021) and a Sony AD-7200S DVD unit:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt; lsscsi
[2:0:0:0] disk   ATA  WDC WD5000AAKS-0 1D05 /dev/sda 
[2:0:1:0] disk   ATA  MAXTOR STM316021 D    /dev/sdb 
[3:0:0:0] disk   ATA  WDC WD30EZRX-00M 0A80 /dev/sdc 
[3:0:1:0] cd/dvd SONY DVD RW AD-7200S  1.61 /dev/sr0 
[4:0:0:0] disk   Sony Card_R/W     -CF 1.11 /dev/sdd 
[4:0:0:1] disk   Sony Card_R/W     -SD 1.11 /dev/sde 
[4:0:0:2] disk   Sony Card_R/W     -MS 1.11 /dev/sdf 
</pre>
</p><p>
Check out all the possibilities of this command with <tt  >lsscsi
--help</tt>.
You'll see that you really can dig down into SCSI devices with
it. And, if you're interested, this command works by scanning the /sys
filesystem (see Resources, and the DIY with /proc and /sys
sidebar for more information).
</p><p>
Now, let's move on to some other commands. <tt  >lsusb</tt> provides 
information on all USB-connected devices; see Listing 2 for an example. (An
alternative is <tt  >usb-devices</tt>, but it's somewhat more obscure
in its output and has no configuration options.) As in most modern
computers, you'll probably have a lot of such devices. In my case, I
have a Bluetooth dongle, Webcam, keyboard, mouse and more. You
can get information on a specific bus or device with the
<tt  >-s</tt>
option or select a given vendor with the <tt  >-d</tt> option; for the latter, check the USB ID repository (see Resources) for
vendor/device numbers. Finally, if you want very detailed information,
try the <tt  >-v</tt> (verbose) option, but be prepared to
read a lot.
For my machine, <tt  >lsusb -v</tt> produces more than 1,300
lines of output.

Try the <tt  >-v</tt> or <tt  >-vv</tt> options, for verbose and very verbose
listings. To get full information on my (current) graphics card, I
proceeded as shown in Listing 3. I now have an NVIDIA GeForce 740, and I'm using
the nouveau kernel driver, among other internal details. Of course,
to understand the produced information fully, you must have a bit of
experience with PCI devices. Try the same command with

you'll see what I'm talking about.

If you are even more electronically/digitally minded,
<tt  >lsdev</tt>
produces information about your installed hardware, including interrupts,
ports, addresses and all such internal details. This command provides no
options, and it's not likely you'll use it unless you are dealing very
closely with hardware. Listing 4 shows an abbreviated example of
the output. This command scans /proc/interrupts, /proc/ioports
and /proc/dma, as described in the DIY with /proc and /sys
sidebar.

Finally, if you've made it this far, the <tt  >lshw</tt>
command is a sort of
catch-all that can produce lots of information on all of your
installed hardware. The <tt  >-short</tt> option provides a (somewhat)
abbreviated listing of everything in your box (see Listing 5, and note
some interesting lines, &ldquo;To Be Filled By O.E.M.&rdquo;, which show that
someone was careless when setting up my motherboard). With this command,
you get information on the system, buses, memory, processor, display,
network and everything else.

Notice the &ldquo;class&rdquo; column in Listing 5. You can get a hint of the
full information that <tt  >lshw</tt> can provide by using the
<tt  >-class</tt>
parameter to limit output. For example, see below the detailed specs on my
network card; it shows the vendor, model and plenty of other details
(warning: this is the kind of output you get if you don't restrict the
command with <tt  >-short</tt>; for my machine,
<tt  >lshw</tt> with no extra
options produces a listing more than 500 lines long):

The <tt  >lshw</tt> command has several other interesting options. For
example, it can produce either HTML or XML output (add the
<tt  >-html</tt> or
<tt  >-xml</tt> options); the former is appropriate for showing in a browser,
while the latter is useful if you want to store or process your hardware
information. See Figure 1 for just a small part of the full hardware
description of my box. For security purposes, the
<tt  >-sanitize</tt> option
removes sensitive information, such as serial numbers. There's
even an <tt  >-X</tt> option to use a graphical interface (I'll
get to that later).

So far, I've discussed several ls* commands, and even if they are
not actually a &ldquo;family&rdquo;, they are my favorite tools. It's easy 
to remember them by typing <tt  >ls</tt> and letting type-ahead suggest
the rest. However, there are more command-line possibilities, so let's
take a look.

What's SMBIOS?</b></p><p>
How does Linux recognize what devices are installed? Since 1995, the SMBIOS
(System Management BIOS) specification has provided this kind of information,
doing away with the need for potentially worrisome operations like
hardware probing. This standard (used by DMI) is geared to the Intel 32- and
64-bit processor architecture systems. Basically, it defines a structure
with appropriate data for each kind of device, such as CPU, RAM, system
slots and more. On principle, you could parse and decode this table
by yourself, but several of the commands shown in this article already
do that job. If you are curious about the specifics of the standard,
see the Resources section.

More Command-Line Options</h2></div></div><p>
Let's start with some general commands. The first,
<tt  >dmidecode</tt>,
allows you to dump the computer's DMI (or SMBIOS; see the What's
SMBIOS? sidebar) in a more readable format. If the table is found,
its contents are dumped record by record, similar to this:

<pre     class="programlisting">

</p><p>
If you don't want to list the entire table (several hundred lines in
my computer), you can restrict the output to a specific type of entry,
according to SMBIOS definitions (Table 2).
</p><div class="table"><a name="N0x2986580.0x3008510"></a><p class="title"><b>Table 2. SMBIOS has several record types that you can select with

If I were to give an award for &ldquo;Most Talkative Command&rdquo;, surely it
would go to <tt  >hwinfo</tt>, another command that can dump all the hardware
information on your computer. On my machine, running
<tt  >hwinfo</tt> without
any parameters produces more than 12,000 lines, including several memory
dumps of the SMBIOS table. You can produce a much more compact version

Of the command-line programs I'm covering in this article,
<tt  >inxi</tt> is
more colorful, even if only moderately (Figure 2).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11914f2.large.jpg"><img src="11914f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. inxi, even if only a command-line tool, at least tries to use some colors.
</p></div></div><p>
If invoked with no parameters, it will just produce a line like the
following, 
showing CPU, kernel, uptime and a few more details:

<pre     class="programlisting">
CPU~Quad core Intel Core2 Quad CPU Q8400 (-MCP-) 
 &#8618;clocked at 2003.000 Mhz Kernel~4.1.5-1-desktop 
 &#8618;x86_64 Up~2 days 23:24 Mem~2377.4/3949.4MB 
 &#8618;HDD~3660.7GB(67.9% used) Procs~202 Client~Shell 
 &#8618;inxi~1.7.24   
</pre>
</p><p>
However, you can use lots of options to get specific data. For
example, you can set the verbosity level with options
<tt  >-v0</tt>
(minimum) through <tt  >-v7</tt> (maximum verbosity). The
<tt  >-x</tt> option
allows including extra information for some hardware. Check out
<tt  >inxi -h</tt> to get all possible options. For instance, you can
get audio information with <tt  >inxi -A</tt> or graphics card data with
<tt  >inxi -G</tt> and so on:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# inxi -A
Audio:     Card-1: NVIDIA GK107 HDMI Audio Controller 
 &#8618;driver: snd_hda_intel Sound: ALSA ver: k4.1.5-1-desktop
           Card-2: Intel NM10/ICH7 Family High 
 &#8618;Definition Audio Controller driver: snd_hda_intel

Now, let's finish with
some GUI options.

The GUI Way</h2></div></div><p>
To start with, <tt  >usbview</tt> is a rough graphic equivalent
of <tt  >lsusb</tt> or
<tt  >usb-devices</tt>, which I discussed earlier. It's quite simple to use, with no
options or parameters. It shows two columns: the left one is a tree of
all available USB devices, and the right one gives the full details. 
Figure 3 shows details on my USB keyboard.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11914f3.large.jpg"><img src="11914f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. The <tt >usbview</tt> command shows the details of all USB devices in tree
form.
</p></div></div><p>
Let's move on to a command I already discussed, which shares the display
style: <tt  >lshw -X</tt>. Instead of producing a listing (as
shown previously), the
<tt  >-X</tt> option produces a graphic interface with several columns on the
left to let you choose what hardware to inspect. An area to the right
shows the full hardware details for the chosen device. Figure 4 shows the
result of analyzing my optical DVD reader/writer unit; the provided
information includes other details, such as the logical unit name, its
capabilities and more. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11914f4.large.jpg"><img src="11914f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. The <tt >lswh -X</tt> command produces a graphic
interface that lets you browse all hardware devices.
</p></div></div><p>
Another interesting program is <tt  >hardinfo</tt>, which
&ldquo;is not dead, but
needs a maintainer&rdquo;, according to its GitHub page (see Resources.) This
program shows a tree structure to the left with four main branches:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Computer shows lots of details about your machine: some are related to
software and not to hardware.
</p></li><li><p>
Devices includes all devices in your box, grouped by category.
</p></li><li><p>
Network not only shows network card details, but also some other aspects,
such as DNS servers or routing.
</p></li><li><p>
Benchmarks lets you see how your machine fares against other
computers, but because of the lack of updates, the comparisons are against old CPUs.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Figure 5 shows sample output.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11914f5.large.jpg"><img src="11914f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. The <tt >hardinfo</tt> command includes several extra pieces of data, not
limited only to hardware.
</p></div></div><p>
There are two more options. The &ldquo;Information&rdquo; menu entry allows you to
produce a report, in either HTML or plain-text format, choosing whichever
parts interest you. The &ldquo;Network Updater&rdquo; should let you update the
internal program data, including more recent benchmark results, but when I
tried to run it, I got a &ldquo;Contacting HardInfo Central Database
(failed)&rdquo;
message. See Figure 6 for a example of the produced HTML report.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11914f6.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. The <tt >hardinfo</tt> command can produce an HTML or text report describing your complete system.
</p></div></div><p>
Let's end with KDE's own <tt  >kinfocenter</tt>. This utility (see Figure 7,
which shows RAM details for my machine) is similar to the previous tools
I've been describing, and it offers a left pane with a tree with all available
options and a right pane with more details on the chosen option at the
left.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11914f7.large.jpg"><img src="11914f7.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 7. KDE's own kinfocenter shows not only hardware details, but plenty
of other system data as well.
</p></div></div><p>
The program doesn't restrict itself to hardware details, but shows all
kinds of other information, such as &ldquo;Samba Status&rdquo;,
&ldquo;Energy Information&rdquo;
or &ldquo;X-Server&rdquo;, just to mention a few.

DIY with /proc and /sys</b></p><p>
Linux is full of directories and files, but the /proc and /sys directories
are really strange. They don't actually exist, but they allow you to browse
them. They are full of zero-length empty files, but you can open and view
them. The /proc directory preceded /sys, and it has basically all details
about running processes (hence, the /proc name). Over time, more
files were added to it, mostly &ldquo;virtual&rdquo; ones, which don't actually exist,
but are created on the fly if you try to access them. (Most virtual
files sport a current timestamp, which shows that they constantly are kept
up to date and their contents are the latest possible.) The /sys directory
is more modern. It appeared around the time of the 2.6 kernel to
introduce more order and a better structure than provided by the older
/proc, which had just grown in a sort of haphazard way. Many of the files
(but not all) in /proc are duplicated in /sys, and whenever possible, you
should pick the files in the latter directory. The /sys directory has
several subdirectories:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
block/ has an entry pointing to each block device.
</p></li><li><p>
bus/ has directories for each bus type, and within each, two
subdirectories: devices/ and drivers/. The former has a
directory for each device, pointing to the device's directory in /root,
and the latter has a directory for each driver that was loaded for devices
on the given bus.
</p></li><li><p>
class/ has directories for each type of object; some examples are
block/, graphics/, net/, sound/ and so on.
</p></li><li><p>
dev/ provides directories for each type of device (for example,
dev/block/ or dev/char/), each with directories for each
appropriate device.
</p></li><li><p>
devices/ contains the global device hierarchy, with every physical device
in your system.
</p></li><li><p>
firmware/ includes directories for firmware-specific objects; for example,
acpi/ or memmap/, but the particular directories in your own
machine depend on the firmware drivers in your kernel.
</p></li><li><p>
fs/ has a directory for each filesystem type in your machine, each with
further directories for each specific device; for example, I have
/sys/fs/ext4/sda2, because the disk mounted as /dev/sda2 uses ext4.
</p></li><li><p>
kernel/ has several files related to the currently loaded kernel.
</p></li><li><p>
module/ has a subdirectory for each and every module loaded into the
kernel.
</p></li><li><p>
power/ represents the power subsystem.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
When you get to the deepest levels of any branch, you may find any number
of individual files, which you can read to get attributes of the given
object. What files? That's a hard question to answer, because it depends on
which specific branch you are visiting, so you'll have to do a bit of work before
you get to extract information from the /sys directory. (See Resources
for some pointers about this.) Also, be aware that you can write to some of
the files, and that will imply modifying the corresponding
parameter&mdash;be warned: do
this with care! However, if you keep at it, you'll be able to
duplicate the functionality of most of the tools shown in this article,
which often work the same way.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
I've covered a lot of commands that let you query your Linux machine
and learn, in more or less detail, what's exactly in it. And if you need
to, you even can get at the base data by yourself and whip up your own
hardware-inspection tool.
