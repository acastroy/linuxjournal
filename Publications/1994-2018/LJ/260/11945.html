Bitwig GmbH's Bitwig Studio</h2></div></div><p>
Bitwig Studio is Bitwig GmbH's software solution for empowering music
enthusiasts to realize their musical ideas at every stage of production.
Available for Linux, Mac OS X and Windows, the updated Bitwig Studio 1.3 most
prominently features complete multi-touch functionality for quick identification
of gestures for the most unique and intuitive workflow ever. With multi-touch,
users control multiple faders, knobs and device displays at the same time.
Other innovations in v1.3 include a radial menu for quick access to multiple
actions, an integrated keyboard that includes independent X/Y axis controls for
each finger and a new e-cowbell&mdash;because when you've got a fever, the only
cure is...more cowbell!

Red Hat Software Collections</h2></div></div><p>
In order to provide developers with ready access to applications needing
software components in order to utilize their newest features, Red Hat maintains
Red Hat Software Collections. This Red Hat offering, now at version 2.1, is a
package of essential open-source Web development tools, dynamic languages,
databases and a variety of development and performance management tools. The
content is either more recent than equivalent versions included in the base Red
Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) system or is new to RHEL. Red Hat Software
Collections 2.1 includes Red Hat Developer Toolset 4, which has the latest
stable open-source C and C++ compilers and dev tools. For developers following
the rapid development and deployment cycles inherent to Linux containers, many
of the most popular Red Hat Software Collections also have been made available
as Dockerfiles and/or Docker-formatted container images via the Red Hat Customer
Portal.

Jedox 6</h2></div></div><p>
With the new Jedox 6, vendor Jedox says it has managed to distill the essence of
its unified business intelligence (BI) and planning platform, accelerate it and
make it easier to use. Jedox is a unified planning, analysis and reporting
platform that empowers decision-makers from finance, sales, purchasing and
marketing to work smarter, streamline business collaboration and make
insight-based decisions with confidence. Jedox 6 improves the BI platform by
including connectors for Salesforce, SAP HANA, Hadoop and the Qlik social
collaboration platform, as well as by providing a completely new mobile
experience. Meanwhile, speed, enterprise scalability and usability are enhanced
due to the new integrated Dynamic Data Engine. The improved mobile experience
stems in large part from the integration of the newly acquired Reboard mobile BI
platform. Because Jedox 6 is available as SaaS and on-premise, it completely
supports companies transitioning to the cloud.

Varnish Software's Varnish Cache</h2></div></div><p>
Headlining the innovations in the new Varnish Cache 4.1 open-source HTTP engine
are improved security and proxy support. These advances enhance the recently
added streaming architecture, which cuts down delivery times for larger
objects and decreases latency when accessing content through cache hierarchies.
A noteworthy new security feature is support for different kinds of privilege
separation methods, collectively described as jails. On the topic of proxy protocol
support, version 4.1 provides socket support for PROXY protocol connections,
whereby PROXY defines a short preamble on the TCP connection where typically an
SSL/TLS terminating proxy can signal the real client address. Varnish Software
notes that more than 2.2 million Web sites use its HTTP accelerator,
including 14% of the top global 10,000 sites.

New Spaces AG's Gravit.io</h2></div></div><p>
The Principality of Liechtenstein may have fewer people than the pueblo of
Bountiful, Utah, but it can boast innovations like New Spaces AG's Gravit.io,
&ldquo;the world's first Web-based pixel design tool&rdquo;. Gravit offers
features that will allow anyone&mdash;from beginner to professional&mdash;to start
designing free of charge. Examples include a company logo, Facebook timeline or
graphics for a Web site. The site has basic features that cater to those who are
unfamiliar with design software as well as advanced features that a professional
would be happy to use for everyday work. This new version 2.0 makes it easier
for users to create, edit and manage their designs, and it includes additions
like
the professional Bezigon Pen and more than two dozen photo filter options.
Gravit's developers say that its creation is unlike other design software
and services in that it is more than a pixel design tool. It also is a cloud-based
design platform that allows users to design, share their work and interact with
other designers and community members as part of their regular workflow.

FreeFileSync</h2></div></div><p>
The new version 7.5 is the latest rendition of FreeFileSync, a free and
open-source utility that synchronizes files and folders for &ldquo;all modern
versions&rdquo; of Linux, Windows and Mac OS X. FreeFileSync is designed to save
users' time setting up and running backup and sync jobs while enjoying useful
visual input along the way. The software has been optimized for both CPU and
file I/O performance, enabling it to scan a hard drive with hundreds of
thousands of files in seconds. The fail-safe file copy design includes multiple
strategies to prevent data corruption if the synchronization process is
interrupted. The latest version 7.5 now supports the SFTP protocol, adding the
unique benefit of eliminating the tedious and error-prone task of manually
identifying files that have changed on the source computer and moving them to
the target computer. Another new feature is the detection of moved files on the
source computer, even for targets with no file-id support or with unstable
file-id support. Finally, enhanced media transfer protocol (MTP) support makes
it even easier for users to synchronize files and folders between their PCs and
their other MTP devices.

Neverware's CloudReady</h2></div></div><p>
Helping schools extend the life of their hardware is one key objective of
Neverware and its Google-supported CloudReady OS, which turns almost any
existing PC or Mac into a fully functional Chromebook. The new free version of
CloudReady has been certified by Neverware on nearly 200 computer models and can
be used on hundreds of others. Automatic updates are included, and simple
installation occurs from a USB thumb drive. Because CloudReady is based on the
same code that powers Chromebooks, it offers complete and secure integration
with Google Apps and other Google services. A previously released paid version
of CloudReady also exists, adding a complement of dedicated support and
integration with Google's device management console. Neverware says that
numerous school districts have expressed satisfaction that CloudReady has
appreciably increased their device-to-student ratios.

Simon Monk's <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Maker's Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse</em></span> (No Starch Press)</h2></div></div><p>
Author, hardware hacker and zombie anthropologist Simon Monk wants to know
where his fellow makers will be when the zombie apocalypse hits. Trapping
yourself in the basement? Roasting the family pet? Beheading re-animated
neighbors? &ldquo;No way!&rdquo; offers Monk. With his guidance, you'll be
building fortresses, setting traps and hoarding supplies, because you, savvy
survivor, have snatched up your copy of <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Maker's Guide to the Zombie
Apocalypse</em></span> before it's too late. Subtitled <span   class="emphasis"><em>Defend Your Base with Simple
Circuits, Arduino, and Raspberry Pi</em></span>, this indispensable guide to survival after
Z-day will teach apprentice zombie anthropologists how to generate their own
electricity, salvage parts, craft essential electronics and out-survive the
undead. Readers will learn myriad survival skills. They will take charge of
their environment&mdash;for example, by powering zombie defense devices with car batteries, bicycle
generators and solar power. They will escape imminent danger&mdash;for example,
by repurposing 
old disposable cameras for zombie-distracting flashbangs. And they will
communicate with other survivors&mdash;for example by passing silent messages with two-way
vibration walkie-talkies. Survival of the zombie apocalypse calls for these and
many more essential, life-saving measures.
