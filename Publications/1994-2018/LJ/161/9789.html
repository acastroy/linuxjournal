What distribution are you loading up today, Fran&ccedil;ois? MCNLive? Very
nice, and compact too. When you get a chance, you should copy it to
your USB key. That way, you always can carry a live Linux distribution
with you. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Quoi?</em></span> You're not sure if this is
<span   class="emphasis"><em>the</em></span> one? I
see. Yesterday, you were running OpenSUSE 10.2, and the day before you
installed Debian Etch in the morning and Kubuntu Feisty in the
afternoon. Last week, you managed Fedora Core 7, CentOS 5, Mandriva
Corporate Desktop 4.0, Slackware Linux 12 and a half-dozen others. Are
you having trouble finding something you like? You like them all but
you just can't choose, eh?
</p><p>
Well, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mon ami</em></span>, I hate to interrupt this voyage of discovery, but I
need that wine list I sent you a couple of days ago. What do you mean,
you don't have it? It was on the machine where you are installing the distros and you
erased the disk? You know, Fran&ccedil;ois, there are better ways to try
out all these distributions. For the moment, leave what you are doing
and head down to the wine cellar. I can see our guests approaching the
restaurant now, and they will be here any second. Bring back the George
du Beouf Cuv&eacute;e Saint Valentin from the East wing. There are three cases
right next to that old suit of armor you brought in last year.
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Vite!</em></span>
</p><p>
Welcome, everyone, to <span   class="emphasis"><em>Chez Marcel</em></span>, where fine wine meets great
Linux and open-source software. Please, sit down and make yourselves
comfortable. I've already sent my faithful waiter on a quest to retrieve
the perfect wine for tonight's menu. While we wait, I'm going to introduce
you to an impressive parade of Linux distributions, courtesy of system
virtualization. Best of all, you can keep running your current system
while you take these others out for a spin.
</p><p>
Ah, glad to have you back, Fran&ccedil;ois. Please, pour for our guests while
I introduce the first item on tonight's menu.
</p><p>
Fabrice Bellard's QEMU is a free, open-source, machine emulator
and virtualizer. The reason for this distinction is that QEMU can emulate
different machine types and hardware, but the performance, although not bad,
can be greatly improved upon. Virtualization is achieved by using a kernel
module that executes code on your system processor rather than emulating
the processor. Another reason this is an important distinction to
make is that QEMU also can emulate different processor architectures. For
instance, if you wanted to run a SPARC or a PowerPC machine on your Intel
processor, you could. Fabrice's Web site has a nice table showing the
various processors that can be emulated. There also are some prebuilt
QEMU images of different operating systems ready for download&mdash;you
even can get FREEDOS and Minix if you like. What we're going to do
though, is install Linux, lots and lots of Linux distributions.
</p><p>
Most modern Linux distributions come with QEMU, but the latest source
always is available from <a href="http://fabrice.bellard.free.fr" target="_self">fabrice.bellard.free.fr</a>. The
virtualization kernel module, however, usually requires that you download
it from the site and build it yourself. Although you don't 
need it specifically, the performance improvements are dramatic and well worth the
effort. Because this is a kernel module, you load it with the <tt  >modprobe
kqemu</tt> command.
</p><p>
Let's take a look at how QEMU works. For this first demonstration,
I'm going to install Puppy Linux from an ISO image downloaded from the
Puppy Linux Web site. Because Puppy is a cute little distribution with
minimal space requirements, I create a relatively small disk
image (a virtual hard disk) for it to live in. This is done with the
<tt  >qemu-img</tt> command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
qemu-img create puppy216.img 256M
</pre>
</p><p>
The above command creates a raw format disk image by default. There are
a few different image formats, most notably qcow2, which is a
more portable image format, useful if you want to install that other
OS&mdash;you know, the one from Redmond. Our next step is to install Linux into
this disk image, which I do using this command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
qemu -cdrom ../isos/puppy-2.16.1-seamonkey-fulldrivers.iso \
   -hda ./puppy216.img -m 256 -boot d 
</pre>
</p><p>
Several interesting things are happening here, and I'll describe each one
briefly. For starters, the -cdrom parameter is, in fact, the path
to the CD-ROM image from which you are installing your distribution. If
you were using a physical CD-ROM, that path would likely be something like
/dev/cdrom. The next parameter, -hda, defines the path
to the disk image we just created. This is followed by the -m
switch, which, in this case, allocates 256MB of RAM to the running
session. Finally, we have -boot, which identifies the boot
drive (our CD image), the so-called D drive. As soon as I press Enter,
the Puppy Linux install starts (Figure 1).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9789f1.large.jpg"><img src="9789f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. QEMU boots a Puppy!
</p></div></div><p>
From here, you simply follow the steps for a Puppy Linux installation
(or those of whatever distribution you are installing). Before I show the
result, I'd like to share one more parameter with you&mdash;the -std-vga parameter. This tells QEMU to simulate a standard
VGA card with Bochs extensions. You also can use the -localtime
parameter to tell QEMU to run your session using the local machine time,
as opposed to the default UTC. Remember the kernel acceleration? Try
using -kernel-kqemu. This is only a small sample. There
are network parameters, USB parameters, file-sharing parameters (SMB),
devices parameters and more. I'm covering only the basics here, so make
sure you check out the man page for the qemu command. Remember
also that my settings for this example imply a very small footprint
distribution. To run something slightly larger, such as MCNLive (a great
live distribution based on Mandriva), I would create a larger disk image
(see Figure 2 for a shot of MCNLive in action).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9789f2.large.jpg"><img src="9789f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. A Lovely Graphical
Desktop, Courtesy of MCNLive and QEMU
</p></div></div><p>
When you start working in a QEMU session for the first time, you may
find yourself wondering why you can't mouse out of the session.
This is the first and most important lesson you will learn about QEMU
keyboarding. Once you click in a QEMU session, it takes control of
your mouse. Pressing Ctrl-Alt releases control so you can work on your
master system. To return to the QEMU session, simply click anywhere on the
window. The second most important keyboard command is Ctrl-Alt-F, which
switches to and from full-screen mode.
</p><p>
Now, Puppy Linux and MCNLive are live distributions, but both
offer an install icon on the desktop. Once a distribution is installed,
starting the session is a little different, mostly because you won't be
booting from the CD-ROM ISO image. In this example, I simply identify my
hard disk image for QEMU and select the amount of RAM I want
to use:

<pre     class="programlisting">
qemu -hda ./mcnlive.img -m 384
</pre>
</p><p>
All this command-line work is easy enough, but there are dozens
of qemu command parameters, not to mention tons of possible
options or combinations of those. That's why we are going to look at
some great graphical tools for working with QEMU, starting with Erik
Meitner and Linas Zvirblis' Qemu Launcher.
</p><p>
Qemu Launcher provides a front end to basic as well as advanced features
of the QEMU command suite. There are three tabs: Configurations,
Launcher Settings and About. Most of the action takes place under
the first tab. For starters, you can create a set of configurations
based on existing QEMU images simply by entering a configuration name,
a file location for your hard disk (the image created by qemu-img)
and defining the memory you want to allocate. Click the Save button,
and you are ready to start your virtual machine by clicking the Launch
button on the lower right of the Qemu Launcher interface. In Figure 3,
I've added a profile for Debian Etch 4.0 to launch with 384MB of RAM.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="9789f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Adding an
existing QEMU image under Qemu Launcher is easy.
</p></div></div><p>
I entered the path to the Debian Etch image, but I also could have clicked
the New button next to the Hard disk 0 label and created an image using
the pop-up dialog. My next step would have been to click the Use CD-ROM
check box, select CD-ROM from the Boot disk drop-down list, and continue
normally from there. As you can see, the Configurations tab is also a
multitabbed affair that allows you to access other QEMU settings. Under
Linux boot, you can specify an alternate kernel image or pass kernel
parameters. The Network tab offers control over your network card (the
default is to use a pass-through to your main system) and also provides
access to a Samba share&mdash;useful should you want to run Windows. From the
Hardware tab, you can choose an alternate video device, set the clock,
define your hardware or turn on system sounds to name a few options. Finally,
the Emulator tab gives you control over the QEMU session itself.
</p><p>
Incidentally, a recent alternative to QEMU is KVM (Kernel Virtual
Machine), which works by taking advantage of processor-based hardware
virtualization technology. On the Intel platform, this is known as VT,
which AMD processors call their hardware virtualization, Pacifica. 
This means you can take advantage of Linux KVM to run your
virtual machines with substantially better performance than you can
with straight software virtualization. The catch, as you might expect,
is that not every machine out there supports hardware virtualization. To
find out whether your system is a candidate, execute this little snippet
of code from a terminal window or shell:

<pre     class="programlisting">
grep -E '^flags.*(vmx|svm)' /proc/cpuinfo
</pre>
</p><p>
If you see the string <tt  >vmx</tt> or
<tt  >svm</tt> returned, your
processor is ready. If not, you'll have to stick with the software-based
virtualization provided by QEMU. The KVM commands are pretty
much interchangeable with those of QEMU, as are the install and
operating system images. In fact, KVM is based on QEMU.
</p><p>
The next item on tonight's menu isn't as sophisticated or flexible (you
can't create images), but those of you with a soft spot for Ruby may want
to check out Mathieu Mast's Qemu Supervisor, a front end based on,
you guessed it, the Ruby programming language. Aside from Ruby itself,
you also need to have the Ruby GTK2 bindings, the libgtk2-ruby
package and its dependencies. Once these prerequisites are met, it's
only a matter of extracting the Qemu Supervisor source and running a
<tt  >make install</tt> from the source directory. To run the program,
execute the command <tt  >qemu-supervisor</tt>. From the interface that
appears (Figure 4), you can choose to add QEMU images for launch.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9789f4.large.jpg"><img src="9789f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Now you
can Ruby-up your QEMU sessions with Qemu Supervisor.
</p></div></div><p>
The final item on tonight's menu, Rainer Haage's Qemulator, is
a must-see stop on your search for the ultimate QEMU front end to all
your ultimate Linux (virtual) boxes. This impressive and feature-rich
application covers pretty much every aspect of QEMU's operation,
including
creating disk images (Figure 5), installing distributions,
monitoring running instances and so much more.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9789f5.large.jpg"><img src="9789f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. Qemulator makes QEMU easy with tools for image creation and
more.
</p></div></div><p>
Like the other programs featured here, Qemulator provides easy access to
existing QEMU images. Click the Plus sign at the top of the main window,
enter the basics and save. To run a virtual machine, simply click the run
arrow at the top right. The main window lists existing images under the
My Machines tab. Each of these machines can, in turn, be configured
or changed by clicking the Show Settings button at the bottom of the
main window (Figure 6). The tabbed view provides access to image
settings, disks and other hardware, network settings and more. Several
machines can run simultaneously (given adequate resources) with access
to each under the Running Jobs tab.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9789f6.large.jpg"><img src="9789f6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. Easy
access to all QEMU settings are a click away.
</p></div></div><p>
There are some nice, somewhat hidden features as well. For instance,
right-click on a machine in the My Machines list, and a small pop-up menu 
appears. From that menu, you can select Show command line&mdash;perfect for
the curious who want to find out exactly what the qemu command
is doing once all those settings have been tweaked. From that same menu,
you can get information on the image itself, change settings and more.
</p><p>
To round things out, Qemulator even provides an Install Wizard to take
you through the steps of loading up yet another distribution. Simply click
System on the menu bar and select Install system.
</p><p>
Looking around the restaurant floor, I see that many of you are already
discovering a downside of running all these virtual machines. Virtual
or not, each instance of Linux (or whatever else) that you run, requires
processor time and system memory. The more VMs you choose to run, the more
resources you will be drawing on. I run a second distribution happily on
my dual-core notebook, but a third is pretty much out of the question
for this machine. The more resources you can provide, the faster your
virtual machines will run and the more virtual machines you can run.
</p><p>
Ah, if only we could find some way to run multiple instances of our
award-winning wine cellar. But then, Fran&ccedil;ois and I might not have the
pleasure of sharing ours with you, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>. And now, sadly,
the time has arrived, and we must head back to our non-virtual
homes. However, we here at <span   class="emphasis"><em>Chez Marcel</em></span> would never dream of sending
you off without a final glass of wine. Fran&ccedil;ois, please take a moment
to refill our guests' glasses one last time. Raise your glasses,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>mes
amis</em></span>, and let us all drink to one another's health.
<span   class="emphasis"><em>A votre sant&eacute;! Bon app&eacute;tit!</em></span>
