Lessons on evangelizing free and open-source software over a
round of libations.

&ldquo;How can I convince my professors to use free and open-source software
(FOSS) in their classes?&rdquo; asked Dennis, a former Pollywog that
is now going to a university in Brazil. Dennis is old enough now to
join me legally for libations at the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Alideia dos
Piratas</em></span>, the beach-side
restaurant and bar where I hang out, although he often hints that he
had been &ldquo;libating&rdquo; much longer than the legal age limit
allows.
</p><p>
&ldquo;The first thing you need to do&rdquo;, I answered, &ldquo;is create compelling
arguments for the use of FOSS in the classroom. These arguments might
include freedom from proprietary licensing and licensing's inherent
costs and issues, the fact that the FOSS source code allows you both to
use the software as a tool and to see how the software arrived at
its answer. Publishing research results also is easier with FOSS,
because you can freely publish source code for your work, not just talk
about the work conceptually. FOSS allows schools to have better
control over the software used on their systems, especially when they need to
upgrade software and hardware. You should try to stick to practical
reasons that are easy to defend, including the fact that FOSS is used
in many commercial environments, which means that students will use it
when they leave school.
&rdquo;
</p><p>
&ldquo;Present these arguments to the faculty and administration in a calm,
professional way. If they do not respond favorably, ask their reasons
for using proprietary software and ask whether you can address those reasons
in a follow-up meeting.
&rdquo;
</p><p>
&ldquo;Second, make it as easy as possible for them to use FOSS. Remember
that professors are like a lot of other people, and they are very busy just
trying to keep up with all the other issues in their jobs and lives.
Developing new courses and course material takes time and research, and
although you can look at it as part of their jobs, you also can be assured
that they are busy with other aspects of their jobs.
&rdquo;
</p><p>
&ldquo;One tactic would be for you to take an existing course, such as compiler
design or database theory and transform it to using FOSS. You could find (or create) a bibliography of
all the open-source projects that you can locate on the Web having
to do with that subject. See if there are any books that relate to
teaching that topic, which are oriented toward FOSS rather than
closed-source products.
&rdquo;
</p><p>
&ldquo;In the case of the operating system, a wealth of projects
using FOSS can be used to help teach a course in OS design&mdash;not only the Linux kernel, but the *BSD (OpenBSD, FreeBSD, NetBSD)
kernels, FreeDOS, TinyOS and a variety of others. There also are 
several on-line talks and papers discussing aspects of FOSS OS design
that can be useful, and for the more popular operating systems, 
specific books describe the kernel and the way it works.
&rdquo;
</p><p>
&ldquo;In the case of database design, a series of different
projects also are useful&mdash;everything from MySQL and PostgreSQL to
Berkeley DB (although an Oracle product, it is still open source),
Firebird, flat-file databases and libraries for other types of data
accesses, such as ISAM.
&rdquo;
</p><p>
&ldquo;Accumulating the bibliography for the course might be enough to gain the
professor's interest. Many times professors have heard the terms
free software or open source, but they have not had the time to 
investigate how much software and resources are out there with respect
to their own courses.
&rdquo;
</p><p>
&ldquo;If the professor still doesn't accept using FOSS to
teach the course, you could take the next step of actually devising
a set of notes for the course as you study the supplied material.
Nothing helps you learn the subject matter as much as having to try to
organize it and explain it to others, and creating a set of class notes
and presentation slides based on FOSS would help you learn the underlying
information very completely.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Dennis looked at me with a sort of horror on his face. &ldquo;That sounds
like a lot of work&rdquo;, he said.
</p><p>
&ldquo;It could be&rdquo;, I agreed. &ldquo;Fortunately, you may not have to do all the
work yourself, as Googling the Internet using the terms course
notes and operating system turned up several editions of class notes
that were under the GPL or copyable with attribution. You also
might enlist some other students in the class to help by doing different
chapters and then merge the
work back into a single document.
&rdquo;
</p><p>
&ldquo;I took compiler theory twice, once as an
undergraduate and once for my MS in Computer Science, yet I feel that I
really did not know compiler theory until I had to teach it to others.
Now, more than 20 years after giving the last formal class on that
subject, I feel I easily can explain fundamentals of how a compiler works.
Knowing difficult material that thoroughly is kind of scary in a
way.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Both Dennis and I sat in silence for a couple of seconds contemplating
this thought, then we both ordered another libation.
</p><p>
&ldquo;Can other areas of the university also use FOSS methods to teach their
courses?&rdquo; asked Dennis.
</p><p>
&ldquo;Of course. There are thousands of FOSS programs that students and
faculty can use in engineering, the sciences and other aspects of
education. In addition, there are freely available pieces of information
like Project Gutenberg, which houses more than 17,000 books and articles whose
copyright have expired. I have a friend who teaches English as a second
language but did not know of this treasure of on-line books that she
could use for her students free of charge.
&rdquo;
</p><p>
&ldquo;Some disciplines, such as civil engineering, use a lot of maps and
mapping software. The use of software from projects, such as FreeGIS
(<a href="http://www.freegis.org" target="_self">www.freegis.org</a>) and Open Source GIS (<a href="http://opensourcegis.org" target="_self">opensourcegis.org</a>), allow these academic fields
to use and understand mapping software. Hospital administration and
management courses can benefit from the OpenVista Project, a complete
hospital administrative system used by the United States Department of
Veterans Affairs that was then made freely distributable. Management courses
at universities can benefit from sophisticated FOSS project and portfolio
management systems such as project.net (<a href="http://www.project.net" target="_self">www.project.net</a>), both to train
students how to use such tools and show students how those
tools work.&rdquo;
</p><p>
&ldquo;What about the administration of our school, are there any FOSS programs
that can help them?&rdquo; asked Dennis.
</p><p>
&ldquo;Yes. Schools often spend huge amounts of money for
administrative software that barely works. I know of one major university
that was going to spend ten million dollars to buy and implement an
administrative system.
&rdquo;
</p><p>
&ldquo;Another university in Australia had spent 17 million Australian dollars
on a commercial system, which (after five years) did not work at all.
The Australian university was told that it would cost an additional
five million Australian dollars and another three years of development
to get a 'vanilla' system, one that was not tuned to their school,
but at least worked. Maybe.
&rdquo;
</p><p>
&ldquo;Compare all of that to SAGU, a system that was created in Brazil as a FOSS
project, which is now used by more than 60 universities throughout the
world, having been translated from its native Portuguese to Spanish and
English. Another interesting project is that of the Kuali Foundation,
in its effort to create FOSS financial software for universities.
&rdquo;
</p><p>
&ldquo;Although not exactly an administrative program, the Sakai Project
(<a href="http://www.sakaiproject.org" target="_self">www.sakaiproject.org</a>) is a FOSS system that is being developed by a
consortium of companies and educational institutions for learning and
research collaboration. There's also Moodle, a well-known CMS system for use
in education. All of these, and more, are available for use and can
save huge amounts of money for budget-strapped schools and
universities.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Dennis finished his drink, thought about what I had said, and asked
the question, &ldquo;What happens, if after all this work to try to convince my
university to use FOSS, they still refuse to use FOSS?&rdquo;
</p><p>
&ldquo;The efforts you take to research and make the argument about using FOSS
software would not be wasted. Perhaps you will learn more about your
subjects by making these efforts, and that can never hurt. I know a
young man who started a FOSS project to write an operating system kernel
when he was going to college in Helsinki, Finland....&rdquo;
