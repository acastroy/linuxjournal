Dave explores Bash command-line history and delves into the super-powerful
<tt  >find</tt> command.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a83580.0x2b7b408"></a></h2></div></div><p>
It has been a while since I spent some time looking at basic command-line features and how they tie in to shell scripts, so I thought it'd be
a good time to go back to basics. Let's start with some fundamentals of
command-line history, actually. 
</p><p>
If you're like me, you're stuck in a rut, either using
<tt  >!xx</tt> to repeat the most recent command starting with that letter
or those letters, or using the arrow up/down keys to step through your
command history and find a specific command. I definitely get into a
<tt  >!v !cc !.</tt> loop when I'm developing
software, for example&mdash;useful.
</p><p>
But, there's a lot more that your Bash shell can do in terms of
manipulating your command history. A common one is to search for a specific
command, then repeat it with the command's numeric ID, like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ history | grep find
  213   find $HOME -name "*.zip" -print
$ !213
</pre>
</p><p>
Make a typo on the command? You can use arrow keys to monkey around and fix
it, but that can be tedious. Instead, use the ^old^new replacement sequence:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ pc oldfile newfile
-bash: pc: command not found
$ ^pc^cp
cp oldfile newfile
$
</pre>
</p><p>
It's super helpful, and notice that Bash echoes the corrected command so you
know what's going on too.
</p><p>
One of my favorites is to repeat all the arguments of the previous command
but not the command itself. Use <tt  >!*</tt>, like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ vi file1 file2 file3
$ cp !* ~
</pre>
</p><p>
Got that? The <tt  >cp</tt> command will copy each of the three files to
your home directory for safekeeping.
</p><p>
You also can select individual parameters by index number too, as I
demonstrate here:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ echo listening to the soundtrack from cloud atlas
listening to the soundtrack from cloud atlas
$ echo !!:3
echo the
the
$ echo !!:3-5
-bash: :3-5: bad word specifier
</pre>
</p><p>
Hmm...what went wrong on that second example? Did you figure it out?
The <tt  >!!</tt> applies to the command immediately before the current
command, so the long string of <tt  >listening to the soundtrack from cloud
atlas</tt> is <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> what's being modified, and there are only two words
in the immediately previous command (<tt  >echo the</tt>).
</p><p>
There are two ways to get the latter example to work, either have it come
immediately after the longer echo statement or tap into the power of Bash
history modifiers even further by referencing the command by its number:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ history | grep cloud atlas
  508   echo listening to the soundtrack from cloud atlas
$ echo !508:6-7
echo cloud atlas
cloud atlas
$
</pre>
</p><p>
Obviously, the shell's habit of echoing the expanded command before it
actually executes it makes these examples a bit annoying, but they
demonstrate the concept, and quite frankly, sometimes when you're working
with the shell, a bit of redundancy isn't such a horrible thing anyway.

The Incredible <tt  >find</tt> Command</h2></div></div><p>
Enough command-line history though. Let's shift to the rather insanely
complicated <tt  >find</tt> command instead. There's actually quite a bit you can
do with <tt  >find</tt>, and that's why it ends up being a really
complex utility. Worse, its command-line parameters are specified in a
format quite different from most Linux commands because they're generally
in -parameter value pairs, except the very first parameter, which specifies
the starting directory for the search.
</p><p>
Unless it's command-line flags that aren't in the -parameter value
format. 
</p><p>
To make this more fun, there are different versions of
<tt  >find</tt> floating
around, depending on what flavor of Linux you're running&mdash;UNIX, NetBSD,
Darwin and so on. I'll try to talk about general approaches to working with
<tt  >find</tt>, but if you encounter hiccups, check your man page (<tt  >man
find</tt>)
to see what your local variant should be.
</p><p>
The most basic use of <tt  >find</tt> is to search for filenames that match a specific
pattern&mdash;for example, all &ldquo;C&rdquo; source files in the home directory or
any subdirectory thereunder:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ find ~ -name "*.c" -print
</pre>
</p><p>
On modern <tt  >find</tt> commands, the <tt  >-print</tt> parameter is redundant and
can be omitted, but if you've an old-school version of
<tt  >find</tt>, omitting
it might result in zero output&mdash;not so useful.
</p><p>
<tt  >find</tt> can check a lot of different characteristics of files too. Here's
the same search, but this time, let's say you want only C source files that
are more than 1K
and have been created 30 or fewer days old:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ find ~ -name "*.c" -ctime -30d -size +1k -print
</pre>
</p><p>
And now, here's an explanation, because I know you need one.
</p><p>
Times can be specified in seconds, minutes, hours, days or weeks by
specifying &ldquo;smhdw&rdquo;, respectively. Size is specified in kilobytes,
megabytes, gigabytes, terabytes and petabytes with &ldquo;kmgtp&rdquo;,
respectively.
</p><p>
Then, a specified value defaults to an exact match, so <tt  >-ctime
30d</tt> will 
match only files that were created exactly 30 days earlier&mdash;not quite so useful.
So, the <tt  >-</tt> prefix means &ldquo;less than or equal
to&rdquo;, and
<tt  >+</tt> means &ldquo;greater than or equal to&rdquo;.
Got it?
</p><p>
You also can search for files by permission string, which is darn useful
for administrators. In fact, a very common search that you should do
occasionally is this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ find / -perm -4000 -user root -print
</pre>
</p><p>
This introduces yet another parameter: <tt  >-owner</tt>.
There's also a
group value if you want to check group ID, although in modern Linux that
seems to be far less utilized than it was back in the old
days&mdash;progress,
or something like that.
</p><p>
<tt  >find</tt> has an <tt  >-exec</tt> parameter that's worth exploring too, because it lets
you invoke arbitrary Linux commands on each and every matching file. So you
started with a basic command to list all C source files by looking for
matches with the simple pattern <tt  >*.c</tt>, but the output of that is just the
filenames&mdash;boring.
</p><p>
Instead, <tt  >-exec</tt> can let you output an <tt  >ls -l</tt> result for each one
just as easily:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ find ~ -name "*.c" -exec ls -l '{}' \;

</p><p>
It seems like pretty complicated output, but really, it's just an <tt  >ls
-l</tt>
with a lot of subdirectories making things look more complicated. You can
handle that, right? 
</p><p>
The parameters required for <tt  >-exec</tt> are tricky. The
<tt  >{}</tt> sequence is replaced
with the matching filename, but without the quotes, it'll be
preprocessed and removed. And, the weird <tt  >\;</tt> sequence
is because <tt  >-exec</tt> needs
to know how far to read on the parameter list, so it reads until the
<tt  >;</tt>. But again, that'd be interpreted by Bash before 
even being given to <tt  >find</tt> without the
backslash&mdash;hence <tt  >\;</tt>.
</p><p>
So, a really common way for sysadmins to search for setuid root programs
is a slight variant on the above:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ find / -perm -4000 -user root -exec ls -l '{}' \; | 
   mail -s "setuid programs and scripts" admin
</pre>
</p><p>
That'll send an e-mail report that lists all files with setuid and owner root
to the e-mail address &ldquo;admin&rdquo;.
</p><p>
That's it for this article. Next time, I'll talk about the
<tt  >find|xargs</tt>
command pipe pair and the substantial problem with files and directories
that contain spaces.
