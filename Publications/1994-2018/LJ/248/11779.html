One server and one program can service many sites. Here's an introduction to
&ldquo;multitenant&rdquo; applications.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdb1580.0xea93b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
For some time now, there has been tremendous growth in the world of Web
applications. It's quite amazing to see what you can do just via a Web
browser&mdash;not only can you buy just about anything, but also a growing
number of sites offer &ldquo;software as a service&rdquo;, often abbreviated as
SaaS. The idea is that in exchange for a monthly service fee, you get
access to a service. Many thousands of such services exist that
take care of anything from Git repositories (for example, GitHub and
BitBucket), e-mail services (for example, AWeber and MailChimp), invoicing
systems, time-tracking systems, calendar systems, e-commerce systems,
e-learning systems&mdash;you name it.
</p><p>
As Web developers, you can create your own SaaS applications. That's
right&mdash;with little more than a Linux box, a database, a programming
language and a Web framework, you're positioned to create a new SaaS
application. With a good idea, some hard work and good marketing,
you'll be on your way to having a successful business.
</p><p>
There are numerous models for how SaaS can work. Sometimes, you have a
user name on a system, and you're simply interacting with your view of
the world. But sometimes, an SaaS app gives you what appears to be an
entirely new domain. So if I get an account on SuperDuperSaas.com,
everything I do will be under lerner.SuperDuperSaas.com.
</p><p>
Programs allowing for this are known as &ldquo;multitenant&rdquo;
applications. It's possible, of course, that each new subdomain
involves the rollout of a new virtual machine. But there also
are ways that you can make a single computer, with a single instance of
the application, provide the same illusion of an infinite number of
domains. Moreover, doing so is not nearly as difficult as you might
think.
</p><p>
In this article, I look at several techniques that make it possible for
you to create and maintain such multitenant applications. These
techniques can be used in an SaaS product or any other application in
which the software can and should respond differently to a variety of
hostnames or domain names.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdb1580.0xea9778"></a>
It's All Thanks to HTTP</h2></div></div><p>
HTTP, the Hypertext Transfer Protocol, is so ubiquitous that most people
barely give it any thought. Even someone like me, who works nearly
every day on Web applications, knows that HTTP exists and what it
does&mdash;and yet, I don't think about it too much. However,
multitenant applications owe their existence to growth in the earliest
days of the Web.
</p><p>
The first version of HTTP that I encountered, back in 1993, was
described as version 0.9. That version was a simpler protocol than
the one we know today, but it already included the basic GET and POST
actions&mdash;that is, you could connect to an HTTP server on port 80, and
say:

<pre     class="programlisting">
GET /
</pre>
</p><p>
The server would, if all went well, send the contents of its home page
(typically formatted with HTML) back to the HTTP client. At that
point, the connection would close.
</p><p>
Although HTTP 0.9 worked well for many simple cases, the explosive growth
of the Web meant that it wasn't good enough for many complex ones. One
particularly common, and particularly painful, case was that of Web
hosting companies: HTTP 0.9 required that each Web site have its own
IP address. If you set up a Linux-based server with a single IP
address but multiple hostnames, it wasn't possible for the HTTP server
to distinguish between them.
</p><p>
This changed when HTTP 1.0 was released and required that a
&ldquo;Host&rdquo;
header be sent along with the action and pathname. Now, a simple
request looked like:

<pre     class="programlisting">
GET / HTTP/1.0
Host: lerner.co.il
</pre>
</p><p>
The first line changed, such that it incorporated the version number
of HTTP that was being used. This was done so as to have backward
compatibility with HTTP 0.9 clients. The second line was defined to be
the first of several &ldquo;request headers&rdquo;, name-value pairs that could be
sent from the client to the server.
</p><p>
These request headers have grown in scope through the years, and now
include everything from the hostname to cookies to content type to
caching information. But for my purposes in this article, the most
important part of this request was the &ldquo;Host&rdquo; request header.
Given
that a server now could distinguish between different hosts, even on
the same IP address, it was possible to have a single server provide
Web hosting capabilities for any number of different domains and
hostnames.
</p><p>
In other words, it was now possible to have the same Web server
provide hosting to CompanyA.com and CompanyB.com, without either
knowing of or seeing each other. The Web server would know to route
requests for CompanyA.com to one directory of programs and HTML files,
and CompanyB.com to a second, completely separate directory of
programs and HTML files.
</p><p>
This might be obvious to anyone who knows about domains, hostnames
and DNS, but from the perspective of the server, it didn't matter if
it had to distinguish CompanyA.com from CompanyB.com, or
abc.CompanyA.com from def.CompanyA.com. That is, different hostnames
within the same domain were treated similarly to different domains.
True, DNS and HTTP server configuration files made it easier to send
*.CompanyA.com to the same location, but at the end of the day, your
HTTP server sees different hostnames and, thus, can react differently.
</p><p>
&ldquo;Virtual hosts&rdquo;, as they became known, shared an IP address and a
computer, and so from the perspective of a programmer or IT manager,
they were all under the same umbrella. From the perspective of the
outside world, these were completely different Web sites. Perhaps
they shared an IP address, and thus a hosting provider, but that was
the only thing they had in common.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdb1580.0xea9e00"></a>
Multitenant</h2></div></div><p>
Today, it's trivial to service different hostnames under the same HTTP
server. As I indicated previously, you simply tell Apache (or nginx, or
whatever HTTP server you use) that the two hosts exist in different
directories, and that they should be treated differently. With such a
configuration in place, there is no connection whatsoever between the
different hostnames. This actually makes it easier to move Web sites
from one machine to another. You scoop up the virtual host's
configuration file and move it to another machine, along with the
programs and static assets&mdash;that is, HTML files and images.
</p><p>
Indeed, a huge industry of cheap, on-demand Web hosting perhaps
has made this the most common way servers are allocated and used.
Even my own personal server has five to ten different virtual hosts on it at
any given time, between personal projects and demos of client
applications.
</p><p>
A multitenant application turns this idea on its head. Rather than
using a single server, with a single IP address, to service a large
number of different applications, each with its own hostname, you will
have many different instances of the same application. That is, you'll have
both CompanyA.com and CompanyB.com point not only to the same IP
address, but also to the same instance of your Web application.
</p><p>
This might sound strange, until you consider that because modern
versions of HTTP always pass a &ldquo;Host&rdquo; header, and because all of the
HTTP request headers are available to a Web application, you can write
a single application that will work on multiple hosts. Consider that
BigCompany.com has two different divisions and a separate Web site
for each division. The site should be completely identical in both
cases, except that the contact phone number and address should reflect
the coast that the user has reached.
</p><p>
You can use the &ldquo;Host&rdquo; request header in an &ldquo;if&rdquo; statement inside 
the application, and thus display the information that is
appropriate. This is a classic example of multitenant sites, although
it's certainly not the most complex of them.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdb1580.0xeaa1c8"></a>
Multitenant with Sinatra</h2></div></div><p>
Let's implement the above scenario using Sinatra, a very small and
lightweight Web application framework written in the Ruby language.
In the July 2014 issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>, I covered a similarly small framework, known as
Flask, written in Python. Such frameworks often are perfect for simple
sites and example code.
</p><p>
There are a number of ways that you can create a Sinatra
application. My preference is to do so in a directory, along with a
Gemfile and a config.ru file. This took less than five minutes for me
to set up on my own computer. First, I created a directory called
&ldquo;multiatf&rdquo;. In that directory, I created a file called
&ldquo;Gemfile&rdquo;,
which is where I will name the Ruby gems I'll be using for this
application:

<pre     class="programlisting">
source 'https://rubygems.org'
gem "sinatra", :require =&gt; "sinatra/base"
gem 'shotgun'
</pre>
</p><p>
The first line says that I want to retrieve gems from Rubygems.org,
the official and standard location. The second line says that I want
to use the &ldquo;sinatra&rdquo; gem, but that I don't want to require
&ldquo;sinatra&rdquo;,
but rather &ldquo;sinatra/base&rdquo;. Finally, I name the
&ldquo;shotgun&rdquo; gem, which
provides for automatic reloading of Sinatra apps&mdash;precisely the sort
of thing I want when I'm developing an application.
</p><p>
Before continuing, I then run <tt  >bundle install</tt>, which ensures that all
of the gems named in the Gemfile have been installed. It creates a
file named &ldquo;Gemfile.lock&rdquo;, which lists the precise names and versions
of each gem I'll be using in my application. This list includes those
gems I have named explicitly and those upon which my named gems
depend. It is worth taking a look at Gemfile.lock sometime; it may
well give you insights into how your Sinatra and Rails applications
work.
</p><p>
Next, I write a &ldquo;config.ru&rdquo; file, sometimes known as a
&ldquo;rackup file&rdquo;,
which tells Rack&mdash;Ruby's standard interface between HTTP servers and
applications&mdash;where my application's code is located and how to
execute it. The file looks like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
require 'bundler'

Bundler.require

require './multiatf.rb'
run Sinatra::Application
</pre>
</p><p>
The first line loads the &ldquo;bundler&rdquo; gem. Bundler is an increasingly
indispensable gem in the Ruby world, in that it manages the versions
of your gems for you, ensuring that they will not require conflicting
versions of a gem. After loading Bundler, you then use the
&ldquo;require&rdquo;
class method, which reviews your Gemfile.lock and loads the gems named
within.
</p><p>
Next, the &ldquo;require&rdquo; statement reads a Ruby file named
&ldquo;multiatf.rb&rdquo; in
the current directory. That is the actual application code, and it's
the file I will be writing and modifying most of all. Loading it
means that Ruby will read the contents of the code. In the case of my
Sinatra app, that means taking the various &ldquo;get&rdquo; and
&ldquo;post&rdquo;
declarations and turning them into the appropriate routing map, such
that the appropriate code block is executed for each URL.
</p><p>
Then, once the application has been loaded, config.ru invokes
<tt  >Sinatra::Application</tt>. That starts the application up and running.
</p><p>
The final step in putting the application together is the multiatf.rb
file. This also consists of very little code, but potentially could be
quite large:

<pre     class="programlisting">
require 'sinatra'

get '/' do
  "Hello from server '#{request.host}'"
end
</pre>
</p><p>
The first line loads the Sinatra code. Next is something that
looks vaguely like a method definition, but isn't. Rather, it tells
Sinatra that if someone makes a request to the / URL, it should return
a string. In this case, the string isn't static, but rather contains a
dynamic portion, including the value of &ldquo;request.host&rdquo;. As you can
imagine, this value will vary according to the hostname you are using.
</p><p>
To start this up on my development machine, I ran:

<pre     class="programlisting">
shotgun multiatf.rb
</pre>
</p><p>
This produces output telling me that Shotgun is now running my
application on port 9393, using Ruby's built-in WEBrick server. I can
now go to my Web browser, and load up
http://localhost:9393,
and because of the <tt  >get /</tt> declaration in my Sinatra file, that method
is fired. I get a nice message telling me:

<pre     class="programlisting">
"Hello from server 'localhost'"
</pre>
</p><p>
But, what if it isn't localhost? What if I go to another server name?
For example, I added the following two lines to my /etc/hosts file:

<pre     class="programlisting">
127.0.0.1 atf1
127.0.0.1 atf2
</pre>
</p><p>
In other words, when I tell my Web browser to go to host
&ldquo;atf1&rdquo;, it'll
go to 127.0.0.1, and it will send, in the &ldquo;Host&rdquo; HTTP request
header, the server name &ldquo;atf1&rdquo;. The output then will be:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Hello from server 'atf1'
</pre>
</p><p>
The same will be true for &ldquo;atf2&rdquo;.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdb1580.0xea1b30"></a>
Showing Different Content</h2></div></div><p>
Thus, you've seen how you can have different output,
based on the value
of the server name. This seemingly simple fact opens the door to the
entire world of multitenant systems. For example, you could imagine a
company doing business under a variety of names, which would want to
have the same Web application running, but showing the current
domain name. All you have to do is change your strings, or your
templates, to reflect the current hostname.
</p><p>
In many cases, showing different hostnames isn't enough. You may want to
show a different business name or a different address. In order for
that to happen, you'll need some additional data. The best and most
scalable way to do this is a relational database, but you can simulate
one with a Ruby hash that will be good enough for the purposes of this
article.
</p><p>
In this case, let's define the hash such that it contains two keys,
one for each of the hosts to recognize. Then, let's pull out the
company's name from the hash, based on the key.
</p><p>
I thus change multiatf.rb to read as follows:

<pre     class="programlisting">
require 'sinatra'

hosts = {'atf1' =&gt; {name: 'First ATF site',
                    address: '111 Main Street'},
         'atf2' =&gt; {name: 'Second ATF site',
                    address: '222 Elm Street'}
        }

get '/' do
  "Welcome to '#{hosts[request.host][:name]}', located at
    &#8618;'#{hosts[request.host][:address]}'!"
end
</pre>
</p><p>
The idea here is simple, but the effects are profound. This is how
each domain can appear different, even if the content is the same. You
can imagine going even further than this, pulling in a different CSS
stylesheet to an HTML page based on the hostname, or having it show
different pictures.
</p><p>
If you are using a relational database, you can enter each new
tenant site in a table, giving each a unique ID number. You then
can use that ID as a foreign key, adding (for example) this
&ldquo;site_id&rdquo;
value in a table describing merchandise. For example, one of my
clients manages about 30 different sites, each with its own set of
real-estate offerings. These 30 sites are actually running on a single
Web application, with a single database. However, based on the
hostname through which the user enters the site, the software displays
a different set of properties. This has made the site and the software
easy to manage, scale and grow. Each time a new site needs to be
added, the biggest task is to update the SSL certificate, such that it
includes the new hostname. Otherwise, the system works automatically,
with the (nontechnical) company managers able to create new sites
within several minutes, merely by filling out an HTML form. That form
allows them to add a new entry into the &ldquo;sites&rdquo; table. The hostname is
used to look up the site ID, whose value is then used to display
properties.
</p><p>
Next month, I'll continue with this topic, discussing not only how you
can have the same site produce similar content, but how you can
configure it such that different users can manage their own sites,
without interfering with the overall software and functionality.
