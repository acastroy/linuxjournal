Who needs arrow keys when you have a perfectly good home row?
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcfc580.0xdf43b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The first time I used vi was in a college programming course. It was the
default editor on the computer lab's UNIX systems we used to compile our
assignments. I remember when our professor first introduced vi and
explained that you used the hjkl keys to move your cursor around instead of
the arrow keys. Before this point, I was a pico user (that dates me a bit
now), and it seemed so backward to me that vi used hjkl instead. 
</p><p>
It wasn't
until I became a heavy vim user that I began to appreciate the speed you
gain from navigation keys appearing on home row. As a touch typist, I
realized the arrow keys are in a no-man's land outside the home row
compared to hjkl, and even though vim supported arrow keys, I used hjkl
instead. I've been pleased to discover a number of different programs that
also support the same level of key bindings. 
</p><p>
I've written a few other
columns in <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> through the years along those lines (all with Dr
Hjkl in the title), and here, I've decided to revive Dr Hjkl for
another round of time-saving command-line navigation tips that will help keep
your hands on the home row and off those arrow keys.
</p><p>
Most of my tips in this article are about reducing your reliance on the
arrow keys and increasing your speed when on the command line. For many
years, whenever I would find a mistake in a command I typed, I would do one
of two things: use a combination of Home, End and the arrow keys (all way
too far away from home row) to move the cursor back to the mistake so I
could fix it, or sometimes I found it was faster to press Ctrl-C and type the
whole command again. One day I observed another Linux user fly back and
forth across words on the command line and realized there was a better way.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcfc580.0xdf46c8"></a>
Moving Between Words</h2></div></div><p>
The first simple speed improvement is the use of Alt-b and Alt-f to move
backward or forward one word on the command line. This behaves somewhat
like the b and w keys in vi to skip between words instead of one letter at
a time. Alt-b acts like just like b in vim. Press Alt-b, and the cursor will
move back one word and sit at the first letter of the previous word. Alt-f
is slightly different; the cursor moves forward until it ends up at the
space between words instead of at the beginning of the following word. So
given the following command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ls -l /var/log
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcfc580.0xdf4880"></a></h2></div></div><p>
If my cursor were at the end of the line and I pressed Alt-b, it now would be
over the l in log. If I pressed it again, it would move to the v in var. If my
cursor were at the beginning of the line and I pressed Alt-f, it would end up
on the space between ls and -l. This annoys me enough that often I'll find
myself going forward <span   class="emphasis"><em>an extra</em></span> word and then pressing Alt-b so
the cursor is where I want it. Even though it's more keystrokes than the
right-arrow key, it keeps my hands on the home row. Alternatively (as you'll
see later), I simply could press Ctrl-f to move forward an extra letter instead.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcfc580.0xdf49e0"></a>
Delete Words</h2></div></div><p>
The bulk of the time that I use Alt-b and Alt-f on the command line is to
correct a typo earlier in the line. Now, you certainly could move the cursor
over to the right position and then use Delete or Backspace to erase the
error, but for minor mistakes, I've found it's much faster to delete the
whole word and retype it. In vim, I would type cw to change the word under
my cursor, or a slightly slower approach is to type dw to delete the word
and then enter insert mode to make my changes. On the command line, you
can replicate the behavior of dw with Alt-d. The Alt-d key will 
remove the word under the cursor completely so you can retype it. So,
taking the
same example from above:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ls -l /var/log
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcfc580.0xdf4b98"></a></h2></div></div><p>
If my cursor were at the end of the line and I realized I wanted to change
<tt  >-l</tt> to <tt  >-ltr</tt>, I would press Alt-b three times to move it over the l in -l, then
I would press Alt-d to delete the l, and finally type ltr.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcfc580.0xdf4d50"></a>
Replace Home and End</h2></div></div><p>
It turns out the arrow keys aren't the only ones on the hit list. Home and
End, although useful, also are out in that no-man's land away from the home
row.
In vi, you would just use ^ or $ to go to the beginning or end of the line.
On the command line, you can replace Home and End with Ctrl-a and Ctrl-e,
respectively. If you use screen or tmux with screen key bindings, you know
that Ctrl-a already is called for, so you'll need to press Ctrl-a a to send
that Ctrl-a through to the command line. Ctrl-a can be particularly useful
when you realize you need to pipe some initial command through something
you've already typed, and Ctrl-e is useful to move back to the end of the
line afterward to finish your command after editing it somewhere in the
middle.

A Few Final Shortcuts</h2></div></div><p>
Although the above shortcuts are enough to get started, before I finish, I
want to highlight a few extra shortcuts that are less useful but worth
knowing all the same. First, although Alt-b and Alt-f move backward and
forward a word, respectively, their counterparts Ctrl-b and Ctrl-f will
move backward and forward a single letter. Somewhat less useful, but still
interesting, is the fact that you can use Alt-u to uppercase the full word
under the cursor, Alt-l to lowercase the word, and Alt-c to capitalize the
first letter in the word.
</p><p>
With all of these tips, I recommend posting a reminder to yourself
somewhere on your computer. It may take a few weeks to ingrain a new habit
like this into your command-line use, but once you get used to it, you won't
go back. I've found that these shortcuts also apply in command-line
clients like Irssi, so if I notice I have a typo in something I'm about to
say in IRC, I can just press Alt-b until it's under the cursor, and press Alt-d to
delete it, and then correct the error and press Enter.
