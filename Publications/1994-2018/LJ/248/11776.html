Opengear's CM7100 Console Server</h2></div></div><p>
Enterprises need solutions that help them leverage their existing equipment
and tools securely and efficiently, asserts Opengear, provider of critical
infrastructure management solutions. This should occur, Opengear adds, without
myriad logins and security procedures when accessing multiple devices. This
philosophy underpins Opengear's new CM7100 Console Server, a
state-of-the-art appliance that offers dramatically simplified console
management, high reliability and strong security for maximizing the uptime
of enterprise networks. The CM7100 is a 16&ndash;48 port serial console server
that enables network administrators to manage
sprawling and complex infrastructure of switches, routers, PDUs, firewalls,
servers, UPSes and other critical data-center equipment from a wide array of
vendors securely and efficiently. Other key product features include enterprise-grade security with
FIPS 140-2 certified SSL, SSH and VPN; dual LAN ports for main and
secondary networks; and audit/trail logging to 4GB local storage or a
remote log server.

The Icinga Project's Icinga Exchange</h2></div></div><p>
The new Icinga Exchange is a central repository for plugins, files,
programs and add-ons that extend Icinga and compatible projects like
Nagios, Shinken or Naemon. The repository allows users to search,
store and rate Icinga-compatible extensions easily and connect with the people
behind them. The project's Solr-based search engine and navigation tags
ensure that searches are quick and easy. Users can choose from manual
upload or an automated GitHub sync, the latter &ldquo;taking the fuss out of
maintaining a second project site&rdquo;, notes the Icinga Project. Currently
more than 500 projects are available on Icinga Exchange, many of which migrated
to the new repository with the previously established Monitoring Exchange
repository. The Icinga Project also emphasizes its openness to plugins and
add-ons that are compatible with related monitoring tools.

Untangle NG Firewall</h2></div></div><p>
The network software and appliance specialist, Untangle, Inc., recently
announced a faster, more agile version 11 of its Untangle NG Firewall
software. Untangle claims that its NG Firewall product brings a combination
of enterprise-grade capabilities and consumer-oriented simplicity to the
management of every aspect of network control. Most notably, version 11 of
the solution adds performance gains to the Virus Blocker to address the
ever-present and growing threats of malware and to the Spam Blocker to
keep unwanted e-mail at bay. In addition, besides an updated kernel,
Untangle further added new technologies from the company's IC Control
product, improving both HTTPS processing and Captive Portal.

SSH Communications' Secure Shell HealthCheck</h2></div></div><p>
Since news of the Shellshock Bash vulnerability broke, revelations about
the impact of the bug have grown, including reports of lost or stolen
Secure Shell (SSH) keys being used to access sensitive
information covertly. In reaction to Shellshock, SSH Communications Security
announced the release of Secure Shell HealthCheck, a solution for
discovering major risk and compliance violations related to all aspects of
SSH in data-center environments. SSH HealthCheck helps to reduce the risk
of failed audits and cyber-security breaches from hackers or malicious
insiders. SSH Communications Security, whose chief innovation officer is
SSH inventor Tatu Yl&ouml;nen, recommends properly scanning and managing SSH
keys, including comparing and auditing them against approved keys. The
company claims that only its tools can achieve this.

iTrinegy's NE-ONE</h2></div></div><p>
The NE-ONE solution was developed by iTrinegy to confront the demands that
come from users' accessing applications across myriad devices and mixed
networks. NE-ONE enables businesses to understand, predict and manage the
performance of applications across today's diverse networks, keeping
the performance of networks and applications at their best. iTrinegy says
that with NE-ONE, it has eliminated the complexity of dealing with the
ecosystem of public, private, cloud, mobile and virtual networks. NE-ONE
also offers a modular design, so customers use just the solutions they
need, when they need them. NE-ONE comes in two variants: Edge is
the ready-to-go hardware-based solution, and Flex is the agile
virtual appliance-based solution that can be deployed quickly wherever
it's needed on to a network.

John Baichtal's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Robot Builder</em></span> (Que)</h2></div></div><p>
The topic of DIY robots is so us, fellow Linuxers. Publishing house Que
says that author John Baichtal's new book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Robot Builder: The
Beginner's
Guide to Building Robots</em></span> will help readers learn the craft of robot
building from the ground up in an easy, fun and hands-on way. As the subtitle
implies, absolutely no experience is needed. Baichtal has been a veteran
author in the DIY [insert geek toy] space for many years and has helped
many an intrigued-by-robot geek get started with robotics. Baichtal and
Que have brought together a wealth of practical robotics know-how into
&ldquo;one incredibly easy tutorial&rdquo;. Hundreds of full-color photos guide
readers through every step and skill and get them building the first
working robot (of 30 total) in the very first chapter. Throughout the book,
skill building grows to expert level, and readers will find themselves
powering motors, configuring sensors, constructing a chassis and even
programming low-cost Arduino microcontrollers.

Eltechs ExaGear Desktop</h2></div></div><p>
Eltechs hopes to lure ARM-based mini-PC users to try its ExaGear Desktop,
which the company says can run virtual Intel x86 apps 4.5 times faster than
competitor QEMU. Eltechs ExaGear Desktop is a virtual machine that
implements a virtual x86 Linux container on ARM-based mini PCs, enabling
the direct and simultaneous running of both x86 Linux and native
applications. In addition, MS Windows applications can be run via the Wine
emulator. The current version does not support applications that require
kernel modules nor does it support 3-D hardware.
