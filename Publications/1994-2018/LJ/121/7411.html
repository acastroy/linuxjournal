Back in November 2002, Nick Moffitt wrote a brief tutorial
titled &ldquo;Busting Spam with Bogofilter, Procmail and Mutt&rdquo; (<a href="../000/6439.html" target="_self">/article/6439</a>) for the <i  >Linux Journal</i> Web site. He provided a Bogofilter configuration that
made it easy to mark incoming messages as spam or non-spam. Nick's
article still receives a number of hits as people continue
to look for ways to manage their mailboxes. The problem, however,
is command-line switches to Bogofilter have been reversed as of
March 2003, &ldquo;so they now have the exact opposite effect&rdquo;. In
other words, follow the original article and you'll be training your
spam filter to keep the spam and ditch the legit mail.
To
save readers some frustration, Nick wrote a follow-up article for our
Web site, &ldquo;Busting Spam with Bogofilter, Procmail and Mutt,
Revisited&rdquo;
(<a href="../000/7436.html" target="_self">/article/7436</a>). If you used
Nick's first implementation or are looking for another spam-fighting
tool, be sure to read his update.

If you're in charge of a network whose servers use asymmetric TCP/IP
routing, you may have noticed artificial bandwidth bottlenecks as all
traffic goes out one interface, leaving the other idle.
In &ldquo;Overcoming Asymmetric
Routing on Multi-Homed Servers&rdquo; (<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/7291" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/7291</a>), Patrick McManus
explains how to use source-based routing capabilities, similar to the
ones used in high-end networking gear, to improve traffic flow in server
environments. Specifically, he discusses the iproute2 package, which can
be used to control routing behavior as well as to &ldquo;set up interfaces,
control arp behavior, do NAT and establish tunnels&rdquo;. As Patrick states,
&ldquo;the key difference in an iproute2 world is the system may contain many
different destination-based routing tables instead of a single global
system table.&rdquo;

When William Yu and Dominique Cimafranca were given the green light to
install Linux on the desktops of a pilot group at their company, they
were told the work had to be completed in half a day. Plus, if the pilot
group didn't like the Linux desktops, their Windows desktops needed to
be reinstated just as quickly. Given the age of the machines they were
working with, plus memory limitations and the presence of a decent
Ethernet infrastructure, they decided thin clients would be the best
approach. Their article, &ldquo;Desktop Guerilla Tactics: a Portable Thin
Client Approach&rdquo; (<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/7109" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/7109</a>), details their experience
with using the VNC remote display system, assembling a floppy-based
distribution and setting up a fat server. Read their article on-line to
see how the pilot group reacted to the new desktop.

As more and more people make the move to Linux, whether it be at work or
at home, interest in end-user applications grows. In response, the
<i  >Linux Journal</i> Web site has acquired some new
columnists, including Dave Phillips, Chris DiBona and Bruce Byfield, who
will write regularly on such topics as Linux audio, tasks for new Linux
users and OpenOffice.org. Dave's Linux audio series already has a
few columns posted providing introductions to AGNULA and Planet
CCRMA. His March column, &ldquo;At the Sounding Edge: OpenMusic and
SuperCollider3&rdquo; (<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/7432" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/7432</a>), discusses two new Mac
audio application ports to Linux.
