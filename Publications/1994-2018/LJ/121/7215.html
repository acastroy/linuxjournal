Aap is a flexible tool that can do what <b  >make</b> does and much more. Learn
how to write portable recipes for maintaining your Web sites and building
programs.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e24580.0x1f1c2f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Many people use a Makefile and shell scripts to automate tasks where
a change to a file requires an action to be taken. You edit a file
and then invoke <tt  >make</tt> in the hope that all actions necessary
to effect the changes are done. Often you need to tweak the
Makefile to get it right and end up using <tt  >touch</tt> to work around
a missing dependency. As a result, when other people look at your carefully
tuned Makefile, they have a hard time understanding how it works.
</p><p>
These tasks can be done more easily and reliably with Aap than with make.
For example, Aap has built-in Internet support. Downloading and
uploading is taken care of without the need to specify the commands
or to keep timestamp files. Reliability is achieved by figuring
out dependencies automatically and using signatures instead of
timestamps. With Aap it is simpler to
specify the work you want done, and you make fewer mistakes. You still
can fall back on using shell commands where you want them.
This article presents two examples of Aap in action, maintaining a
Web site and building a program. Aap can do much more, of course,
but these subjects should be sufficient to get you started.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e24580.0x1f1c500"></a>
Installing Aap</h2></div></div><p>
To use Aap you need Python version 1.5 or later. In the
unlikely event that you do not have Python on your system, download it from
Python.org, or install it from your Linux distribution CD
or update system.
</p><p>
Installing Aap can be done in four simple steps. Start by downloading
the latest Aap zip archive (see the on-line Resources section).
Then, unpack the archive in a temporary directory (<tt  >unzip
aap-1.053.zip</tt>).
If you are root, run <tt  >./aap install</tt>. If
you are a normal user, install
the archive in your home directory with <tt  >./aap install PREFIX=$HOME</tt>.
For more information about downloading and installing Aap, see
Resources. Aap is distributed as
open-source
software under the GNU GPL.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e24580.0x1f1c768"></a>
Maintaining a Web Site</h2></div></div><p>
With the current Aap software in place, let's look at using it in a basic
example task. You have designed a simple Web site with
HTML files and images. The files are on your local computer, and you need to
upload them to the Web server. Listing 1 shows the Aap script, called a
recipe, that does this.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e24580.0x1f1c870"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Listing 1. Recipe for Uploading Files to a Web Server</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">
# The list of files to be uploaded.
Files = index.html
        info.html
        download.html
        images/*.png

# The publish attribute tells where to upload to.
:attr {publish = scp://my.server.net/html/%file%}
        $Files

# When executed without a target: publish the files.
all : publish
</pre></div><p>
Store the recipe under the name main.aap. This file is what Makefile is
to <b  >make</b>&mdash;the default file to be executed. Running
<tt  >aap</tt> without
arguments executes the main.aap recipe in the current directory.
</p><p>
Comments in an Aap recipe start with # and continue until the end of the
line, as in a Makefile or shell script.
The first effective line in the recipe is an assignment; the
list of files to be uploaded is assigned to the Files variable.
There are no back slashes nor punctuation to
mark the end of the assignment. Aap recognizes command continuation
by the amount of indentation used. This may appear strange at first, but you
quickly get used to it. This method avoids the usual mistakes with
punctuation and enforces a layout that is easy to read. Aap allows
you to use either tabs or spaces to indent lines.
</p><p>
The :attr line is an Aap command. All Aap commands start with a
colon to make them easy to recognize. This command adds the
publish attribute to its arguments. The publish attribute
tells Aap where to upload the files when they are published.
The method used here is scp://, secure copy. Other supported
methods are rsync:// and ftp://.
The last argument of :attr is $Files, the value of the Files variable.
The attribute is attached to each item in $Files.
</p><p>
When you run Aap without an argument, it updates the
target all. The final line specifies that the default target all
depends on publish. This is a special target, which tells Aap to
upload all items that have a publish attribute.
</p><p>
You now can edit the HTML files, add pictures and view them locally.
Once you are satisfied, execute <tt  >aap</tt>. Aap figures out which
files have changed and uploads them. Signatures (checksums) are
used; thus, if you restore an old version of a file it still
works properly. If you were using make, you would have to touch the
restored file to update its timestamp.
</p><p>
If you want to try this example, but you don't have a server to
upload to, you can use the publish attribute
<tt  >file:/tmp/html/%file%</tt>.
With it, Aap creates the /tmp/html directory, if necessary.
</p><p>
A word of warning: Aap does not delete
files on the server no longer in use. Then again, neither does make.
You have to delete these files manually. Hopefully,
automatic deletion will be added to Aap soon.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e24580.0x1f1ce48"></a>
Listing the Image Files</h2></div></div><p>
A wild card was used to select the images:
<tt  >images/*.png</tt>. This is convenient,
but it has the danger of including images you do not want uploaded.
Explicitly naming each file avoids this trap, but then you might forget an image.
Being that this is a common issue, Aap provides a function to extract the image
filenames from the HTML files. Listing 2 shows how this is done; the Python
function get_html_images is invoked, and the back ticks enclose a Python
expression. Aap evaluates the expression and puts the result, the image
filenames, in its place.
The get_html_images() function has limited capabilities, however. It
works only for plain
HTML files with images that have a relative pathname.

Generating HTML Files</h2></div></div><p>
Most HTML files consist of a header, title, main contents and footer.
Obviously, you don't want to type the common parts each time. A simple
solution is to concatenate a number of files. Listing 3 shows the recipe that
implements this. Five parts are used: header, title, middle, contents and
footer. The title and contents are different for each page, but the other three
parts are the same.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e24580.0x1f1d2c0"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Listing 3. Generating an HTML File from Five Parts</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">
Files = index.html
        info.html
        download.html

:rule %.html : header.part
               %_title.part
               middle.part
               %.part
               footer.part
    :cat $source &gt;! $target

:update $Files
Files += `get_html_images(Files)`

:attr {publish = scp://my.server.net/html/%file%}
        $Files

all : publish
</pre></div><p>
The main difference between Listing 2 and Listing 3 is the added :rule
command in Listing 3. It
specifies that a target (the HTML file) depends on five source files (the
parts) and lists the command to build the target from the sources. The %
character is used instead of the name of the file, similar to a * wild card. All %
characters in the rule stand for the same name. Thus, for index.html the %
stands for index. The sources then include index_title.part and
index.part.
</p><p>
Below the :rule line comes the indented block of statements that are executed when
the target of the rule needs to be updated. So, the recipe has two levels:
the commands at the top level are executed when reading the recipe, and the
command block of the rule is executed later, when needed.
</p><p>
The :cat command concatenates files, the same as the UNIX cat command. It
actually can do much more, such as read files from a specified URL. In a
rule, $source stands for the whole list of source files.
</p><p>
The HTML files need to be generated before obtaining the list of image files
they contain. To get this right, the :update command is invoked
before calling get_html_images(). The HTML files are updated using
the defined rule. This is at the top level of the recipe, so it always
is done when Aap reads the recipe.
</p><p>
Now that you have so many files, how does Aap keep track of what needs to be
done? Aap works with dependencies, the same as make does. It starts with the
target you specify on the command line. When no target is given, all is assumed.
Aap then locates those dependencies and rules in which this
target appears before the colon. The colon basically means depends on;
after the colon are the source files on which the target depends. Each
of these source files then is inspected, and Aap finds rules where they appear
as a target. This continues recursively until no more rules are found. The
result is a tree of dependencies. Aap then executes commands for those
dependencies that need to be built, starting at the end of the tree (depth
first). This sounds complicated, doesn't it? Because Aap takes care of this,
you only need to make sure you specify the sources on which each target depends.
Aap figures out what needs to be done.

Adding a Timestamp</h2></div></div><p>
As a nice addition, let's add a timestamp to the HTML file, so you can
see on the Web site when the page was last generated. Put the string
@TIMESTAMP@ somewhere in the file footer.part. Listing 4 shows the rule
in which this string is replaced with the current date. The rest of the
recipe is as shown in Listing 3. The :eval command evaluates a Python
expression, and string.replace is a standard Python function for replacing
one string with another. This way, you can use any Python expression to filter
text. The HTML page is piped through the :eval command, as with a shell.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e24580.0x1f1d790"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Listing 4. Rule for Putting a Timestamp in a Generated HTML File</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">
:rule %.html : header.part
               %_title.part
               middle.part
               %.part
               footer.part
   :print Generating $-target
   :cat $source
       | :eval string.replace(stdin,
                         '@TIMESTAMP@', _no.DATESTR)
       &gt;! $target
</pre></div><p>
The first time the new rule is used, all HTML files are updated.
That is because Aap remembers a signature for the commands. Thus, you don't
need to worry about forcefully generating the files after changing the
commands in the recipe.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e24580.0x1f1d9f8"></a>
Uploading with rsync</h2></div></div><p>
When making small changes to a Web page, it is a waste of bandwidth to upload
the whole file each time. A good way to upload efficiently is to use
rsync. It uploads only those parts of a file that have been changed. Aap
uses rsync when it finds rsync:// in the publish attribute. By default,
rsync is used over an SSH connection. You can change this by
setting the $RSYNC variable.
</p><p>
rsync is not a standard command. If it does not exist on the system, you
encounter a nice feature of Aap&mdash;you are offered the choice to install
rsync:

<pre     class="programlisting">
% aap
Aap: Uploading ['index.html'] to
               rsync://my.server.net/html/index.html
Cannot find package "rsync"!
1. Let Aap attempt installing the package
2. Retry (install it yourself first)
q. Quit
Choice:
</pre>
</p><p>
Aap has a mechanism to install a package when it is needed by downloading a recipe from the Aap Web site that
specifies how the package is to be installed. The downloading
features of Aap come in handy here. How the package is installed
depends on your system; not all systems are supported yet.
After rsync has been installed, Aap starts uploading the files.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e24580.0x1f1dc08"></a>
Building a Program</h2></div></div><p>
Aap includes support for building a program from C and C++ code. Here is the
one-line recipe that builds the program called myprog from four C source files:

<pre     class="programlisting">
:program myprog : main.c common.c various.c args.c
</pre>
</p><p>
Despite the simplicity of the recipe, Aap takes care of several issues:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Dependencies are figured out automatically. You don't need to specify the
included header files or do a <tt  >make depend</tt>.
</p></li><li><p>
This recipe works on most systems without modification. Aap finds a
compiler and linker to use and figures out the arguments they need.
</p></li><li><p>
The object files are stored in a separate build directory for each system.
You can build several versions without cleaning up.
</p></li><li><p>
Aap creates a log file, AAPDIR/log, that contains details about what happened. If
your build fails and the output scrolls off the screen, you don't need to
repeat the build command with the output redirected.
</p></li><li><p>
A few default targets are added automatically: <tt  >aap
install</tt> installs the
program, and <tt  >aap clean</tt> deletes generated files.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
It would be possible to do the same work with make, with the help of a few
extra tools. But the Makefile would be much longer and not portable; it
also would require
more effort to maintain.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e24580.0x2316538"></a>
Building Variants</h2></div></div><p>
Now let's build a program in two variants, a release and a debug version.
Aap includes support for variants. All you need to do is specify what
variants you want to build and what is different between them. Listing 5
shows the recipe.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e24580.0x2316640"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Listing 5. Building Release and Debug Variants</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">
:variant Build
   release
      OPTIMIZE = 4
      Target = myprog
   debug
      DEBUG = yes
      Target = myprogd

:program $Target : main.c common.c various.c args.c
</pre></div><p>
The first line of the :variant command specifies the variable name used to
select the variant to be built. You can set this variable on the command
line; <tt  >aap Build=debug</tt> builds the debug version.
Without an argument, the
release variant is built, because it is mentioned first.
</p><p>
The amount of indentation identifies the other parts of the :variant command.
The possible values have less indentation; the commands used for each
value have a bit more. You are forced to align the parts, which makes them easier to
read.
</p><p>
The release variant sets the OPTIMIZE variable. This is a number in the
range of zero to nine that indicates the amount of optimizing to be done. It
automatically is turned into the right argument for the compiler being used.
The debug variant sets DEBUG to yes. The default value is no. The
Target variable holds the name of the resulting program. The two variants
use a different name, so both programs can exist.
</p><p>
A nice advantage of using variants this way is
that object files for each
variant are stored automatically in a separate build directory. When
switching between the two variants you should notice that Aap does not rebuild
all the files.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e24580.0x2316a60"></a>
Building with Another Language</h2></div></div><p>
For languages other than C and C++ you need to import a language module. A
few standard modules are included with Aap. For example, this is how to
build from D sources; D is a new programming language:

<pre     class="programlisting">
:import d
:program myprog : main.d common.d various.d args.d
</pre>
</p><p>
The :import d command is used to load the support for the D language.
Otherwise this process is similar to building from C sources.
</p><p>
You can write a module yourself to add support for a language. Because Aap is
open source, you are encouraged to submit the module to be included in the Aap
distribution. Until that happens, drop the file in the Aap modules directory;
this works as a plugin.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e24580.0x2316c70"></a>
Building a KDE Application</h2></div></div><p>
Building a KDE application involves working with a lot of tools, including using Qt Designer to
create dialogs, generating header files from user-interface descriptions and
generating interprocess communication code. Nevertheless, a recipe for
building a KDE application can be as simple as this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
:import kde
:program logger : main.cpp
                  logwidget.ui
                  dcop.h {filetype = skel}
                         {var_OBJSUF = _skel.o}
</pre>
</p><p>
Of the three input files, main.cpp can be compiled directly. The Qt Designer
file logwidget.ui first needs to be processed by uic to generate an
include file; then moc must be used. Aap recognizes the .ui
suffix and takes care of all of this. Handling this kind of multistep
compilation, from ui to h to moc to object file, is a useful feature in Aap.
Doing the same thing in a Makefile requires far more explicit rules.
</p><p>
The dcop.h file contains special KDE items but has a normal suffix. It
cannot be recognized automatically. Therefore the filetype attribute is
specified explicitly. The :program command also needs to know the name of
the object file, which is specified with the var_OBJSUF attribute.
You do not need to specify explicitly the KDE tools being used; the complexity
is hidden in the KDE module. This is considerably less complex than using
automake.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e24580.0x2316e80"></a>
Using Aap as a Better make</h2></div></div><p>
So far, you have used high-level Aap commands to specify quickly what needs to
be done. For nonstandard tasks, you need to spell out the dependencies and
commands. This mostly works like a Makefile. Besides shell commands, you can
use portable Aap commands. If that is not enough, you can add a Python
script.
</p><p>
Listing 6 shows what a low-level recipe looks like. Every
dependency is given explicitly here&mdash;all depends on hello, hello is
compiled from hello.c and hello.c is generated from scratch.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e24580.0x2316fe0"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Listing 6. Using Aap as a make Replacement</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">

all : hello

# Manually compile the hello program.
hello : hello.c
   :sys cc -o $target $source

# Clumsy way to generate a C program.
hello.c:
   :print Generating $target
   :print &gt;! $target $(#)include $(&lt;)stdio.h$(&gt;)
   :print &gt;&gt; $target main() {
   :print &gt;&gt; $target    printf("Hello World!\n");
   :print &gt;&gt; $target    return 0;
   :print &gt;&gt; $target }

</pre></div><p>
Because the build commands in a recipe are Aap commands, you need to use :sys
to execute a shell (system) command. In the example, <tt  >:sys
cc</tt> executes the C
compiler. Obviously, this works only on systems with the cc command.
Using shell commands reduces the portability of a recipe.
</p><p>
The hello.c file is generated with :print commands. The first line uses
<tt  >&gt;! $target</tt> to overwrite an existing hello.c file. Without the exclamation
mark, you receive an error message if the file already exists. This line
also
contains $(#), which escapes the special meaning of the # character to start a
comment. Likewise, $(&lt;) and $(&gt;) are used to get &lt; and &gt; characters instead
of redirection.
</p><p>
The hello.c file is generated when it doesn't already exist; no source file
dependency is specified. The file can be generated in another situation as
well&mdash;if
you change one of the :print commands, because it changes the
signature of the build commands. When the build commands change, Aap knows
that the target must be rebuilt.
</p><p>
The file is generated with Aap commands; no shell commands need to be used.
This part of the recipe therefore can work on any system. But the number of Aap commands is
limited. When you need more functionality and also require portability, you
can use Python scripting.
</p><p>
All flow control in Aap recipes is done with Python, and
Listing 7 illustrates an
example of a recipe that applies patches to Vim. A loop is used to generate a
list of patch filenames, starting with vim-6.2.001 and counting up to the
last patch number, specified with LASTPATCH. Each of the patch files is to
be downloaded and applied. The $* in done/$*Patches is used for
rc-style variable expansion; done/ is prepended to every item in Patches.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e24580.0x2317458"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>

Normally, you don't need to use much Python in your recipe, but it is good to
know that complicated tasks are possible to accomplish when they arise.

Installing Packages</h2></div></div><p>
We already mentioned that Aap can install rsync for you if it
cannot be found on your system. The package install mechanism also can be
invoked directly. For example, to install Agide use the command
<tt  >aap --install agide</tt>.
Agide is the A-A-P GUI IDE, another part of the A-A-P Project.
You can use it to build and debug programs with Vim and gdb. It still is
in an early stage of development, but it is good enough to
develop and debug C programs.
</p><p>
Several packages currently are available, and more will
be added over time. A list of the current packages can be found on
<a href="http://www.a-a-p.org/packages.html" target="_self">www.a-a-p.org/packages.html</a>.
Aap itself also can be installed. Updating to the latest version
can be done with
<tt  >aap --install aap</tt>.
This command overwrites any existing Aap version. If your system has a
package manager, you probably should use that instead.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
You now have an idea of the tasks that you can automate with Aap. When you
start experimenting you can find a lot of help in the comprehensive
documentation. You can find it on the Aap Web site in several forms (see
Resources). These pages explain many things that could not be included in this article,
such as using CVS for version control, automatic configuration and so on.
