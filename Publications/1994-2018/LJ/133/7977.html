If you are neither an artist nor an animator but have
an interest in trying 3-D design and animation
software on your workstation, then Blender 3D is
the application for you. As complex as this type of
application is, Blender 3D is quite approachable due
to the extraordinary support, including documentation,
tutorials and demonstrations, produced by the Blender
3D community.
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>The Official Blender 2.3 Guide</em></span> is a published
compilation of on-line
resources produced by the Blender 3D community. As would be expected from
an official guide, the contents are authoritative. This book also is
comprehensive, targeting the full range of Blender 3D users&mdash;this is not
a simple command reference.
</p><p>
My only issue with the book's text is the English in some passages is
grammatically incorrect to the point that the reader's progress is
disrupted, forcing a re-read of a sentence or two. This is
to be expected, given that many of the authors do not speak English as a
first language and the Blender Documentation Board decided to grant each
author stylistic latitude. These occasional lapses are forgiven, though,
because the overall quality of the book is so high.
</p><p>
Due to the many supporting images provided throughout the book, readers can
learn how to use Blender 3D without a workstation as easily as with one.
In fact, I would not hesitate to recommend teaching directly from
this text.
</p><p>
Different types of users are going to approach this book from various
perspectives. A novice, for example, should start at the beginning and work methodically
through the text in order to learn general design concepts and terminology
while also learning Blender 3D. An artist already skilled with another
3-D application should start at the beginning as well, if only to cover the Blender 3D
interface. However, an experienced Blender 3D artist probably could use
the book for its reference sections, to explore little-used techniques and parts of the program.
</p><p>
Because it is a cross-platform application, the authors present important
information about running Blender 3D on each platform, including sections
about installation and supported graphics cards.
</p><p>
The book comes with a CD that contains Blender 3D 2.32 source code, binaries
for several platforms, documentation and representative example work.
The book also offers a glossary, but in my opinion, it does not rise to the
level of rest of the book. Overall, I highly recommend this book to anybody
interested in learning about 3-D design and animation.
