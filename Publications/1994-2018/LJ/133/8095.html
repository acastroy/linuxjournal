The new generation of security for wireless networks
doesn't simply fix WEP's flaws&mdash;it enables you to use your
RADIUS server to authenticate wireless users.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1346580.0x143e3a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Last month, I described the new wireless LAN security protocol, Wi-Fi
Protected Access (WPA). I showed how it adds strong and flexible
authentication, plus dynamic encryption-key negotiation, to the
otherwise-insecure WEP protocol. I also showed how WPA's component
protocols, including 802.1x, the various flavors of EAP and RADIUS,
interrelate. In this month's column I start to show how to create your own
authentication server for WPA and other 802.1x scenarios, using FreeRADIUS
and OpenSSL.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1346580.0x143e4a8"></a>
Quick Review</h2></div></div><p>
WPA, you may recall, is more modular than WEP. Whereas
authentication and encryption in WEP both are
achieved through a shared secret used by all
wireless clients, authentication in WPA normally is
achieved by using the 802.1x protocol. The pre-shared key (PSK)
mode, which works more like WEP, also is an option. With WPA,
unique encryption keys for each client are generated dynamically and
refreshed periodically by the access point.
</p><p>
802.1x is a flexible authentication protocol that depends on
the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP). Many different flavors of
EAP, including EAP-TLS and PEAP, are supported in WPA-enabled products. If you
choose to skip 802.1x and deploy WPA in the much simpler PSK mode, which
gives you dynamic encryption key generation but exposes authentication credentials
by transmitting them in clear text, all you need to do is configure
your access point and wireless clients with the same pre-shared key.
</p><p>
If, however, you want to use WPA to its full potential by employing
the much-stronger authentication mechanisms in 802.1x, you need
a RADIUS server. Commercial tools are available for this work, such
as Funk Software's Steel Belted RADIUS. But if you prefer a free and
open-source RADIUS application, FreeRADIUS supports all major flavors of
EAP and is both stable and secure. Here's how you can put it to work.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1346580.0x143e660"></a>
Our Usage Scenario</h2></div></div><p>
Naturally, I don't have enough space to describe all possible
uses of FreeRADIUS with 802.1x or even specifically with wireless
scenarios. Therefore, let's start with a description of an example usage
scenario that subsequent procedures can implement.
</p><p>
The most important choice to make when implementing WPA is which flavor
of EAP to use. This is limited not only by what your RADIUS server
software supports but also by your client platforms. Your wireless
access point, interestingly, is EAP-agnostic&mdash;assuming it supports
802.1x and/or WPA in the first place. It simply passes EAP traffic
from clients to servers, without requiring explicit support for any
particular EAP subtype.
</p><p>
What your client platform supports is a function both of your client
operating system and of its wireless hardware. For example, a Microsoft Windows
XP system with an Intel Pro/2100 (Centrino) chipset supports EAP-TLS
and PEAP, but EAP-TTLS isn't an option. But if you run Linux with
wpa_supplicant (see the on-line Resources), you have a much wider range of choices
available.
</p><p>
In our example scenario, I cover EAP-TLS. EAP-TLS requires client
certificates, which in turn requires you to set up a certificate authority (CA).
But there are several good reasons to use EAP-TLS. First, EAP-TLS is
supported widely. Second, TLS (X.509 certificate) authentication provides
strong security. Third, it really doesn't require that much work to use OpenSSL
to create your own CA.
</p><p>
Our example scenario, therefore, involves Windows XP clients
using EAP-TLS to connect to a WPA-enabled access point. The access
point, in turn, is configured to authenticate off of a FreeRADIUS
1.0.1 server running Linux.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1346580.0x143e8c8"></a>
Getting and Installing FreeRADIUS</h2></div></div><p>
SuSE 9.2, Fedora Core 3 and Red Hat Enterprise Linux each has its
own FreeRADIUS RPM package, called freeradius. Debian Sarge
(Debian-testing) has a DEB package by the same name. With Red Hat,
Fedora and Debian-testing, additional packages are available if you want to
use a MySQL authentication database. In addition, Debian-testing has a few other
features broken out into still more packages. With all four distributions,
however, the only package you should need for 802.1x authentication is
the base freeradius package. If your favorite Linux distribution doesn't have its own FreeRADIUS
package, or if it does but not a recent enough version to meet your
needs, you can download the latest FreeRADIUS source code from
the Web site (see Resources).
</p><p>
Compiling FreeRADIUS is simple: it's the common <tt  >./configure
&amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install</tt> routine. If you're new to the compiling game, see the source
distribution's INSTALL file for more detailed instructions. You
should execute the <tt  >configure</tt> and
<tt  >make</tt> commands as some nonroot user
and execute only <tt  >make install</tt> as root.
</p><p>
Notice that, by default, the configure script installs FreeRADIUS into
subdirectories of /usr/local. Because the Makefile has no uninstall
action, I recommend leaving this setting unchanged, as it simplifies
removing FreeRADIUS later, should that become necessary.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1346580.0x143ebe0"></a>
Creating a Certificate Authority</h2></div></div><p>
Before we configure FreeRADIUS, we need to create some certificates. And
before we create any certificates, we must create our
CA. My book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Server Security</em></span>
contains a section in Chapter 5 titled &ldquo;How to Become a Small-Time CA&rdquo;, which goes into more
depth than I can go into right now, but here's a crash course nonetheless.
</p><p>
First, what is a CA and where should it reside? A CA is a system that
acts as the root of a public key infrastructure. It's the central
authority that vouches, by way of digital signatures, for the authenticity of
all certificates issued in your organization. It also periodically issues
certificate revocation lists (CRLs), lists of certificates the
CA no longer vouches for, for example, certificates issued to people
who've left the organization, servers that are no longer on-line and so
on.
</p><p>
None of this requires your CA to act as an actual server; in fact, it's
better if it doesn't. For a CA to be trustworthy, it must be protected carefully
from misuse. My own CAs, therefore, tend to reside on systems I
only periodically connect to the network, such as VMware virtual machines.
</p><p>
You already may have a CA that you've used to create certificates for
Web servers, stunnel or other applications that use TLS. If so, you can
use it for WPA too. If not, here's how to create a CA. First, make sure
your designated CA system has OpenSSL installed. OpenSSL
is a standard package on all popular Linux distributions, not to mention
FreeBSD, OpenBSD and the like. One quick way to make sure you have
OpenSSL is to issue the command <tt  >which
openssl</tt>&mdash;this returns the path to your OpenSSL command,
if it's installed.
</p><p>
Next, change your working directory to wherever your system keeps
OpenSSL's configuration and certificate files. On SuSE, this is /etc/ssl,
but this location varies by distribution. Doing a search for the file
openssl.cnf should bring you to the correct place.
</p><p>
Now, open the file openssl.cnf with your text editor of choice. We need to
tweak some default settings so as to make certificate creation speedier
later on. Listing 1 shows the lines in openssl.cnf I like to change.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1346580.0x143efa8"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Listing 1. Changes to openssl.cnf for Optimal Certificate Creation
</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">
# First we change the CA root path in the CA_default
# section to reflect the CA we're about to create

[ CA_default ]
dir             = ./micksCA              # Where everything is kept

# The following lines are further down in openssl.cnf:

countryName_default             = US
stateOrProvinceName_default     = Minnesota
0.organizationName_default      = Industrial Wiremonkeys of the World
</pre></div><p>
Next, we should edit the CA creation script to change our CA's
root directory to something other than demoCA, that is, to match the
dir variable we just changed in openssl.cnf. I use the script CA.sh,
which on SuSE systems is located in /usr/share/ssl/misc but may reside
elsewhere on your system. The line you need to change is
<tt  >CATOP=./micksCA</tt>.
</p><p>
If you changed your working directory to edit this file, change
back to your SSL configuration directory, for example, /etc/ssl. From
there, run the CA.sh script with the -newca option, for example,
<tt  >/usr/share/ssl/misc/CA.sh -newca</tt>. You then are prompted to create a new
root certificate and to type a passphrase for its private key. Choose
a difficult-to-guess passphrase, and write it down in a safe place&mdash;if
you forget it, you'll be unable to use your CA.
</p><p>
After the script is done, your SSL configuration directory should contain
a new directory, micksCA in our example. At the root level of this
directory is your new CA's public certificate; by default this file
is named cacert.pem. As I demonstrate later, you need to
copy this file to your FreeRADIUS server and to each wireless client.
</p><p>
There's one more thing you need to do before creating
certificates if you've got Windows XP wireless clients. Windows XP
expects certain attributes in server and client certificates, so you
need to create a file called xpextensions that contains the
lines shown in Listing 2.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1346580.0x143f370"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>

[ xpserver_ext ]
extendedKeyUsage = 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.1
</pre></div><p>
The xpextensions file is referenced in some of the OpenSSL commands I'm about
to show you. It should reside in the same directory as openssl.cnf.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1346580.0x143f580"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
How EAP-TLS Works</b></p><p>
In EAP-TLS, a wireless client and your RADIUS server mutually
authenticate each other. They present each other with their respective
certificates and cryptographically verify that those certificates were
signed by your organization's certificate authority. In some ways, this
is an elegant and simple way to handle authentication. After you
install the CA's public certificate on the FreeRADIUS server, you don't
need to configure any other client information explicitly, such as user names,
passwords and so on.
</p><p>
That doesn't mean EAP-TLS is less work than user name-password schemes,
however. You still need to use OpenSSL to create certificates for all your users
and copy those certificates over to them. You also need to ensure that
everyone has a copy of the root CA certificate installed in the proper
place.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1346580.0x143f790"></a>
Creating Certificates</h2></div></div><p>
For EAP-TLS, you need at least two certificates besides your CA
certificate, a server certificate for your FreeRADIUS server and one
client certificate for each wireless client on your network. Creating
certificates is a three-step process:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Generate a signing request, that is, an unsigned certificate.
</p></li><li><p>
Sign the signing request with your CA key.
</p></li><li><p>
Copy the signed certificate to the host on which it will be used.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
Let's start by creating a server certificate signing request using OpenSSL's
req command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ openssl req -new -nodes -keyout server_key.pem -out server_req.pem -days 730 -config ./openssl.cnf
</pre>
</p><p>
This command creates the files server_req.pem, which contains the
actual request&mdash;an unsigned certificate&mdash;and server_key.pem, its
passphrase-less private key. First, though, you are prompted for
your organization's Country Code, State and so on, much of which can
use the default values you tweaked in openssl.conf. Pay special
attention, however, to Common Name. When prompted for this,
type the fully qualified domain name of your server, for example,
server.wiremonkeys.org.
</p><p>
Next, let's use our CA key to sign the request by using OpenSSL's ca
command:

<pre     class="programlisting">

$ openssl ca -config ./openssl.cnf \
-policy policy_anything -out server_cert.pem \
-extensions xpserver_ext -extfile ./xpextensions \
-infiles ./server_req.pem

</pre>
</p><p>
This command reads the file server_req.pem and, after prompting
for your CA key's passphrase, saves a signed version of
it plus its corresponding private key to the file server_cert.pem.
Notice the -extensions and -extfile options&mdash;this is why earlier we created
the file xpextensions.
</p><p>
Open your signed certificate with the text editor of your
choice and delete everything before the line <tt  >-----BEGIN
CERTIFICATE-----</tt>. Concatenate it and your key into a single file,
like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">

$ cat server_key.pem server.cert.pem &gt; \
server_keycert.pem

</pre>
</p><p>
Now we've got a server certificate with a key that we can copy over to our
FreeRADIUS server. Its private key isn't password-protected,
however, so be sure to delete any extraneous copies after you've got it
in place.
</p><p>
Now we need to create a client certificate signing request. The
OpenSSL command to do this is similar to that used to create server
certificates:

<pre     class="programlisting">

$ openssl req -new -keyout client_key.pem \
-out client_req.pem -days 730 -config ./openssl.cnf

</pre>
</p><p>
As you can see, we're writing our signing request and key to the files
client_req.pem and client_key, respectively. Unlike with the server
signing requests, however, we're omitting the -nodes option. Therefore,
when you run this command, you are prompted for a passphrase with
which the certificate's private key can be encrypted.
</p><p>
Next we sign the client certificate's signing request:

<pre     class="programlisting">

$ openssl ca -config ./openssl.cnf \
-policy policy_anything -out client_cert.pem \
-extensions xpclient_ext -extfile ./xpextensions \
-infiles ./client_req.pem

</pre>
</p><p>
Again, this is similar to the equivalent command for our server, except
this time the -extensions command references a different entry in xpextensions.
Also, if your clients run Linux, you should delete the
extraneous stuff in the certificate, like you did with server_cert.pem.
You then either can leave the certificate and key files separate or concatenate
them. From there, copy your client certificate file(s) to your Linux
client system.
</p><p>
If your certificate is to be used by a Windows XP client, you have one
more step to take. You need to convert the certificate file(s) to a PKCS12-format file,
with this command:

<pre     class="programlisting">

openssl pkcs12 -export -in client_cert.pem \
-inkey client_key.pem -out client_cert.p12 -clcerts

</pre>
</p><p>
You are prompted for client_key.pem's passphrase and then for a new passphrase
for the new file; you can use the same password as before if you like.
You may be tempted simply to press Enter instead, especially given that the WPA
supplicant in Windows XP works only when you store its certificates
without passphrases. It's very, very bad practice, however, to move private keys
around networks unprotected, so I strongly recommend that you not remove the
passphrase until after this file is copied safely over to your Windows XP client.
</p><p>
Lest you be tempted to take this opportunity to bash
Microsoft, I must note that both Xsupplicant
and wpa_supplicant on Linux require you to either
use a blank passphrase or store the passphrase in
clear text in a configuration file. This is contrary
to good certificate-handling wisdom. I hope we some day
see WPA supplicants intelligent enough to prompt
the user for its certificate passphrase on startup.
</p><p>
The resulting file, in this example client_cert.p12, contains both
your signed certificate and its private key. Copy it to your Windows XP
client system.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
We've installed FreeRADIUS, created a certificate authority, generated
server and client certificates and transferred them to their respective
hosts. But we're not done yet. We still need to configure FreeRADIUS,
our access point and our wireless clients. We'll do all that next
time. Until then, be safe!
