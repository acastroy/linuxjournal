Don't be fooled by chatter about desktop
wars. Applications and desktop environments are
cooperating behind the scenes and using reality-tested
standards to make everyone's software work and play
well together.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2781580.0x2879298"></a></h2></div></div><p>
End users care only about applications that perform the desired
tasks. They come to Linux to have the freedom to pick up these applications
one by one. To them, integrated desktop means the
freedom to choose any mix of programs and the assurance that they work
together. A monolithic desktop environment can limit programmers as
well. Making sure that your code cooperates with existing applications
is essential to good software, if not the main characteristic that makes it useful. Being forced
to use one or two development toolchains to achieve this result makes
much less sense.
</p><p>
A sore spot of the GNU/Linux desktop used to
be XFree86&mdash;development progressed too slowly and performance was not
satisfying. Many tools, from fontconfig to zlib, were duplicated to avoid
external dependencies. If one driver changed, the whole package had to be
released again. On top of all this, the XFree86 license changed last year
to one that appeared to prohibit GPL programs from linking to any of the
new code. Several distributions immediately reacted by not shipping the
new version with the license problem.
</p><p>
Freedesktop.org (FD.o) was formed in March 2000 to help developers
solve the technical problems outlined above. The goal of this project is to
create a base platform upon which every desktop can build. The method is
to define independent specifications, complete with working code where
needed. Formal standardization is left to other bodies. Following these
specs should guarantee real interoperability among applications as early
as possible during their development, ideally before it starts. All
software will be placed under LGPL or X-style licenses. FD.o hosts a
lot of neat projects, but this article introduces the main tools
constituting the so-called FD.o platform.

Figure 1. Integration the Freedesktop.org way:
servers, libraries and communication protocols that all applications
can use, no matter which desktop environment they were born in.

Xlibs</h2></div></div><p>
The X Window System is a network transparent protocol
for graphical display. GUI programs use X to give
drawing commands to the software, called the X server,
which actually controls the screen. Until last year,
servers and libraries usually were found in monolithic
packages. FD.o broke that bundle into parts, however, that now
can be developed and packaged separately. The
main advantage of this is that programmers and Linux
distributions can mix and customize, at will, different
implementations of each piece.
</p><p>
Other X improvements
include the removal of all in-tree dependencies and the use
of autotools as the build system and of the iconv
library for all conversions between Unicode and other
encodings. The libraries wrapping the X protocol are
called Xlibs. FD.o released its first version of them
in January 2004. They adhere to the X standard, so
they can be used with any X server.
</p><p>
Even after several optimizations, the size of Xlibs may create problems
on low-end platforms. Furthermore, some Xlibs request block until they
receive a reply, even when it is not really necessary. This can
interfere with some latency reduction features in the 2.6 kernels. Xlibs also do a lot
to hide the protocol, through caching, layering and similar efforts;
these efforts are an advantage in many cases, an overhead in others. Last but not least,
support for the creation of X extensions is limited.
</p><p>
The FD.o proposal to solve these problems is the X C Binding, XCB for
short. This second library can be a base for new toolkits and lightweight
emulation of parts of the Xlibs API. XCB is designed to work transparently
with POSIX thread or single-thread programs. The code maintains binary
compatibility with Xlibs extensions and applications and might not
require recompilation of extensions. This makes slow, gradual migration
from Xlibs to XCB easier, without losing functionality. The next step
along this path, the Xlibs Compatibility Layer (XCL), should allow
existing applications built on Xlibs to take advantage of XCB.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2781580.0x2879818"></a>
X Servers</h2></div></div><p>
FD.o hosts two alternatives to XFree86. The first one started as
a fork of the XFree86 4.4-RC2 code before the license change. This
server is called X.org and is used in the same way as XFree86. The other
alternative, called Xserver, is the most promising option in the long run. It is the fork
of Kdrive, which started years ago as a lightweight, heavily modified
version of XFree86. Kdrive is small, partly because it has less
code duplication with the kernel. Size reduction also came about by removing
some obsolete features and driver modules. The much smaller code size
makes it easier to start from Kdrive to build a whole new server.
</p><p>
The version of Xserver available today still is used mainly as a testbed for new extensions
and features, such as transparency or OpenGL acceleration. Memory usage
is minimized by performing a lot of calculations at runtime instead of
always keeping the results in memory.
</p><p>
The goal of Xserver is to reduce
slowness as well as the other phenomena that make looking at a
screen unpleasant, including flickers. A new X extension, called Composite,
allows double buffering of the entire screen. Of course, no server
can be smarter than its dumbest client, but the lighter architecture
should make it easier to find and fix slow code, wherever it is. The
new server makes no impact at the toolkit level, except when the
programmer chooses to take direct advantage of the new extensions.

Cairo</h2></div></div><p>
Vector graphics create an image by drawing more or less complex lines
and filling in the resulting areas with colors. The corresponding files
are small in size and can be scaled at any resolution without
losses. Consequently, this technique is interesting for everybody who
wants to be sure that what they print is what they see. Unfortunately,
X knows how to manage screen pixmaps of text, rectangles and
such, but it simply ignores printing or vector graphics. This is one of
the reasons why we still do not have 100% consistency between screen,
paper and saved files.
</p><p>
The FD.o solution is Cairo, &ldquo;a new 2D vector graphics library with
cross-device output support&rdquo;. In plain English, this means the
result is the same on all output media. Externally, Cairo provides user-level APIs
similar to the PDF 1.4 imaging model.
</p><p>
Through different back ends, Cairo can support different output
devices. The first one is screens, through either Xlibs or XCB,
and in-memory image buffers, which then can be saved to a file or passed
to other applications. PostScript and PNG output already is possible,
and PDF is planned. OpenGL accelerated output also will be available through
a back end called Glitz. In addition, it will be possible to use Glitz as a
standalone layer above OpenGL. Cairo language bindings exist for C++,
Java, Python, Ruby and GTK+.
</p><p>
The developers of OpenOffice.org also are planning to use Cairo after
version 2.0 of the OOo suite is released, possibly even as a separately
downloadable graphics plugin. Still being in active development and
minus a completely stable API, Cairo is not included yet in official
FD.o platform releases.

D-BUS</h2></div></div><p>
D-BUS is a binary protocol for Inter Process Communication (IPC) among
the applications of one desktop session or between that session and the
operating system. The second case corresponds to dynamic interactions
with the user whenever new hardware or software is added to the
computer. The internals of D-BUS were discussed by Robert Love in &ldquo;Get
on the D-BUS&rdquo; in the February 2005 issue of <i  >Linux Journal</i>. As far as the desktop end user is concerned, D-BUS
should provide at least the same level of service currently available
in both GNOME and KDE. To achieve this, both a system d&aelig;mon called
message bus and a per-user, per session d&aelig;mon are available. It
also is possible for any two programs to communicate directly by using D-BUS,
to maximize performance. For the same reason, because the programs using
the same D-BUS almost always live inside the same host, a binary format
is used instead of plain XML.
</p><p>
The message bus d&aelig;mon is an executable acting like a router. By passing
messages instead of byte streams among applications, the d&aelig;mon makes
their services available to the desktop. Normally there are multiple
independent instances of this d&aelig;mon on each computer. One would be
used for system-level communications, with heavy security restrictions
on what messages it can accept. The others would be created for each
user session, to serve applications inside it. The systemwide instance
of D-BUS can become a security hole: services running as root must be
able to exchange information and events with user applications. For
this reason, it is designed with limited privileges and runs in a chroot
jail. D-BUS-specific security guidelines can be found on the Fd.o Web
site (see on-line Resources).
</p><p>
Most programmers do not need to talk to the D-BUS protocol
directly. There are wrapper libraries to use it in any desired framework
or language. In this way, everybody is able to maintain his or her preferred
environment rather than learning or switching to a new one specifically
for IPC. End users, again, receive gains in interoperability: KDE, GNOME
and Mono programs will be able to talk to one another, regardless of
toolkit. As with Cairo, the first versions of the FD.o
platform don't include D-BUS, because its API is not stabilized yet.
But, the developers consider D-BUS to be a cornerstone of future releases.
D-BUS also is meant to replace DCOP in KDE 4.

Is This the Right Solution?</h2></div></div><p>
Only time will tell if the first implementations of Fd.o are good enough and
if the related specifications are valid. In this context, valid means
something complete that can be re-implemented from scratch with
totally new code, if one feels like doing so. I am convinced, however,
that the approach is valid and has more potential than any other
&ldquo;complete desktop&rdquo; already existing.
</p><p>
The two most frequent complaints I've read so far are 1) the current
desktops would lose their identities, becoming &ldquo;only user-interface
stuff&rdquo; and 2) FD.o is not standards, simply other implementations.
My personal response to the first concern is, even if it happened,
would it really be a problem? Most end users wouldn't even realize it,
nor would they be concerned at all. They most likely would note the improvements
I mentioned at the beginning and be done with it. Making sure that all applications can
cooperate, no matter how they were developed, also would make Linux much
more acceptable as a corporate desktop, shutting up a whole category of
arguments in favor of proprietary solutions.
</p><p>
If protocols and formats stop being tied to specific implementations or
toolkits, they can be shared across multiple &ldquo;desktop
environments&rdquo;. Code stability and lightness would directly
benefit from this, as would innovation. Completely new programs could
interact immediately with existing ones. I therefore hope that this trend is
generalized and that more application-independent standards are
submitted to FD.o, covering file formats, sound schemes, color and tasks settings.
Imagine one mail configuration file that could be used by any e-mail
client, from Evolution to mutt, or one bookmark file usable by every
browser from Mozilla to Lynx.
</p><p>
As far as the second objection goes&mdash;FD.o is not standards, simply
other implementations&mdash;that's exactly how free software and
RFC work. As long as specifications are written alongside the code,
concepts can be validated in the field as soon as possible. For the
record, this same thing currently is happening with OO.o and the OASIS
Office standard (see <i  >LJ</i>, April 2004). The file format started and matured
inside StarOffice and OO.o, but now it has a life of its own. The committee
currently includes representatives from KOffice, and any future office suite
can use it as its native format, starting only from the specification.
</p><p>
Some traps do exist along this path, but as far as I can tell, the
developers are aware of them and determined to avoid them. The first risk
is to develop standards that for one reason or another work well only
on Linux, leaving out the other UNIXes. The other is resource usage: all
the magic described here would look much less attractive if it required
doubling the RAM to run smoothly. As far as we know today,
however, this seems to be an unlikely possibility. In any case, this is
the right moment to join this effort. Happy hacking!
