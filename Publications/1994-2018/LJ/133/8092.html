Marcel takes a tour of a variety of games from a classic genre.
Quick! Jump!

Careful, Fran&ccedil;ois, you're going too fast! You're
going to fall in...too late. Ah, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mon ami</em></span>,
you have lost another life to the deep blue sea. In
fact, you have lost all four, which means it is my
turn. I know we are playing a game, but we also are
sampling the fare on tonight's menu, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mon ami</em></span>,
testing it as part of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Chez Marcel</em></span>'s extensive quality
control. Still, our guests will be here shortly, and
I have yet to select a wine.
</p><p>
They are here already? My apologies, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, we are
somewhat distracted. Welcome to <span   class="emphasis"><em>Chez Marcel</em></span>, where fine wines always
accompany fine Linux fare. Quick, Fran&ccedil;ois, to the wine cellar. Given
the light nature of tonight's menu, we need something that's light and
easy-drinking. Bring back the 2001 Modello Italian red.
</p><p>
My faithful waiter and I were looking at examples of a particular
type of video game often referred to as a platform game. The idea of these
games is fairly simple, and most tend to be scrolling two-dimensional
affairs. While moving from level to level, searching for or collecting
objects as you go, your player must run, jump and avoid objects
or enemies. To do so invariably involves climbing or jumping across
platforms that make it possible to move from one place to another. This
type of game has been around for years but continues to be popular, and
new ones are created all the time. This also is true in the Linux world.
</p><p>
Many years ago, when this humble Chef was quite a bit younger, I was
hooked on a game called <span   class="emphasis"><em>Lode Runner</em></span>. Dave Ashley's excellent
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Scavenger</em></span> is similar to this classic game and is great
fun to play (Figure 1). The idea is simple. You run around climbing ladders,
shimmying across ropes and running from one platform to another, collecting
gems while avoiding the bad guys. Depending on what is beneath your feet
at the time, you also have the ability to dig holes, either for escape
or to trap enemies.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8092f1.large.jpg"><img src="8092f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. <span  class="emphasis"><em>Scavenger</em></span> is an excellent homage to the
old <span  class="emphasis"><em>Lode Runner</em></span>.
</p></div></div><p>
Get your copy of <span   class="emphasis"><em>X Scavenger</em></span> by heading to the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Scavenger</em></span> Web site (see
the on-line Resources), where you'll find
the latest source. I have found that many contrib sites also offer
precompiled binaries of the program, so you may want to look in your
favorite distribution's offerings. That said, building
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Scavenger</em></span>
from source is not difficult. It's a slight variation on our classic
extract and build process:

<pre     class="programlisting">
tar -xzvf xscavenger-1.4.4.tgz
cd xscavenger-1.4.4/src
xmkmf
make
su -c "make install"
</pre>
</p><p>
The command name is scavenger, so that is what you have to run to start
the game. It starts in demo mode, so you can watch the action
and get a feel for how it works. Pressing F1 starts your game at
your highest level; if this is the first time you are playing, you start at level 1.
</p><p>
Game controls are on the numeric keypad, though the cursor keys work for
moving left, right, up and down. Two additional functions are provided
for digging to the left and to the right. If you don't like
the default key mapping, which is a problem on a notebook keyboard, and
already are playing a game, press Esc and then press the
spacebar. This takes you to the configuration menu. Now, press
F10 to remap your keyboard. I left the cursor keys as is for movement,
but I chose the A key to dig left and the D key to dig right.
</p><p>
While you are busy remapping your keyboard, you might notice some other interesting options here. For instance, you can choose
to demo various levels. Pressing F7 or F8 lets you
go up or down levels in the demo mode. Possibly my favorite feature,
though, is the level editor. Simply press F3 and you can create
your own <span   class="emphasis"><em>Scavenger</em></span> levels, a great way to eat up your time.
</p><p>
There's nothing like a nice, friendly game to whet your appetite. It is
extremely tempting for me to add a smiley somewhere in the last
sentence, partly due to the next platform game I want to tell you about,
a game of smileys gone bad. The game is called <span   class="emphasis"><em>Blob Wars: Metal Blob
Solid</em></span>, from Parallel Realities, and it's one of the stranger games
I've played.
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Blob Wars</em></span> is a rescue-the-MIAs game with a bizarre twist. All of the
characters are smileys, blobs if you will, and your task as Blob Soldier
Bob is to traverse various unfriendly but occasionally nice-looking areas looking for other soldiers being held prisoner. Your job
is to run your smiley soldier, firing various weapons&mdash;make sure you pick
up the laser&mdash;at your opponents, jumping from platform to platform as
you try to complete your mission without being destroyed (Figure 2).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8092f2.large.jpg"><img src="8092f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Your job, soldier, is to rescue the MIA blobs. Any questions?
</p></div></div><p>
Precompiled RPMs and Debs are available from the Parallel Realities
Web site, as is a source package should you need or want to compile the
program yourself. You need the various SDL development libraries, but
otherwise it's quite simple, only four steps:

<pre     class="programlisting">
tar -xzvf blobwars-1.02-1.tar.gz
cd blobwars-1.02
make
su -c "make install"
</pre>
</p><p>
To play, launch the command <tt  >blobwars</tt>. When the game
starts, you are presented with a menu from which you can start a new
game or continue one already in progress. The Options menu
lets you switch from windowed to full-screen mode. You also can adjust the volume
of both the sound and music track, as well as the brightness level.
In addition, you can decide whether you want to have the blood and gore
turned on. Yes, as you fire on enemy blobs, they scream and explode
into a bloody fireworks display. Sure, it's a little over the top, but
the game is great fun. Really.
</p><p>
You then are presented with a map identifying several locations where
MIAs are being held. Each location constitutes a mission. In the course
of the rescue operation, a number of useful objects are there for the
taking. These could be a jet pack, laser guns, grenades or keys to open
doors. Sometimes you pick up these objects from fallen
enemies. When you find an MIA, simply walk over to it and it is beamed away
from the action. As a <span   class="emphasis"><em>Star Trek</em></span> fan from way back, I loved
the transporter graphics and sound effects.
</p><p>
Could we possibly do justice to a menu of Linux platform games without
including Tux, our favorite mascot? <span   class="emphasis"><em>SuperTux</em></span> is a
classic jump-and-run platform game in the style of, you guessed it,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Super Mario Bros</em></span>. Under
Tobias (Tobgle) Glaesser's lead, but originally created by Bill Kendrick,
the current alpha release of <span   class="emphasis"><em>SuperTux</em></span> is guaranteed
to provide you with hours of fun. Don't let that first alpha milestone
fool you&mdash;this is a great game, one you absolutely need to check out.
</p><p>
The story goes like this: Tux and Penny (Tux's love interest) are out
on a nice date when Tux is knocked out and his lovely Penny
is penguinnapped by the evil Nolok. Held prisoner in Nolok's equally
evil fortress, Tux must brave all sorts of perils to save his lovely
lady. It is your job to help Tux succeed in his quest (Figure 3).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8092f3.large.jpg"><img src="8092f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Can Tux save his beloved Penny from the evil Nolok?
</p></div></div><p>
Binary packages for a variety of distributions and platforms are available
at the <span   class="emphasis"><em>SuperTux</em></span> Web site (see Resources),
so there may be no need to build from source. Should you decide to go
that route, though, building <span   class="emphasis"><em>SuperTux</em></span> is a classic
extract and build five-step:

<pre     class="programlisting">
tar -xjvf supertux-0.1.2.tar.bz2
cd supertux-0.1.2
./configure
make
su -c "make install"
</pre>
</p><p>
The game can be played entirely with cursor keys, but joysticks
and gamepads also are supported. Start the program by running the
<tt  >supertux</tt> command. The program starts with a handful of choices,
such as jumping right into the game, loading a couple of bonus levels
or creating your own, a little something for later. You also can set
various options, including OpenGL support, sound and music settings and so on.
</p><p>
The play is fast and fun. Jump over the many enemies to avoid them. Objects are
at different levels, so you climb or jump onto platforms to get from one obstacle to another. Collect gold coins as you
go. Smash ice blocks with Tux's head to discover power flowers or ice
balls that transform him into SuperTux, a being of enhanced strength
and power! When you complete a level, you are transported to the next,
more complicated level. I'm still on level four as I write this.
</p><p>
Oh, no! Knocked out by that sliding ice block again. I think it's
definitely time for a refill, Fran&ccedil;ois. Given the theme of this last
game, I think you should serve the Baked Alaska now. I also see that
closing time is nearly upon us, but have no fear, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes
amis</em></span>. We will keep the doors open and the wine flowing. There is no hurry. Besides,
the Baked Alaska needs to be eaten and Penny needs to be saved before
Fran&ccedil;ois and I can close the restaurant for the night. Therefore,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, let us all drink to one another's health.
<span   class="emphasis"><em>A votre sant&eacute; Bon app&eacute;tit!</em></span>
