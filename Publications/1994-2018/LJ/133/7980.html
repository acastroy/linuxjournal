Formerly tied to one proprietary OS, this multicampus college is
broadening students' horizons with Linux, Samba, SquirrelMail and
more.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16d7580.0x17cf5b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Mountainland Applied Technology College (MATC) is
one of several campuses that are a part of the Utah
College of Applied Technology (UCAT) system. Our
department teaches information
technology courses to both high school and adult
students. We provide individual technology courses,
short-term intensive training (STIT) courses, custom
fit courses and an education track that ends with an
Associate of Applied Technology degree or Certificate
of Completion in Information Technology. We currently
have two satellite sites with a probability of adding
two more in the 2005&ndash;2006 school year.
</p><p>
Until the last few years, we had been reliant solely
on Microsoft operating systems in our classrooms.
Unfortunately, when you give students sufficient
rights to work on their course material and labs,
spyware and viruses are introduced despite your best
uses of firewalls and virus scanners. These problems
have entered the network through means such as Web surfing,
floppies and USB thumbdrives.

Our Evolving Use of Linux</h2></div></div><p>
Starting with the 2001&ndash;2002 school year, Mountainland Applied Technology
College began offering Linux courses at the Orem MATC campus. Over the
next several years, our Linux class enrollments and course offerings
continued to grow, matching the growing use of Linux at home and in
businesses. Coupled with individual Linux distribution evaluations,
teaching these courses was a convincing experience that Linux was a
viable operating system for the IT department's infrastructure and for
hosting courseware on our classroom machines.
</p><p>
At the start of the 2000&ndash;2001 school year, individual
classroom servers were running either Microsoft Windows
2000 or Novell Netware. We started using a Linux
based firewall/router product called Freesco in the
individual classrooms to help deal with the increasing
amount of malware and the security inadequacies of
Windows.
</p><p>
During the 2001&ndash;2002 school year, a Windows 2000
system continued as the main classroom server.
Up until this time we still had no main department
server. We brought up a system with Linux as a
secondary server and started working on integrating
Linux into Microsoft Active Directory with great
difficulty and little success. We tried using
Microsoft Services for Unix, winbind (Samba 2.2.x)
and pam_smb, but we still couldn't make things work well
and temporarily abandoned our attempt to integrate
Linux authentication with Windows Active Directory.
During this school year, we also taught our first Linux
course for CompTIA Linux+ certification.
</p><p>
During the 2002&ndash;2003 school year, we replaced the
classroom Windows 2000 server with a Linux system
running Mandrake 9.1. We had an epiphany, so to speak,
when we changed our paradigm in relation to what to
use on our server(s) in the back end. We discovered
that using Linux for the back end made it a much
easier task to integrate different operating systems,
such as Microsoft and Linux, as opposed to
using Windows and Active Directory as the back end.
</p><p>
During the second half of the school year, various
Linux distributions, such as Red Hat 9 beta and
Mandrake 9.1, were beta tested on the desktop.
NIS was used for user authentication on Linux
clients and Samba, as a domain controller, for user
authentication in Windows. Although this setup worked,
it was frustrating to deal with multiple passwords
for the same user account, and we started looking
for a better solution. During this school year, we also
taught the first incarnation of our Linux Server
Administration course, using what we had learned
through our experiences up to this point.

The 2003&ndash;2004 school year was a time when Linux
technology, other open-source software and our
understanding and ability to use it all caught up
with their promised potential. The main IT classroom
servers were moved from Netware and Windows 2000 to a
single department server running Linux, in this case
Mandrake 9.1. We started using OpenLDAP as a central
repository for user authentication. LDAP was used
as the back-end database for Samba, and we used the
pam_ldap modules for Linux client authentication.
We started using Linux on the desktop&mdash;initially Red
Hat 9, Fedora Core 1 or SuSE 9&mdash;as the default option
in a dual-boot configuration with Windows XP Pro. At
this time, the majority of our students chose the
Windows option with a few brave souls trying Linux.
</p><p>
We also retained Windows because several
courseware packages either required Microsoft products,
including the Windows OS, Internet Explorer or Media
Player, or the browsers available for Linux were not
sufficiently Microsoft-Internet-Explorer-compatible
to use some sites. All things considered, we
were pleased with the stability of Linux on
the desktop. We were impressed particularly with
the virtual elimination of problems with viruses,
spyware and overly curious students that we suffered with
desktop Windows systems.
</p><p>
The 2004&ndash;2005 school year has proven to be one of
continued and significant improvements. We upgraded
the main Information Technology department server to
Fedora Core 2 to gain the advantages of the Linux
2.6 kernel. We also started offering students in
the Information Technology Department e-mail using
Postfix, Dovecot and Squirrelmail, with filtering
provided by SpamAssassin and ClamAV. On the Microsoft
compatibility front, we upgraded to Samba 3, which
provides much better integration with OpenLDAP and
creates a new opportunity for us in our quest for a
true single sign-on solution.
</p><p>
We now have an environment where our users can log
in to either Linux or Windows XP Pro using the same
user name and password. Linux clients authenticate
using pam_ldap, and users have home directories stored
on the server, shared via NFS and dynamically mounted
at login time using autofs. Windows clients are joined
to a domain controlled by Samba, allowing users to
authenticate using the same account information, user
name and password as they would if they were logging
in to a Linux client. The same home directories on
the server that are used with Linux are available in
Windows through automatic drive mappings. Windows
users' roaming user profiles also are stored in
their home directories on the server.
</p><p>
To take a step
further in the single sign-on arena, users also use
the same account information to access their e-mail.
We have provided Web-based access to e-mail, which
also is stored in their home directories on the server,
through Squirrelmail. Standard POP3 or IMAP access
is provided by Dovecot.
</p><p>
Fedora Core 2 or Fedora Core 3 is the primary desktop
operating system, depending on the lab.
Windows XP Pro also is available as a dual-boot
option in some labs, but we strongly are encouraging
our students to use Linux. We are finding that,
for the most part, our students have had little
difficulty making the switch to using Linux as their
primary desktop operating system. In many cases, they
are enjoying it more than Windows because of the
capabilities of KDE and GNOME to be customized to
a user's individual taste.
</p><p>
To support software
updates and patches between re-imaging, we have set up a
centralized software/package repository on our main IT
department server that mirrors the updates available
on the Web. The lab servers at the remote sites then
mirror a copy of the updates from the main server.
The individual Linux clients in each lab then are
scheduled to pull the updates from their respective
lab server using apt4rpm. This method allows for
better bandwidth usage, particularly for our sites
connected via T1, and a controlled set of software
and patches.
</p><p>
What we have developed on our main campus is a robust infrastructure
free from many of the problems related to Microsoft Windows.
Samba has replaced Windows as our domain controller for
those desktops that need to run Windows.The latest version of OpenLDAP
has proven robust, and Samba, Apache, Postfix and PAM take full
advantage of its capabilities. Refer to Figure 1 to see the complete
MATC infrastructure.

Linux Use at Remote Campuses</h2></div></div><p>
The MATC main campus is in Orem, Utah, and we have a secondary campus
in American Fork, Utah, approximately 10 miles away, that is connected
to the main campus by a T1 line. We also have a lab in Park City,
Utah, approximately 50 miles away, that we share through a partnership
with the Park City School District.
</p><p>
During the 2003&ndash;2004 school year, the IT classroom at the American Fork
campus was configured with a system running a Linux-based firewall and
a separate server based on Fedora Core 2. That server hosted Linux
distribution ISO images, pre-made VMware and VirtualPC images and files
related to the courses the students were taking. It also provided
some storage space for the students' work. The workstations ran Windows XP
Pro, and all students logged in using a single user name and password
local to the workstation.
</p><p>
Recently, during the 2004&ndash;2005 school year, the American Fork server
has been upgraded to Fedora Core 3 with the latest versions of Samba,
OpenLDAP and other software. The server now provides DNS and DHCP services, stores the
home directories for the students that attend IT classes at that site
and acts as the backup domain controller for the Windows clients in that
lab. All course-related data is synchronized daily from the main
server at our Orem campus using rsync. The firewall provides filtering
and NAT masquerading and handles all of the Internet traffic for the
workstations in that lab. Linux clients mount the home directories
stored on the server using NFS. The main IT department server in
Orem provides user authentication for all users.
</p><p>
All LDAP requests,
generated either by the Linux clients or the Samba server on behalf of
the Windows clients, are tunneled through OpenSSL to provide security.
Although funneling all authentications back to our main campus is not an
ideal solution, it has turned out to be surprisingly trouble free and
highly reliable. We had to resort to this method because our attempts
to use slapd to synchronize the LDAP servers between the Orem campus and
American Fork campus often were interrupted due to circumstances beyond
our control, such as high traffic volume and line unreliability. I must
interject that we only provide computer services for our department and
not the entire school. The result of these interruptions was the LDAP
directory being out of sync between these servers.
</p><p>
The shared lab in Park City is located in the Park City Learning Center.
As a member of the Park City School District (PCSD) network, the PCs and
network are locked down tightly and administered by the highly competent
PCSD IT staff. In discussions with the school district IT staff, we
reviewed some issues with security that had impacted our ability to
teach IT courses during the 2003&ndash;2004 school year. We jointly decided
on a plan to include a Linux-based server that would provide
Network Address Translation (NAT), DHCP and routing, along with hosting Linux distribution
ISO images, pre-made VMware images and files related to the courses the
students were enrolled in, plus some storage space for our students.
Seventeen lab PCs were imaged to dual boot into Windows XP or Fedora
Core 2. The PCSD IT staff, with the excellent help of Harold Hanson,
provided a VLAN that isolated the Linux server, yet allowed us to
change connections quickly so that Windows XP users still could authenticate
into the PCSD Novell network. This enables us to provide authentication
and other services for our students while they are in the lab, while not
interfering with the PCSD IT staff's ability to maintain the network for
their students.
</p><p>
The setup in the Park City lab is similar to that in the American
Fork lab. The lab server provides file, print, name and address
services as well as a mirror of the software and patch updates for the
Linux clients. The main server at our Orem campus, using SSL to secure
the transmissions, still provides all user authentications. Refer to
Figure 2 to see our infrastructure template for remote campuses.

Figure 2. At each remote campus, one Linux file server
offers local clients fast access to large files, while
a Linux firewall also functions as a DHCP server.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
We have, over the past few years, developed a system based around Linux
and open-source software that allows us to provide computing services for
our students to enhance their learning experience in a manner that is both
easy to maintain and simple to extend and replicate. It also has been
quite inexpensive to implement, maintain and update. For those in
the educational realm, cost is extremely important given the limited financial
resources available to most secondary and post-secondary institutions.
There is no doubt that more and more schools and businesses will move
in a direction similar to ours as Linux and open-source software becomes
more recognized and usable. This is one of the primary reasons that we
are working so hard to provide Linux and open-source software training.
All of our Linux courses have been influenced by our own experiences
and include instruction in most if not all of the techniques that we
have developed and refined.
</p><p>
Our journey with Linux and open-source software is far from over. We
continue to refine and explore new areas to better meet our current and
future needs. Things we are working on and plan for the future include:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
