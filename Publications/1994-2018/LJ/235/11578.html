We are analog and digital. One is old, the other new. Civilizing the latter
will take some work.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10e7580.0x11df300"></a></h2></div></div><p>
On a panel at the last LinuxCon, Linus was asked if the US government
ever wanted a backdoor added to Linux
(<a href="http://www.eweek.com/developer/linus-torvalds-talks-linux-development-at-linuxcon.html" target="_self">www.eweek.com/developer/linus-torvalds-talks-linux-development-at-linuxcon.html</a>).
He nodded &ldquo;yes&rdquo; while saying &ldquo;no&rdquo;.
While we're sure Linus meant what he said, his answer calls to mind the
immortal words of Yogi Berra (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yogi_Berra" target="_self">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yogi_Berra</a>): &ldquo;When you come to a fork in the road, take
it.&rdquo;
We are at that fork now. We arrived when Edward Snowden began revealing to
muggles what the wizards among us always knew, or at least suspected: that
government spying on ordinary data communications among private individuals
was not only possible, but happening.
</p><p>
I was talking the other day to a high-ranking US military officer who
referred to our new collective condition as &ldquo;post-Snowden&rdquo;. It is a
permanent state. We aren't going back.
</p><p>
The central problem of post-Snowden life is that our lives are now both
analog and digital. Snowden revealed the forked road we had already taken
and made clear how hard it is to travel both at once.
</p><p>
The difference between the two sides of the fork is binary. The analog and
the digital are as different and complementary as zero and one, which are
also the only numbers we need for binary math. For better and worse, we now
cohabitate a world that is both analog and base-2.
</p><p>
Today's use of base-2 mathematics traces back to Gottfried Leibniz
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Leibniz" target="_self">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Leibniz</a>), who
wrote, &ldquo;Now one can say that nothing in the world can better present and
demonstrate this power than the origin of numbers, as it is presented here
through the simple and unadorned presentation of one and zero or
nothing.&rdquo;
The thing &ldquo;presented here&rdquo; was the Chinese <span   class="emphasis"><em>I Ching</em></span>, which is wrapped around
the more ancient notion of <span   class="emphasis"><em>yin</em></span> and
<span   class="emphasis"><em>yang</em></span>, drawn by Taoists as the familiar
symbol shown in Figure 1.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11578f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. I Ching 
</p></div></div><p>
Berra-ists might prefer another Eastern symbol, the <span   class="emphasis"><em>endless
knot</em></span> shown in Figure 2
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endless_knot" target="_self">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endless_knot</a>).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11578f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Endless Knot
</p></div></div><p>
Both convey embrasure of irony: one in a state, the other in a path.
</p><p>
I'd love to see a symbol for this: <span   class="emphasis"><em>embodied</em></span> and
<span   class="emphasis"><em>disembodied</em></span>. The symbol shown in Figure 3 will have to
do for now.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11578f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Embodied and Disembodied
</p></div></div><p>
Our analog selves are embodied. Our digital ones aren't. Yet we manifest
both ways to each other.
</p><p>
As fleshy creatures, being analog is our permanent fate. Being digital
isn't, but it's what we also are now. We need to learn what that is and how
to deal with it. And we have a long way to go before being digital comes as
naturally as being analog. If it ever does.
</p><p>
In <span   class="emphasis"><em>Philosophy in the Flesh</em></span>, George Lakoff and Mark
Johnson say, &ldquo;The mind
is inherently embodied.&rdquo; Because of this, they continue, our bodies supply
the primary metaphors we use to make sense of the world. For example, we
say <span   class="emphasis"><em>good is up</em></span> and <span   class="emphasis"><em>bad is down</em></span> because we walk upright. We say good is
light and bad is dark because we are diurnal. If we were nocturnal, those
might be reversed. We speak of life in terms of travel (<span   class="emphasis"><em>birth is
arrival</em></span>,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>death is departure</em></span> or <span   class="emphasis"><em>passing on</em></span>,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>careers are paths</em></span>) because we are
ambulatory animals. To live is to move.
</p><p>
It is also fairly easy to own things in the analog world, or at least to
claim them as our own. &ldquo;Possession is nine-tenths of the law&rdquo; because it is
nine-tenths of the three-year-old. She says &ldquo;It's mine!&rdquo;, because she
has mastery of her opposable thumbs. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Possession is
holding</em></span>.
</p><p>
Our senses also extend outward beyond our bodies through a capacity called
<span   class="emphasis"><em>indwelling</em></span>. When a carpenter speaks of &ldquo;my
hammer&rdquo;, and drivers speak of
&ldquo;my engine&rdquo;, it is because their senses dwell in those things as
extensions of their bodies.
</p><p>
But how do we dwell in the disembodied place we
call the Internet? It isn't
a place, even though it has <span   class="emphasis"><em>sites</em></span>,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>locations</em></span> and <span   class="emphasis"><em>domains</em></span> that we
<span   class="emphasis"><em>visit</em></span> and
<span   class="emphasis"><em>browse</em></span>. Our bodies, even in public places, tend to be clothed, with things
we call &ldquo;privates&rdquo; concealed. On the Net&mdash;so far&mdash;we are exposed
in ways that are foreign to our bodily experience. Even the muggles among
us knew that, to some degree, in pre-Snowden time. Now just about all of us
know our degrees of personal exposure could be...anything, to a degree
that is incalculable in the limited terms of our analog experience.
</p><p>
This near-absolute range of possibility on the disembodied digital side of
our forked road is encapsulated in this single line from Kevin Kelly:
&ldquo;The
Internet is a copy machine&rdquo;
(<a href="http://www.kk.org/thetechnium/archives/2008/01/better_than_fre.php" target="_self">www.kk.org/thetechnium/archives/2008/01/better_than_fre.php</a>). When you send me a digital document over the
Net, you don't yield it, as you would in the analog way. Instead, you
contribute to the proliferation of everything.
</p><p>
T.Rob says the difference &ldquo;is one of atoms versus bits&rdquo;
(<a href="https://ioptconsulting.com/industry-still-puzzling-over-consumer-reaction-to-tracking" target="_self">https://ioptconsulting.com/industry-still-puzzling-over-consumer-reaction-to-tracking</a>). He goes on
to explain:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
When surveillance was physical Newtonian physics limited what could be
done. We didn't need laws or policies stating that you couldn't surveil
all of the people all of the time because to do so wasn't physically
possible. Because we have never had that capability before, we do not have
any experience with it from a policy-making standpoint.
</p><p>
Having always been constrained along that boundary by what was possible, it
was difficult to overstep the line of what was ethical. Today we have the
reverse. The line of possibility has withdrawn so far that it no longer
constrains us from crossing the line of what is ethical. But we are so
unused to having to exercise self-restraint along this boundary that many
are not recognizing the ethical line when they cross it. Many are in fact
treating it like a land rush, grabbing all the territory between the
ethical line and the possible line before policy and legislation can step
in to claim it.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
I suspect in the end it will come down to manners. There will be things
that we do not do, even though we can. I see hope in the word
<span   class="emphasis"><em>protocol</em></span>, which is well understood in technical circles, as well as among diplomatic
and other practices back in the analog world.
</p><p>
But I don't have faith. Not yet. Not while the land rush is still on for
marketers and government agencies, trampling our analog sensibilities.
Snowden's revelations may have marked Peak Surveillance, but they also marked
the point at which we start to work seriously on civilizing our digital
selves.
