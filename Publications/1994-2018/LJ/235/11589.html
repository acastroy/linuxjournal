You've probably heard of OpenStack. It's that cloud software that's getting
a lot of attention from a lot of big names in the IT industry and major
users like CERN, Comcast and PayPal.
However, did you know that it's more than that? It's also the
fastest-growing Open Source community in the world, and a very interesting
collaboration among technology vendors.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd5a580.0xe521f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
OpenStack is really truly open. If you want to test it out, you can stop reading this article (come
back after&mdash;we'll still be here), visit
<a href="http://status.openstack.org/release" target="_self">status.openstack.org/release</a>, and get a real-time list of features
that are under development. Select one, follow it to the code review
system, and give your comments. This is an example of Open Development, just one of the &ldquo;Four
Opens&rdquo; on which
OpenStack was founded. Of
course, you likely already know that OpenStack is fully released under the
Open Source Apache 2 license, no bits reserved, but did you also know
about the principle of &ldquo;Open Design&rdquo;?
</p><p>
The software is released on a six-month cycle, and at the start of each
cycle, we host a Design Summit for the contributors and users to gather and
plan out the roadmap for the next release. The Design Summit has become
part of an increasingly large conference that also hosts workshops for
newcomers, inspiring keynotes and some fairly amazing user stories.
However, somewhere tucked away are rooms with chairs arranged in
semicircular layouts ensconcing dozens of developers engaged in robust
discussion, taking notes on a collaborative document displayed on a
projector. This is where the roadmap of OpenStack is determined, pathways
for implementations of features are aligned, and people volunteer to make it
reality. This is the Open Design process, and we welcome your
participation.
</p><p>
OpenStack may have started with just two organizations, NASA and Rackspace,
but now there are hundreds, and with each additional member, the community
grows stronger and more cohesive. Every morning the OpenStack developer
awakes to a torrent of e-mail from the discussions in other countries, and
the momentum is best described as &ldquo;intense&rdquo;.
</p><p>
Overall, OpenStack's standout feature is this
strong community. It's
extremely diverse, composed of very different technical backgrounds
(Python developers to packagers to translators) and different philosophical
backgrounds (free software evangelists to hard-core capitalists). It's also
very widespread, with the OpenStack Foundation claiming membership from 130
countries as of October 2013. So, dear reader, chances are there is a place
for you.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd5a580.0xe52670"></a>
Becoming a Contributor</h2></div></div><p>
During a 12-month period, OpenStack typically has more than 1,000
software developers contributing patches. Despite this, we always need
more.
</p><p>
You can find detailed instructions on how to get started on the wiki
(<a href="http://wiki.openstack.org/HowToContribute" target="_self">wiki.openstack.org/HowToContribute</a>), but let me run through a
couple key aspects:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
OpenStack uses Launchpad for bugs and GitHub for code hosting, but neither
of those places for contributing code. That's right, no GitHub pull
requests are accepted. Don't panic yet&mdash;this is for a good reason: all
patches to OpenStack go through an extensive code review and testing
process (<a href="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Gerrit_Workflow" target="_self">https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Gerrit_Workflow</a>).
</p></li><li><p>
Every code change in OpenStack is seen by at least three people (the owner and
two of the core reviewers for the project), but often many more, and test
cases and PEP8 compliance is required. The patches also are run through the
continuous integration system, which effectively builds a new cloud for
every code change submitted, ensuring that the interaction of that piece
of software is as expected with all other parts of OpenStack. As a result
of this quest for quality, many have found that contributing has improved
their Python coding skills.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Of course, not everyone is a Python developer. However, don't worry;
there's still a place for you to work with us to change the face of cloud
computing:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Documentation: in many cases, the easiest way to become an OpenStack contributor is to
participate in the documentation efforts. It requires no coding, just a
willingness to read and understand the systems that you're writing
about. Because the documentation is treated like code, you will be learning
the mechanics necessary to make contributions to OpenStack itself by
helping with documentation. Visit
<a href="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Documentation/HowTo" target="_self">https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Documentation/HowTo</a> for more
information.
</p></li><li><p>
Translation: if you know how to write in another language, translations of OpenStack
happen through an easy-to-use Web interface
(<a href="https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/openstack" target="_self">https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/openstack</a>). For help, contact the
Internationalization team (<a href="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/I18nTeam" target="_self">https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/I18nTeam</a>).
</p></li><li><p>
File bugs:
OpenStack is one of the few projects you will work on that loves to hear
your angry rants when something does not work. If you notice something off,
consider filing a bug report with details of your environment and what you
experienced at
<a href="http://docs.openstack.org/trunk/openstack-ops/content/upstream_openstack.html" target="_self">docs.openstack.org/trunk/openstack-ops/content/upstream_openstack.html</a>.
</p></li><li><p>
Asking questions:
a StackOverflow-style board for questions about
OpenStack is available at <a href="http://ask.openstack.org" target="_self">ask.openstack.org</a>. Feel
free to use it to ask yours, and if you have the ability,
stick around and try to answer someone else's (or at least vote on the
ones that look good).
</p></li><li><p>
Evangelism:
do you think OpenStack is pretty cool? Help us out by telling your friends; we'd
really appreciate it. You can find some materials to help at
<a href="http://openstack.org/marketing" target="_self">openstack.org/marketing</a>, or join the marketing mailing list to find
out about some cool events to attend.
</p></li><li><p>
User groups:
join your local user group
(<a href="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/OpenStackUserGroups" target="_self">https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/OpenStackUserGroups</a>). They're in about 50
countries so far. Attend to learn, or volunteer to speak. We'd love to
have you.
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd5a580.0xe53170"></a>
Navigating the Ecosystem: Where Does Your OpenStack Journey Begin?</h2></div></div><p>
One of the unique aspects about OpenStack as an open-source project is that
there are many different levels at which you can begin to engage with it. You don't
have to do everything yourself.
</p><p>
Starting with <span   class="emphasis"><em>Public Clouds</em></span>, you don't even need to have an OpenStack
installation to start using it. Today, you can swipe your credit card at
eNovance, HP, Rackspace and others, and just start migrating your
applications.
</p><p>
Of course, for many people, the enticing part of OpenStack is building
their own private clouds, and there are several ways to do that. Perhaps the
simplest of all is an <span   class="emphasis"><em>appliance-style</em></span> solution. You purchase a
&ldquo;thing&rdquo;, unbox
it, plug in the power and the network, and it just <span   class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> an OpenStack cloud.
</p><p>
However, hardware choice is important for many applications, so if that
applies to you, consider that there are several software distributions
available. You can, of course, get enterprise-supported OpenStack from
Canonical, Red Hat and SUSE, but take a look also at some of the
specialized distributions, such as those from Rackspace, Piston, SwiftStack
or Cloudscaling.
</p><p>
If you want someone to help guide you through the decisions from the
hardware up to your applications, perhaps adding in a few features or
integrating components along the way, consider contacting one of the system
integrators with OpenStack experience like Mirantis or Metacloud.
</p><p>
Alternately, if your preference is to build your own OpenStack expertise
internally, a good way to kick start that might be to attend or arrange a
training session. The OpenStack Foundation recently launched a Training
Marketplace (<a href="http://www.openstack.org/marketplace/training" target="_self">www.openstack.org/marketplace/training</a>), where you can
look for events nearby. There's also a community training effort
(<a href="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Training-manuals" target="_self">https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Training-manuals</a>) underway
to produce open-source content for training.
</p><p>
To derive the most from the flexibility of the OpenStack framework, you may
elect to perform a DIY solution. In which case, we strongly recommend
getting a copy of the OpenStack Operations Guide
(<a href="http://docs.openstack.org/ops" target="_self">docs.openstack.org/ops</a>), which discusses many of the decisions you
will face along the way. There's also a new OpenStack Security Guide
(<a href="http://docs.openstack.org/sec" target="_self">docs.openstack.org/sec</a>), which is an invaluable reference for
hardening your installation.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd5a580.0xe537a0"></a>
DIY-ing Your OpenStack Cloud</h2></div></div><p>
If, after careful analysis, you've decided to construct OpenStack yourself
from the ground up, there are a number of areas to consider.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Storage</b></span>
</p><p>
One of the most fundamental underpinnings of a cloud platform is the
storage on which it runs.
In general, when you select storage back ends, ask the following questions:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Do my users need block storage?
</p></li><li><p>
Do my users need object storage?
</p></li><li><p>
Do I need to support live migration?
</p></li><li><p>
Should my persistent storage drives be contained in my compute nodes, or
should I use external storage?
</p></li><li><p>
What is the platter count I can achieve? Do more spindles result in better
I/O despite network access?
</p></li><li><p>
Which one results in the best cost-performance scenario I'm aiming for?
</p></li><li><p>
How do I manage the storage operationally?
</p></li><li><p>
How redundant and distributed is the storage? What happens if a storage
node fails? To what extent can it mitigate my data-loss disaster scenarios?
</p></li><li><p>
Which plugin do I use for block storage?
</p></li></ul></div><p>
For many new clouds, the object storage and persistent/block storage are
great features that users want. However, with OpenStack, you're not forced
to use either if you want a simpler deployment.
</p><p>
Many parts of OpenStack are pluggable, and one of the best examples of this
is Block Storage, which you are able to configure to use storage from a
long list of vendors (Coraid, EMC, GlusterFS, Hitachi, HP, IBM, LVM,
NetApp, Nexenta, NFS, RBD, Scality, SolidFire, Windows Server and Zadara).
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Network</b></span>
</p><p>
If this is the first time you are deploying a cloud infrastructure in your
organization, after reading this section, your first conversations should
be with your networking team. Network usage in a running cloud is vastly
different from traditional network deployments, and it has the potential to be
disruptive at both a connectivity and a policy level.
</p><p>
For example, you must plan the number of IP addresses that you need for
both your guest instances as well as management infrastructure.
Additionally, you must research and discuss cloud network connectivity
through proxy servers and firewalls.
</p><p>
One of the first choices you need to make is between the
&ldquo;legacy&rdquo;
nova-network and OpenStack Networking (aka Neutron). Nova-network is a
much simpler way to deploy a network, but it does not have the full
software-defined networking features of Neutron, and it will be deprecated
after 12&ndash;18
months.
</p><p>
Object Storage's network patterns might seem unfamiliar at first. Consider
these main traffic flows:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Among object, container and account servers.
</p></li><li><p>
Between those servers and the proxies.
</p></li><li><p>
Between the proxies and your users.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Object Storage is very &ldquo;chatty&rdquo; among servers hosting
data&mdash;even a small
cluster does megabytes/second of traffic, which is predominantly &ldquo;Do you
have the object?&rdquo;/&ldquo;Yes I have the object.&rdquo; Of course, if the answer to the
aforementioned question is negative or times out, replication of the object
begins.
</p><p>
Consider the scenario where an entire server fails, and 24TB of data needs
to be transferred &ldquo;immediately&rdquo; to remain at three
copies&mdash;this can put
significant load on the network.
</p><p>
Another oft-forgotten fact is that when a new file is being uploaded, the
proxy server must write out as many streams as there are replicas&mdash;giving
a multiple of network traffic. For a three-replica cluster, 10Gbps in means
30Gbps out. Combining this with the previous high-bandwidth demands of
replication is what results in the recommendation that your private network
is of significantly higher bandwidth than your public need be. Oh, and
OpenStack Object Storage communicates internally with unencrypted,
unauthenticated sync for performance&mdash;you do want the private network to
be private.
</p><p>
The remaining point on bandwidth is the public-facing portion. Swift-proxy
is stateless, which means that you easily can add more and use HTTP
load-balancing methods to share bandwidth and availability between them.
</p><p>
More proxies mean more bandwidth, if your storage can keep up.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
&ldquo;Cloud Controller&rdquo;</b></span>
</p><p>
To achieve maximum scalability via a shared-nothing/distributed-everything
architecture, OpenStack does not have the concept of a &ldquo;cloud
controller&rdquo;.
Indeed, one of the biggest decisions deployers face is exactly how to
segregate out all of the &ldquo;central&rdquo; services, such as the API endpoints,
schedulers, database servers and the message queue.
</p><p>
For best results, acquiring some metrics on how the cloud will be used is
necessary. Although of course, with a proper automated configuration
management system, it will be possible to scale as operational experience is
gained. Key questions to consider may include:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
How many instances will run at once?
</p></li><li><p>
How many compute nodes will run at once?
</p></li><li><p>
How many users will access the API?
</p></li><li><p>
How many users will access the dashboard?
</p></li><li><p>
How many nova-API services do you run at once for your cloud?
</p></li><li><p>
How long does a single instance run?
</p></li><li><p>
Does your authentication system also verify externally?
</p></li></ul></div><p>
When choosing the size of compute node hardware is mainly dependent on the
types of virtual machines running, &ldquo;central service&rdquo; machines can be more
difficult. Contrast two clouds running 1,000 virtual machines. One is
mainly used for long-running Web sites, and in the other the average
lifetime is more akin to an hour. With so much churn in the latter, it 
certainly will need a more heavyset API/database/message queue.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Scaling</b></span>
</p><p>
Given that &ldquo;scalability&rdquo; is a key word in OpenStack's mission, it's no surprise
that there are several methods dedicated to assisting the expansion of
your cloud by segregating it&mdash;in addition to the natural horizontal
scaling of all components.
</p><p>
The first two are aimed at very large, multisite deployments. Compute
cells are designed to allow running the cloud in a distributed fashion
without having to use more complicated technologies or being invasive to
existing nova installations. Hosts in a cloud are partitioned into groups
called cells. Cells are configured in a tree. The top-level cell (API
cell) has a host that runs the API service, but no hypervisors. Each child
cell runs all of the other typical services found in a regular
installation, except for the API service. Each cell has its own message
queue and database service, and it also runs the cell service, which
manages the communication between the API cell and child cells.
</p><p>
This allows for a single API server to be used to control access to
multiple cloud installations. Introducing a second level of scheduling (the
cell selection), in addition to the regular nova-scheduler selection of
hosts, provides greater flexibility to control where virtual machines are
run.
</p><p>
Contrast this with regions. Regions have a separate API endpoint per
installation, allowing for a more discrete separation. Users wishing to run
instances across sites have to select a region explicitly. However, the
additional complexity of a running a new service is not required.
</p><p>
Alternately, you can use availability zones, host aggregates or both to
partition a compute deployment.
</p><p>
Availability zones enable you to arrange OpenStack Compute hosts into
logical groups, and they provide a form of physical isolation and redundancy
from other availability zones, such as by using separate power supplies or
network equipment.
</p><p>
You define the availability zone in which a specified Compute host resides
locally on each server. An availability zone is commonly used to identify a
set of servers that have a common attribute. For instance, if some of the
racks in your data center are on a separate power source, you can put
servers in those racks in their own availability zone. Availability zones
also can help separate different classes of hardware.
</p><p>
When users provision resources, they can specify from which availability
zone they would like their instance to be built. This allows cloud
consumers to ensure that their application resources are spread across
disparate machines to achieve high availability in the event of hardware
failure.
</p><p>
Host aggregates, on the other hand, enable you to partition OpenStack
Compute deployments into logical groups for load balancing and instance
distribution. You can use host aggregates to partition an
availability zone further. For example, you might use host aggregates to partition
an availability zone into groups of hosts that either share common
resources, such as storage and network, or have a special property, such as
trusted computing hardware.
</p><p>
A common use of host aggregates is to provide information for use with the
compute scheduler. For example, you might use a host aggregate to group a
set of hosts that share specific images.
</p><p>
Another very useful feature for scaling is Object Storage Global Clusters.
This adds the concept of a Region and allows for scenarios like having one
of the three replicas in an off-site location. Check the SwiftStack blog
for more information 
(<a href="http://swiftstack.com/blog/2012/09/16/globally-distributed-openstack-swift-cluster" target="_self">swiftstack.com/blog/2012/09/16/globally-distributed-openstack-swift-cluster</a>).

Summary</h2></div></div><p>
If you've looked at the storage options, determined which types of storage
you want and how they will be implemented, planned the network carefully (taking
into account the different ways to deploy it and how it will be managed),
acquired metrics to design your cloud controller, then considered how to
scale your cluster, you probably are now an OpenStack expert. In which
case, we'd encourage you to customize your deployment and share your
findings with the community.
