Crucial LRDIMMs</h2></div></div><p>
If Crucial could tell you one thing about its new 64GB DDR3L Load-Reduced
DIMMs
(LRDIMMs) for servers, it would be that they enable more DIMMs per channel
for up to
twice the installed memory capacity per server. By enabling high-end server
environments with demanding workloads to reach the maximum amount of
installed memory possible, dramatic performance gains in memory bandwidth
and overall server productivity are possible, all while reducing power
costs relative to adding additional servers. Utilizing 1.35V (vs. 1.5V) for
optimal energy efficiency, Crucial LRDIMMs offer up to a 35%
increase in memory bandwidth compared to standard registered DIMMs and
eliminate the channel ranking limitation of standard DDR3 registered DIMMs.
These new memory modules also are compatible with OEM servers and
warranties, allowing users to upgrade their existing server infrastructures
without having to purchase an entirely new system. Crucial LRDIMMs fully
support the latest Intel Xeon processor E5 family.

Peteris Krumins' <span   class="emphasis"><em>Perl One-Liners</em></span> (No Starch)</h2></div></div><p>
Perl one-liners are small, super-nifty Perl programs that fit in one line
of code and do one thing really well. Peteris Krumins' new book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Perl
One-Liners: 130 Programs That Get Things Done</em></span> showcases short and
compelling lines of code that do all sorts of handy, geeky things like
numbering lines in a file; generating random passwords; encoding, decoding
and converting strings; calculating factorials; and even checking to see if a
number is prime with a regular expression. Krumins' dissections of each bit
of code will help readers gain a deeper understanding of the Perl language,
and the Perl one-liners contained herein are sure to save time and sharpen
skills.

Our community is packed with power citizens, from free speech advocates to
Second Amendment gurus and civil rights activists. To inform your activism,
or simply to live up to Thomas Jefferson's ideal of an informed citizenry,
the Library of Congress has a new resource for you. <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Constitution of the
United States of America: Analysis and Interpretation</em></span>, popularly known
as the &ldquo;Constitution Annotated&rdquo; is now available as a free app and
Web publication. The resource, formerly difficult to access by the general
public due to its size and update cycle, makes analysis and interpretation
of constitutional case law accessible to anyone with a computer or mobile
device. The Web publication consists of digitally signed, searchable
PDF documents. Meanwhile the app, which adds a wealth of interactive
features, is available for the iOS platform; an Android version
is currently under development.

OpenStack Foundation's Training Marketplace</h2></div></div><p>
As the OpenStack cloud computing platform infiltrates data centers
worldwide, the demand for educated administrators and users to manage these
clouds grows in tandem. To help developers and operators gain the valuable
skills they need to exploit the burgeoning opportunities, the OpenStack
Foundation and its ecosystem partners have responded with the Training
Marketplace. The on-line &ldquo;course catalog&rdquo; features dozens of courses across
10 countries and 25 cities, from providers at launch time as varied as
Aptira, hastexo, The Linux Foundation, Mirantis, Morphlabs, Piston,
Rackspace, Red Hat, SUSE and SwiftStack. In addition to paid and free
training courses, many community efforts are available to produce helpful
documentation, how-to information and new Operations and Security guide
books.

Zentyal Server</h2></div></div><p>
In midst of a cloud push, Zentyal Linux Small Business Server 3.2
represents a drop-in alternative to existing SMB solutions for companies
seeking a choice in how to manage their network infrastructure. The
all-in-one IT backoffice, which can be set up in less than 30 minutes, is
an integration of the complex Samba technologies that provides native
interoperability with Microsoft Active Directory and a range of other services.
The solution speaks to customers who have logistical, security and
connectivity concerns about moving to the cloud. The single most important
improvement that Zentyal Server 3.2 introduces, according to its developer,
is greater integration of the Samba technology, meaning that it is now
possible to introduce Zentyal Server transparently on a Windows
environment, migrate network services and users to Zentyal and then turn
off unneeded Windows servers without causing inconvenience to users.
Zentyal Server 3.2 also supports Group Policy Objects and Organizational
Units and secures mobile communications to the private company resources
out of the box.

SUSE Cloud</h2></div></div><p>
The headlining new feature of SUSE Cloud 2.0 is the capacity for setting up
a mixed-hypervisor private cloud environment that can be deployed
rapidly and managed easily, helping enterprises increase business agility and
reduce IT costs. SUSE Cloud 2.0 supports KVM and Xen hypervisor
environments and is the first OpenStack distribution (namely Grizzly) to
add full support for Microsoft Hyper-V. VMware ESXi integration also
is included as a technical preview. Other advances in v2.0 include a more
robust installation process, integration with the Crowbar deployment
framework, all of the features and fixes of OpenStack Grizzly, improved
integration with SUSE Studio and SUSE Manager for building and managing
cloud-based applications and a broader ecosystem of partner solutions to
configure private clouds based on unique IT infrastructure requirements.
