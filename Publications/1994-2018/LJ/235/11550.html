</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x124c580.0x13441f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Zato is a Python-based platform for integrating applications
and exposing back-end services to front-end clients
(<a href="https://zato.io/docs/index.html" target="_self">https://zato.io/docs/index.html</a>). It's an ESB (Enterprise
Service Bus) and an application server focused on data integrations. The
platform doesn't enforce any limits on architectural style for designing
systems and can be used for SOA (Service Oriented Architecture), REST
(Representational State Transfer) and for building systems of systems
running in-house or in the cloud.
</p><p>
At its current version of 1.1 (at the time of this writing), Zato supports HTTP, JSON, SOAP, SQL, AMQP,
JMS WebSphere MQ, ZeroMQ, Redis NoSQL and FTP. It includes a browser-based
GUI, CLI, API, security, statistics, job scheduler, HAProxy-based load
balancer and hot-deployment. Each piece is extensively documented from
the viewpoint of several audiences: architects, admins and programmers.
</p><p>
Zato servers are built on top of gevent and gunicorn frameworks
that are responsible for handling incoming traffic using asynchronous
notification libraries, such as libevent or libev, but all of that is hidden
from programmers' views so they can focus on their job only.
</p><p>
Servers always are part of a cluster and run identical copies of
services deployed. There is no limit on how many servers a single
cluster can contain.
</p><p>
Each cluster keeps its configuration in Redis and an SQL database. The
former is used for statistics or data that is frequently updated and
mostly read-only. The latter is where the more static configuration
shared between servers is kept.
</p><p>
Users access Zato through its Web-based GUI
(<a href="https://zato.io/docs/web-admin/intro.html" target="_self">https://zato.io/docs/web-admin/intro.html</a>),
the command line (<a href="https://zato.io/docs/admin/cli/index.html" target="_self">https://zato.io/docs/admin/cli/index.html</a>) or API
(<a href="https://zato.io/docs/public-api/intro.html" target="_self">https://zato.io/docs/public-api/intro.html</a>).
</p><p>
Zato promotes loose coupling, reusability of components and
hot-deployment. The high-level goal is to make it trivial to access
or expose any sort of information. Common integration techniques and
needs should be, at most, a couple clicks away, removing the need
to reimplement the same steps constantly, slightly differently in each
integration effort.
</p><p>
Everything in Zato is about minimizing the interference of components
on each other, and server-side objects you create can be updated easily,
reconfigured on fly or reused in other contexts without influencing
any other.
</p><p>
This article guides you through the process of exposing complex XML
data to three clients using JSON, a simpler form of XML and SOAP, all 
from a single code base in an elegant and Pythonic way that doesn't
require you to think about the particularities of any format or transport.
</p><p>
To speed up the process of retrieving information by clients, back-end
data will be cached in Redis and updated periodically by a job-scheduled
service.
</p><p>
The data provider used will be US Department of the Treasury's real
long-term interest rates
(<a href="http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/Pages/TextView.aspx?data=reallongtermrate" target="_self">www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/Pages/TextView.aspx?data=reallongtermrate</a>). Clients
will be generic HTTP-based ones invoked through curl, although in
practice, any HTTP client would do.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x124c580.0x1344930"></a>
The Process and IRA Services</h2></div></div><p>
The goal is to make it easy and efficient for external client
applications to access long-term US rates information. To that end,
you'll make use of several features of Zato:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Scheduler will be employed to invoke a service to download the XML
offered by treasury.gov and parse interesting data out of it.
</p></li><li><p>
Redis will be used as a cache to store the results of parsing the XML.
</p></li><li><p>
Zato's SimpleIO (SIO, <a href="https://zato.io/docs/progguide/sio.html" target="_self">https://zato.io/docs/progguide/sio.html</a>) will allow you to expose the same set
of information to more than one client, each using a different message
format, without any code changes or server restarts.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Zato encourages the division of each business process into
a set of IRA services (<a href="https://zato.io/docs/intro/esb-soa.html" target="_self">https://zato.io/docs/intro/esb-soa.html</a>)&mdash;that is, each service exposed to users should be:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Interesting</em></span>: services should provide a real value that makes
potential users pause for a moment and, at least, contemplate using the
service in their own applications for their own benefit.
</p></li><li><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Reusable</em></span>: making services modular will allow you to make use of them
in circumstances yet unforeseen&mdash;to build new, and possibly unexpected,
solutions on top of lower-level ones.
</p></li><li><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Atomic</em></span>: a service should have a well defined
goal, indivisible
from the viewpoint of a service's users, and preferably no functionality
should overlap between services.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
The IRA approach closely follows the UNIX philosophy of &ldquo;do one thing
and do it well&rdquo; as well as the KISS principle that is well known and followed
in many areas of engineering.
</p><p>
When you design an IRA service, it is almost exactly like defining APIs
between the components of a standalone application. The difference is
that services connect several applications running in a distributed
environment. Once you take that into account, the mental process is
identical.
</p><p>
Anyone who already has created an interesting interface of any sort in
a single-noded application written in any programming language will feel
right like home when dealing with IRA services.
</p><p>
From Zato's viewpoint, there is no difference in whether a service
corresponds to an S in SOA or an R in REST; however, throughout this
article, I'm using the the former approach.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x124c580.0x1345328"></a>
Laying Out the Services</h2></div></div><p>
The first thing you need is to diagram the integration process, pull out the
services that will be implemented and document their purpose. If you need
a hand with it, Zato offers its own API's documentation
as an example of how a
service should be documented (see <a href="https://zato.io/docs/progguide/documenting.html" target="_self">https://zato.io/docs/progguide/documenting.html</a> and <a href="https://zato.io/docs/public-api/intro.html" target="_self">https://zato.io/docs/public-api/intro.html</a>):
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Zato's scheduler is configured to invoke a service (update-cache)
refreshing the cache once in an hour.
</p></li><li><p>
update-cache, by default, fetches the XML for the current month, but
it can be configured to grab data for any date. This allows for reuse
of the service in other contexts.
</p></li><li><p>
Client applications use either JSON or simple XML to request
long-term rates (get-rate), and responses are produced based on data
cached in Redis, making them super-fast. A single SIO Zato service can
produce responses in JSON, XML or SOAP. Indeed, the same service can be
exposed independently in completely different channels, such as HTTP or AMQP,
each using different security definitions and not interrupting the
message flow of other channels.
</p></li></ul></div><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11550f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Overall Business Process
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x124c580.0x1345900"></a>
Implementation</h2></div></div><p>
The full code for both services is available as a gist
on GitHub, and only the most interesting parts are discussed
(<a href="https://gist.github.com/dsuch/6440366" target="_self">https://gist.github.com/dsuch/6440366</a>).
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
linuxjournal.update-cache</b></span>
</p><p>
Steps the service performs are:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Connect to treasury.gov.
</p></li><li><p>
Download the big XML.
</p></li><li><p>
Find interesting elements containing the business data.
</p></li><li><p>
Store it all in Redis cache.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Key fragments of the service are presented below.
</p><p>
When using Zato services, you are never required to hard-code network
addresses. A service shields such information and uses human-defined
names, such as &ldquo;treasury.gov&rdquo;; during runtime, these resolve into a set of
concrete connection parameters. This works for HTTP and any other protocol
supported by Zato. You also can update a connection definition on the
fly without touching the code of the service and without any restarts:


<pre     class="programlisting">
 1 # Fetch connection by its name
 2 out = self.outgoing.plain_http.get('treasury.gov')
 3
 4 # Build a query string the backend data source expects
 5 query_string = {
 6  '$filter':'month(QUOTE_DATE) eq {} and year(QUOTE_DATE) eq
{}'.format(month, year)
 7 }
 8
 9 # Invoke the backend with query string, fetch 
   # the response as a UTF-8 string
10 # and turn it into an XML object
11 response = out.conn.get(self.cid, query_string)
</pre>
</p><p>
lxml (<a href="http://lxml.de" target="_self">lxml.de</a>) is a very good Python library for XML processing and
is used in the example to issue XPath queries against the complex
document (<a href="http://data.treasury.gov/feed.svc/DailyTreasuryRealLongTermRateAverageData?$filter=month%28QUOTE_DATE%29%20eq%208%20and%20year%28QUOTE_DATE%29%20eq%202013" target="_self">data.treasury.gov/feed.svc/DailyTreasuryRealLongTermRateAverageData?$filter=month%28QUOTE_DATE%29%20eq%208%20and%20year%28QUOTE_DATE%29%20eq%202013</a>)
returned:


<pre     class="programlisting">
1 xml = etree.fromstring(response)
2
3 # Look up all XML elements needed (date and rate) using XPath
4 elements = xml.xpath('//m:properties/d:*/text()', 
  &#8618;namespaces=NAMESPACES)
</pre>
</p><p>
For each element returned by the back-end service, you create an entry
in the Redis cache in the format specified by
<tt  >REDIS_KEY_PATTERN</tt>&mdash;for instance,
<tt  >linuxjournal:rates:2013:09:03</tt> with a value of 1.22:


<pre     class="programlisting">
 1 for date, rate in elements:
 2
 3   # Create a date object out of string
 4   date = parse(date)
 5
 6   # Build a key for Redis and store the data under it
 7   key = REDIS_KEY_PATTERN.format(
 8       date.year, str(date.month).zfill(2), 
         &#8618;str(date.day).zfill(2))
 9   self.kvdb.conn.set(key, rate)
10
12   # Leave a trace of our activity
13   self.logger.info('Key %s set to %s', key, rate)
</pre>
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
linuxjournal.get-rate</b></span>
</p><p>
Now that a service for updating the cache is ready, the one to return the
data is so simple yet powerful that it can be reproduced in its entirety:


<pre     class="programlisting">
 1 class GetRate(Service):
 2 """ Returns the real long-term rate for a given date
 3 (defaults to today if no date is given).
 4 """
 5 class SimpleIO:
 6     input_optional = ('year', 'month', 'day')
 7     output_optional = ('rate',)
 8
 9 def handle(self):
10     # Get date needed either from input or current day
11     year, month, day = get_date(self.request.input)
12
13     # Build the key the data is cached under
14     key = REDIS_KEY_PATTERN.format(year, month, day)
15
16     # Assign the result from cache directly to response
17     self.response.payload.rate = self.kvdb.conn.get(key)
</pre>
</p><p>
A couple points to note:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
SimpleIO 
was used&mdash;this is a declarative syntax
for expressing simple documents
that can be serialized to JSON or XML in the current Zato version, with
more to come in future releases.
</p></li><li><p>
Nowhere in the service did you have to mention JSON, XML or even HTTP
at all. It's all working on a high
level of Python objects without specifying any output format or
transport method.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
This is the Zato way. It promotes reusability, which is valuable because
a generic and interesting service, such as returning interest rates,
is bound to be desirable in situations that cannot be predicted.
</p><p>
As an author of a service, you are not forced into committing to
a particular format. Those are configuration details that can be
taken care of through a variety of means, including a GUI that Zato
provides. A single service can be exposed simultaneously through
multiple access channels each using a different data format, security
definition or rate limit independently of any other.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x124c580.0x173eac8"></a>
Installing Services</h2></div></div><p>
There are several ways to install a service:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Hot-deployment from the command line.
</p></li><li><p>
Hot-deployment from the browser.
</p></li><li><p>
Adding it to services-sources.txt&mdash;you can specify a path to a
single module, to a Python package or a Python-dotted name by which to
import it. 
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Let's hot-deploy what you have so far from the command line, assuming a Zato
server is installed in /opt/zato/server1. You can do this using the
<tt  >cp</tt> command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ cp linuxjournal.py /opt/zato/server1/pickup-dir
$
</pre>
</p><p>
Now in the server log:


<pre     class="programlisting">
INFO - zato.hot-deploy.create:22 - Creating tar archive
INFO - zato.hot-deploy.create:22 - Uploaded package id:[21],
 &#8618;payload_name:[linuxjournal.py]
</pre>
</p><p>
Here's what just happened:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
The server to be deployed was stored in an SQL database, and each server from a cluster was notified of the deployment of new code.
</p></li><li><p>
Each server made a backup of currently deployed services and stored
it in the filesystem (by default, there's a circular log of the last 100
backups kept).
</p></li><li><p>
Each server imported the service and made it available for use.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
All those changes were introduced throughout the whole cluster with no
restarts and no reconfiguration.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x124c580.0x173f360"></a>
Using the GUI to Configure the Resources Needed</h2></div></div><p>
Zato's Web admin is a GUI that can be used to 
create server objects that services need quickly, check runtime statistics or
gather information needed for debugging purposes.
</p><p>
The Web admin is merely a client
(<a href="https://zato.io/docs/progguide/clients/python.html" target="_self">https://zato.io/docs/progguide/clients/python.html</a>) of
Zato's own API,
so everything it does also can be achieved from the command line
or by user-created clients making API calls.
</p><p>
On top of that, server-side objects can be managed &ldquo;en masse&rdquo;
(<a href="https://zato.io/docs/admin/guide/enmasse.html" target="_self">https://zato.io/docs/admin/guide/enmasse.html</a>) using a
JSON-based configuration that can be kept in a config repository for
versioning and diffing. This allows for interesting workflows, such as
creating a base configuration on a development environment and exporting
it to test environments where the new configuration can be merged into
an existing one, and later on, all that can be exported to production.
</p><p>
Figures 2&ndash;6 show the following configs:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Scheduler's job to invoke the service updating the cache.
</p></li><li><p>
Outgoing HTTP connection definitions for connecting to treasury.gov.
</p></li><li><p>
HTTP channels for each client&mdash;there is no requirement that each client
be given a separate channel but doing so allows one to assign different
security definitions to each channel without interfering with any other.
</p></li></ul></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11550f2.large.jpg"><img src="11550f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

Testing It</h2></div></div><p>
update-cache will be invoked by the scheduler, but Zato's CLI offers
the means to invoke any service from the command line, even if it's not mounted
on any channel, like this:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ zato service invoke /opt/zato/server1 linuxjournal.update-cache
 &#8618;--payload '{}'
(None)
$
</pre>
</p><p>
There was no output, because the service doesn't produce any. However,
when you check the logs you notice:

<pre     class="programlisting">
INFO - Key linuxjournal:rates:2013:09:03 set to 1.22
</pre>
</p><p>
Now you can invoke get-rate from the command line using curl with JSON, XML
and SOAP. The very same service exposed through three independent channels
will produce output in three formats, as shown below (output slightly reformatted
for clarity).
</p><p>
Output 1:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ curl localhost:17010/client1/get-rate -d 
 &#8618;'{"year":"2013","month":"09","day":"03"}' 
 &#8618;{"response": {"rate": "1.22"}}
$
</pre>
</p><p>
Output 2:


<pre     class="programlisting">

$ curl localhost:17010/client2/get-rate -d '
  &lt;request&gt;&lt;year&gt;2013&lt;/year&gt;&lt;month&gt;09&lt;/month&gt;&lt;day&gt;03&lt;/day&gt;&lt;/request&gt;'
&lt;response&gt;
 &lt;zato_env&gt;
  &lt;cid&gt;K295602460207582970321705053471448424629&lt;/cid&gt;
  &lt;result&gt;ZATO_OK&lt;/result&gt;
 &lt;/zato_env&gt;
 &lt;item&gt;
  &lt;rate&gt;1.22&lt;/rate&gt;
 &lt;/item&gt;
&lt;/response&gt;
$

</pre>
</p><p>
Output 3:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ curl localhost:17010/client3/get-rate \
    -H "SOAPAction:get-rates" -d '
  &lt;soapenv:Envelope xmlns:soapenv=

IRA Is the Key</h2></div></div><p>
IRA (Interesting, Reusable, Atomic) is the key you should always keep in mind
when designing services that are to be successful.
</p><p>
Both the services presented in the article meet the following criteria:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>I</em></span>: focus on providing data interesting to multiple parties.
</p></li><li><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>R</em></span>: can take part in many processes and be accessed through more than one
method.
</p></li><li><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>A</em></span>: focus on one job only and do it well.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
In this vein, Zato makes it easy for you to expose services over many
channels and to incorporate them into higher-level integration scenarios,
thereby increasing their overall attractiveness (I in IRA) to potential
client applications.
</p><p>
It may be helpful to think of a few ways not to design services:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Anti-I</b></span>: update-cache could be turned into
two smaller services. One
would fetch data and
store it in an SQL database; the other would grab it from SQL and put
it into Redis.
Even if such a design could be defended by some rationale, neither of
the pair of services would be interesting for external applications.
A third service wrapping these two should be created and exposed
to client apps, in the case of it being necessary for other systems
to update the cache. In other words, let's keep the implementation
details inside without exposing them to the whole world.
</p></li><li><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Anti-R</b></span>: hard-coding nontrivial parameters is almost always a poor
idea. The result being that a service cannot be driven by external
systems invoking it with a set of arguments.
For instance, creating a service that is limited to a specific year
only ensures its limited use outside the original project.
</p></li><li><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Anti-A</b></span>: returning a list of previous queries in response to a request
may be a
need of one particular client application, but contrary to the needs
of another. In cases when a composite service becomes necessary,
it should not be obliged upon each and every client.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Designing IRA services is like designing a good programming interface
that will be released as an open-source library and used in places that
can't be predicted initially.

Born Out of Practical Experience</h2></div></div><p>
Zato it not only about IRA but also about codifying common admin and
programming tasks that are of a practical nature:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Each config file is versioned automatically
(<a href="https://zato.io/docs/admin/guide/install-config/overview.html#config-files-are-versioned" target="_self">https://zato.io/docs/admin/guide/install-config/overview.html#config-files-are-versioned</a>)
and kept in a local bzr repository (<a href="http://bazaar-vcs.org" target="_self">bazaar-vcs.org</a>), so it's always possible
to revert to a safe state. This is completely transparent and needs
no configuration nor management.
</p></li><li><p>
A frequent requirement before integration projects are started,
particularly
if certain services already are available on the platform, is to provide
usage examples in the form of message requests and responses. Zato
lets you specify that one-in-<span   class="emphasis"><em>n</em></span> invocations of a service be stored
for a later use, precisely so that such requirements can be 
fulfilled by admins quickly.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Two popular questions asked regarding production are:
1) What are my slowest services? and
2) Which services are most commonly used?
To answer these, Zato provides statistics
(<a href="https://zato.io/docs/stats/guide.html" target="_self">https://zato.io/docs/stats/guide.html</a>)
that can be accessed via Web admin, CLI or API. Data can be compared over
arbitrary periods or exported to CSV as well.

Summary</h2></div></div><p>
Despite being a relatively new project, Zato is already a lightweight
yet complete solution that can be used in many integration and back-end
scenarios. Regardless of the project's underlying integration principles,
such as SOA or REST, the platform can be used to deliver scalable
architectures that are easy to use, maintain and extend.
