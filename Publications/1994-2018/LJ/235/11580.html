Regular readers of this column won't be surprised to hear that I love
both Ruby on Rails and PostgreSQL. Rails has been my primary
server-side Web development framework for about eight years, and it has
managed to provide solutions for a large number of consulting and
personal projects. As for PostgreSQL, I've been using it for about 15
years, and I continue to be amazed by the functionality it has
gained in that time. PostgreSQL is no longer just a relational
database. It's also a platform supporting the storage and retrieval of many
types of data, built on a rock-solid, ACID-compliant, transactional
core.
</p><p>
When I started to develop using Ruby on Rails, most of the other
developers (including the core Rails developers at 37Signals) were
using MySQL. As a result, Rails didn't offer any support for
PostgreSQL-specific features. Indeed, one of my favorite Rails
features always has been database migrations, which allow developers
to change a database schema incrementally. The downside of such
platform independence is that special features often are ignored,
and indeed, in order to serve the lowest common denominator, many of
PostgreSQL's features were ignored or relegated to third-party gems.
</p><p>
During the past few years, PostgreSQL has grown in popularity, both
overall and within the Rails community. This is partly due to the
large (and constantly growing) feature set that PostgreSQL provides.
However, I'm guessing that it also has to do with the fact that Oracle
now owns MySQL, along with the growth of the popular Heroku hosting
service. Whether Heroku is an appropriate choice for your application
is a decision that should be made on a case-by-case basis. However,
the fact that Heroku offers a free tier for tiny data sets, and that
it uses PostgreSQL by default, has made it a popular option for
people learning Rails, for small applications and for many people who
want to outsource their hosting.
</p><p>
As as result of PostgreSQL's growing popularity, the latest (4.x)
version of Ruby on Rails includes extensive, built-in support for many
PostgreSQL features. In this article, I introduce a number of
these features, both from the perspective of a Rails developer
and from that of a PostgreSQL administrator and DBA. Even if you
aren't a Rails or PostgreSQL user, I hope these examples will
give you a chance to think about how much you can and should expect
from your database, as opposed to handling it from within your
application.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc67580.0xd5f670"></a>
UUIDs as Primary Keys</h2></div></div><p>
One of the first things database developers learn is the need
for a primary key, a field that is guaranteed to be unique and
indexed, and that can be used to identify a complete record. That's
why many countries have ID numbers; using that number, government
agencies, banks and health-care systems quickly can pull up your
information. The usual standard for primary keys is an integer, which
can be defined in PostgreSQL using the SERIAL pseudo-type:

<pre     class="programlisting">
CREATE TABLE People (
    id     SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name   TEXT,
    email  TEXT
);
</pre>
</p><p>
When you use the SERIAL type in PostgreSQL, that actually creates a
&ldquo;sequence&rdquo; object, on which you can invoke the
&ldquo;nextval&rdquo; function.
That function is guaranteed to give you the next number in the
sequence. Although you can define it to have a step of more than one, or to
wrap around when it's done, the most usual case is to use a sequence
to increment an ID counter. When you ask PostgreSQL to show you how
this table is defined, you can see how the &ldquo;id&rdquo; field's definition has
been expanded:

<pre     class="programlisting">
\d people
                          Table "public.people"

+--------+---------+--------------------------------------------+
| Column |  Type   |                 Modifiers                  |
+--------+---------+--------------------------------------------+
| id     | integer | not null default 
                     &#8618;nextval('people_id_seq'::regclass) |
| name   | text    |       |
| email  | text    |       |

+--------+---------+--------------------------------------------+
Indexes:
    "people_pkey" PRIMARY KEY, btree (id)
</pre>
</p><p>
So, you can see that there's nothing special about the &ldquo;id&rdquo; column,
except that it has a default value. If you don't specify the value of
&ldquo;id&rdquo; in your INSERT statement, PostgreSQL will invoke nextval on
a sequence. In this way, you can be sure that the &ldquo;id&rdquo; column
always will
have a unique value.
</p><p>
But, what if you don't want to use integers? I've always been partial
to them, but it is common and popular to use UUIDs (universally unique
IDs). One of the advantages of UUIDs is that they are (more or less)
guaranteed to be unique across computers, allowing you to merge
records from multiple servers. If you were to do this with an integer
primary key, you might well have multiple records with an ID of 5 or
10. But with UUIDs, this is far less likely.
</p><p>
In theory, PostgreSQL always has supported the use of UUIDs as primary
keys. After all, you can just use a text field and have your
application generate and insert the UUIDs. But that puts the onus on
the application, which isn't really appropriate. A better solution is
to use PostgreSQL's uuid-ossp extension, which has shipped with the
last few versions of the database. In a modern version of PostgreSQL,
you can issue the SQL command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
CREATE EXTENSION "uuid-ossp";
</pre>
</p><p>
Note that you must use double quotes here, because there is a - character
in the identifier. Double quotes tell PostgreSQL to keep an
identifier precisely as you have written it (don't confuse this with
single quotes, which are used for text strings).
</p><p>
Also note that extensions are installed only in the database where you
issued the <tt  >CREATE EXTENSION</tt> command. Thus, if you add an extension to
the &ldquo;foo_development&rdquo; database, it won't be in the
&ldquo;foo_production&rdquo; database automatically. To ensure that an extension is present in
all databases, add it to &ldquo;template1&rdquo;, from which all new databases are
copied.
</p><p>
Once you have installed the extension successfully (which the database
will confirm by echoing your command, <tt  >CREATE
EXTENSION</tt>), you can use
it. Like many PostgreSQL extensions, uuid-ossp defines a new data
type and functions that know how to use it. For example, you now
can invoke the <tt  >uuid_generate_v1()</tt> function, getting back data of type
&ldquo;uuid&rdquo;:

<pre     class="programlisting">
select uuid_generate_v1();
+--------------------------------------+
|           uuid_generate_v1           |
+--------------------------------------+
| 6167603c-276b-11e3-b71f-28cfe91f81e7 |
+--------------------------------------+
(1 row)
</pre>
</p><p>
If you want to use a UUID as your primary key, you can redefine the table
as follows:


<pre     class="programlisting">
CREATE TABLE People (
    id UUID NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v1(),
    name TEXT,
    email TEXT
);
</pre>
</p><p>
As you can see, here you have replaced the SERIAL type with a UUID type
(defined by the extension) and have instructed PostgreSQL to invoke
the UUID-generating function when no UUID value is provided. If you
insert a row into this table, you'll see that the UUID is indeed
generated:


<pre     class="programlisting">
INSERT INTO People (name, email)
VALUES ('Reuven', 'reuven@lerner.co.il');

SELECT * FROM People;
+--------------------------------------+--------+---------------------+
|                  id                  |  name  |        email        |
+--------------------------------------+--------+---------------------+
| 9fc82492-276b-11e3-a814-28cfe91f81e7 | Reuven | reuven@lerner.co.il |
+--------------------------------------+--------+---------------------+
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, all if this is great if you're working directly at the database
level. But Rails migrations are supposed to provide a layer
of abstraction, allowing you to specify your database changes via Ruby
method calls. Starting in Rails 4, that's possible. I can create a
new Rails application with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
rails new pgfun -d postgresql
</pre>
</p><p>
This will create a new &ldquo;pgfun&rdquo; Rails app, using PostgreSQL as the
back-end database. I then create an appropriate database user at the
command line (giving that user superuser privileges on the database in
question):

<pre     class="programlisting">
createuser -U postgres -s pgfun
</pre>
</p><p>
I then create the development database:

<pre     class="programlisting">
createdb -U pgfun pgfun_development
</pre>
</p><p>
Now you're now ready to create your first migration. I use the
built-in Rails scaffold mechanism here, which will create a migration (as
well as controllers, models and views) for me:

<pre     class="programlisting">
rails g scaffold person name:text email:text
</pre>
</p><p>
Notice that I haven't specified a primary key column. That's because
Rails normally assumes there will be a numeric column named
&ldquo;id&rdquo;,
which will contain the primary key. However, you're going to change
that by opening up the migration file that was created in
db/migrations. By default, the migration looks like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">

class CreatePeople &lt; ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
    create_table :people do |t|
      t.text :name
      t.text :email

      t.timestamps
    end
  end
end

</pre>
</p><p>
By passing an additional parameter to <tt  >create_table</tt> (before the block,
in the first line), you can indicate that you want the primary key to be
a UUID:

<pre     class="programlisting">

class CreatePeople &lt; ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
    create_table :people, id: :uuid do |t|
      t.text :name
      t.text :email

      t.timestamps
    end
  end
end

</pre>
</p><p>
With that in place, your primary key still will be called &ldquo;id&rdquo;, but
it will be of type UUID. You can run the migration to be sure with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
bundle exec rake db:migrate
</pre>
</p><p>
Sure enough, the table has been defined as you might like:


<pre     class="programlisting">
\d people
                              Table "public.people"

+------------+-----------------------------+--------------------------+
|   Column   |            Type             |         Modifiers        |
+------------+-----------------------------+--------------------------+
| id         | uuid                        | not null default 
                                             &#8618;uuid_generate_v4() |
| name       | text                        |               |
| email      | text                        |               |
| created_at | timestamp without time zone |               |
| updated_at | timestamp without time zone |               |

+------------+-----------------------------+--------------------------+
Indexes:
    "people_pkey" PRIMARY KEY, btree (id)
</pre>
</p><p>
If you look carefully, however, you'll see there's a difference
between the default that the Rails migration generated and the one
generated by hand earlier. The difference is in the function
that is being used to generate a UUID&mdash;in the manual version, you
generated a &ldquo;version 1&rdquo; UUID, based on the MAC address of the computer
that created it. Rails, by contrast, uses the &ldquo;version 4&rdquo; UUID
algorithm, which is completely random. The advantage of the v4 UUID
is that the number is more random, thus reducing the chance that
someone can guess it. However, because the data is random, it'll be
slower for PostgreSQL to index it. If you want to tell Rails to use
the v1 function, add a line to the migration:


<pre     class="programlisting">

class CreatePeople &lt; ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
    create_table :people, id: false do |t|
      t.primary_key :id, :uuid, default: 'uuid_generate_v1()'
      t.text :name
      t.text :email

      t.timestamps
    end
  end
end

</pre>
</p><p>
Note that if you want to run the modified migration, it's probably
easiest and best just to drop and re-create the &ldquo;people&rdquo; and
&ldquo;schema_migrations&rdquo; tables. Rails remembers which migrations 
already have been applied, and it won't re-run one, even if you have modified
the file:


<pre     class="programlisting">
\d people
                              Table "public.people"

+------------+-----------------------------+--------------------------+
|   Column   |            Type             |              Modifiers   |
+------------+-----------------------------+--------------------------+
| id         | uuid                        | not null default
                                              &#8618;uuid_generate_v1() |
| name       | text                        |               |
| email      | text                        |               |
| created_at | timestamp without time zone |               |
| updated_at | timestamp without time zone |               |
+------------+-----------------------------+--------------------------+
Indexes:
    "people_pkey" PRIMARY KEY, btree (id)
</pre>
</p><p>
With this default in place, your &ldquo;people&rdquo; table now will use UUIDs.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc67580.0xd576b8"></a>
Arrays</h2></div></div><p>
Arrays are another PostgreSQL feature that is now supported natively
by Rails. PostgreSQL has supported arrays for a number of years, and
although I personally find the syntax to be a bit difficult to deal with,
there's no doubt that arrays can simplify some database designs. (I
should note, however, that arrays should be a last resort, because they
tend to result in a non-normalized database design, potentially
leading to unnecessary duplication of data.) For example, if I want
to create a &ldquo;posts&rdquo; table for my blog and then allow people to store
one or more social tags, I could define it as:


<pre     class="programlisting">
create table posts (
    id       UUID NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v1(),
    headline TEXT,
    body     TEXT,
    tags     TEXT[]
);
</pre>
</p><p>
Notice the data type associated with the &ldquo;tags&rdquo; column. By using
square brackets after the <tt  >TEXT</tt> type, I've indicated that the column
can contain zero or more text strings. For example:


<pre     class="programlisting">
INSERT INTO Posts (headline, body, tags)
VALUES ('my headline', 'my body', '{general, testing}');
</pre>
</p><p>
Notice that the array value is inserted as a string, the first and
final characters of which are curly braces. Now you can get
information from the array as follows using square brackets,
remembering that unlike many languages, PostgreSQL indexes arrays
starting with 1:

<pre     class="programlisting">
SELECT headline, body, tags[1], tags[2] FROM Posts;
+-------------+---------+---------+---------+
|  headline   |  body   |  tags   |  tags   |
+-------------+---------+---------+---------+
| my headline | my body | general | testing |
+-------------+---------+---------+---------+
(1 row)
</pre>
</p><p>
Notice how you can retrieve each of the tag elements separately by
using their index. If you try to use an index for which there is no
value, you get a NULL instead. You also can use the
<tt  >ANY</tt> operator to
find rows in which a particular tag value is assigned:


<pre     class="programlisting">
select headline, body, tags from posts where 'general' = ANY(tags);
+-------------+---------+-------------------+
|  headline   |  body   |       tags        |
+-------------+---------+-------------------+
| my headline | my body | {general,testing} |
+-------------+---------+-------------------+
</pre>
</p><p>
Note that the <tt  >ANY</tt> operator must be on the right-hand side of the
comparison. Otherwise, you'll get a syntax error from PostgreSQL.
</p><p>
There was little or no support for PostgreSQL arrays in earlier
versions of Ruby on Rails. But starting with Rails 4, there is
support for such functionality. You not only can define a column to
contain an array, but you also can use ActiveRecord to manipulate it.
First and foremost, let's create a scaffold for the resource:


<pre     class="programlisting">
rails g scaffold post headline:text body:text tags:string
</pre>
</p><p>
This generates the necessary files. Don't run the migration just
yet, however; you first need to turn &ldquo;tags&rdquo; from a string into an array
of strings and your ID into a UUID:


<pre     class="programlisting">

class CreatePosts &lt; ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
    create_table :posts, id: false do |t|
      t.primary_key :id, :uuid, default: 'uuid_generate_v1()'
      t.text :headline
      t.text :body
      t.string :tags, array:true, default:[]

      t.timestamps
    end
  end
end

</pre>
</p><p>
Now you will have a UUID for a primary key, but you also will define
tags to be an array. After running the migration, this is what you'll
see:


<pre     class="programlisting">
\d posts
                               Table "public.posts"

+------------+-----------------------------+--------------------------+
|   Column   |            Type             |          Modifiers       |
+------------+-----------------------------+--------------------------+
| id         | uuid                        | not null default
                                             &#8618;uuid_generate_v1() |
| headline   | text                        |               |
| body       | text                        |               |
| tags       | character varying(255)[]    | default '{}'::character
                                             &#8618;varying[]   |
| created_at | timestamp without time zone |               |
| updated_at | timestamp without time zone |               |
+------------+-----------------------------+--------------------------+
Indexes:
    "posts_pkey" PRIMARY KEY, btree (id)
</pre>
</p><p>
From a database perspective, things seem great; you can
perform an INSERT:


<pre     class="programlisting">
INSERT INTO Posts (headline, body, tags, created_at, updated_at)
VALUES ('my headline', 'my body', '{general, testing}', now(), now());
</pre>
</p><p>
Sure enough, you can see the post in the database. The magic, however, is
that ActiveRecord allows you to treat the PostgreSQL array as if it
were a Ruby array. For example, you can say:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Post.first.tags.each {|t| puts t}
</pre>
</p><p>
This tells Rails to ask ActiveRecord for the first record in the Posts
table and to call up its &ldquo;tags&rdquo; column, which is returned as a
Ruby array of strings. You then can iterate over those strings,
printing them (or otherwise manipulating them). Although this isn't very
efficient or smart, you also can do the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Post.all.select {|p| p.tags.member?('foo')}
</pre>
</p><p>
A more efficient way to do this would be to use the
<tt  >ANY</tt> operator that
you saw earlier, passed to PostgreSQL in a string:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Post.where("'general' = ANY(tags)").first
</pre>
</p><p>
Unfortunately, it doesn't seem that you can add elements to a
PostgreSQL array using the standard Ruby &lt;&lt; (append) operator.
Rather, if you want to add one or more elements to an array via
ActiveRecord, you must do so manually:


<pre     class="programlisting">
p.update_attributes(tags: ['general', 'testing', 'zzz'])
</pre>
</p><p>
This is somewhat annoying, but not fatal, particularly not for the
first version where this functionality is included.

Summary</h2></div></div><p>
Rails 4, although not breaking compatibility with its predecessors nearly
as much as Rails 3, does introduce a great deal of new functionality.
For me, one of the most interesting areas of this functionality is a
shift toward PostgreSQL, with ActiveRecord migrations and
functionality abandoning some of its platform independence. In this
article, I showed two of the features that are now available, namely
UUIDs and arrays. However, there are additional features, such as
native support for INET (that is, IP address) data types, for JSON (which
PostgreSQL 9.3 supports even better than it did in the past), ranges
and even for hstore, a NoSQL-like storage system built on top of
PostgreSQL.
</p><p>
No technology, including PostgreSQL, is the right answer for everyone
at all times. However, in my experience, PostgreSQL offers excellent
performance, features and stability, with a fantastic community that
answers questions and strives for correctness. The fact that Rails 4
has embraced many of these features is likely to expose even more
people to PostgreSQL, which can only be good for Web and database
developers who use open-source products.

The PostgreSQL home page is at <a href="http://postgresql.org" target="_self">postgresql.org</a>. From that site,
you can download the software, read documentation and subscribe to
e-mail lists. The latest version, 9.3, includes a large number of
goodies that should excite many developers.

Ruby on Rails, in version 4.0.0 at the time of this writing, is
available at <a href="http://rubyonrails.org" target="_self">rubyonrails.org</a>. You likely will want to use
Ruby version 2.0, although version 1.9.3 is known to work with Rails
4. You also will want to include the &ldquo;pg&rdquo; Ruby gem, which connects to
PostgreSQL. Excellent documentation on Rails is available in the
&ldquo;Guides&rdquo; series at <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org" target="_self">guides.rubyonrails.org</a>.
