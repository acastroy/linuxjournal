Article on the Command Line</h4><p>
Regarding Janos Gyerik's article &ldquo;Time-Saving Command-Line
Tricks&rdquo; in the September 2013 issue: what a let down&mdash;simple,
not especially useful tips that largely
missed the point. For instance, the author assumes vim as the editor
of default. A good choice, but if you know vi, then <tt  >set -o
vi</tt> in bash is
far superior than using the default. Then editing a config file:
<tt  >set aw</tt>
in vim, then from within vi run <tt  >:!command</tt> to start
the service. It's much
better than starting a new window. Did I write the file in the other
window? Who cares? <tt  >set aw</tt> does it for you. 
</p><p>
I'm afraid the rest of the
article was just not especially useful either. How about the whole
writing a script with vi and <tt  >set aw</tt>? No need for the save, exit, run, fail,
re-open editor cycle. Pah! UNIX is God's gift, and the command line
is fantastic, but this was no exposition of that.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Graham Nicholls  <br><br>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Janos Gyerik replies:</b></span>
I'm glad that you already master this stuff. I wrote the article because
too often I see folks not using half of these moves. It's not fun to
watch them crawl when they could fly. As for vim, I didn't assume
anything. If you look closely, the focus there is on the screen
utility and how it lets you juggle multiple different activities.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Graham Nicholls replies again:</b></span>
</p><p>
You've entirely missed my point. These tips are okay, but nothing special,
and in some cases, they are just plain wrong. In fact, having assumed the
use of vi(m), which you have (your mention that less works like vi,
for instance), <tt  >set -o vi</tt> at the bash prompt is infinitely more powerful
than using the default Ctrl-r and so on. You make the point that less is
somewhat vim-like, but you miss that the shell can be also. I think you're
selling people short by offering something that is less than optimal.
I'm sure screen is very useful, but having a decent tabbed terminal
emulator (konsole, for example in X; mremote or poderosa in the Windows
environment) renders it somewhat irrelevant to me. 
</p><p>
As a UNIX user of &gt;25 years, yes, I have mastered this stuff, but I also teach for a
large international training organisation (in addition to my day job).
In that role, I urge my students that if they expect to use UNIX (read
Linux) every day, learning vi is a good idea. Then I show them
the power of <tt  >set -o vi</tt> (at the bash prompt), which leverages the power
of vi in command-line editing. Finally, I show them how using vi with
autowrite switched on makes writing (for instance) scripts or config
files very easy. 
</p><p>
Suggesting that people have multiple screens open
and write the file in vim on one and then restart the d&aelig;mon in another is
just plain bad. Rather, show them how in vi they can run a shell escape,
which with autowrite switched on, will write the file first, then call
the shell-escaped command. No more &ldquo;did I save the file in the other
session?&rdquo; nonsense. No more &ldquo;how do I get back to the session where
I was editing the file&rdquo; either. In my experience, and opinion, your
method will lead to errors and misunderstandings. Restart the d&aelig;mon
without saving the file = confusion. 
</p><p>
Another advantage that vim has
in this instance is that you get a history of shell escapes that you
can edit, using vi, from within the file&mdash;now
<span   class="emphasis"><em>that's</em></span> how to write
a config file. Using screen by comparison is like using a slide rule
for computing advanced calculus. It's perfectly possible, but why would you?
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Janos Gyerik replies again:</b></span>
To you, maybe, the tips are nothing special. Believe it or not, I see
many seasoned Linux users not using these moves. Using Ctrl-r is a great
improvement over pushing the up arrow 20 times. Using Ctrl-a is a great
improvement over using the left arrow to get the cursor all the way to
the start. And using screen on a remote server is a great improvement
over opening two terminal tabs to the same remote server. You gotta give
me that.
</p><p>
I did not assume that readers use vim. The text talks about editing a
configuration file, and then in the example command, I used vim. Replace it
with your favorite editor, and the text still makes sense. I mention vim a
second time later to highlight the similarities with the shortcuts in the
less command. That's just a small remark&mdash;not knowing vim is no
disadvantage for the reader. Vim was not the message of the article.
Replace it with pico, nano or emacs, and the message still will be the same.
</p><p>
You say that <tt  >set -o vi</tt> is &ldquo;infinitely more
powerful&rdquo; than the tricks I
highlight. Sure, and C is infinitely more powerful than bash, isn't it? But
sometimes a bigger gun is neither the most practical nor the most
ergonomic. Vim is my favorite editor, and I love to be efficient on the
command line, but <tt  >set -o vi</tt> is not practical for me.
I think <tt  >set -o vi</tt> is
too advanced for the vast majority of Linux users of all levels.
</p><p>
Regarding screen, note that I emphasized using it specifically when working
on remote servers. Search for the term &ldquo;remote&rdquo; through the
article, and you
will see. If you take a look at the last paragraph about screen, I
explicitly discouraged using it locally, and recommended tabbed terminal
emulators instead.
</p><p>
You talk a lot about editing config files and restarting d&aelig;mons, but that's
missing the point. Those were example activities you might do on a remote
server. The point is doing many things at the same time. Read a man page in
one window. Tail a log file in another. Compile source code in a third. Run
a debugger in a fourth, and so on. You could replace the editing config and
restarting d&aelig;mon examples with these or other activities, and the article
still makes sense. What you do in the examples was not the point. The point
was that you can do many things.

DDOS&mdash;Sendmail in Script</h4><p>
To Dave Taylor, regarding his article &ldquo;Web Administration
Scripts&mdash;Redux&rdquo; in the September 2013 issue: just wondering,
you say that <tt  >-s</tt> for subjects is not supported by the
sendmail client, but you can, of course, create a text-template-email where
you can support all the (data-part smtp) headers you want, including
a subject. When your instance of the template is ready, just feed it
through a pipe to sendmail, and you've got everything you want, right?
</p><p>
Or, it is always possible I'm not understanding what you're doing, of
course, in which case I'd ask you to discard this.
</p><p>
I appreciate your monthly article, Dave. Keep it up.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Lieven   <br><br>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Dave Taylor replies:</b></span> 
You're absolutely correct! Indeed, it'd be easy to have something
like &ldquo;sendmails&rdquo; that simply accepted two arguments, $1 as the
recipient and $2 as the subject:

<pre     class="programlisting">
( 
echo "To: $1"
echo "Subject: $2"
echo ""
cat - ) | sendmail 
</pre>
</p><p>
Then, you'd invoke it as:


<pre     class="programlisting">
sendmails lievendp@gmail.com "this is a sample sendmail wrapper"
</pre>
</p><p>
Is it elegant? Nah. But it'd work.
</p><p>
Thanks for your e-mail and for reading my column!

Reading Suggestions for Jeff Regan</h4><p>
In the September 2013 issue's Letters, reader Jeff Regan laments reading
<span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> on a
tablet. He is right; tablets are terrible for reading. I highly recommend
the B&amp;N Nook Simpletouch or other E Ink device for reading. I have rooted
mine (Android 2.1, which is enough to use Anki, read PDFs and do light Web
browsing), and it has redefined the way I read. I cannot recommend it
highly enough.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Dotan Cohen  <br><br>
</p><p>
My last magazine-worthy tablet was an original Kindle DX, and although it
made large format files readable, its speed (or lack thereof) made it
frustrating. I'm guessing newer devices have better refresh rates and
cleaner displays. I'd still miss the color though. Color E Ink, please
come quickly!&mdash;Shawn Powers

Coarse Language</h4><p>
The language in the title of Doc Searls' article summary on Linux is
entirely inappropriate [see Doc's &ldquo;Linux vs. Bullshit&rdquo; in the
September 2013 issue]. Each of our acts moves standards and behaviour up
or down. This moves things down.
</p><p>
Not good.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Bryan Batten  <br><br>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Doc Searls replies:</b></span> My main source for the
column was <span   class="emphasis"><em>On Bullshit</em></span>, an
academic work by Harry Frankfurt, a professor emeritus of philosophy at
Princeton. It is, as far as I know, the only deep investigation of a
vernacular English word that carries a high degree of meaning and for
which there is no synonym. That it's also vulgar does not give us cause to
avoid it. Could be that understanding it better might help us create a
true synonym that isn't vulgar.
</p><p>
I believe Linux is also vernacular (though hardly vulgar) and visited this
possibility in a column titled &ldquo;The New Vernacular&rdquo; in 2001
(<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/4553" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/4553</a>).

Renewed Subscription</h4><p>
After many years of reading the paper version of <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>, I sadly had to let my
subscription lapse when you went all electronic. It simply didn't fit with
where the magazine went&mdash;for example, in the car, by the pool, cricket pitch and
various others places whilst waiting for numerous kids to finish whatever they
were doing. Although I had access to computers, none were portable enough
for this use, and I couldn't justify the cost of another one. Yesterday, my
new Nook arrived for &pound;79 delivered&mdash;bargain.
</p><p>
But you never forgot me, sending me regular e-mail messages and inviting me
back, so
last night, I downloaded the free version and found all my favourite
authors still there to entertain and inform us. I renewed immediately, of
course.
Thank you, and all the best for the future.

September Letter &ldquo;Electronic vs. Paper&rdquo;</h4><p>
First, I am glad I renewed my subscription to <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>. I
was a longish-time
paper magazine subscriber. I do have some sympathy with those who would
prefer a paper copy, but the copies on my hard drive do take up less room.
</p><p>
Anyway on to business&mdash;I am a member of the Radio Society of Great
Britain (RSGB), which runs an excellent Web site full of useful news
and radio-amateur-centric information, which practice, I believe,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span> has copied successfully. However, the RSGB also brings out
in the autumn (for Christmas) a &ldquo;Year Book&rdquo; that repeats much of the
technical specifications found on the Web site plus relevant articles
on things radio, such as the advantages of building receiver type X over
receiver type Y and so on.
</p><p>
I just wanted to add this to any thoughts <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> may have in this direction.
I certainly look at my copy a number of times in the year, as it is just
so much more convenient and quicker than using the desktop. I know you
do an archive CD, but a book makes a better present.

Reuven M. Lerner's Column on the Historical Web</h4><p>
To Reuven M. Lerner:
I really enjoy reading your column in <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span>. It is one of the
columns that I can say, &ldquo;he knows what he is talking about.&rdquo;
</p><p>
However, in the September 2013 issue, when you look back over Web development history, you
didn't mention any Microsoft technologies. I am not affiliated with the
company, and I know it's not the magazine's main target, but for a historical
column, I think Microsoft deserves to be mentioned. With its Web-develop NET
frameworks, it evolved and diverged from the company's vision and become
more and more open source. It's still investing on the cloud with
Azure, and I think it actually moved the bar up for every technology
provider.
</p><p>
Regardless, I enjoy your column. I think it would have been a lot nicer if
you were more objective like a historian.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Can   <br><br>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Reuven M. Lerner replies:</b></span>
Thanks for your message.
I often tell people that there are open-source people who hate Microsoft,
and then I explain that I'm not one of them. Rather, I say I'm an
open-source person who more or less ignores Microsoft&mdash;that I know
it's a major (indeed, dominant) force in the computer industry, but that
it doesn't directly affect my day-to-day life, and that I'm rather ignorant
about its technologies.
</p><p>
There are oodles of smart people working at Microsoft, and they have
clearly done a lot to advance Web technologies. But I must admit that I
know nothing, or almost nothing, about those technologies.
</p><p>
So for me to have written about Microsoft technologies would have
undoubtedly demonstrated my ignorance, and/or required research that I
don't have time to do. That said, I completely accept what you're saying,
and I probably should have noted that the column was based on my personal
experience, and the technologies I personally used&mdash;meaning that I
undoubtedly left out a lot of influential and important ones.
</p><p>
It's always great to hear from people who read my columns, even when you're
being critical. Thanks again for writing, and always feel free to let me
know what you think, or if you have any suggestions for future topics.

Dave Taylor's DDOS</h4><p>
I'm wondering if Dave Taylor has tried ModSecurity to fight his DDOS [see
Dave's column in the August and September 2013 issues]. I'm
evaluating it for my own use, and it seems like it could help. If the
attacker is placing something unusual in the HTTP headers, like a special
user-agent string, ModSecurity can be used to drop the connection before
the request is processed.
</p><p>
There is a reasonably good e-book about it at <a href="http://www.packtpub.com" target="_self">www.packtpub.com</a>.

Work the Shell Idea</h4><p>
As a blogger who deals with climate and weather, sometimes I like to know
right away if a major sudden event is happening, such as a tsunami. The
National Weather Service has a tsunami alert system (@NWS_WCATWC) on
Twitter. Whenever there is an earthquake, and there is no tsunami expected,
they tweet something that includes &ldquo;Tsunami NOT expected&rdquo;, but when there is
a tsunami expected, they tweet a different string (along with info on the
event).
</p><p>
I would like to see a script that regularly checks Twitter (as a chron job)
for reliable sources (such as the NWS specialized feeds and so on) for certain
key phrases, and if there is an event indicated, then to search Twitter for
an appropriate hashtag (such as #tsunami and #[place it is happening]). The
script then should send me an alert of some kind, so I can look at the list
of tweets to figure out what is going on.
</p><p>
This is a little like the DDOS script, because if you just search for
#tsunami on Twitter, there would be mostly junk most of the time, but when
there is an official alert, the #tsunami hash tag would include a lot of
actually useful information.
</p><p>
A new script by Dave that uses the current Twitter API would be useful, as
that changes now and then, and a script that includes parsing a select
Twitter feed, responding to that feed by then parsing other feeds, would be
intelligent(ish) and a great demonstration of how to use a remarkable
20th-century technology (bash, Linux) to solve a problem in a very 21st-century
way.
