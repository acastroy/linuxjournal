    Small computers, especially those with little memory,
    don't run the X Window System&mdash;or any other graphic
    environment&mdash;very smoothly. An intelligent keyboard
    configuration and use of the gpm mouse server
    will help you exploit your small Linux box to its fullest.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14c1580.0x15b9558"></a></h2></div></div><p>If your system doesn't run X-Windows, you
may miss the mouse support that makes interactive programs so easy
to use. <span   class="bold"><b>gpm</b></span>, the general purpose
mouse server, is designed with you in mind. Instead of having a
multitude of mouse drivers, several from each mouse vendor, some
that work well, others that don't, you can run gpm, which can talk
to all mice, and works quite well. This article explains how to set
up gpm to work with your mouse and programs, and also explains how
to set up your text console to work the best for you.
</p><p>The gpm program is derived from the older
<span   class="bold"><b>selection</b></span> program, which was
solely for cut-and-paste on the Linux console. gpm acts like
<span   class="bold"><b>selection</b></span> until a client requests
mouse events. Because gpm manages each console as an independent
entity, you can use your multi-console text screen like a
multi-window graphic environment. This article refers to
<b  >gpm-1.0</b>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14c1580.0x15b9818"></a>Configuring the Mouse Device</h2></div></div><p>One major problem with Linux is hardware compatibility, and
the mouse is no exception. Companies are always releasing new mice,
and each of them provides a different mouse driver for DOS. Linux
users are left alone with their device and no driver. Fortunately,
companies tend to converge on a few &ldquo;standard&rdquo; protocols, which
are supported by both XFree86 and gpm. Moreover, the gpm package
includes <span   class="bold"><b>gpm-test</b></span>, which can help
in detecting your own mouse port and protocol, and which suggests
which command-line options you should use to invoke the
daemon.</p><p>You must provide the protocol name and options to gpm on the
command line, together with your own preferences. These will affect
all mouse response until the server dies. One preference allows
button reordering: left-handed people can reorder the buttons by
using the command line option <b  >-B 321</b>, and owners
of two-button devices can use <b  >-B 132</b> to use the
right button as if it were the middle one, a useful way to paste
the cut-buffer in Emacs without modifying Emacs itself. The current
version of the gpm server duplicates the functionality of both
<span   class="bold"><b>mconv2</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>MultiMouse</b></span>, and can act as a
&ldquo;repeater&rdquo;. You can merge the events from two different devices
and pass them along to the X server. This is useful if you use a
laptop with both an internal pointer and an external mouse. If
you'd like to use one mouse in each hand but keep the internal
trackball active, however, gpm can't help you&mdash;no more than two
mouse devices can be read at a time.</p><p>The &ldquo;repeater&rdquo; option is automatically enabled if you read
two mice, but can be triggered independently; if you use gpm as a
repeater, the X server can be configured to read
<b  >/dev/gpmdata</b>, a fifo named pipe, where gpm puts
mouse packets received while the console is in graphic mode. This
option is meant to be used by owners of busmice who want to
multiplex text-only and X operation without killing and restarting
the daemon. Owners of new dual-mode mice, which run the
three-button protocol only if the middle button is kept down at
mouse initialization, will enjoy it as well, because the device is
initialized only at boot time.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14c1580.0x15b9be0"></a>How Does gpm Work?</h2></div></div><p>The core of the gpm daemon is currently built around the
<b  >select()</b>system call and the process runs in the
user space of the systems memory. The main loop of the daemon
listens to a Unix-domain socket and to the mouse, and uses them in
conjunction to multiplex event retrieval and management of new
clients. The main loop of gpm can be (and has been) used to build a
concurrent daemon for network services by modifying just a few
details.</p><p>The choice of a user-space server for the mouse was
originally meant to help owners of low-end boxes&mdash;the process
could be swapped out when not in use and thus save a little
precious memory. Unfortunately, when you use Emacs, a perceptible
delay in delivery of mouse events can severely degrade performance,
and combined use of mouse and keyboard is completely unreasonable
on a slightly loaded machine.</p><p>The swap-in delay can be removed by locking the process in
memory, but in the case of Emacs two processes should be locked in
memory. The goal for <b  >gpm-2.0</b>, which will
supersede the current version, is to provide the choice between a
user process and a kernel module. The advantage of running a kernel
module is mainly fewer context-switches (and no swap-in delay
whatsoever), while the main disadvantage is the waste of memory.
The module alternative will offer the same interface to client
applications, but will use a device node instead of a
socket.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14c1580.0x15b9e48"></a>Configuring the Keyboard</h2></div></div><p>The Linux keyboard is fully customizable (could you doubt
it?) and can be tailored for smart text-only usage. The idea is to
reduce context-switch time to get more performance out of your
multitasking brain. This is the basic idea behind virtual
consoles.</p><p>Here are some suggestions for improving your keyboard. I will
describe some of the useful changes to make, and then give the
appropriate lines for the <span   class="bold"><b>loadkeys</b></span>
program to effect the change.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><b  >Caps_Lock</b>: Why have a &ldquo;Caps
Lock&rdquo; key near the &ldquo;a&rdquo; key? When caps lock was useful to write
silly BASIC programs they put it far from alphabetic keys; now that
it is not so useful, they turned it to a trap for your little
finger. Just get rid of it and turn it into a
<b  >Control</b> key.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
alt-CapsLock will still yield CapsLock
keycode 58 = Control
control keycode 58 = Control
</pre></li><li><p><b  >Control</b>: The
<b  >Control</b> key on the bottom-left corner is a
duplicate of the one we put by the &ldquo;a&rdquo;. You can turn it into
<b  >Last_Console</b> and thus have a fast
editor/compiler context switch. Moreover, this makes your wrist
useful in typing. <b  >Last_Console</b> switches to the
previous console you visited, and is one of the several exotic
capabilities of the Linux keyboard.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
keycode 29 = Last_Console
</pre></li><li><p>The Numeric Keypad Unless you're used to desktop
calculators, the numeric keypad is too far in the right to be
useful in typing digits, and can be turned to a console-switch
scratchpad: hitting Alt-F8 takes a whole hand, and Alt-F1 isn't
easy, either, at least on keyboards with the function keys at the
top. Similarly, X-Windows users can configure the keypad as a map
to their virtual desktop, provided that the
<b  >Num_Lock</b> key is left alone:
<span   class="bold"><b>xmodmap</b></span> can't differentiate a
non-<b  >Num_Lock</b>ed keypad from the arrow keys. The
&ldquo;0&rdquo; key then is suitable to be another
<b  >Last_Console</b>, useful if you didn't get rid of
<b  >Caps_Lock</b>.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
keycode  29 = Last_Console # KP_0
keycode  79 = Console_1    # KP_1

</pre></li><li><p>Home and End It can be useful to configure
<b  >Home</b> as <b  >Control</b>
-<b  >a</b> and <b  >End</b> as
<b  >Control</b>-<b  >e</b>. This works with
<span   class="bold"><b>bash</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>tcsh</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>Emacs</b></span>, without any other fiddling.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
keycode 102 = Control_a
keycode 107 = Control_e
</pre></li><li><p><b  >Escape</b>: If you are used to
Sparc2s, old PCs, or the old faithful Apple II you'll enjoy putting
the <b  >Esc</b> key near the &ldquo;1&rdquo;. This change forces
you to reposition the backtick/tilde pair as well. The exact change
made here may not work on your keyboard, you'd better check your
keycodes with <span   class="bold"><b>showkeys</b></span>.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
keycode  41 = Escape  # Escape
alt     keycode   1 = Meta_Escape

keycode  43 = grave   # asciitilde
control keycode  41 = nul
alt     keycode  41 = Meta_grave
</pre></li><li><p>Backslash: The backslash/bar pair should be near
&ldquo;Z&rdquo;, where the default keyboard configuration puts a duplicate of
less/greater.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
keycode  86 = backslash        bar
control keycode  43 = Control_backslash
alt     keycode  43 = Meta_backslash
</pre></li></ul></div><p>The modifications listed above work with my keyboard. Check
your actual keycodes using
<span   class="bold"><b>showkeys</b></span> before applying these
changes. <span   class="bold"><b>showkeys</b></span> is part of the
<b  >kbd</b> package. If you're a real typist, you can
make something really useful out of the twelve function keys. Read
the <span   class="bold"><b>keytables</b></span>(5) man page to probe
further. For more information on how to modify the keyboard, see
Kernel Korner in <i  >Linux Journal</i> #14.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14c1580.0x15b1910"></a>Spawning New Consoles</h2></div></div><p>&ldquo;Why should I use the numeric keypad to switch between 15
consoles when I only have 6?&rdquo; I hear you say. Linux can handle a s
many as 63 virtual console, and 6 (or whatever else) is only the
number of &ldquo;login prompts&rdquo; configured in your system. Actually,
consoles are dynamically created and destroyed during your system's
lifetime.</p><p>The different <b  >login:</b> prompts are spawned
by the <span   class="bold"><b>init</b></span> process, which knows
what to do by reading the file /etc/inittab; this very file
specifies where <span   class="bold"><b>getty</b></span> should be
invoked. You can play with inittab even if you don't completely
understand it: to open more (or fewer) than 6 consoles for login,
you can simply duplicate (or remove) lines. You must be careful,
however, about the first field in the line&mdash;it is a unique &ldquo;key&rdquo;
for the line, and it must be exactly two letters long.</p><p>My choice for console login sessions above 9 is
<b  >cA</b>, <b  >cB</b> and so on, with the
first nine entries <b  >c1</b> through
<b  >c9</b>.</p><p>A more interesting, and memory-saving, approach to your Linux
session is to spawn only one or two gettys using /etc/inittab, and
dynamically allocate other as you need them. There are a number of
ways to spawn a new console:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>gpm-root: This tool can spawn a new getty on the
lowest-numbered free console in your system: just press
control-mouse to wake the program, then press the mouse button
again on the correct menu entry, and you will soon be presented
with a newly-created <b  >login:</b> prompt&mdash;it's that
easy. When you log out from that console, everything is cleaned up
automatically. This way of spawning consoles has the advantage that
the /etc/utmp file is kept up to date, and thus the
<span   class="bold"><b>who</b></span> command tells you the
truth.</p></li><li><p>open: The tiny
<span   class="bold"><b>open</b></span> utility spawns a new console
and executes a program in it. You can use
<span   class="bold"><b>loadkeys</b></span> to create a hot key which
invokes open. Thus a single keypress (or meta-key) can log you in.
This approach doesn't update the <b  >utmp</b> database
and works only when the hotkey is fed to a shell prompt.</p></li><li><p>spawn_console: The daemon spawn_console is part of
the kbd package. It creates a console in response to a signal sent
by the kernel in response to a <b  >Spawn_Console</b>
keysym. This approach works even if there isn't a shell to get your
key, and doesn't update the utmp database.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14c1580.0x15b2200"></a>What's the Difference?</h2></div></div><p>The first proposed approach requires no intervention on your
side&mdash;you should invoke the gpm server and the gpm-root client
only at bootup, which you're already supposed to do. The gpm-root
client then takes care of it all. Actually, a console is created
only by opening it, so little more than <b  >fork()</b>
and <b  >exec()</b> is required. Cleaning up is performed
when the child process dies.</p><p>The other approaches are explained in the documentation for
kbd-0.90, and are slightly more difficult only in that you need to
change your keyboard configuration again, run an extra daemon
program, or retrieve an extra package&mdash;open isn't part of the kbd
package. The extra effort is small, because all of the hard work is
implemented in the kernel.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14c1580.0x15b2410"></a>Changing the Text Mode</h2></div></div><p>Older versions of Linux couldn't allow console resizing, and
a single video mode should be used for the console from boot to
shutdown, and it usually was the bare 80x25. Linux-95 (Linux-1.2)
allows console resizing. The user program
<span   class="bold"><b>SVGATextMode</b></span>, despite its
cumbersome name, is a nice utility to change the appearance of your
text console on-the-fly.</p><p>The tool makes use of the <b  >ioctl(VT_RESIZE)</b>
system call to change the way the video buffer is managed in the
kernel, and modifies the internal registers in your video board in
order to send the right signals to your monitor. The program must
run with root permissions because both tasks are privileged.
SVGATextMode isn't alone in the field of console resizing, but it
currently is the most flexible choice.</p><p>Installing the program is easy&mdash;just <b  >make
&amp;&amp; make install</b>. Then configure the file
/etc/TextConfig&mdash;you need to tell SVGATextMode which chipset is in
your video board. The <b  >TextConfig</b> file is full of
helpful comments.</p><p>The single tricky task is resequencing running applications
to the new tty size. The configuration file provides a
<b  >ResetProg</b> line, where you can put a pathname of
an executable file that will handle this; it will generally consist
of sending <b  >SIGWINCH</b> to applications, as outlined
in the sample <b  >ResetProg</b>.</p><p>The definitions for the specific modes are modeled on the
XF86Config lines. The X-Windows configuration documentation and any
previous experience with with X-Windows configuration can help in
playing with text modes. If you're going to fine-tune your
X-Windows screen, you can easily run your tests with SVGATextMode.
Its fast cycle time makes trial-and-error better because you
needn't restart the X server for each trial. Fine-tuning screen
timings for text modes can lead to a good configuration to be
pasted in your XF86Config file. Alternately, if you have set up
X-Windows already, you can use that knowledge to set up
SVGATextMode.</p><p>Other facilities offered by SVGATextMode are automatic font
loading and cursor reshaping. This last feature alone is a good
reason to run SVGATextMode on your laptop&mdash;no more kernel patch to
have a block cursor.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14c1580.0x15b2938"></a>Problems Related to Console Resizing</h2></div></div><p>If you use SVGATextMode, especially on small machines, you'll
notice that sometimes console resizing will fail, even if you have
plenty of swap available, and sometimes even with plenty of RAM.
The problem is related to the <span   class="emphasis"><em>kind</em></span> of memory
needed; the kernel needs to complete the system call (an
<b  >ioctl()</b>) atomically, and it needs to get a
contiguous chunk of memory for each active console. There's no time
to swap out some process or to shrink the buffer cache, and the
kernel keeps only 1/64 of the available RAM for these &ldquo;urgent&rdquo;
issues. As a result, the smaller the box, the more consoles you
use, the more you're prone to fail resizing. Resizing to a smaller
estate won't always help, because the kernel must be sure to have
place for <span   class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span> the active consoles before it
starts copying video data to the new area, and only at the end can
the old buffer be released. If it fails, simply try again; it will
probably succeed the second time.</p><p>Another issue is the role of the
<b  >ResetProg</b>. Why do some applications do resize
well (like <span   class="bold"><b>jed</b></span>), others become
completely stuck (like selection) and still others need to be sent
the <b  >SIGWINCH</b> signal? Because a resizing of the
surrounding window is an asynchronous event, which doesn't fit the
normal environment of the application.</p><p>Applications belong to three types: over-attentive ones look
at the window size often, and perceive the new situation right when
it happens; more conventional applications wait for an asynchronous
notification of the event (a signal, namely
<b  >SIGWINCH</b>, for <b  >WIN</b>dow
<b  >CH</b>ange), and respond to the notification in the
right way; and some applications simply don't respond to changes in
window size, and ignore <b  >SIGWINCH</b>---the current
version of selection was written before console resizing was
available. Thus, while a resizing xterm sends
<b  >SIGWINCH</b> by itself, a resizing console doesn't
send anything, and an external <b  >ResetProg</b> is
needed to fill the gap.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14c1580.0x15b2f10"></a>Tools for the Text Console</h2></div></div><p>The following tools work particularly well on the text
console, sometimes even better than in graphics mode.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>gpm-root: <span   class="bold"><b>gpm-root</b></span>
is a root-window manager. Its role is to draw menus on the screen
background, like you do in the X environment. By default it
responds to control-mouse events, since mouse-only is left to the
selection mechanism, a vital feature if you work on a text console.
The menus drawn by gpm-root are read from a user-local
configuration file, and can be tailored to your own preferences.
gpm-root allows console-switching, console locking, opening a new
console to create a new system login, retrieving system information
and executing external commands, as well as recursive menus. The
user configuration file is reparsed when needed, to ease
trial-and-error menu writing.</p></li><li><p>Emacs The Emacs editor is made mouse-sensitive by
loading the t-mouse.el package, which comes in the gpm
distribution. All the functionality available under the X Window
System is duplicated on the text console, including the scrollbar.
The scrollbar acts on the last column of the screen and smooth
scroll is accomplished through a variable resolution widget&mdash;the
more you move your mouse to the left, the less scrolling takes
place in response to vertical motions. A meta- mouse button press
triggers the scrollbar independently of the position of the
mouse.</p></li><li><p>Jed: The Jed editor is mouse-sensitive as well.
Mouse support has been developed by Jed's author, and thus is
perfectly integrated. Jed is a good alternative to Emacs if you own
a small computer&mdash;it is considerably smaller, both in disk usage
and memory occupation, but offers the same basic commands and
interface, as well as its own extension language. Well, if you
learned &ldquo;elisp&rdquo; to configure Emacs, won't you learn &ldquo;slang&rdquo; to
configure Jed?</p></li><li><p>dialog: The dialog program is nothing special,
except that it runs definitely better on the text console than
under an xterm. Managing a Slackware installation with the dialog
menus on the console is a breeze, especially if you can interact
with your mouse. Under xterm, on the contrary, a dialog menu looks
ugly, and available mouse events are limited to button press, so
you're almost forced to use the keyboard. Moreover, the curses
libraries tend to use the alternate screen provided by xterm, and
thus message boxes are simply invisible, and you wonder why the
terminal is idling around without any message on it.</p></li><li><p>mc: <span   class="bold"><b>mc</b></span>
(<span   class="emphasis"><em>The Midnite Commander</em></span>) a powerful file
manager, is modeled on the famous DOS command
<span   class="bold"><b>nc</b></span>, though much more powerful than
the original. <span   class="bold"><b>mc</b></span> is fully
configurable and extendable, and does a good job of managing your
file system status. You can use its menus with the mouse as well as
the keyboard, while shift-mouse runs selection as usual.</p></li><li><p>screen: The <span   class="bold"><b>screen</b></span>
utility is a viable alternative to opening a lot of consoles. It
manages up to ten terminal sessions running on a single physical
connection. <span   class="bold"><b>screen</b></span> offers a lot of
functionality, and is a must if you use a vt100 or an old PC
running kermit to connect to your linux box. It is useful also if
you're really console-hungry and you don't have enough consoles.
The major drawback of screen is that it emulates a vt100, so you
lose all the extra features offered by the Linux console.
Specifically, you can't run gpm-aware programs under screen. One
really nice feature of screen is the visual-bell facility. It
offers a cut-and-paste facility, too, but mouse-based selection is
easier to use.</p></li><li><p>minicom: <span   class="bold"><b>minicom</b></span>
is an easy-to-use communication package resembling DOS's
<b  >telix</b> with a menu-oriented setup. It offers a
good scripting utility, which makes your programs talk directly
with the remote end of your serial connections. I use minicom to
remotely control a Nicolet oscilloscope, with no concern about
communication parameters.</p></li><li><p>gnuplot: Its name says a lot about it. A drawing
program that can read external ASCII files, its major advantage is
the ability to manage a many different output devices&mdash;including a
bare terminal. This means you can look at your data graphs without
starting X-Windows. The granularity of a tty plot is coarse, but
gnuplot does its job well. It has a fairly complete internal help
facility, and you can produce nice PostScript (or other graphic
format) graphs without entering your graphic environment.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14c1580.0x18c6ea8"></a>Further Readings</h2></div></div><p>All the tools described above come with manual pages or info
