Days</em></span> from Sams Publishing&mdash;two inches thick&mdash;are
intimidating. Don't let the size of the book intimidate you,
though, it's due not to the complexity of the language, but to the
easygoing writing style of the author.</p><p>The book is divided into 21 days (chapters) of differing
length, three review sections (at the end of each &ldquo;week&rdquo;), several
appendixes, and a thorough index. Each &ldquo;day&rdquo; has a discussion of a
part of the language, examples (either complete programs or code
fragments), warnings, sections of &ldquo;Do's and Don'ts,&rdquo; and questions
or problems at the end. Suggested answers to each &ldquo;day's&rdquo; questions
are supplied in an appendix.</p><p>I started reading this book with no previous exposure to
PERL; by the end of the second week I was beginning to see places
where the language might be used in real world applications. The
examples and discussions were clear and easy to follow. After
completing the book, I started writing a simple application; so far
I've been able to do everything in PERL that I need to do.</p><p>Some of the functions of PERL are also directly translatable
to other programs. The discussion of Pattern Matching (Day 7)
should be (with author/publisher permission) incorporated into the
<span   class="bold"><b>sed</b></span> manual page; I'd never been
able to get sed to do what I wanted until I read this
chapter.</p><p>However, the copy of the book I received had a few problems.
It was from the first printing and had several errors that the
proofreaders had missed. Some of those early in the book would trip
up new users of computers. For example, in the section on ftping
the PERL file to install PERL on the reader's machine, a sample ftp
session is presented. In the sample dialogue, the GET command
wasn't followed by a file name: <b  >get</b> . When I
tried this, ftp told me I needed to supply a file name. I knew
enough to do a <b  >ls p*</b> to find the current file
and then type <b  >get filename</b> to get it. (I only
did the ftp session to test the directions, since I had already
installed PERL from my Slackware CD-ROM.)</p><p>Another hazard lies in the discussion of the required first
line of a PERL program <b  >#!/usr/local/bin/perl</b>.
There is a small discussion of the fact that it must be the correct
path of the PERL interpreter, but the only advice given is to talk
to your System Administrator. Since several folks are their own
System Administrator, this might cause problems. Since there are
already &ldquo;Unix Only&rdquo; discussions in some of the chapters, a small
discussion of the <span   class="bold"><b>which</b></span> command
would be a welcome addition.</p><p>I was able to detect at least one error for every two
chapters. Upon requesting an errata sheet from the publisher via
their area on CompuServe (which they advertise in the book), I was
informed that they would get back to me. A week later, they still
hadn't. Since files containing errata for some of their other books
are available from the area, I presume that the book is still too
new for a sheet to have been compiled.</p><p>The only other problem that I have with the book is its
classification of &ldquo;User Level: Beginning&mdash;Intermediate.&rdquo; Since I
have taken classes in both C and Ada, I was able to relate some of
the concepts that I had learned to this language. However, as I
pointed out before, some of the ideas presented are definitely not
for beginning computer users.</p><p>Generally, I would recommend this book for any person who
wants to learn PERL. But this is not the book for a person who is
attempting to learn a first programming language.</p></div></div>
