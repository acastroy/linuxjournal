keep finding top quality writers like Stephen Uhler. I also
appreciated the Perl article. But the reason <i  >LJ</i> is so great is that
it applies high editorial standards to discussion of topics that
are typically served by nothing more formal than FAQs. So I'd like
to see more articles like the Tcl one that aren't for absolute
beginners but instead try to teach a bit of the art of some skill
or explore some hidden corner of a powerful program. This is the
knowledge that is hard to come by.</p><p>Keep up the good work,</p><p>&mdash;Grant Reaber</p><p>You will be glad to know (if you missed it before) that the
Tcl/Tk column is slated to be a bimonthly column, and issue 18 has
another of his columns.</p><p>We will continue to try to find a mix of articles for readers
at all skill levels from novice to expert. At this point there are
a lot of powerful programs that aren't being used at all, and we
have been working on a lot of articles to introduce readers to new
programs that have not had the publicity they deserve. I'm hoping
this will help produce the need for more advanced articles about
the same programs later. This way, the more advanced articles have
a chance for wider readership. And the correlary is that right now,
most of the more advanced articles are on topics that have wide
interest, like the Tcl/Tk column.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21a9580.0x22a13a0"></a>Is Linux on the Bus?</h2></div></div><p>I understand there has been work on versions of Linux for

Linuxdoc-SGML and <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Installation and Getting
Started</em></span>, recently finished the first leg of his
country-wide tour to promote his book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Installation
and Getting Started</em></span>. His first stop was in Seattle,
where <i  >Linux Journal</i> staff members Phil Hughes
and Amy Simpson met him at the airport. After a whirlwind tour of
the Seattle area (and an unsuccessful attempt at locating a
geoduck, a large bivalve found in the waters around Seattle) and a
dinner of sushi and sake, he was whisked away to a local bookstore
for his first talk. About 70-80 people were on hand&mdash;including a
large contingent of Microsoft employees&mdash;to hear Matt talk. The
audience was technically adept, and very receptive to Linux, and
Matt did an excellent job despite the fact that the space alotted
for the talk was more suitable for half the number of people that
showed up.</p><p>The first leg of his tour ran from August 14th through August
20th, with stops in Seattle, Denver, Kansas City, St. Loius,
Dallas, College Station, and Austin. Highlights of his trip include
receiving an honorary citizenship to the city of Austin, signed by
the mayor, and signing the guestbook at his St. Loius bookstore
right below Newt Gingrich, and right before Anne Rice. Matt reports
that the tour went quite well, and says he now has a much greater
appreciation for the time usually allotted for sleep.</p></div></div>
