    Always wanted to change the look of X Windows? Here are the
    tools to do it easily.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d69580.0x1e61608"></a></h2></div></div><p>Do you ever wonder how some peoples'
xclocks and xterms always start up with different colors than
boring old black and white? Do you wish those Athena 3-D widgets
(discussed in <i  >Linux Journal</i>, issue 15) looked
a bit more like the Motif ones they are supposed to emulate?
Through the magic of something called X Resources, you can make all
this happen&mdash;and a lot more.
</p><p>Resources may look confusing and complex at first glance,
like something only a programmer with a mean streak would foist
upon the unwitting user. It's true that resources are very closely
tied to X programming, which is why they can appear so arcane.
However, with a little practice, you can customize applications to
suit your own personal preferences, and kiss &ldquo;vanilla X&rdquo; goodbye
forever.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d69580.0x1e617c0"></a>What are X Resources Useful For?</h2></div></div><p>Color has already been mentioned, but to dismiss resources as
a simple color control mechanism would be a mistake. Don't like an
application's choice of fonts? Change them. Want to change the way
the cursor appears? You can do that too.</p><p>Resources can even be used to modify the entire behaviour of
an application, from the appearance and labels of buttons and
pull-down menus, to the actual functions that these items call in
the program. For instance, if you think that the &ldquo;Quit&rdquo; label on a
button is too bland, you can easily substitute &ldquo;Kill&rdquo;, or something
even more imaginative.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d69580.0x1e61920"></a>Resource Files</h2></div></div><p>X Resources are stored in several locations. Applications
often have a default set of resources that are stored in a file in
the /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults directory. For example, you will find
resource files for both xterm and xload in that directory. Notice
the files usually have the first two letters capitalized, i.e.
XTerm, and XLoad. While this is only a de-facto standard, it is
related to the applications class name, which we'll get to
later.</p><p>Besides these application-specific files, there are two other
files in which you can store resources. If you have a file in your
home directory called .Xdefaults, it will be loaded when your X
session starts (either through xdm or startx), replacing any
system-wide resources that might have been defined (stored in
/usr/lib/X11/Xdefaults). A second file, .Xresources, doesn't
replace the system defaults but instead is merged with them. For
that reason, you probably want to use this file for your own
resources instead of .Xdefaults.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d69580.0x1e61a80"></a>Specifying a Resource</h2></div></div><p>Resources are specified in one of the following
formats:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
name*variable: <span   class="emphasis"><em>value</em></span>name.variable.variable: <span   class="emphasis"><em>value</em></span>
</pre><p>Resources are case sensitive, and you should be sure that
there is at least a space or a tab after the colon, before the
value specified. The first format listed, which utilizes the
<b  >*</b> separator (called loose binding), is used to
indicate that all resources of a program with name
<b  ><i><tt>name</tt></i></b> and variable
<b  ><i><tt>variable</tt></i></b> are to
acquire value <b  ><i><tt>value</tt></i></b>.
For instance, the resource</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Xedit*font: 7x14
</pre><p>will cause xedit to use a 7x14 fixed font for everything,
including the main window and the menus. (We will see how to find
resource names later in the article&mdash;take them on faith for now.)
But what if you only want to change the font in a particular area
of a program? In that case, the
<b  ><i><tt>.</tt></i></b> notation (called
tight binding) would be used. This notation allows you to be more
specific than loose binding allows:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Xedit.Paned.Label.font: fixed
</pre><p>will make two labels in xedit use the fixed font. However,
the default font (7x14, as set by the first resource) will be used
everywhere else. Note that although the first resource applies to
<span   class="bold"><b>every</b></span> font resource in the Xedit
program, including those two labels, the second resource is the one
used for those labels because it is more
<span   class="bold"><b>specific</b></span>. More specific resources
are always used in preference to less specific resources.</p><p>Resources, and the <span   class="bold"><b>widgets</b></span>
they modify, have a hierarchical nature. &ldquo;What's a widget?&rdquo; you
ask. Widgets are the basic building blocks, or objects, of X
programs. Some example widgets with which everyone is familiar:
scrollbars, text-entry fields, buttons, and checkboxes. In the
above resource, the Label widget is a &ldquo;child&rdquo; of the Paned widget,
which is a &ldquo;child&rdquo; of Xedit. This will become more clear when the
<span   class="bold"><b>editres</b></span> program is introduced
below.</p><p>One other note before we continue: a distinction must be made
between classes and <span   class="bold"><b>instances</b></span> of a
particular class. In the above resource, <b  >Label</b>
specifies any instance of the widget class
<b  >Label</b>. There are two that match the
specification, whose names are <b  >bc_label</b> and
<b  >labelWindow</b>. All
<span   class="bold"><b>classes</b></span> begin with a capital
letter by definition; <b  >Label</b> is the class, and
<b  >bc_label</b> and <b  >labelWindow</b>,
which start with lower case letters, are the instances of that
class.</p><p>You can specify instances as well as classes, so that only
one particular widget is affected; you can add the following
resource:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Xedit.paned.bc_label.font: 7x14
</pre><p>which will set the font for one of the two
<b  >Label</b> widgets back to 7x14&mdash;it is more specific
than the previous resource.</p><p>It is usually more convenient to set the resources for an
entire class of widgets than for an individual instance, as you
typically want to make the entire application look
consistent.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d69580.0x1e62840"></a>Viewing, Changing, and Loading Resources</h2></div></div><p>Several times, you've been told to add or modify a resource.
How is this accomplished? The X distribution provides several
programs you can use to add, modify, and view resources. The most
simple method (but perhaps the most difficult) is to specify the
resource for a program as an argument when the program is started.
Most well-behaved X programs accept the <b  >xrm</b>
command line option for adding or modifying a single resource. The
format works like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
-xrm "<span   class="emphasis"><em>resource</em></span>"
</pre><p>Specifying resources on the command line can become tedious,
to say the least. X provides considerably more sophisticated
mechanisms to modify and examine resources. The most simple of
these is <span   class="bold"><b>xrdb</b></span>. Xrdb is a command
line utility that can load, query, and merge resources. Here are
some of the common command line options:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><b  >-load
<i><tt>filename</tt></i></b> Load the resources
contained in <b  ><i><tt>filename</tt></i></b>
into the resource database. Replaces any resources currently in the
database with new values if they are specified in the file.</p></li><li><p><b  >-merge
<i><tt>filename</tt></i></b> Performs much like
the load option, but only loads those resources which are not
already modified. Nothing currently in the resource database that
is encountered in the file will be loaded.</p></li><li><p><b  >-query</b> Show the resource
database that is currently in use. Only those resources that have
been modified are displayed. If all resources were displayed
(including defaults), then you would probably have much more
information than you expected.</p></li></ul></div><p>Another very useful program that comes with the X
distribution is <span   class="bold"><b>editres</b></span>. Editres
can be used to interactively modify the resources of a particular
program. After starting editres, pull down the &ldquo;Commands&rdquo; menu,
select &ldquo;Get Widget Tree&rdquo;, and then click on the application you
want to examine or modify. Now you should see something like what
is pictured in Figure 1 (the actual hierarchy pictured is for
<span   class="bold"><b>xedit</b></span>). Note that it won't look
exactly like Figure 1, because I've modified my resources for
editres.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="1154f1.jpg"></div><p>Figure 1. editres, an interactive X resource editor</p><p>All widgets are laid out in a tree-like fashion, with the
parent widgets on the left, and their children progressing to the
right. Lines connect children to parents. You can use the box in
the upper-left corner of editres to move the display around if the
widget tree is larger than the window itself.</p><p>Using the &ldquo;Tree&rdquo; menu, you can switch between class and
instance names and select certain widgets in particular. If you
want to modify the resources of one particular widget, select it by
clicking on it once with the left mouse button, and then, from the
&ldquo;Commands&rdquo; menu, choose &ldquo;Show Resource Box&rdquo;. A popup box with all
the available resources for the widget selected will be displayed,
as shown in Figure 2. In the Resource Box, select a resource with
the mouse, and then enter a value for the resource in the text
field below. This is perhaps the easiest way to both find the names
of the resources and experiment with setting them to different
values.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="1154f2.jpg"></div><p>Figure 2. Ascreen from editres showing the resource display
screen</p><p>You can also make the resource string more loosely or tightly
bound by adjusting which fields are highlighted at the top of the
popup window. When you are ready to see the results of your
changes, push the &ldquo;Apply&rdquo; button at the bottom of the
window.</p><p>More detailed help with editres can be found on the editres
manual page.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d69580.0x1e59d88"></a>Some Examples</h2></div></div><p>No article on X resources would be complete without detailed
examples of how they can be used. To do this, we'll take a look at
one simple X client&mdash;xclock&mdash;and then at a whole widget set&mdash;the
Athena widgets (which are a stock part of any X11
distribution).</p><p>Let's try a couple of things with xclock. You can either make
these changes with editres, so you can view them interactively, or
you can add them to your .Xresources file, which you'll need to
merge with xrdb. Remember, whenever you make changes to the
resource database, the clients affected need to be restarted in
order for the changes to take effect. If you think the normal black
and white scheme of the clock is too dull, consider the
following:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
*xclock.foreground: steelblue*xclock.hands:      steelblue
*xclock.background: ivory
</pre><p>That should give you some ideas for starters. For a more
extensive change in appearance, try:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
*xclock.analog: 0
</pre><p>This will make the clock display in a digital fashion.
Specifying 1 as the value for this resource will reset it to the
normal analog display.</p><p>Let's go a step further. In the July, 1995 issue of
<i  >Linux Journal</i>, the
<span   class="bold"><b>Xaw3D</b></span> widgets were introduced. The
purpose of these widgets is to give the default Athena widgets a
more three-dimensional look and feel. However, with no default
resources, programs still can look washed out and dull. This is
because no default colors have been specified for the widgets, so
programs that don't change these resources explicitly will display
them in black and white with unattractive, dithered shadowing. See
Figure 3 for an example of this.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="1154f3.jpg"></div><p>Figure 3. A &ldquo;vanilla&rdquo; xmailtool</p><p>A set of resources which make the Xaw3D widgets appear more
like the popular Motif widgets appear in Listing 1.</p><p>Listing 1</p><pre     class="programlisting">

*shadowWidth:             3

! now look silly
*xclock*shadowWidth:      0
*xload*shadowWidth:       0
*xcalc*shadowWidth:       0
</pre><p>The first resource tells all programs that color is available
and should be used. Then, the shadow width for all Athena widgets
is set to 3 (which looks like Motif). Default colors are then
selected for most of the common widgets (buttons, scrollbars, and
the like), and shadow contrast levels are set. Finally, shadows on
a few X clients is a bit overkill, so
<b  >shadowWidth</b> is reduced to 0 for these. Figure 4
shows how the program now looks more aesthetically pleasing as a
result of these modifications.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="1154f4.jpg"></div><p>Figure 4. xmailtool after resource changes</p><p>This should get you started. X resources are one of the most
important aspects of X programs in general, so a basic
understanding of them is essential&mdash;not only for using and
customizing X programs, but also writing them. You should now be
able to discover the resources hiding behind your own favorite
programs, and it would be good practice for you to apply the
techniques in this article to a different program of your own
choosing right now. Remember this while you are tinkering with X
resources: X may not be as simple to configure as MS Windows, but
it is much more powerful.</p><p>Enjoy!</p></div></div>
