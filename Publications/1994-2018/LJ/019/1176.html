    IKEA has discovered that Linux is a low-cost solution for
    its TCP/IP networking needs. Anders &Ouml;stling tells us the
    story.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1deb580.0x1ee33a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>It started by coincidence early last
year. We had repeated problems with a system that sent files to a
business partner using a leased line and VMS-based Kermit. A
consultant suggested that we installed a PC with UUCP as
replacement. We agreed, the PC arrived, and guess what operating
system I found on the disk. Right, it was Linux 1.0, our&mdash;and
my&mdash;first experience with a PC-based Unix system.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1deb580.0x1ee34a8"></a>Our Organization</h2></div></div><p>For those that don't know IKEA, here is a overview of my
company. IKEA is a retailer of furniture and home interior stuff.
We have sites in nearly all European countries, the US and Canada,
and the Far East, including Australia. These countries are
sub-divided into organizational units. Our unit, Northern Europe
(at the moment of this writing), is responsible for managing the
stores, warehouses and offices in 7 European countries. Our
headquarters is located in Helsingborg, in southern Sweden, and
this is where I work.</p><p>From here, there are network connection to all &ldquo;our&rdquo;
countries, as well as to the other IKEA branches. We also have a
couple of DEC Alpha systems as central &ldquo;mainframes&rdquo; for common
database applications. These systems are critical for our survival
(and so are the network connections to these systems).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1deb580.0x1ee3608"></a>New Times, New Network Demands</h2></div></div><p>Like many other companies, we are rapidly evolving our IT
structure to more distributed systems. This means that
communication lines that could be cut for a day or more before
without any serious problems, are now becoming absolutely essential
for business.</p><p>In late 1994 and early 1995, we at IKEA Northern Europe
restructured our European network to have faster links, new
routers, LANs, etc. From being a more or less pure DECNET network,
we converted more and more to TCP/IP, since this is the common
denominator with our sister organizations worldwide. While we
planned for this big task, we also found that we had to change our
IP addressing and naming in order to avoid havoc. Our decision was
to have a tree-structured DNS [footnote:Domain Name Service] system
with the root at our head office in Helsingborg, Sweden, and
secondary DNS servers at each site. The DNS servers would serve
approximately 75 VMS systems, 20 AIX systems, and hundreds of other
PCs and and NT-servers.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1deb580.0x1ee3768"></a>Why Linux?</h2></div></div><p>One option was to use an existing VMS or AIX system as
primary server, but since we demand 100% uptime, this was not very
attractive. Not that VMS or AIX systems are unreliable, but they
are used for other tasks, which means that they could be down for
many unrelated reasons. We saw that we needed a dedicated system to
avoid problems.</p><p>This was one year after our first Linux system; since I had
been running Linux both at home and at work for over a year and was
convinced of its usefulness and stability, I suggested Linux. My
boss listened to my arguments, and agreed to give it a try.</p><p>We bought two 486/33 machines with 8 MB ram each, and I
started to install 1.1.91 on a rainy day in March. After two days,
we had BIND 4.3.9 [footnote:The nameserver program] up and running,
with a second PC as a backup system should the first PC fail. After
running internally for a week, we decided to start the
transformation. The whole tech department spent a weekend changing
more than 300 TCP/IP systems all over Europe. On Monday morning, we
had over 50 secondary DNS servers (mostly VMS systems running
TCPware) getting their information from CYGNUS, the primary server
PC. CYGNUS was also serving approximately 200 IP systems at our
headquarters from day one.</p><p>For redundancy, all headquarter systems have both &ldquo;primaries&rdquo;
in their resolver file. Empirical tests (pulling out the cable)
have shown that this works flawlessly. Another thing is that if
CYGNUS breaks completely, we can replace him with VIRGO, the second
PC. In order to make this a bit easier, we
<span   class="bold"><b>rcp</b></span> all DNS, RCS and passwd files
via <span   class="bold"><b>cron</b></span> at regular intervals. All
CYGNUS specific files (rc.inet and such) are also stored safely on
VIRGO so it should be fairly easy to switch identities, if
needed.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1deb580.0x1ee3a28"></a>Hands-On DNS: How we did it</h2></div></div><p>As I mentioned, we use GNU RCS to maintain our DNS files. We
have set up one master file for all IP systems and one
reverse-translation file for each country. All persons allowed to
edit these files have their private accounts which gives us a good
overview of who did what, and the ability to reverse their editing
in case they have done something wrong.</p><p>IKEA is using the RFC-recommended address 10.x.x.x
internally. Each country has its earlier DECNET area as the second
number, so for example, Belgium has 10.14.x.x since they were in
DECNET area 14. The third part represents the location, so Antwerp
has 10.14.5.x. This leaves 253 possible hosts for each LAN or site,
and enables us to use class C subnet masking for all countries.
Again, the exception is our headquarters, which has more than 253
hosts. We have allocated a special &ldquo;area&rdquo;, 62, and use a class B
subnet mask at headquarters.</p><p>The master file is called named.neurope, and the reverse
files are called named.<span   class="emphasis"><em>xx</em></span>, where
<span   class="emphasis"><em>xx</em></span> is the ISO code for each country (be, gb,
dk, se, nl, and no). We also have a reverse file for our
headquarters, named.hbg, since this is the single largest &ldquo;domain&rdquo;.
As an example, Figure 1 contains an edited extract form this
file.</p><p>The cache (named.ca) file has entries for our central DNS
system (where the Internet connection is) and for our sister
organizations' primary DNS servers.</p><p>The boot (named.boot) file has a &ldquo;forwarders&rdquo; record which
routes all unknown lookups to our Internet-connected DNS server, as
well as a record that states that we are primary server for our
organization.</p><p>Our secondary servers (40 VMS hosts) have corresponding files
with pointers to CYGNUS so they know where to &ldquo;zone-transfer&rdquo; files
and updates from. These updates takes place at boot and every
fourth hour.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1deb580.0x1ee3d98"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>Today, system size has increased to well over 700 IP hosts
due to the fact that new LANs with networked NT servers and Windows
PCs are popping up every day of the week. How have CYGNUS and his
partner (yes, it's a he) coped with this? Until today, there has
been no problem worth mentioning (aside from a total power outage
which killed both systems). Oh yes: one
<span   class="bold"><b>big</b></span> problem is to make people not
used to Unix use RCS and <span   class="bold"><b>vi</b></span> to
manage our DNS files.</p><p>Another problem with Linux is that it's too cheap. I'm
serious, since many people still put an equal sign between
Cheap/Free and Bad/Dangerous. In the case of Linux (and XFree86)
this has proven to be pure nonsense.</p><p>There are some companies here in Sweden offering support for
Linux. I think that this will help to make Linux more socially
acceptable; if you find somebody who is willing to accept a check
from you, then you can always shout and yell at him if there are
unsolved problems. Personally, I prefer to have direct contact with
the programmers and designers.</p><p>A year later, that system is still running Linux 1.0 and
UUCP. There have been a few problems, all caused by the other UUCP
partner (I won't mention any brands), but all-in-all, everybody was
happy. So happy, in fact, that a few of our techies have also tried
Linux out on their own PCs. Some, like me, have kept Linux for
good.</p></div></div>
