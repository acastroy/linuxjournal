    Have a Linux box and need to run Mac applications? Andreas

newsgroups, you may have heard some talk about a new Macintosh
emulator called <span   class="bold"><b>Executor</b></span>
(pronounced <span   class="emphasis"><em>ig-zek'-yu-tor</em></span>). When we (Andreas
Schiffler, a long time Linux user, and David Moody, a die-hard Mac
fan) first heard about this program, our interest was sparked:
finally, some common ground on which to relate! We investigated and
wrote this review for <i  >Linux Journal</i> to give
readers some idea of whether this commercial product will bridge
the gap between these two completely unique operating systems, and
also to give the Mac-illiterate Linux user a head-start on using
the program.
</p><p>Executor, a product of Abacus Research and Development, Inc.
(ARDI), is &ldquo;a commercial emulator that allows non-Macintosh
hardware to run some applications originally written on a
Macintosh&rdquo;. Recently, a version for Linux has become available.
This review is based on a pre-beta version, 1.99o, which was
current at the time of evaluation. It should be noted that this
pre-beta version has many known bugs which ARDI is addressing for
its official 2.0 release of Executor.</p><p>Executor is available as a demo for evaluation purposes. The
demo is a fully functional version which is limited to 10 minutes
of use, a limitation which can be removed by obtaining a serial
number and registration code, which you are granted when you
purchase it.</p><p>The demo can be obtained from various Linux FTP sites,
including ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/system/Emulators/, or
from the official (but slower) ARDI FTP site at ftp.ardi.com. For
installation, we obtained the 3 MB archive, unarchived it with
<b  >tar xzf executor199o.tar.gz</b> changed directories
with <b  >cd executorlinux199o</b> and ran
<b  >make</b> as root. This copied the executable into
/usr/local/bin/executor and created a Macintosh &ldquo;volume&rdquo; in
/usr/local/lib/executor/. A quick look into its sub-directories
reveals that Executor uses the native file system with additional
emulator-specific files (prefixed by a %); the file system is
seamlessly integrated into your Linux system. The current version
is only supported under X-windows, but an SVGALIB version for those
without X is in the works. Typing <b  >executor</b> in an
X-terminal brings your new Mac to life. (See Figure 1.)</p><p><a href="1031f1.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 1.
Startup Screen</b></span></a></p><p>The first thing David (the Mac expert) noticed is the
slightly non-standard setup. Instead of the &ldquo;Finder&rdquo; desktop (which
Macs use to find and run programs on the hard drive), Executor runs
its own &ldquo;Browser&rdquo; program. The main difference is the presence of a
&ldquo;hot band&rdquo;, located just below the menu bar. This band contains a
help button, which gives help on using the hot band, and 6
application grouping buttons for making quick reference icons.
Basically, the Browser is a slightly watered-down version of the
Finder; we found it fairly easy to use, but lacking a bit in
on-line documentation and color.</p><p>The Mac system is not completely emulated, so there are some
features which are handled differently in, or are absent from,
Executor. For starters, the keyboard is slightly different. Macs
have two keys which are absent from the PC keyboard, the option key
and the</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="1031logo.jpg"></div><p>key, and the Mac has no Alt keys. Executor uses the left Alt key
 as the</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="1031logo.jpg"></div><p>key and the right Alt key as the option key. Since the</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="1031logo.jpg"></div><p>key is often used as an accelerator key, the documentation could
have been a bit more specific about this. In future releases, a
README.FIRST summarizing these topics, for people who don't want to
read the fairly extensive FAQ before running executor, might be a
useful addition.</p><p>Floppy disks are also handled differently from a real Mac,
and some insight in Executor floppy disk handling is required to
avoid hangups. On a Mac, inserting a disk immediately causes an
icon to appear on the desktop; in Executor, you have to press</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="1031logo.jpg"></div><p>-shift-2 once the disk is in the drive and choose Eject before a
disk is taken out.</p><p>This is how disk swapping encountered during the installation
of program is handled as well. This is very important to note, as
clicking the &ldquo;OK&rdquo; button during a disk swap before pressing</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="1031logo.jpg"></div><p>-shift-2 will result in a segmentation fault, and it's &ldquo;game over&rdquo;
for Executor. Note, however, that this is explicitly an
experimental release of Executor, and faults that we encountered
may well be corrected in version 2.0, which will probably be
released by the time you read this. As mentioned in the FAQ,
Executor cannot read 800K Mac disks, because PC floppy drives are
physically incapable of doing so. The current version hangs for a
long time when a 800K disk is inserted and the disk-check option is
selected. This is annoying but should be no problem for most
people&mdash;if you are aware of it.</p><p>Executor has only a little System 7.x support, which is the
current incarnation of the Mac operating system. This will only
affect programs which use the special features of System 7.x. Also,
Executor won't load CDEV's (Macintosh control panels) or INIT's
(modular extensions to the system)---that means no QuickTime, After
Dark, etc.</p><p>Now we decided to get down to work and install WordPerfect
3.0. Programs like WordPerfect have a particular use for
Executor/Linux users who want to use commercial productivity
applications that are not yet available under Linux or who simply
want to make use of their old documents without having to switch
operating systems. The WordPerfect installation requires knowing
how to handle floppies under Executor, as mentioned above, but
completes speedily and without problems. A new folder is created,
and a double click starts WordPerfect.</p><p><a href="1031f2.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 2.
Wordperfect Screen</b></span></a></p><p>Now that was easy! In Figure 2, you can see the demo document
with inline graphics and tables. According to the Readme file,
Executor can send output to a PostScript-compatible filter, so we
printed our document. As promised, out came our formatted document.
(Our printer prints PostScript by default). So far, so good. Now
the bad news. Although the basic editing and formatting appeared to
work well, we were unable to get the graphic editor or the equation
editor to work.</p><p>PageMaker 4.2 installation was straightforward, and we had
our program up and running in a few minutes. Everything appeared to
be where it should be, and all documents were displayed correctly.
The functions we tried worked well, although PageMaker is mentioned
in the Executor 1.99o bug list as having trouble with some file
functions.</p><p>Enough real work&mdash;what did we buy a computer for anyway? On
to the games.</p><p>We started with the included shareware games. Lemmings was
our first choice. It worked, but it seemed quite sluggish. This is
because of the way Executor handles graphics. There are two methods
to choose from for color mapping: either the standard color map
allocation under X-windows (dynamic) or a private color map
controlled by Executor. The first option preserves the colors of
the X-windows desktop, but is slow. The second option, invoked with
the command line <b  >executor -privatecmap</b>, creates
some bizarre colors for the rest of X-windows, but is very fast.
When we re-ran Executor with the <b  >-privatecmap</b>
option, Lemmings blazed.</p><p>We ran the other two included games, Solitaire and Risk,
without incident. On to the private stock. The FAQ sheet claimed
that Wolfenstein 3D worked under Executor, so we loaded it up.
Technically, it did work. However, even with the fast color option,
it was unbearably slow. Perhaps we were pushing the limit a
bit&mdash;or did we have to fiddle with more preferences? We tried
installing Populous, but no amount of prodding would get it
working.</p><p><a href="1031f3.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 3.
Prince of Persia</b></span></a></p><p>We had more luck with Prince of Persia (Figure 3). It ran
right off the floppy disk&mdash;and was it ever
<span   class="bold"><b>fast</b></span>! Our jaws dropped as we
watched the emulated game outspeed the version running on our Mac.
Needless to say, we were very impressed. At this point, however, it
would be worth discussing the kind of machines we were using and
doing some real benchmark comparisons.</p><p>ARDI includes Speedometer (Ver. 3.23) with its emulator.
Speedometer performs a variety of CPU, graphics and other benchmark
tests, thus providing a convenient means of comparing machines, so
we used this program to perform our tests. Our main test systems
were a 25 Mz, 68030LC-based LCIII Macintosh and an AMD 486 DX4-100.
ARDI claims that Executor runs at 1/3 the speed of a similar-speed
Macintosh, so these systems should be roughly comparable in
speed.</p><p>For our final software test, we decided to stack our
emulators. With some trepidation, we booted up Executor, and loaded
a program called SoftAT which is&mdash;you guessed it&mdash;a DOS emulator
for Macintosh. Did it work? You bet. We even managed to mount an E:
drive under SoftAT to the directory /dos, which was a DOS partition
mounted under Linux, provided by Executor. Got your head around
that? The short version is, it was really cool. Take a look at
MSD.EXE running under SoftAT (see Figure 4).</p><p><a href="1031f4.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 4.
MSD</b></span></a></p><p>According to the FAQ and WWW site, the following programs
have been tested and work properly under Executor: Entertainment:
Beam Wars, Glypha III, Shatterball, Civilization, Spaceward Ho!
Productivity: Claris Works 2.0.1, Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel
Utility: DropStuff Enhancer, Stuffit Expander, NIH Image,
AddressBook We are sure there are numerous other programs that will
run.</p><p>So what's the bottom line? If there is even a remote chance
that you will ever want to run a Mac program on your Linux box, you
should definitely get yourself a copy of the Executor demo. That
way, you can try out any programs you have to see if they work. At
the very least, you'll impress anyone looking over your
shoulder!</p><p>Although we were very impressed with the experimental version
1.99x, we recommend saving your work regularly, because of the
slightly unstable nature of these pre-beta releases. ARDI promises
that Version 2.0, due out in October, 1995, will fix many bugs,
making Executor into a very attractive product. Missing from 2.0
will be AppleTalk, sound, serial port access, and support for INITs
and CDEVs.</p><p>After version 2.0 has been released, ARDI will begin working
on System 7.5 support, sound and serial port access, and better
documentation&mdash;much needed additions. Current licensing fees are
$49 for educational use, $99 for commercial use, both of which
include updates up to version 2.0---which we find very
reasonable.</p><p>Get the Executor demo, but be sure to read the accompanying
documentation in the form of a FAQ. Take a look at the unofficial
WWW pages at
<a href="http://vorlon.mit.edu/arditop.html" target="_self">vorlon.mit.edu/arditop.html</a>
for more information and tips, and look around the Internet at
Macintosh shareware sites, including
ftp://wuarchive.wustl.edu/systems/mac/info-mac/.</p><p>Happy Mac-ing!</p><p>Disclaimer: We are in no way related to ARDI.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="1031a1.jpg"></div><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Andreas Schiffler is a graduate student at the
