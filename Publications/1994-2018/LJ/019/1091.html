    Jeff provides a handy guide to X-Windows window managers and tells you
    how to customize them.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d7b580.0x1e73500"></a></h2></div></div><p>One of Linux's most impressive but least
recognized features is its flexible and powerful desktop
environment. While great efforts are underway to develop the next
generation of desktop interfaces (such as OSF's Common Desktop
Environment or Microsoft's Windows 95 and Bob), Linux enthusiasts
have for years had a choice of several stable, powerful, and
customizable window managers and shells for program management.
</p><p>Unlike many other operating systems, Linux runs extremely
well on standard VGA 80x24 terminals. While unglamorous and less
intuitive, Linux's terminal interface provides speed and
ease-of-use still unmatched by GUIs. Linux uses mature, powerful
shells such as tcsh and bash, which elegantly display and
manipulate text at blazing speeds on any PC. Linux's text mode
support is particularly appropriate for portables with small
screens, slower processors, and little memory. [See &ldquo;The Best
without X&rdquo; in this issue, page 22&mdash;Ed]</p><p>The reduced requirements for character-mode displays also
enables Linux to run very well off of floppy drives, which has
great utility for creating bootable emergency repair disks or
running Linux on non-Linux PCs. Linux's text mode support is
inappropriate for graphical applications like Netscape or WYSIWYG
word processors, but is superior for system administration and text
editing tasks due to its versatility, speed, and uniform
support.</p><p>At the other end, Linux supports a wide number of X-Windows
servers on large monitors at resolutions up to 1600x1200. Linux's
X-Windows client-server technology offers the superb capability of
displaying graphical applications locally which run remotely, a
feature unmatched by other PC operating systems. X-Windows is also
notable for the extreme amount of customization available through
resource files. For example, as a left-handed mouse user I commonly
switch the scrollbars of my X-Windows applications to the left
side, which cannot be done with other operating systems. With
native support for three-button mice, multiple displays, and a
myriad of free window managers, Linux provides more powerful and
flexible desktop interface options than most other operating
systems.</p><p>Unfortunately, the Linux interface suffers from the
inevitable tradeoff of flexibility and power for ease-of-use. Many
Linux users continue to use default X-Windows or shell
configuration files, unaware of alternative interface tools or
configuration options which can simplify or enhance their current
setup. I have encountered many Linux users who are unwilling to
modify their installation because of arcane configuration file
syntax and lack of knowledge on this subject. This problem
continues to increase as more people without Unix training migrate
to Linux.</p><p>This article describes strategies for desktop interface
configuration and utilization under Linux. These strategies are
based on a simple premise: the optimal desktop environment is one
which maximizes data visualization and screen utilization (output)
while minimizing the amount of time, interaction, and complexity
required to perform a given task (input). Utilities which are
frequently used must be immediately accessible to users with a few
keystrokes or button clicks. Less commonly used utilities need not
be as accessible but should be well-organized such that they are
easily located and started. Utilities should optimize screen usage
to permit monitoring and interaction with multiple, concurrent
processes. Finally, all interface tools must make minimal usage of
memory and CPU resources.</p><p>Having tested the majority of Linux window managers and
shells over the past several years, I am most impressed by rxvt and
fvwm, John Bovey's and Robert Nation's
(<a href="mailto:fvwm@wonderland.org">fvwm@wonderland.org</a>)
xterm clone and window manager, as tools to manage my desktop
environment. I use Tcsh, written by multiple authors, within rxvt,
although Bash, GNU's &ldquo;Bourne again shell&rdquo;, is a fine
alternative.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d7b580.0x1e73870"></a>The Command Line</h2></div></div><p>While I prefer most graphical programs to their command line
alternatives (ftptool instead of ftp, for example), terminal
windows continue to provide three important uses. First, most of my
routine system administration tasks are performed with homegrown
perl and shell scripts running in a term window. While many fine
GUI program builders are available (such as Tcl/Tk), it is still
simpler to program shell scripts for command line input and output.
Complex networking, file management, searches, or other system
activities are most easily performed in this manner. Second, even
as SLIP and PPP become more widespread, wider support and better
responsiveness exists for terminal-based serial line
communications.</p><p>Finally, terminal windows usually provide much faster
interaction than GUI alternatives. It is much easier and faster to
type &ldquo;date&rdquo; at the command line than to open an Xclock (which
requires more keystrokes), move it and/or minimize it, read it, and
then close it. In addition, programs which do not require much user
interaction are best run as command-line applications to avoid the
additional resources and programming complexity required by
graphical applications. Linux's terminal windows serve as master
interfaces for all programs without sophisticated input/output
requirements and eliminate the need to open multiple windows for
different tasks.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d7b580.0x1e739d0"></a>Rxvt</h2></div></div><p>I prefer rxvt to xterm as an X-Windows terminal emulator.
Rxvt provides a subset of common xterm features with substantial
memory savings. The amounts of physical memory required by xterm
and rxvt, as reported by <span   class="bold"><b>top</b></span> (a
program that displays CPU activity), are 2120KB and 560KB,
respectively. Since I commonly run three to four X-Windows terminal
sessions simultaneously, I save approximately 6MB of memory by
using rxvt. Rxvt does not support Tektronix 4014 emulation or
session logging, but this is seldom a concern.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d7b580.0x1e73b30"></a>Tcsh</h2></div></div><p>Tcsh has enough features to merit another article, so I will
concentrate on just a few aspects with respect to its user
interface functions. Most notable is its excellent support of
Emacs-style command line editing. Typographical errors are easily
corrected by moving the cursor to the error with the arrow keys and
using editing commands such as <b  >ctrl-D</b> or
<b  >ctrl-K</b> to make the modification. Previous
commands can be edited in the same fashion by first scrolling back
through the history list using the up arrow. Filename completion is
enabled by putting <b  >set filec</b> in .cshrc (the tcsh
configuration file located in the user's home directory), which
enables the user to type in just a few characters of a long
filename and press <b  >tab</b> to complete the remainder
(assuming those characters are unique). This feature has become so
useful and natural to me that I find myself constantly pressing
<b  >tab</b> in situations which do not support it, such
as remote ftp session or when I need to work under MS-DOS. As an
example, If I want to view the contents of text file
OptimizingLinuxUserInterface, I simply type <b  >cat
Opt</b><b  >tab</b><b  >return</b>, and
the filename is completed for me&mdash;unless there is another file
with those first three characters. In that case, I need to supply
additional characters.</p><p>Tcsh also has advanced ways to set the prompt, which I use to
keep track of the present working directory (indentation is
important). From my .cshrc:</p><p><b  >:set prompt = '\n%B%n@%m%b:%/ %h %#
'</b></p><p>gives: <b  >root@regal:/home/root 27 #</b></p><p>when working as the user root on the machine regal in the
directory /home/root with a current history command number of
27.</p><p>I also like the <b  >ctrl-alt-Z</b> shortcut tcsh
provides to allow me to jump from the shell to a suspended version
of Emacs and <b  >ctrl-Z</b> to bring me back to the
shell. It has eliminated my dependence on Emacs's internal shell,
which displays some non-standard behavior regarding key
assignments.</p><p>Having been accustomed to command.com for many years, my
favorite feature of tcsh and other Unix shells are aliases. As have
most Linux users, I've aliased extremely common commands such as
<b  >ls, ls -l, rlogin</b>, and <b  >less</b>
to <b  >l. ll, r</b>, and <b  >t</b> (short for
type). This is easily done in .cshrc with lines like</p><p><b  >alias rlogin 'lr'</b></p><p>Here are a few useful and representative selections from my
.cshrc for file viewing, process logging, telnet access, floppy
formatting, and remounting the hard drive if it boots read-only
(note: the last one comes up all the time frantically in Usenet's
comp.os.linux hierarchy).</p><pre     class="programlisting">
:
alias t           'expand -5 \!* | less'
alias pss         'ps -au | grep $user | less'
# Syntax: pss &lt;user&gt;
alias archie      'telnet archie.internic.net'
alias formatfd0   'echo "Using ext2 filesystem."
                   fdformat /dev/fd0H1440;
                   mkfs -t ext2 /dev/fd0H14440'
alias remountroot  'set temp = $PWD; cd /;
                   mount -w -n -o remount /;
                   cd $temp'
</pre><p>Excellent shell tools such as tcsh and rxvt are one reason
why I consider Linux's interface to be superior to most non-Unix
operating systems. DOS, Windows, NT, and even the Mac do not offer
this powerful and fast means for program and system
interaction.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d7b580.0x1e74580"></a>Fvwm</h2></div></div><p>Fvwm is an excellent choice for a window manager, providing
most or all of the functionality of Motif in far less memory (like
rxvt compared with xterm). Fvwm was derived from twm code, but
designed to use fewer system resources. Informal tests with top
show that fvwm uses 700KB of physical memory (RSS) compared to
OpenLook's 900KB, twm's 1700KB, and mvwms's (Motif) 1900KB. Not
even the author still remembers what fvwm stands for, although I've
often heard &ldquo;feeble virtual window manager&rdquo;. This is an
unfortunate name, since fvwm is far from feeble. [I suggest that
this is why the author chooses not to remember what it stands for.
&mdash;Ed]</p><p>Fvwm employs a virtual desktop like olvwm with a maximum size
of 32KB pixels squared (I doubt anyone would ever take advantage of
such gargantuan proportions), and has a look and feel very similar
to Motif. Sticky windows can be assigned which stay on the screen
regardless of which virtual desktop is currently being viewed. As
with Motif, resizing windows invokes a helpful grid showing the
changing dimensions of the window. Shaped windows are supported,
but increase memory utilization by 60KB (I don't use these).</p><p>Fvwm utilizes &ldquo;modules&rdquo;, a concept not shared by other
window managers. Modules are separate programs which may be
independently developed, yet which are integrated into fvwm.
Modules run as separate Linux processes, spawned by fvwm such that
a pair of pipes are used to transmit commands back and forth for
execution. While this design may be superior for window manager
programming, it is particularly important to the average Linux
enthusiast because it provides more functionality than most window
managers.</p><p>Fvwm's man page is very long (36 pages) and complete. More
important, the sample configuration file which comes bundled with
fvwm is crammed with comments and useful defaults. Fvwm is like
other window managers or X-Windows applications in that great
control may be exercised over almost every aspect of display.
Window color, border size, and window behavior are easily specified
in the .fvwmrc or .Xdefaults file. Specific directions for such
modifications are available in the default .fvwmrc file.
Configuring fvwm should not be difficult.</p><p>I find that the most useful desktop interface feature offered
by fvwm (and most other window managers) is its root menu.
Customization of the root menu provides easy access over almost
every aspect of the system. On my Linux workstation, the first five
root entries (Apps, Docs, Desktop, Network, and System) are
pointers to submenus.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Apps</b></span> contains all
productivity X-Windows applications, like xemacs, xv, etc.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Docs</b></span> are common ASCII
documents which I constantly need to access, such as my to-do list.
I also use this submenu to organize the many, many ASCII
configuration files used by Linux. Since I have Emacs running at
all times, the .fvwmrc statement controlling this entry runs
emacsserver:</p><p><b  >Exec "To do list" exec emacsclient /home/root/todo
&amp;</b></p><p>Emacsserver then loads the running Emacs with my document and
switches buffers to display the new document. This method saves
memory and minimizes the number of windows on my screen.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Desktop</b></span> modifies the
appearance of the screen and is used to invoke screen savers and
change backgrounds. For example, I can call each of the different
xlock screen savers in my .fvwmrc with:</p><p><b  >Popup "DesktopScreensavers" Exec "Fractal Flame"
exec xlock -nolock -nice 0 -mode flame &amp; Exec "Game of life"
exec xlock -nolock -nice 0 -mode life &amp; ...
EndPopup</b></p><p>I can load and automatically expand any graphic to serve as
background wallpaper with:</p><p><b  >Exec "Starry skies" xv -root -max -quit
/data/wallpaper/VanGogh1.jpg</b></p><p>or create a texture (a small graphic which may be tiled to
give an interesting background) with:</p><p><b  >Exec "Red brick wall" xv -root -quit
/data/wallpaper/redbrick.jpg</b></p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Network</b></span> runs any of the
common browsers or utilities, such as FTP, Archie, Gopher, etc. I
also use this menu to access the different network daemons
currently running.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>System</b></span> lists a wide variety
of utilities involved with system administration. For those of you
familiar with Windows 3.11, this entry is similar to, but
substantially more powerful and customizaable than, the control
panel applet. One entry in the submenu runs my perl backup script
in a new rxvt window; another opens the excellent keyboard mapping
utility xkeycaps:</p><p><b  >Exec "Keyboard mapping" exec xkeycaps -keyboard DELL
&amp;</b></p><p>Other entries in my root menu start the screen blanker (I
have a Nokia monitor which powers down upon receiving a black
screen), refresh the window, and exit fvwm.</p><p>For an excellent (albeit expensive) reference to extensive
root menu customization, see <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Shell Hacker's Guide to
X and Motif</em></span> by Alan Southerton.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d7b580.0x226d328"></a>GoodStuff</h2></div></div><p>The <span   class="bold"><b>GoodStuff</b></span> iconbar is
truly one of the most useful Linux utilities I have ever found.
GoodStuff is a fvwm module and only runs under fvwm. GoodStuff is
an iconbar extremely similar to that found on the NeXT and to a
lesser extent like Window's Dashboard or RipBAR. GoodStuff uses
approximately 500KB of memory and very little CPU resources. The
configuration file is the same as fvwm, .fvwmrc.</p><p>GoodStuff's primary use is simply to assign iconic buttons to
commonly-used applications so that they may be started with a
single mouse click. For example, I have rxvt terminals assigned to
each machine in my home network which I can immediately log into.
This is substantially faster than my old method of typing
<b  >xterm</b>, moving the mouse into the window's field
of view, clicking for focus, typing <b  >rlogin
<i><tt>machine name</tt></i></b>, and then
entering my password.</p><p>I also have common utilities, such as my mail utility,
ftptool, Emacs editor, netscape, file manager, and so forth
attached to individual buttons. I limit the GoodStuff iconbar to a
dozen buttons (laid out in a 2<b  >'</b>6 matrix),
because each one takes valuable screen real estate, especially
since I have it set permanently in the foreground. Rxvt, my most
commonly started application, is not included in GoodStuff but
instead is mapped to the middle mouse button on the root window. I
can immediately pop up a new rxvt window by simply clicking the
second button on the background wallpaper. Less commonly used
programs are attached to the root menu (as described in the
previous section).</p><p>Button bars are hardly novel. What
<span   class="bold"><b>is</b></span> special about GoodStuff is that
one may assign running X-Windows applications to each button and
use the button as the display. For example, I have xload running as
a 2x1 button at the top of the GoodStuff menubar, and it displays
just as it would in a small window. I have xbiff in another window,
which alerts me if mail has arrived (the button's color becomes
inverted, and it is very noticable). I even have a less well-known
but equally useful X-Windows app called xosview which monitors
instantaneous CPU, memory, disk, and network usage as a small
colored bar graph. It is very helpful for me to watch this program
running in the GoodStuff button bar to see when I'm taxing the
network or CPU or running out of memory or disk space. All I needed
to do to incorporate xosview into GoodStuff was the following line
in the .fvwmrc:</p><p><b  >*GoodStuff - whatever Swallow "xosview" xosview -bg
grey -geometry 210x96-1500-1500 &amp;</b></p><p>I also have fvwm's 2x2 virtual desktop at the bottom of the
GoodStuff menu bar. I don't use it all that often, but it is a
handy feature when needed.</p><p>Other fvwm modules exist, including Pager, Banner, WinList,
Clean, Ident, Save, Scroll, Debug, and Sound. I don't use them as
much as GoodStuff, but they are all useful utilities.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d7b580.0x226d8a8"></a>Conclusions</h2></div></div><p>The strategy
described above uses fvwm, tcsh, and other utilities to generate an
effective desktop interface to manage programs, data, and system
resources. While lacking in certain features, such as drag-and-drop
desktop tools and object-oriented metaphors, the combination of
these tools creates a desktop which is more flexible, customizable,
and powerful than competing paradigms. Current versions of these
tools are freely available at many Internet sites including
ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux.</p></div></div>
