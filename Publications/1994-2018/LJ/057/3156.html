Server Marketing for the IBM Software Group in Somers, New York. He
has overall marketing responsibility for IBM's web server software
product line, including the WebSphere Family product line. He began
working for IBM in 1980 and has held a variety of international
positions. Mr. Sweeney received a degree in Business Studies from
University College Dublin in 1980. I interviewed Mr. Sweeney by
e-mail in October 1998.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: What event first
brought Apache to your attention?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Paraic</b></span>: Internally, IBM has
always used a variety of web servers, including the Apache HTTP
server. Based on the knowledge of Apache's past performance, IBM
made the decision to ship the Apache HTTP server with the IBM
WebSphere Application Server and to provide commercial,
enterprise-level support for the Apache HTTP server as part of the
WebSphere Application Server package.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: What sort of
evaluation procedures did you use to decide to support
Apache?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Paraic</b></span>: The Apache team
talked to groups within IBM who were already familiar with Apache,
and to external customers to get feedback on the Apache HTTP
server. In addition, IBM conducted an extensive code review of the
server, looking at code that the Apache Project has created, from
both a performance and legal perspective. The methods by which code
changes are implemented were also evaluated to ensure that IBM
could participate in the manner outlined by the Apache
Project.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: What advantages do
you see in having products that support Apache?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Paraic</b></span>: Support for the
Apache HTTP server will allow IBM customers to benefit from the
broad range of skills and partners in the marketplace. An extensive
amount of expertise is available for building and maintaining
Apache-based web sites. By following the Apache process closely,
IBM can get quicker insight into a wide variety of customer needs
for web-based products. Supporting the Apache server also enables
IBM to leverage the large installed base the Apache server
currently has&mdash;over 50% in the most recent Netcraft survey.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>:
Disadvantages?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Paraic</b></span>: IBM must get
accustomed to working within the guidelines of the Apache Project,
which are different from the usual IBM way of developing software.
In addition, the Apache HTTP server currently does not contain some
functionality customers are interested in, and IBM is working with
the Apache Project to add additional capabilities to the
server.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: Could you mention
some functionality that IBM is working on with Apache?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Paraic</b></span>: Fast Response Cache
Accelerator and SSL support are being added to the WebSphere
Application Server, and the Apache HTTP Server is being ported to
the AS/400.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: Could you expand
on the differences (which guidelines in particular are
different)?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Paraic</b></span>: As a member of the
Apache Project, IBM is working within the guidelines already
developed by the Apache Group. Details on these guidelines can be
found at http://www.apache.org/. Since submitted code is approved
by the Apache Group, it is different from an IBM internal
development process.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: What do you find
most attractive about Apache?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Paraic</b></span>: Extensive and
powerful source code with a very large installed base, along with a
large base of skilled developers who are constantly looking for
ways to improve their web site development skills.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: How do you compare
Apache with other HTTP servers?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Paraic</b></span>: We believe Apache is
the best general purpose web server available.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: What other
platforms do you support?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Paraic</b></span>: Currently, for IBM's
WebSphere Application Server, Standard Edition, we support NT,
Solaris and AIX. Additional platforms are being evaluated.
WebSphere Application Server, Standard Edition also supports
several additional HTTP servers including Microsoft IIS, Netscape
Enterprise Edition, Netscape FastTrack and Lotus Domino Go
Webserver.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: Is Linux one of
the additional platforms being considered?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Pariac</b></span>: As an ongoing
business practice, IBM is constantly evaluating operating system
and platform considerations to meet our customers'
requirements.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: Do you plan to
support Apache with all your products? If not, why not?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Paraic</b></span>: IBM has thousands of
products, and many of them require an HTTP server to operate. As
the needs of individual products requiring an HTTP server are
updated, Apache will be considered. The first WebSphere product to
be released after the announcement, WebSphere Application Server,
Standard Edition Version 1.1, includes Apache on the CD. Customers
who purchase this edition are entitled to the same IBM support for
the included Apache server as they get for the WebSphere
Application Server, Standard Edition.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: Tell us about the
products on which you are using Apache and why you chose Apache for
these products.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Paraic</b></span>: The main product
line that drove the need for using Apache at IBM was the WebSphere
product line. WebSphere Application Server, Standard Edition is
IBM's Java servlet-based web application server that helps
customers deploy and manage web-based applications, ranging from
simple web sites to powerful e-business solutions. IBM wanted the
broadest possible audience for the WebSphere products. By making
the developer comfortable with his current operating environment of
Apache, IBM enables these Apache developers to extend their web
site building capabilities with the products from the WebSphere
product line.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: Have you
considered making any of your products Open Source?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Paraic</b></span>: IBM has made Open
Source code available on http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/ when
appropriate.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: What do you think
needs to be added to Apache to make it more attractive to business
users?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Paraic</b></span>: The main features
IBM sees business users requesting are SSL (secure socket layer)
security, an easy to use GUI interface and support for threading of
requests.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: Apache seems to be
climbing rapidly in popularity with all the PR it has gotten
recently. How long do you expect that to last?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Paraic</b></span>: Because of the
rapidly changing nature of the Internet, IBM cannot predict the
popularity of any product. IBM does note that over 50% of the HTTP
servers surveyed by http://www.netcraft.com/ are operated on
Apache.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: What do you see in
the future for your company and Apache?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Paraic</b></span>: IBM is pleased to be
working with Apache, to participate in the highly successful Apache
Project and to bring industry-leading service and support to the
Apache HTTP server. IBM has joined the Apache developer effort as a
core member that contributes code. IBM plans to continue
contributions under the existing framework that has served the
Apache developer community so well in the past. By working within
the Apache Project, IBM hopes to help the Apache web server
community continue to advance into enterprises with IBM support and
IBM- contributed code.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: Thanks for your
time.</p></div></div>
