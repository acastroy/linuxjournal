    Dr. Bentson did a survey of Linux kernel developers to find
    out about their backgrounds. Here are the results.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xebb580.0xfb3450"></a></h2></div></div><p>I get mail from folks about my book, the
device driver I wrote for Linux, and about articles I've written
for <i  >Linux Journal</i>. A few months ago I got one
which said, in part:
<div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>My boss is a great guy to work for ...[but he] is
of the opinion that Linux is the work of &ldquo;college punks&rdquo; and will
not consider it for serious work.</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>He had a nightmare with the MINIX file system and
is permanently convinced that UNIX simply cannot be trusted and
that Linux is the work of pimply-faced sophomores with time on
their hands. I got a good laugh out of that while looking at your
picture and reading your bio.</p></blockquote></div>

I can only hope his laughter was kindly. The opinions expressed by
his boss weren't the first I've heard of that sort. Nor, I fear,
will this be the end of it. Nonetheless, I decided to take a shot
at confronting these claims.
</p><p>I had suspicions that Linux contributors are a bright,
experienced and well-educated bunch of folks. The discussions in
the various Linux newsgroups and mailing lists aren't lightweight,
nor is the resulting operating system. My &ldquo;feel&rdquo; of the operating
system is that it's based on a lot of mature judgments and there is
some theoretical grounding in what's being done.</p><p><a href="2931s1.html" target="_self">Credits</a></p><p>I gathered up a list of contributors (from
/usr/src/linux/CREDITS) and sent off 241 notes. Partial text of
this note is shown in the sidebar, &ldquo;Letter to Contributors&rdquo;. I
sent my notes with some trepidation&mdash;I didn't want to bother folks
while they were working on important projects, and I feared a lack
of response.</p><p><a href="2931s2.html" target="_self">Letter to
Contributors</a></p><p>I needn't have worried. So far I've received 103 replies,
many of which have included a few words of encouragement. It seems
that I wasn't the only one who wanted to respond to unjustified
complaints about Linux. (Another 29 notes were returned with
address errors. I hope to see corrections to the CREDITS
file.)</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xebb580.0xfb3978"></a>Education</h2></div></div><p>The level of response was the first piece of good news. The
second was that I've been stunned by how strong the development
team is with regards to both credentials and experience.</p><p>From these replies I found:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>1 had completed just basic public education (high
school)</p></li><li><p>15 had attended college or technical school</p></li><li><p>23 had an undergraduate degree (B.S., B.A.,
etc.)</p></li><li><p>19 had attended graduate school</p></li><li><p>15 had a graduate degree (M.S., M.A., etc.)</p></li><li><p>9 had done further graduate work</p></li><li><p>19 had a terminal degree (Ph.D., M.D., etc.)</p></li></ul></div><p>That's got to totally demolish the image of college
hackers&mdash;at least the sophomore part of it. I figured I was an
exception when I started working on the Cyclades driver while
avoiding rewriting my dissertation. I thought, once folks were
awarded a Ph.D., they would be busy with research, teaching or some
other interest. I guess Linux development may be the doctor's
favorite hobby.
</p><p>When I offered an earlier summary of these results, my
correspondent reported that his boss wisely intoned, &ldquo;those folks
are all academia and none of them have ever tried to run a
business.&rdquo;</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xebb580.0xfb40b0"></a>Experience</h2></div></div><p>I had sort of expected a comment along those lines and
fortunately asked a few more questions in my survey. One hundred of
the replies also reported the number of years spent programming or
doing system design.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>4 had 1 year</p></li><li><p>10 had 2-4 years</p></li><li><p>31 had 5-9 years</p></li><li><p>40 had 10-20 years</p></li><li><p>16 had 20+ years</p></li></ul></div><p>More than a few of us were programming before the integrated
circuit came into general use. (Perhaps a mixed blessing&mdash;some of
us may still suffer from post-FORTRAN syndrome.)
</p><p>As I noted earlier, I have also felt that Linux has
benefitted from a broad experience in its developer base. Linux may
be a first operating system for a lucky few, but almost everyone
(all but three) claimed to be at least a skilled user of another
operating system. Eighty-three were skilled users of several other
operating systems.</p><p>Nor was their contribution to the Linux kernel the first of
that sort. Twenty have contributed to another operating system and
another twenty-two have contributed to several other operating
systems. One reported:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Speaking for myself, I had the same idea Linus
did, but he beat me to it. (I've heard others say this as well.) I
knew how to build a UNIX-like system from the ground up, and there
was a need for it for PCs. (Vendors were charging exorbitant
amounts for poor products in those days, and there was no good
32-bit development system for 386s.) I just didn't have the time. I
had been playing with MINIX when Linus showed up on the MINIX
newsgroups, and it took off from there. I can tell you that though
I was a student at the time, I'd been a professional systems
programmer for many years before. So, I and many others knew what
professional quality software was, as well as how to produce it. I
think it turned out pretty well.</p></blockquote></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xebb580.0xfb4738"></a>Current Use</h2></div></div><p>Finally, I wanted to know if the contributors were &ldquo;doing
Linux&rdquo; in their careers. Eighty-two said their current employment
was based on their computer skills. It was interesting to note that
over a third reported their current employment supported or relied
on their Linux development efforts. Sadly, two reported they were
currently unemployed, but one of those also noted that he was
&ldquo;voluntarily unemployed to have time to put my life in better
order.&rdquo;</p><p>Perhaps one significant difference between Linux development
and academic or commercial development is the duration of personal
interest. In an academic setting, a student typically has one term,
or at most one year, to work on any given program. When programmers
leave a company, support is picked up by someone who has no sense
of what has gone before. There is greater continuity in the Linux
community because of the nature of submission and distribution. No
matter what is happening at school or where one works day to day,
contributors can keep in touch with progress on their piece of the
puzzle. One person noted, &ldquo;Personally, I did start my code in
school, but that does not stop me from maintaining it now.&rdquo;</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xebb580.0xfb4898"></a>Motivations</h2></div></div><p>There are some other issues which weren't addressed by my
survey. Although it might not seem relevant to quality and
performance, a person's interest has a great deal to do with the
outcome&mdash;it leads to a distinction between &ldquo;craftsmanship&rdquo; and
&ldquo;work product&rdquo;. Another person noted:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>&ldquo;Intent&rdquo; is what I think all of these debates
are about. In the commercial world there is only one true answer to
&ldquo;Why are you helping develop Linux?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;To make a living.&rdquo; In
the Linux community I'm quite certain the answer would be more
closely aligned to &ldquo;For me to use.&rdquo; The Linux community tends to
be self-driven and self-motivated, and that is what leads to the
successes and the apparent failures in our development
environment.</p></blockquote></div><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>We are not a company; we don't have any one
person, or group of people, setting the direction Linux will take.
That direction is set by those with the energy to actually
<span   class="emphasis"><em>do</em></span> something.</p></blockquote></div><p>Another motive, akin to what pushed me to first join the
effort, was shared by another respondent who said, &ldquo;When I wrote
[my code] for the Linux kernel I was working at [my former
employer]. Linux use there was extensive, and I wanted to give
something back.&rdquo;
</p><p>Motivation leads to the final and most significant issue&mdash;one
which cannot be examined by a developer survey.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xebb580.0xfb4c08"></a>Quality</h2></div></div><p>In a world driven by marketing, image is the basis for
purchasing decisions. Even if a good image could be established for
Linux by listing credentials or tabulating years of experience, I'd
be reluctant to shift to that level. I'd much rather see acceptance
and popularity for Linux based on quality and performance.</p><p>Even though I hadn't asked specific questions on this topic,
a few people offered comments. One note seemed to identify, however
obliquely, what may be the key to Linux's success.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>In general, my experience is that most software I
have seen which was developed by students is not of the
professional quality I would like to see. On the other hand, much
of the commercial software I have seen, which was developed by
professional software development companies, is also not of the
professional quality I would like to see. The difference is most
people do not get to see the internals of commercial
software.</p></blockquote></div><p>Developing on this theme, another wrote:
<div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>The reason Linux is stable and usable is not
because of its student programmers [or lack thereof]. It is because
of the overwhelming feedback that alpha and beta testers provide.
When you read the Linux kernel, you will find many parts are poorly
structured, poorly written and poorly documented. However, people
dared to test it and report their problems; Linus and friends
respected the error reports and went ahead to fix them. That is why
it works so well.</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>In addition, psychology sometimes causes weird
effects. If a user discovers a bug in his system, reports the bug
and sees it fixed eventually, that user is happy because he was
treated with respect. Most likely, he is even happier than he would
be in the bug-free case.</p></blockquote></div>

We not only need to bring the CREDITS file into an accurate state,
but we also need to acknowledge the thousands who have contributed
to Linux by using it and sharing their discoveries&mdash;good or
bad&mdash;with others.
</p><p>Peter H. Salus reports the UNIX philosophy in <span   class="emphasis"><em>A
Quarter Century of UNIX</em></span> as:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Write programs to work together.</p></li><li><p>Write programs that handle text streams, because
that is a universal interface.</p></li></ul></div><p>I'd like to close by adding another entry, suggested by UNIX
and dominant in Linux:
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Write programs you enjoy.</p></li></ul></div>

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xebb580.0xfabc28"></a>Postscript</h2></div></div><p>I just received a note from the person who sparked the
original survey. He reports:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>I took my &ldquo;hand-me-down&rdquo; Linux box, an
unimpressive 75MHz Pentium with 64MB RAM and a tiny 600MB HD to
work. My boss was amazed that office applications such as
StarOffice were available and was quite impressed when I read a
Word document with StarOffice and then converted it to HTML. Samba
was another revelation. Overall performance impressed him. In a few
crude tests, it outperformed a &ldquo;commercial&rdquo; system running with
128MB RAM, dual 200MHz processors and all ultra-fast/ultra-wide
SCSI drives.</p></blockquote></div><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>After a couple of callers indicated an interest
in UNIX versions, we checked the price of current systems. My boss
decided Linux was indeed priced right, and asked me to start on a
port.</p></blockquote></div><p>It looks like we've won one more away from the dark side.
