commercial product to modify a computer's partitions
non-destructively. Developed originally for OS/2 and then ported to
DOS and MS Windows, previous versions of PartitionMagic have been
able to create, destroy, resize and copy FAT-16, FAT-32, HPFS and
NTFS partitions, as well as convert from FAT-16 to any of the other
formats. Needless to say, this has been a great boon to those with
multiple operating systems, since it frees them from the tyranny of
fixed partition sizes, allowing changes to disk resource allocation
without the need to back up to tape, re-partition and restore. Up
to version 3.05, however, PartitionMagic included no Linux-specific
support. We could modify file systems for DOS, MS Windows and OS/2,
but if we needed to modify Linux file systems, we had to do the
backup/re-partition/restore dance or use various other workarounds,
such as creating new partitions for spillover from existing
partitions. PartitionMagic 4.0 promises to change this, with
support for Linux EXT2 and Linux swap partition types.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cae580.0x1da6978"></a>Program Features</h2></div></div><p>PartitionMagic 4.0 contains an impressive array of features
for partition management. These features are included:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The ability to create and delete partitions: when
created, partitions can be formatted for FAT-16, FAT-32, HPFS,
NTFS, EXT2 or Linux swap. Partition table entries will
automatically be marked with the appropriate file system
type.</p></li><li><p>The ability to move and resize partitions: this
feature applies to all supported partition types, including Linux
swap. For FAT, allocation block sizes are adjusted automatically as
appropriate. Unlike previous versions of PartitionMagic, 4.0's move
and resize features are integrated into one. Partitions can be
moved and resized in one user-interface operation and they can be
resized towards or away from the beginning of the drive as well as
the end. Such operations may result in two or more actual actions,
however.</p></li><li><p>Partition copy: this copies a partition from one
location to another, including across physical disks, and works
with all supported partition types. This makes it possible to
replace a hard drive easily by copying multiple operating systems
to a new drive with a single program. The copies are fast, too; I
timed a copy of my Linux /home directory from one drive to another
at 3:40 in PartitionMagic, vs. 5:38 using a tar pipe in Linux. The
downside is that the copy seems to be doing a semi-raw copy
followed by (if necessary) a resize, meaning that fragmentation is
maintained on the copy.</p></li><li><p>The Boot Magic boot loader: this utility manages
the booting of multiple operating systems. In principle, it is much
like LILO; when installed to a partition, it resides on a FAT
partition and re-directs the boot process to another partition. It
is graphical in nature, however, so may be more user friendly in
operation than LILO. Boot Magic, like LILO but unlike OS/2's Boot
Manager, does not require the allocation of its own
partition.</p></li><li><p>The ability to manage (but not create) IBM Boot
Manager partitions: this may be of interest to OS/2 users and those
who installed Boot Manager using PartitionMagic 3.0x.</p></li><li><p>File system conversion: FAT-16 file systems can be
converted to FAT-32, HPFS or NTFS (but not to EXT2). FAT-32
partitions can be converted to FAT-16 partitions.</p></li><li><p>Drive integrity checks: this performs operations
similar to those done by Linux's
<span   class="bold"><b>e2fsck</b></span> or MS Windows' CHKDSK or
SCANDISK.</p></li><li><p>Operation from DOS or MS Windows: the OS/2 native
executable has been dropped, and there is no native Linux version.
Linux users can create a working system from Linux alone, however,
as described below.</p></li><li><p>Batch mode operation: a series of partition changes
can be set up which PartitionMagic will then run in sequence. This
allows you to do other things while your computer re-configures
itself unattended. In case of an error, the batch execution will
halt.</p></li><li><p>&ldquo;Wizards&rdquo; to advise and help guide the user
through processes such as balancing free disk space, adding a new
operating system, etc.</p></li></ul></div><p>In addition, PartitionMagic has a handful of other features
that are of interest primarily to DOS or MS Windows users. For
example, it has the ability to move applications from one FAT
partition to another and diagnostics to help determine the best
possible partition sizes for optimum FAT allocation block use.
</p><p>PartitionMagic is available for download directly from
PowerQuest's web site (via an on-line secure order form that asks
for a credit card number) and as a retail package. I purchased my
copy via the web site, using my existing 2.02 license number to
obtain the upgrade pricing. The entire download is on the order of
50MB, so you will need several hours and/or a fast net connection
if you choose to get it in this way. I received ample documentation
in Adobe PDF format.</p><p>The program is definitely geared towards MS Windows users:
when burned to CD, the files create a CD that includes an
auto-install program when inserted into a MS Windows machine. Some
of the more esoteric features seem to be present only in the MS
Windows version of the program, but the one of greatest potential
interest to Linux users, Boot Magic, requires a FAT partition to
operate in the first place, so this is not a major loss. The
installation files include a directory called &ldquo;linux&rdquo; which
contains two disk images that can be copied to blank 1.44MB
floppies. The first of these is a bootable OpenDOS 7.01 disk image
with the main DOS PartitionMagic 4.0 executable and a few support
files, including a Microsoft mouse driver. The second image
includes help files for accessing PartitionMagic's help system from
the first disk. Thus, those with Linux and no other OS can still
use PartitionMagic by booting this floppy. It can, of course, be
customized with other mouse drivers or features. Some of my
testing, described below, was done with this DOS disk and some of
it was done with MS Windows. Aside from the &ldquo;Wizards&rdquo;, the DOS
and MS Windows versions of the program perform similarly.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cae580.0x1da7318"></a>PartitionMagic in Operation</h2></div></div><p>I ran PartitionMagic through a series of tests on my system.
I have a SCSI-based computer using a Symbios 53c860-based SCSI host
adapter with a secondary adapter based on the Initio 9100UW chip. I
ran tests with my SCSI hard disks attached to each of these
adapters, with similar results both times. My hard disks include a
4GB Micropolis UltraSCSI, a 2GB Micropolis Fast SCSI-2 and a 2GB
IBM UltraSCSI. Since one of the 2GB drives was used entirely for
Linux swap space and temporary storage for CD-ROM creation, I was
able to use it as a test-bed drive, copying file systems from the
other two drives and modifying them with impunity. Most of my tests
involved copying, moving and resizing EXT2 and HPFS partitions,
although I also tried some operations on FAT-16 and FAT-32
partitions.</p><p>In operation, PartitionMagic 4.0 was relatively easy to use
and worked as advertised&mdash;some of the time. Unfortunately, it
produced errors of one sort or another on my system at least as
often as it functioned correctly. Sometimes the errors would appear
at the end of an operation and not have any apparent ill effect. A
few times they would appear at the beginning of an operation,
causing it to abort. Other times, particularly with copy
operations, errors would occur at the end of an operation and abort
it. I also encountered file system corruption on some tests,
particularly tests involving HPFS. The one time I encountered
ext2fs corruption, e2fsck was able to correct the problems.</p><p>For a number of reasons, I am certain that my physical hard
drive system is not to blame for these problems. First, I did a
low-level format on the IBM drive I was using as a test bed, so I
am certain it was free from physical defects. Second,
PartitionMagic 4.0 reported no errors on the drive when it was
configured to check for them prior to each operation. Third,
problems occurred on both the IBM and the Micropolis 2GB when I
reconfigured my system to use it for the tests. Fourth, problems
occurred with both the Symbios 53c860 board and the Initio board as
the host for the hard disks. Finally, problems did not occur when I
tried the same operations with PartitionMagic 2.02 (when they were
possible with that version of the program).</p><p>Thus, I am quite certain that PartitionMagic 4.0 has some
serious bugs. These bugs are so severe and so obvious that I find
it hard to believe a reputable company would ship a product knowing
these bugs existed. Therefore, I must conclude that PowerQuest did
not know they existed (although I have now filed extensive bug
reports with them) and that something about my system was turning
up bugs in the software. Perhaps the peculiar drive geometry on my
first physical disk (1018 cylinders, 133 heads, 62 cylinders),
produced by the Symbios host adapter, has something to do with it;
or maybe PowerQuest simply did minimal testing with SCSI systems;
or perhaps their testing used relatively simple partitioning. My
drives each have at least two partitions and problems tended to
turn up more frequently with three or more partitions.</p><p>In addition to the out-and-out primary function bugs,
Partition Magic has a number of limitations, some of which would
not even occur to many people except that the program really can do
so much. Specifically:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The Boot Magic program had problems booting a
FreeBSD partition on my system.</p></li><li><p>The program has problems with some Linux-created
partition tables. Specifically, and according to the PartitionMagic
documentation, Linux's fdisk creates extended partitions with
logical partitions listed in order of creation, which may not be
the same as the order of the partitions themselves (e.g., sda6 may
appear before sda5). PartitionMagic 4.0 will choke on such
partition tables, though version 2.02 doesn't seem to have any
problem with them.</p></li><li><p>There appears to be no way to merge the contents of
two partitions; if you have, say, /usr and /usr/X11R6 on two
partitions on one drive, you can't turn them into one partition
from within PartitionMagic (although you can increase the size of
/usr, reboot to Linux, copy /usr/X11R6 to the enlarged /usr, reboot
to PartitionMagic, delete /usr/X11R6 and increase the size of /usr
again).</p></li><li><p>Re-sizing or moving a Linux boot partition will
render the partition unbootable (assuming LILO is being used to
load a kernel image off that partition). Linux users would do well
to ensure that they have a floppy with a kernel image, and also a
full-fledged Linux boot system with a text editor to handle any
necessary changes in /etc/fstab after moving, adding or deleting
partitions.</p></li><li><p>The batch nature of the operations can result in
some truly brainless series of operations. If you enter a partition
resize operation, then decide you want to perform a different
resize on the same partition, both will most likely be executed,
although one would do. Fortunately, you can clear the entire queue
of changes; however, you can't delete a single operation.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cae580.0x1da7948"></a>Recommendations</h2></div></div><p>The above may appear to paint a rather bleak picture&mdash;to some
extent, this is justified. The types of operations performed by
PartitionMagic are inherently dangerous and bugs in such a program
are a serious matter. On the other hand, my suspicion that the bugs
manifest due to something specific about my system may mean that
others may have better luck. PowerQuest also has a good reputation
for producing reliable software, so I have high hopes that they
will correct these problems. Assuming this happens, PartitionMagic
4.0x will be an excellent program and a must-have utility for
anyone managing multiple operating systems on one computer. The
$69.95 price may seem a bit high, but if you have ever spent most
of a day juggling partitions around using tape backups, removable
disks or some similar mechanism, you'll recognize the appeal of
being able to do that quickly and on the fly. If you own a previous
version of PartitionMagic, the $29.95 upgrade price represents a
true savings for any Linux user, since it radically improves on the
program's utility for the Linux community.</p><p>The best possible way to use PartitionMagic seems to be as an
exclusive means of managing partitions on a drive. Because of
incompatibilities such as the one mentioned above with Linux's
fdisk, I recommend using PartitionMagic to create all the new
partitions on a disk. If you find yourself with a disk that
PartitionMagic won't handle because of Linux-created logical
partitions, you may be able to use Linux's fdisk to delete the
offending partitions and recreate them in the correct order. If
you're careful to create new partitions of precisely the correct
size, your partitions will still be usable, but I strongly
recommend backing them up before attempting such an
operation.</p><p>If version 4.01 is not available by the time you read this, I
recommend waiting for it unless you are in immediate need of
Partition Magic's abilities. If you must use version 4.0, use it
cautiously: back up all data before changing a partition, then run
e2fsck, CHKDSK, or SCANDISK on any modified partitions immediately
thereafter. (You may need to specify the <b  >-f</b>
option to e2fsck to be sure it runs on the partition.) A spot check
of the integrity of the data after a modification would also be a
good idea. Of course, these suggestions also apply to any program
that does low-level operations on a hard disk, but given the
problems I encountered with PartitionMagic 4.0, they apply even
more strongly to it.</p></div></div>
