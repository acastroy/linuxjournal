    Mr. Schaaf describes the concept and current development stage of
    this free business management software.
    </p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2914f2.jpg"></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x135c580.0x14543a0"></a></h2></div></div><p> If Linux wants to hold up in enterprises
other than Internet Service Providers (ISPs), the availability of
business management software is vital. Unfortunately, applications
in this field have been few and far between. The Linux-Kontor
project is an attempt to close this gap. Its aim is to create an
open, modern and modular program environment with central
components for the enterprise market and accounting. The concept
and current stage of development are described below.
</p><p>Linux-Kontor is a project for the development of a free
business management software suite. Core components of this suite
are Bookkeeping and Inventory Management modules with the three
requirements of platform-independence, Internet capabilities and
scalability.</p><p>Of course, Linux is already being used in many enterprises
(see the books listed in Resources). The classical use, in which
Linux has proven itself thousands of times, has been as a server
environment. There, Linux is being used as file, print,
communications and database servers, and ISPs rely on the penguin
for a whole range of Internet services.</p><p>Exotic uses, such as Debian Linux on a laptop in a space
shuttle or using Alpha workstations to create the special effects
for the movie <span   class="emphasis"><em>Titanic</em></span> are impressive, but in
my opinion do not necessarily help to show Linux as a basis for
&ldquo;normal&rdquo; use. A better way to do that would be to provide an
easy-to-use fa&ccedil;ade, which is the aim of projects such as KDE
(http://www.kde.org/) or GNOME (http://www.gnome.org/), or simply
through the availability of standard applications.</p><p>Linux-Kontor (LK) is destined to be one of the standard
business management applications. A strong interest (and market)
within the Linux community has been shown in numerous discussions
at the booth of the Linux Verband LIVE
(http://www.linux-verband.de/), the German counterpart to the
American Linux International; during this year's CeBit; and at the
MediaLIVE in Arnsberg, Germany (http://www.media-live.de/).
MediaLIVE is a trade show concentrating on small and medium-sized
enterprises in this country, where I talked about a related
subject.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x135c580.0x1454660"></a>Other Financial Software for Linux</h2></div></div><p>The strongest motivation for Linux-Kontor is the fact that
comparable software has not been available up to now. There are, of
course, applications for the home banking sector&mdash;the Personal
Financial Assistants (PFAs). Several projects have been created for
KDE and GNOME, including KPFA for the KDE desktop and GnoMoney for
GNOME (at least GTK is being used). Watermark has tried to support
both desktop systems by developing a graphical user interface (GUI)
for both. KPFA has been taken over by Watermark.</p><p>Older PFA projects such as Xacc (X Accountant) and CBB (Linux
Check Book Balancer), which were in use for some time, count on
Motif/Lesstif, respectively, with Perl/Tk for the widget set.
FreeMoney, one of the lesser-known business accounting projects,
uses Perl/Tk too.</p><p>In addition, several developers have united and started the
GnuCash project in which Xacc, GnoMoney and Watermark have been
merged. GnuCash is reputed to be suitable as both PFA and as
accounting software for operational applications, and will be
available for as many desktop systems as possible (Motif, GTK and
QT). Like all the other projects, GnuCash is LGPL licensed. It
pursues a &ldquo;Model-View-Controller&rdquo; strategy similar to LK. See
Resources for the web addresses of these projects.</p><p>Note that LK is not designed to be home banking software; it
has no connection to Quicken-like products.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x135c580.0x1454870"></a>Characteristics and Modules</h2></div></div><p>The LK project was started at the end of last year by
Bj&ouml;rn Bayard, CEO of IoS GmbH. Most IoS employees, including
me, are involved in its development. In addition, we have found
several volunteers via mailing lists who convert SQL scripts for
Adabas-D into PostgreSQL.</p><p>Linux-Kontor is Open Source software. It is designed to be
used in small and medium-sized enterprises&mdash;rather atypical places
for free software. Nevertheless, the source is free under the LGPL
license. We made it free for two reasons. First, we are convinced
of the efficiency of free software and believe this method of
development is well-suited for LK. Second, smaller companies in
particular are not guaranteed to survive. In this sense, free
software is a protective investment for clients, since they will at
least have the software sources in case the software company goes
out of business.</p><p>Furthermore, LK is modern in that it uses the most recent
software tools. Java is used, as it is the only programming
language offering many advantages; LK can be used on the Internet
and is platform-independent. It can work anywhere Java works; a
Java-enabled web browser is the only necessity. For those places
not yet working with Linux, this might turn out to be an advantage
(soft migration).</p><p>LK provides the ability to manage distributed objects
provided by Java via remote method invocation (RMI) and is modular
in the program's distribution and the scale of functions. It has a
three-tier architecture: a database server, an application server
and the clients. An already-existing RDBMS (relational database
management system) can be used as a database server. Adabas-D and
PostgreSQL are currently supported, with Adabas-D as the primary
database platform. Thus, you are not restricted to a special
database. You need only a JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) driver.
Support for further databases (e.g., MySQL) is a project for
volunteers.</p><p>As soon as Sun's JDK 1.2 is available, Linux-Kontor will be
converted to CORBA, allowing the integration of older and
non-Java-based systems.</p><p>The application server contacts the SQL database with the
help of JDBC and answers requests from application programs&mdash;the
so-called &ldquo;views&rdquo;, which build a connection to the application
server via RMI. These views are generally &ldquo;dumb&rdquo; clients whose
only job is to receive data from the server, present it, respond to
user inputs, and resend the processed data to the server. In most
cases, such a view is a single database record stored in a Java
object.</p><p>For the time being, these views must still be programmed
manually. It would be more desirable to have a &ldquo;Linux-Kontor
application builder&rdquo; through which a dialog window and access
methods for a special dataset could be easily defined. In order to
structure the work flow in a company, a work-flow module together
with a work-flow editor would be useful, as would a report
generator.</p><p>On the plus side, views are available for the customer
management module containing, among other things, address
management (see <a href="2914f1.jpg" target="_self">Figure 1</a>) and
administration of orders modules. Invoicing and financial
accounting modules are just being prepared.</p><p>LK regards a customer as either a company or a person, so
that different data can be stored. Address administration allows
the entering of different address types, e.g., bill-to address or
ship-to address, which can be used accordingly later on. To each
client, several contact persons (as many as you like) can be added.
Correspondence, mainly non-written, can be stored for future
purposes and forwarded via e-mail if necessary. An acquisition
module is planned in order to win new customers.</p><p>Included in the customer module, but independent of it, is a
program for order and invoice administration. Each order consists
of several items. Developments are already available for different
German industries, from printing works (e.g., the Offset Druck
Team) to Internet service providers (e.g., Delta Internet). The
&ldquo;Gemeinschaftswerk f&uuml;r Behinderte&rdquo; (a joint venture for the
handicapped) is also interested as a public institution.</p><p>On the minus side, modules for field-repair administration,
project management, payroll accounting (including working-time
registration) and stock management remain unfinished.</p><p>LK is scalable; several application servers can be used as
the number of clients increases. Of course, all three tiers can run
on different machines. Another nice option might be to distribute a
database to several machines. Linux-Kontor should be prepared to
face bigger challenges.</p><p>The introduction of the Euro in 1999 and the Year 2000
problem both provide the necessary pressure to replace older
systems with newer ones, rather than modify them. LK is a viable
solution for small and medium-sized enterprises. As years always
have four digits and currencies can always be converted, the year
2000 and the Euro's introduction will not present any problem for
Linux-Kontor.</p><p>&ldquo;Linux-Kontor&rdquo; was chosen as the name of this package in
order to express our support for this marvelous free software and
to promote its distribution. As Java is used, the program is not
exclusively restricted to Linux. In addition, &ldquo;Linux-Kontor&rdquo; is a
registered trademark of the German Linux-Verband LIVE, which should
prevent trademark law disputes.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x135c580.0x1454e48"></a>Linux-Kontor and Friends</h2></div></div><p>Apart from the fact that many modules are used in different
projects, Linux-Kontor is sponsored by several companies, including
ELA Container (a German container rental company) and TakeFive, the
company that made the Sniff+ Development Environment. Companies
such as LunetIX and Delta Internet support LK through suggestions
for improvement.</p><p>We have developed a marketing concept which we presented at
the German Unix Users Group (GUUG) conference last autumn. Software
companies can offer their own solutions and support on the basis of
the free source extensions. We are even planning to have CDs
distributed via subscription.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x135c580.0x1454fa8"></a>Road Map</h2></div></div><p>Finally, I would like to present our current schedule, the
&ldquo;road map&rdquo;. The modules for financial accounting and enterprise
market will be completed at the end of 1998; wages accounting,
stock management and work flow will follow by the middle of this
year.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x135c580.0x14550b0"></a>Where Can I Get All This? Who Can Help
Me?</h2></div></div><p>For more information, check out the web sites in
&ldquo;Resources&rdquo;. You will also be able to download the programs,
subscribe to the mailing lists (one for developers and another one
for users) and join an IRC channel. Any suggestions for improvement
and contributions of any kind are welcome.</p><p>You can meet the IoS developers and people from the mailing
lists there. If you have problems with the installation, you can
either forward your questions to the mailing list or try the
installation program (Swing [Java Foundation Classes] necessary) by
Stephan Schiessling, who also created the logo. Enjoy
yourself!</p><p><a href="2914s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p><p>This article was first published by the German
