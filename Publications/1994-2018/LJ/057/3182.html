</p><p>Display Doctor 1.0 for Linux achieves a goal even more useful
than the DOS product; it uses SciTech's driver technology to
provide drivers for video cards not supported by XFree86. This
includes cards from those manufacturers who will not release the
information required in order to allow XFree86 drivers to be
written.</p><p>This review will cover the Preview Release of SciTech Display
Doctor 1.0 for Linux. You can download the trial version from
SciTech's web site (http://www.scitechsoft.com/).</p><p>Display Doctor can be installed on any glibc2 system which
already has XFree86 (3.3.2), GPM, and Tcl/Tk (7.4 or higher)
installed. These requirements match one of the machines on which I
run Linux. The preview is available as both a compressed tar file
and as an RPM package. I chose to install the RPM package, since I
was reviewing Display Doctor on a Red Hat 5.1 system.</p><p>You can install the package with <b  >rpm -i</b>,
but you must do this from a virtual console as opposed to a TELNET
session, xterm or serial console. After the files are installed,
the post-install script proceeds to set up the program
interactively. This latter aspect may come as a surprise to those
who are used to installing packages with RPM.</p><p>The first problem I had was that I needed to tell the install
program which mouse protocol to use, even though this information
was in a configuration file (an existing XF86Config and the file
/etc/sysconfig/mouse on my Red Hat Linux system). The installation
program immediately provided a dialog box for the purpose of fixing
this, which was quite easy. After doing that, the rest of the
configuration process can be navigated with the mouse.</p><p>The setup program detected the Matrox Millennium card I
installed, but I had to give it the horizontal and vertical retrace
specifications of my monitor (this may be because my monitor is
four years old). I also have a UK-layout Microsoft Natural
keyboard, which some X-server setup programs don't acknowledge, but
to my surprise this went without a hitch and I could type the
British pound symbol quite happily.</p><p>The final step in the configuration process is selecting the
screen modes to be available for the X server. At the start of the
selection process, every possible screen mode is pre-selected for
you. When I started the X server for real, with
<span   class="bold"><b>startx</b></span>, I was presented with a
1920x1080 screen mode, which unfortunately offers an aspect ratio
of 16:9 and looked peculiar on my conventional 4:3 monitor. Exiting
X, I removed this mode from the
<span   class="bold"><b>ModeLine</b></span> list in the configuration
file (which, oddly, is still called XF86Config). Restarting X, I
was presented with a 1600x1200 screen mode&mdash;the same aspect ratio
as my monitor.</p><p>In use, the SciTech Display Doctor X server worked well. From
an installation point of view, it is just another X-server binary
(/usr/X11R6/bin/XF86_SDD) and doesn't interfere in any way with the
regular XFree86 files. I found this to be of immense benefit and in
marked contrast to the MetroX and AcceleratedX products.</p><p>The server implementation appears strikingly similar to the
XFree86 server; the same set of extensions are provided and the
same configuration file name and format is used (with driver name
&ldquo;scitech&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;svga&rdquo; or &ldquo;accel&rdquo;). This is a handicap,
since it prevents easy changing between X servers (XFree86 bails
out when it sees the unknown driver name &ldquo;scitech&rdquo;). If you query
the Display Doctor X server with
<span   class="bold"><b>xdpyinfo</b></span>, it appears to be version
3.3.2 of the XFree86 server, which is quite confusing. I assume
this particular oddity will disappear with the official release of
the final product.</p><p>Since this is the preview release, benchmarks are not very
illuminating. I look forward to benchmarking the full release of
Display Doctor against the next full release of XFree86.</p><p>One thing I find most exciting about this technology is that
it is just as applicable to Linux as it is to Windows. Even the
same executables are used (Display Doctor installs a bunch of
Windows-format 32-bit PE dynamic-link libraries in
/usr/lib/nucleus). This is of interest to Linux fans, because
SciTech is planning to use this same technology to bring the same
level of support to KGI/GGI, SVGAlib and the forthcoming
frame-buffer support currently in the Linux 2.1 kernel. According
to the readme.txt file, Mesa may even benefit from the same
treatment.</p><p>Unfortunately, I cannot say how Display Doctor made it
possible for me to use X on a graphics card that XFree86 does not
support. While it would have been nice to try this, the fact of the
matter is that I have deliberately bought only hardware supported
by Linux. If all Linux users did this, the market for SciTech's
Display Doctor would be constricted; on the other hand, some of the
things they are planning will advance the scope of the product
beyond just X. I think Display Doctor is an interesting option for
a bundling deal, particularly if SciTech follows through with their
planned feature list.</p></div></div>
