    Make working with LaTex easier by using the WYSIWYG editor
    LyX.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2466580.0x255e348"></a></h2></div></div><p>Although (or perhaps because) it is one
of the most flexible typesetting tools, many people are a bit
afraid of using LaTeX. They'd rather use a standard word processor.
On the other hand, even for those of us quite accustomed to LaTeX,
some kind of WYSIWYG editor would often come in handy, especially
for shorter texts like letters.
</p><p>Out on the Internet is a nice tool which may satisfy the
needs of both. It is called LyX and its home page is
http://la1ad.uio.no/lyx/. The primary download site is
ftp://ftp.via.ecp.fr/pub/lyx/, but you can also simply follow the
links from the home page. Initially it was written by Matthias
Ettrich (ettrich@kde.org), one of the initiators of the KDE
project, but it is now maintained by Lars Gullik Bjoennes
(larsbj@ifi.uio.no). The most recent package is usually called
lyx-current.tar.gz. For those of you running KDE, it may be
interesting to know that Matthias Ettrich has just released a KDE
version of LyX: KLyX
(http://www-pu.informatik.uni-tuebingen.de/users/ettrich/klyx/klyx.html).
From the screenshots it looks very promising, so it may be the
version of choice if you have at least the basic KDE libraries
installed.</p><p>For the installation of the source package, you will also
need two libraries, which probably won't be included in your
system. One is the Xpm library; the other is XForms, a library for
simple XView GUI programming. You will need at least version 4.7 of
libXpm and 0.81 of libforms. Both of them can already be obtained
as Linux (ELF, a.out) binaries. You will find XForms at
ftp://laue.phys.uwm.edu/pub/XFORMS/,
ftp://ftp.via.ecp.fr/pub/xforms/ and
ftp://ftp.cs.ruu.nl/pub/xforms/ and Xpm at Sunsite and its mirrors
in libs/X/.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2466580.0x255e500"></a>Installation</h2></div></div><p>I will focus only on the installation of the binary
distribution. It is available for several flavours of UNIX (even
for OS/2) and is the easiest to install. Should you have any
problems with the binaries, you can still switch back to compiling
the sources (remembering to check for the other two
libraries).</p><p>After you have downloaded lyx-current.tar.gz, log in as root
and change to /usr/local. Now do:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
tar xzf /
cd share/lyx
./configure
</pre><p>The configure program checks your local LaTeX installation
and sets up the LyX configuration accordingly. Later on, you can
view a file (from the Help/Documentation menu) that lists both the
packages installed and not installed in your system.
</p><p>Of course, you do not need to put the LyX package in
/usr/local. Nevertheless, LyX can display its messages in languages
other than English. For this feature, it expects to find the
internationalization files in /usr/local/share/locale. If you
install LyX in a different place, you will have to set the
environment variable LYX_LOCALEDIR pointing to the appropriate
share/locale directory. If you chose to install LyX in /opt, then
for bash you would need:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
LYX_LOCALEDIR=/opt/share/locale
</pre><p>and for tcsh:
<pre     class="programlisting">
setenv LYX_LOCALEDIR /opt/share/locale
</pre>


If you don't need the internationalization, i.e., English-only
messages are accessible, you can skip this step.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2466580.0x255e870"></a>Running LyX</h2></div></div><p>Each user can have his/her own resource file in which
customizations can be made. Start by copying the file
/usr/local/lyx/system.lyxrc to $HOME/.lyxrc. Now start LyX by
typing <b  >lyx</b>.</p><p><a href="1355f1.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 1.
Welcome Screen</b></span></a></p><p>You will be welcomed by a window like the one shown in Figure
1. Looking at the LyX window, you will be reminded of any standard
word processor. That's the main reason I think users who have been
reluctant to use LaTeX will be encouraged by LyX to make the
transition.</p><p>At the top is a menu bar with the usual features. Beneath is
a button bar with a list box for choosing the desired style and
several command shortcuts. (By the way, this button bar can be
customized.) The window is dominated by a large text input area
with a scrollbar. Finally, at the bottom is a status line.</p><p>If you do not wish to experiment on your own but would rather
read a little introduction, choose the menu Help/Documentation. A
file selector will open, letting you choose one of the package's
documentation files. The file extension (*.lyx) shows that LyX uses
its own format. However, each document can also be saved in LaTeX
format.</p><p>Now back to the documentation. As the program is still in
version 0.12, most of the files are not too detailed, but for a
quick start I'd recommend either Main.lyx or Tutorial.lyx. In this
selector you will also find the already mentioned results of the
LaTeX configuration check (LaTeXConfig.lyx).</p><p>Let's suppose you selected the file Main.lyx. After
confirming the message that this file is read-only, it takes a
little while to load all the fonts into the X-server. At this
point, error messages may appear in your console/shell window.
Don't worry; it just means you have not installed all the X-server
fonts LyX wants to use. Then, you are presented with one of the
really nice features: a table of contents (TOC). A TOC is
well-known in LaTeX, but LyX has the ability to display it in a
completely interactive window, i.e., you can click with your mouse
on any entry and the cursor jumps to the appropriate section (see
Figure 2). If you prefer to read instructions on paper, print out
the document. Select File/Print, check that everything in the
opening dialog box is set to your needs and click on
<b  >OK</b> (or press <b  >enter</b>).</p><p><a href="1355f2.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 2. LyX
Table of Contents</b></span></a></p><p>Now let's start to write our first LyX document. Our goal
will be a short article with a title, three sections, some
mathematics stuff, perhaps a picture, some footnotes and a
TOC.</p><p>First, if you opened Main.lyx before, close the TOC and
select File/Close. If LyX asks you about saving any changes, say
no. Now create a new document by selecting File/New. If you are not
in your home directory, change to it by pressing the Home button.
Now, type in a file name, e.g., MyFirstTest.lyx. After clicking on
<b  >OK</b>, you are presented with a blank page.</p><p>Very well. You (and LyX) are now ready to start typing.
First, we create the title. Click on the down arrow beside
&ldquo;Standard&rdquo;. A list box will open in which you can choose one of
several styles. (If you know LaTeX, you will recognize most of
them.) Move down and click on &ldquo;Title&rdquo;. The layout on the screen
will change a bit and you can type in your title, &ldquo;My First LyX
Document&rdquo;, then press <b  >enter</b>. Note that the
style changes back to &ldquo;Standard&rdquo;. This is a characteristic of
LyX. One style is valid within only one paragraph (ended by
<b  >enter</b>). If you want to type in more lines, press
Newline (<b  >ctrl-enter</b>).</p><p>To begin the first section, select the &ldquo;Section&rdquo; style in
the list box to type in the section name (e.g., &ldquo;The First
Section&rdquo;) and press <b  >enter</b>. To add an itemize
style, type in some text (&ldquo;A simple itemize style:&rdquo;
<b  >enter</b>), and select &ldquo;Itemize&rdquo; style&mdash;an
asterisk will appear. Now you can write some items which are
separated by <b  >enter</b>. This is an exception to the
mentioned rule: to get back to &ldquo;Standard&rdquo; style, you must select
this explicitly. You can play around a little with the two font
styles, emphasize and noun, by clicking on the button with the
question mark and the person. The next section will contain some
math. After adding a new section headline, click on the formula
button and open the math panel (Math/Math Panel, MP). First, enter
a three-dimensional unity matrix: type <b  >E =</b>,
click on the parentheses button in MP and click on
<b  >OK</b>. Now add the matrix by clicking on the matrix
button in MP (the one with nine squares), set the size (3 by 3) and
click on <b  >OK</b>. This fills in the nine entries. For
a unity matrix, the three rows should read 1 0 0, 0 1 0 and 0 0 1.
If you wish, you can play around a little with the numerous buttons
within the MP.</p><p>We will add a third section and insert a PostScript picture
into our document. First, select Insert/Floats/Figure Float and
type in any figure caption. After that (without clicking on
<b  >enter</b>), click on the &ldquo;Insert Figure&rdquo; button
(just right of the formula button). In the dialog, select the first
item (encapsulated PostScript). If you left-click on the appearing
frame, a settings box opens. Click on &ldquo;Browse&rdquo; and select the
file /usr/local/lyx/clipart/platypus.eps (or change the path
according to your installation). Set the width to 3 inches and
click on <b  >OK</b>. The platypus should now appear on
the screen. You will notice a red frame around the complete figure,
with a small grey rectangle to the left reading &ldquo;fig&rdquo;. If you
press the left button in this field, the whole figure will collapse
into a small, red &ldquo;fig&rdquo;. Left-clicking on this brings back the
whole frame. Pressing the left button anywhere within the figure
opens the &ldquo;Floats&rdquo; context menu, giving you a choice of actions
to perform.</p><p><a href="1355f3.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 3.
Completed Text Document</b></span></a></p><p>By this time, your document should look like Figure 3.
Congratulations&mdash;you've just finished your first LyX document. Now
save it to disk (File/Save), if you have not already done so. If
you like, print it out (File/Print). This may take a little time.
As you know, LaTeX is still working behind the scenes, which means
that the standard LaTeX procedure of compiling and printing has to
be gone through.</p><p>If you followed the opening of the documentation file, you
have already seen LyX's feature of displaying the table of contents
(TOC) of a document in a separate window, letting you jump to each
entry by using the mouse. How is this feature set up and invoked?
In fact, you do not have to do anything special. LyX keeps track of
the &ldquo;Section&rdquo; style as you assign it to parts of the text. Choose
Edit/Table of Contents, and there it is. You will find all the
sections you created; if not, just press the update button.
Clicking on each entry takes your text cursor directly to the
specified point.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2466580.0x255f5d8"></a>More LaTeX Commands and Previewing</h2></div></div><p>With LyX, you can do most any formatting that is possible in
LaTeX. Experienced LaTeX users will notice some LaTeX commands
(e.g., <b  >\pagebreak</b>) are missing. This is not
really a drawback. You can always assign the TeX style to any
portion of text, either by choosing the style from the list box or
by pressing the TeX button. This tells LyX that the marked portion
of text is to be taken as native LaTeX code, thereby allowing you
to use even those LaTeX commands which cannot be reached by menu
entry. Even hard-core LaTeX hackers can still be satisfied by
saving their document in the usual LaTeX format by selecting
File/Make LaTeX file. Although I admit that this file will not
necessarily look the way it would if you had written the text
directly in LaTeX, it opens up the possibility of hacking in
anything you like and then running LaTeX directly on the
file.</p><p>Although LyX is close to WYSIWYG, you might often still like
a preview of your document. For this purpose, LyX offers both
<span   class="bold"><b>xdvi</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>ghostview</b></span>. If both these programs
are installed on your system, you can get a preview by selecting
one of these two options from the file menu. The necessary
background LaTeX commands (running LaTeX and, for the PostScript
output, <span   class="bold"><b>dvips</b></span>) are done by LyX
automatically, so you don't have to worry about whether all your
files are up to date.</p><p>If you save text, the file is stored in the working directory
you specify. But all the intermediate LaTeX-related output files
(like .log, .dvi, .ps) are stored in a /tmp directory (the actual
path can be specified in ~/.lyxrc), unless you explicitly instruct
LyX to make a LaTeX file from your text.</p><p>Now that you have finished your first LyX (and perhaps your
first LaTeX) document, it is time to drop a few notes on the
customizations possible within LyX.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2466580.0x255f948"></a>Templates</h2></div></div><p>The first issue (which, in fact, is not really a
customization of the application) is the template, which you may
have noticed in the File menu (New from template...). You may
already know the template notion from standard word processors, and
in LyX it works just the same: a standard template document
defining the basic settings like fonts, layout, etc. A prototype of
such a template may be a letter (some letter templates are included
in the LyX distribution), where you would set up basic items like
your personal address, a standard opening and closing phrase and
the layout. To create such a template, you don't have to do
anything special&mdash;just start editing a new document with the
desired settings. For those parts of the text which are not
standard and are to be changed in each document using this template
(an example in the letter case may be the recipient's address), you
can type in any text, e.g., &ldquo;recipient's name&rdquo;. Look at the
distribution's templates for other examples. After you finish, save
this template to disk like any other LyX document.</p><p>Unlike other word processors, LyX does not use a special
format for templates. Any LyX document can be taken to be a
template and vice versa. As a template is also a &ldquo;normal&rdquo;
document, saving a newly created template to disk also saves all
the layout options currently selected. So, if you have created a
letter template using a letter-sized sheet of paper, this page size
is also saved to disk, as is all the font information, etc. If you
do not want each of your later letters to use all these settings,
you have two options:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Leave the template file untouched. In this case,
each time you create a new document using this template, you have
to reset the settings to your specific needs after selecting the
template. Remember, selecting a template is more or less like
loading in a file; thus, all the settings saved in this file
overwrite the current parameters.</p></li><li><p>Change the template file by hand using any plain
text editor. In this case, you can remove all the layout commands
which you do not wish to be set by the template.</p></li></ol></div><p>The more general you wish your template to be, the more
likely you will choose option 2. On the other hand, this requires
some knowledge and understanding of the LyX command language. It
won't be too hard if you already know LaTeX, but for the first
experiments you should perhaps leave the file untouched.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2466580.0x255fcb8"></a>Customization</h2></div></div><p>The last issue to be mentioned here is the ~/.lyx directory
which is the place where real customization can take place. Again,
leave the files as they are until you have become a bit more
acquainted with LyX. In this directory, all your personal
configuration files are stored. As long as your configuration and
the global system's are the same, nothing is stored here.</p><p>You can, for example, store your preferred key-bindings.
There are two standard bindings (PC-modern and Emacs), but you can
also define your own key-binding scheme and tell LyX the file where
it is stored. You can also define your own tool bar, various
(LaTeX-related) commands, printing defaults, file defaults and the
like. It would take quite a while to discuss all these options in
detail, but I recommend taking a look at the file. Fortunately, all
options are explained well, so it is easy to figure out where to do
what.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2466580.0x2958068"></a>Summary</h2></div></div><p>LyX, a WYSIWYG editor for LaTeX, is by no means a standard
word processor. It heavily depends on LaTeX, i.e., you need to have
LaTeX installed properly, and you can only do formatting that is
also possible with LaTeX. It has the distinct advantage of directly
displaying all the different style elements on the screen without
fiddling around with &ldquo;strange&rdquo; formatting commands. Those who are
not familiar with LaTeX will find it much easier to take the first
step toward using this powerful package. Those who already know
LaTeX will still find LyX useful for writing shorter pieces of text
such as letters. And, after all, as the LaTeX file format is
supported in output, you even have the freedom to hack the most
complex LaTeX commands by hand if necessary.</p></div></div>
