    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x210a580.0x2202348"></a></h2></div></div><p>The 1998 Atlanta Linux Showcase was held
October 23 and 24 in downtown Atlanta, GA. Thanks to Greg Hankins
and the rest of the Atlanta Linux Enthusiasts, it turned out to be
yet another tremendously successful Linux gathering.
</p><p>One of the most notable aspects of this year's show was the
variety of attendees, over 2000 in all. Visitors spanned the gamut
from faithful Linux geeks to the merely curious. Coupled with the
wide variety of exhibitors and speakers, these guests made the 1998
ALS one of the most diverse crowds ever for a Linux show.</p><p>Among the 60 participating vendors were most of the usual
suspects, such as Red Hat Software, Caldera, Debian, S.u.S.E. and
SpellCaster. Adding to the excitement of the show was the presence
of a few noteworthy newcomers. Oracle gave Linux users a sampler
CD-ROM of their database system, and Informix also presented their
database applications. Corel showed off both the NetWinder and
WordPerfect 8 word processor for Linux. San Mehat, NetWinder
developer, even showed off his pet project&mdash;a ten-processor Beowulf
cluster that he carried around in one hand. Even Schlumberger had a
booth where they talked about their smart card embedded with the
Linux OS (see &ldquo;Muscle Flexes Smart Cards into Linux&rdquo; by David
Corcoran, <i  >Linux Journal</i>, August 1998).</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="3195f1.large.jpg"><img src="3195f1.jpg"></a></div><p>The show was tied together with a one-gigabyte backbone set
up by Cabletron. Registration was run on Linux-based PCs. In fact,
one Microsoft employee we talked to felt very much in the minority.
Hopefully, he ordered a Cobalt Qube or NetWinder to take
home.</p><p>Other exhibitors included Jeff Bates and Rob Malda of
slashdot.org. The GNOME team was out in force, showing us the
fruits of their labors. Miguel de Icaza gave a talk on the GNOME
project. Several retailers were represented, such as Linux Mall,
Linux Central and the Linux General Store.</p><p>Many leaders of the GNU/Linux revolution were on hand. Eric
S. Raymond was there making his always-brilliant philosophical
observations about the power and importance of Open Source
software. Also present was Richard M. Stallman: the man who can be
said to have started it all.</p><p>As expected, a few important announcements were made, in
particular by keynote speakers. Allen Miner, Vice President of
Strategic Business Development at Oracle Corporation, gave the
first keynote speech. Mr. Miner reasserted Oracle's commitment to
Linux and announced several key partnerships with other Linux
vendors. Look for Linux to figure more prominently in Oracle's
future.</p><p>Dr. Michael Cowpland of Corel talked about the future of his
company's relationship with Linux. He also announced that Word
Perfect 8 for Linux would be available as a free download for
personal use in the near future. The rest of Corel's productivity
applications should be available on Linux by early 1999. Corel also
recently announced plans to team with Red Hat to port more software
to their NetWinder.</p><p>The surprise hit of the show was the caffeinated Penguin
Peppermints handed out by <i  >LJ</i> representatives,
including yours truly. Folks lined up three rows deep at the booth
to pick up these treats.</p><p>To no one's surprise, this year's Atlanta Linux Showcase was
yet another testament of Linux's growth towards complete world
domination. As the list of independent software vendors,
value-added resellers and retailers supporting Linux grows each
day, the outlook for the future of Linux is quite
optimistic.</p></div></div>
