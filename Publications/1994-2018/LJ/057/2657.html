    If you think all computer professionals are men think again.
    Mr. Connelly tells us about some well-known women in
    computer annals.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1912580.0x1a0a348"></a></h2></div></div><p>One of the many public debates in
Australia at the moment is on the question of women in the
computing industry. For many people, the computer industry and
computers in general are seen to be a domain where big boys play
with toys. Of course, in a society and economy based on the
division of labor this may very well be true, but that is another
article. The heads of all the large companies are men: Bill Gates
and Steve Jobs to name but two. However, the same must be said of
almost all companies and institutions in modern society. The
computer industry does not exist in a vacuum; as much as anything
else in our world, it is a plaything of larger forces.
</p><p>What of the role of women in computing? From the earliest
days of computing to the writing of the Standard Template Library,
women have played an active and leading role in computer science.
The following examples should quickly prove this statement to be
true.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1912580.0x1a0a4a8"></a>Ada Lovelace</h2></div></div><p>We can start with a question: who was the U.S. Army's
programming language named after? Ada Lovelace, daughter of the
English poet Lord Byron. (Rather ungallantly, Byron left Ada and
her mother, Anne Isabella Milburke, when Ada was one year of age,
to seek glory in Greece, where he succumbed to a fever instead of
leading a stirring charge&mdash;history can be quite unforgiving.) A
brilliant mathematician, she worked on the analytic engine with
Charles Babbage, devising a method of programming based on the
cards used on a Jaquard loom&mdash;a type of input some of us older
people can remember from standardized testing in our school days,
or from the Simpsons cartoon, where Apu wrote a tic-tac-toe game in
his university days (before becoming the fifth Beatle).</p><p>With their combined algebraic skills, the pair set off to the
racetrack to apply logic to horse racing in an attempt to win
enough money to build their machine. This effort resulted in Lady
Lovelace having to pawn her jewelry to keep out of debt&mdash;a lesson
learned, I am sure. Financial problems aside, the machine, which
was never built in their lifetime, was completed not that many
years ago and did work, just as Ada said it would in her paper
&ldquo;Observations on Mr. Babbage's Analytical Engine&rdquo;. Before the
project collapsed in a fury of bad debt, Lady Lovelace wrote a
working program to calculate Bernoulli numbers.</p><p>In this early moment of computing, a woman was actively
involved. Indeed, if it is true that women have the keener language
skills of the two sexes, it would follow that they would be more
than able to contribute to computer science.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1912580.0x1a0a660"></a>Grace Murray Hopper</h2></div></div><p>Skipping a few decades, we come to the attack on Pearl Harbor
and the American entry into World War Two. The epic navy battles of
the Pacific Theater of Operations showed the need to find a way to
quickly calculate the flight of a shell fired from the great
eight-inch guns of the USN. The math was simple enough (maybe not
for me, but for others), but in the stress of battle, errors were
not uncommon. A calculator was devised to make the work simpler and
easier. In the pressure of war, expediency won out over ingrained
sexist ideas, and many women were recruited for the projects, which
in a few years led to the birth of the electronic computer.</p><p>One of the most significant of these young women was Grace
Murray Hopper. A slight woman, who taught at Vassar before the war
and was obsessed with nanoseconds, she talked the USN into allowing
her to volunteer even though the Navy preferred to have its
scientific researchers as civilians. In the Bureau of Ordnance
Computation, she worked on the early computers&mdash;vast machines
weighing many tons and needing crews of programmers to work them.
Tasks were performed by plugging wires into the back of the
machine. Many of the wire-plugging programmers were women.</p><p>Grace Hopper, later promoted to Rear Admiral, is credited
with many innovations in her field. Among the most important was
her first use of the word <span   class="emphasis"><em>bug</em></span>. A moth once
flew into the machine, and was &ldquo;battered to death&rdquo; by a relay.
Grace, upon extracting the poor dead insect, taped it into one of
her notebooks and wrote, &ldquo;The first actual case of a bug being
found.&rdquo; A new phrase for the source of a hair-tearing error was
coined. On a more serious note, her laziness (one of the virtues of
a programmer) led her to develop the first compiler for the UNIVAC
in the mid-fifties. Until then, all coding had been done in machine
code, a time-consuming and often frustrating activity. The ability
to write English words to get the job done was a great advance in
computer science, although it met with strong resistance from
engineers at the time. Grace Hopper learned to loathe the phrase
&ldquo;but this is how we have always done it.&rdquo;</p><p>The invention of the compiler led directly to her work on the
development of the FORTRAN and COBOL programming languages, which
she helped write and later refined and standardized as a member of
the Standards Committee. COBOL, notwithstanding the success of C,
is still the most common language in use today; more lines of code
are produced in COBOL than in any other language. It is a fitting
testimony to her achievement. The invention of the compiler is one
of those things that is easy to take for granted, but for ease of
use and the ability to port code, it is a very powerful
tool.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1912580.0x1a0a8c8"></a>Adele Goldstine</h2></div></div><p>Another woman working during WWII was Adele Goldstine, who in
1946 revamped the ENIAC as a stored program computer, and is
responsible for the quote &ldquo;It was a son-of-a-bitch to program.&rdquo;
This development of the stored program allowed the computer to
perform a new task without reconfiguring the entire system. She
wrote the manual for the ENIAC as well.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1912580.0x1a0a9d0"></a>Betty Holberton</h2></div></div><p>At the same time, Betty Holberton was working on the UNIVAC
and concerning herself with human engineering (i.e.,
user-friendliness). She developed a language called C-10, which
allowed commands to be typed in rather than having to reset all the
wires. Her system used mnemonic characters to input, for example,
&ldquo;a&rdquo; for add and &ldquo;b&rdquo; for bring. In her work, she initiated the
standard we still use today&mdash;the numeric pad next to the keyboard.
In spite of all these efforts, she must be taken to task for her
insistence that black was too intimidating a color for a computer,
which resulted in the use of that horrible beige color for modern
computers.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1912580.0x1a0aad8"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>This is a discussion of only a few of the women involved in
the development of the computer; however, many features we take for
granted were developed by these women&mdash;the keyboard layout, the
compiler, the stored program, the ugly colors and more.</p><p>Finally, two other women should be mentioned: first, the
Editor of <i  >Linux Journal</i>, Marjorie Richardson
(I've never been one to miss a chance to court favor), and the
author of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Essential System Administration</em></span>,
&AElig;leen Frisch. This text may have been of the most use to me
in my vain attempts to conquer Linux.</p><p>More information about women in computer science can readily
be found on the Internet at The Ada Project web site, built by Yale
University,
