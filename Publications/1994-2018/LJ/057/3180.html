    How to get this most popular game to run on your Linux system.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x261c580.0x27143f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>Quake is one of the coolest games
available for any platform. Thanks to Dave Taylor, who began id
Software's tradition of porting their games to Linux back in 1995
with Linux Doom, today we have Quake for Linux. This article is
meant to be a quick start to getting Quake running on your Intel
Linux system. If you encounter problems not addressed here, look at
the Linux Quake HOWTO at http://www.linuxquake.com/howto for more
detailed troubleshooting information.
</p><p><a href="3180f1.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 1.
Player about to capture the blue flag in the &ldquo;Capture the Flag&rdquo;
game</b></span></a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x261c580.0x2714608"></a>Necessary Files</h2></div></div><p>The minimum system requirements for Quake are shown in the
&ldquo;System Requirements&rdquo; sidebar. To install Quake on your Linux
system, you will need some flavor of the official Quake
distribution from id&mdash;either the retail DOS/Windows CD-ROM from a
software store, or the shareware version downloaded from the Net.
Alternatively, if you already have Quake installed on a DOS/Windows
machine, you can use the relevant files from that
installation.</p><p>In addition to the official Quake files, you will need
Linux-specific binaries. All the necessary files for Linux Quake
are available at ftp://ftp.idsoftware.com/. id's site can be very
busy, so you may want to use one of their mirror sites (see
Resources).</p><p>Version numbers in this article are current as of September
1998 and aren't likely to change. Quake is considered a finished
product, so new versions will be released only if major bugs are
found.</p><p>The shareware Quake for Windows distribution is necessary
only if you don't have a Quake CD-ROM
(ftp://ftp.idsoftware.com/idstuff/quake/quake106.zip).</p><p>Quake can render its graphics three ways: in an X11 window,
full-screen SVGA, or hardware-accelerated OpenGL. You'll need to
download the binaries only for the renderers you plan to use. (See
Resources.)</p><p>QuakeWorld is a multi-player version of Quake optimized for
play over the Internet. Get one of the packages listed in Resources
if you plan to play on-line. Red Hat 5.x/Debian 2.x users should
get the glibc version. The .rpm and .tar.gz package contents are
identical. Choose one according to your distribution.</p><p>If you plan to run an Internet QuakeWorld server, select one
of the dedicated server-only binaries (see Resources). Most people
won't need them.</p><p><a href="3180s1.html" target="_self">System Requirements</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x261c580.0x27149d0"></a>Installation</h2></div></div><p>Start by creating the directory in which you will install
Quake. The &ldquo;standard&rdquo; location is /usr/local/games/quake. The
QuakeWorld RPM package installs its files in this directory, so it
is a good idea to install here if you plan on installing QuakeWorld
later.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
mkdir /usr/local/games/quake
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x261c580.0x2714b30"></a>Installing From CD-ROM</h2></div></div><p>If you have a very early release of the Quake CD-ROM, these
instructions won't work. Please see the Linux Quake HOWTO for
details on installing from older CD-ROMs.</p><p>A file on your Quake CD-ROM, resource.1, is an lha archive of
all the Quake game files (lha is a file compression and archiving
format like tar or zip). We will use the
<span   class="bold"><b>lha</b></span> command (see Resources) to
extract it.</p><p>Mount your Quake CD-ROM, move to your Quake directory and
extract the resource.1 archive:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
mount /dev/cdrom /cdrom #change for your system
cd /usr/local/games/quake
lha e /mnt/cdrom/resource.1
</pre><p>Your /usr/local/games/quake directory should now contain a
bunch of new files and a subdirectory called /id1. The most
important files for Linux Quake are in /id1, so you can safely
remove everything else. If you are totally new to Quake (or even if
you are not), you may wish to keep the *.txt files for reference.
On my system, I put all the READMEs that accumulate into a /doc
subdirectory.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x261c580.0x2714df0"></a>Installing the Shareware Version</h2></div></div><p>The single-episode shareware version of Quake has all the
features of the full version of Quake, with a couple of major
limitations: you cannot play QuakeWorld (multi-player) with it, and
you cannot play custom or modified levels.</p><p>Installing the shareware version of Quake is not much
different than installing from the CD-ROM. Put the quake106.zip
file in your Quake directory, then extract the resource.1 lha
archive:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cd /usr/local/games/quake
unzip -L quake106.zip
lha e resource.1
</pre><p>Now save the README files (optional) and remove everything
else except the /id1 directory:
<pre     class="programlisting">
mkdir doc
mv *.txt doc
rm -f *
</pre>


</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x261c580.0x2715058"></a>Installing from a Pre-existing DOS/Windows
Installation</h2></div></div><p>If you have Quake installed under Windows or DOS on a
different machine, you can transfer the files in quake/id1/ to your
Linux system via FTP or some other mechanism. Keep in mind that the
file names on your Linux system must be in lower case for Quake to
find them, so you may have to rename them after the transfer. Also
note that it may be necessary to delete your DOS/Windows
installation after you do this, to remain in compliance with the
terms of id's software license.</p><p>If your DOS/Windows and Linux systems are on the same
machine, you have two options: copy the files from your DOS/Windows
partition to your Linux partition, or link to the necessary files
from Linux. Both options work equally well. You save around 50MB of
disk space when you link instead of copy.</p><p>Whatever you choose to do, start by changing to your Quake
directory and creating a new subdirectory called /id1:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cd /usr/local/games/quake
mkdir id1
</pre><p>To copy the files from your DOS/Windows partition, type:
<pre     class="programlisting">
cp /win95/games/quake/id1/*.pak id1
</pre>


To create links to your DOS/Windows Quake files, type this instead:
<pre     class="programlisting">
cd id1
ln -s /win95/games/quake/id1/*.pak .
</pre>


Of course, you should replace /win95/games/quake in the examples
above with the correct path to your DOS/Windows partition and Quake
directory.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x261c580.0x2715370"></a>Linux Binary Installation</h2></div></div><p>Now it is time to decide which of the three Quake executables
you would like to install.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>X11 Quake allows you to run Quake in a window on
your X desktop. It is the least exciting client, but is a great,
safe way to test your installation.</p></li><li><p>Squake is the SVGAlib Quake client; it runs full
screen on your console.</p></li><li><p>GLQuake is the OpenGL Quake client. If you have a
3Dfx card, this is a must-have.</p></li></ul></div><p>Download the packages you want (see the &ldquo;Necessary Files&rdquo;
section) and extract them to your Quake directory:
<pre     class="programlisting">
cd /usr/local/games/quake
tar -xzf XXXX-i386-unknown-linux2.0.tar.gz
</pre>


</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x261c580.0x2715790"></a>Sound Considerations</h2></div></div><p>If you want sound from Quake, /dev/dsp needs to be readable
and writable. Most distributions give it 662 (rw-rw&mdash;w-)
permissions by default. The simplest solution is just to chmod 666
/dev/dsp. On most systems, the ability to read from the sound
device will not pose a significant security threat. If this
approach is unacceptable for your system, create a group that owns
/dev/dsp and make your Quake players members of that group.</p><p>If you don't have a sound card installed or configured for
your system, make sure to use the <b  >-nosound</b>
command-line option when starting Quake. Failure to use
<b  >-nosound</b> will cause Quake to exit with a
segmentation fault when it tries to initialize your non-existent
sound card.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x261c580.0x27159a0"></a>X11 Quake</h2></div></div><p>If you installed the X11 client, your system may need further
configuration for glquake and squake, but at this point quake.x11
should be ready to go.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cd /usr/local/games/quake
 ./quake.x11
</pre><p>If all is well, a small window running a Quake demo should
appear. You should hear sound effects and possibly music, if the CD
is mounted. You can use the <b  >-width</b> and
<b  >-height</b> command-line options to create a bigger
window.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x261c580.0x2715c08"></a>SVGAlib Quake</h2></div></div><p>Both squake and glquake require SVGAlib to be running
(glquake uses SVGAlib for keyboard and mouse input, in case you
were wondering). SVGAlib comes with most modern distributions and
must be properly configured before squake or glquake will run
correctly.</p><p>libvga.config is SVGAlib's configuration file. On most
systems, you will find it in either /etc or /etc/vga. Make sure the
mouse, monitor and video card settings in this file are correct for
your system. See the SVGAlib documentation for more details.</p><p>If you don't already have SVGAlib on your system, it is
available on Sunsite (see Resources).</p><p>If you have a Red Hat 5.x or other glibc-based Linux
distribution, remember that since Quake was compiled with libc5,
all the libraries it links to (such as SVGAlib) must also be
libc5-based. If you are going to compile a newer version of SVGAlib
yourself, make sure it links to libc5 (and friends) rather than
glibc, or Quake won't run.</p><p>Once svgalib is properly installed, you are almost ready to
run squake. <span   class="bold"><b>squake</b></span> needs to run
with root privileges in order to access your sound and graphics
cards. One (bad) way to deal with this is always to run it as root.
Responsible system administrators will cringe at this filthy
suggestion. Making the Quake binaries setuid root is a more
acceptable solution. Quake can then be run by regular users and
still have the privileges it needs to access the graphics and sound
devices. Be warned that any setuid program represents a security
risk. A clever user could exploit a bug or security hole in a
setuid program to gain root access to your system. If you don't run
a multi-user system, this will not be a big concern.</p><p>Make squake setuid root with the following commands:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
chown root squake
chmod 4755 squake
</pre><p>Note that you should run squake from a virtual console. It
won't run from X unless you are root when you start it, and running
a game as the root user is a situation to be avoided. If you are in
X, do a <b  >ctrl+alt+f1</b>, log in and then:
<pre     class="programlisting">
cd /usr/local/games/quake
./squake
</pre>

intended to be. There is no substitute&mdash;once you have experienced
it, there is no going back.</p><p>To make GLQuake work, you need a 3-D card with the 3Dfx
Voodoo or Voodoo2 chip set on it, the glide library, the Mesa
library and SVGAlib. Getting your 3Dfx card working under Linux is
a big topic, one I will discuss very briefly here. See Resources
for places to find more information.</p><p>First of all, make sure SVGAlib is installed and properly
configured as outlined in the previous section. Remember, glquake
uses SVGAlib to get mouse and keyboard input.</p><p>Next, get and install the glide library. Glide is a library
that provides an API for programming 3Dfx-based cards. If you want
the Mesa graphics library to use your 3Dfx card, you must have it.
Select the package(s) appropriate for your system (see Resources)
and install according to the instructions on the web page.</p><p>Note that unless you download the 3Dfx-device-driver package
in addition to the Glide library, you will be able to run Glide
applications (like GLQuake) only as root. Install the /dev/3dfx
module and you can play GLQuake as a regular user.</p><p>Once you have glide installed, try out the test program that
comes with it. Remember this test program; it is a good way to
reset your display if you ever have a glide application (like
GLQuake) crash, leaving your screen switched off. Run this test
from a VC, not X. It is possible for the test application to lose
mouse and keyboard focus in X; then you'd have no way of shutting
it down. Type <b  >usr/local/glide/bin/test3Dfx</b> and
your screen will turn blue and prompt you to press any key. After
you press a key, you will be returned to the prompt.</p><p>Now you need to install Mesa, a free OpenGL-like graphics
library by Brian Paul (brianp@elastic.avid.com). Luckily, you won't
have to look far, because Mesa 2.6 is included with the QLQuake and
QuakeWorld binaries. All you have to do is move it to the right
place:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cd /usr/local/games/quake
cp libMesaGL.so.2.6 /usr/local/lib
ldconfig
</pre><p>If you want to upgrade Mesa to a more recent version (Mesa
3.0 should be released by the time this is printed), download the
latest version from ftp://iris.ssec.wisc.edu/pub/Mesa. When
installing Mesa 3.0 or higher, keep in mind that glquake is linked
against libMesaGL.so.2, so you must create a symbolic link from
your new libMesaGL.so.3.0 to libMesaGL.so.2 in order for glquake to
find it. Also, as I mentioned earlier, remember that since Quake is
a libc5-based application, all the libraries it links to must also
be built with libc5. A libMesaGL linked against glibc will cause
glquake to abort with a segmentation fault and possibly hang your
system.
</p><p>Now that SVGAlib, glide and Mesa are installed, you should be
able to run glquake. Switch to a VC if you are in X
(<b  >ctrl+alt+f1</b>) and start glquake:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cd /usr/local/games/quake
 ./glquake
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x261c580.0x270d048"></a>QuakeWorld</h2></div></div><p>QuakeWorld is a multi-player version of Quake that is
optimized for Internet play over a modem. Problems with the
original Quake's network code, like excessive lag and packet loss,
are reduced or eliminated in QuakeWorld.</p><p>To play QuakeWorld, you need the full, registered or retail
version of Quake and a Linux QuakeWorld client. QuakeWorld clients
come in the same flavors (X11, SVGAlib and OpenGL) as normal Quake,
but are bundled together in one package. The prerequisites and
configuration for these binaries are the same as for regular Quake,
so if necessary, refer to the previous sections for help on setting
up SVGAlib or glide/Mesa.</p><p>If you are installing one of the RPM QuakeWorld packages,
installation should be as simple as typing the following:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
su root
rpm -Uvh qwcl-xxxxx.i386.rpm
</pre><p>To install from the tar.gz packages, type:
<pre     class="programlisting">
cd /usr/local/games/quake
su root
tar -xzf qwcl-xxxx-i386-unknown-linux2.0.tar.gz
</pre>


Four new executables (qwcl, qwcl.x11, glqwcl and glqwcl.glx) will
be installed in /usr/local/quake. glqwcl.glx is a GLX application
linked against standard OpenGL libraries. This should allow
QuakeWorld to run with OpenGL implementations other than Mesa. The
programs qwcl, glqwcl and glqwcl.glx are installed setuid root so
that the graphics devices on your system can be accessed. If you
installed the /dev/3dfx driver mentioned in the GLQuake section,
you can remove the setuid permissions on glqwcl and glqwcl.glx.
</p><p>Once QuakeWorld is installed with your Quake files, you can
start it up by typing the following:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
 ./qwcl +connect some.server.address
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x261c580.0x270d3b8"></a>Related Software</h2></div></div><p>Qstat is a command-line utility created by Steve Jankowski
(steve@activesw.com) that returns the status of Internet Quake,
QuakeWorld and Quake 2 servers. Qstat (see Resources) is a
must-have tool if you are planning on doing any Internet
Quaking.</p><p>XQF (see Resources) is a graphical front-end to Qstat that
uses the GTK toolkit. This is currently the best QuakeWorld/Quake 2
server browser in existence. Roman Pozlevich (roma@botik.ru) is
still cranking out new versions at the rate of about one per month.
If you are familiar with GameSpy for the Windows platform, this is
the closest thing to it for Linux.</p><p><a href="3180s2.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
