Executive Officer at Netscape Communications Corporation, where he
oversees all aspects of the company. Jim joined Netscape
Communications in January 1995 and has served on the board of the
company since October 1994. He also serves on the boards of 3Com
Corporation, @Home Corporation, Robert Mondavi Corporation and
Network Computer, Inc. Also, in 1996, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Computer Reseller
News</em></span> named Jim Barksdale their No.1 &ldquo;Executive of the
Year&rdquo; and PC Magazine named him &ldquo;Person of the Year&rdquo;. At the
1997 ETRE Conference in Budapest, he received the &ldquo;Executive of
the Year&rdquo; award. I interviewed Jim by e-mail in October 1998.
</p><p>Netscape is an Internet software company located in Mountain
View, California. Its stated goal is to provide open software to
people and companies for the purpose of exchanging information and
conducting commerce over the Internet and other global networks. In
1996, Netscape received the &ldquo;Entrepreneurial Company of the Year&rdquo;
award from both Stanford and Harvard Business Schools. At
November's COMDEX, <i  >Linux Journal</i> gave their
1998 &ldquo;Product of the Year&rdquo; award to Netscape for being the
product which brought Open Source software to the attention of the
world.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: What event first
brought Linux to your attention?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Jim</b></span>: Our customers were
asking us to expand our support for Linux. Netscape Navigator has
been available for Linux since Navigator version 2.0; in fact,
according to Netscape download data, the Linux version of Netscape
Communicator is the most popular UNIX platform for Communicator.
Customers wanted us to add support for the Linux platform to our
cross-platform server software.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: What sort of
evaluation procedures did you use to decide to support
Linux?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Jim</b></span>: In addition to
listening to our customers, we looked at independent market
research. IDC (International Data Corporation) reports that Linux
server software license shipments outgrew the overall server
operating environment market between 1996 and 1997. Linux was the
number five server operating environment overall. Datapro reports a
14 percent market share for Linux in 1997, ranking it number four
among UNIX operating systems in enterprises. ZD Market Intelligence
indicates that Linux is the number one UNIX operating system used
by ISPs. From a user base of barely 1.5 million two years ago,
Linux has grown to between five and seven million users today.
Linux is supported by many commercial Linux vendors including Red
Hat, Caldera, and S.u.S.E. Red Hat's sales of Linux products have
doubled every twelve months, putting it on target to ship 400,000
Linux CD-ROMs this year and reach more than $10 million in sales.
Those numbers do not include downloads over the Internet.</p><p>We also did a technical evaluation, which turned out to be
fairly easy since many of our engineers already had Linux
experience. Linux got high marks all around, technically.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: What advantages do
you see in having products that support Linux?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Jim</b></span>: Customers tell us that
Linux is a secure, reliable, scalable, well-supported operating
system; those qualities make it ideal as a platform for our
enterprise solutions for the Net economy. Linux has a very strong
following among Internet users, particularly with Internet Service
Providers. It is easy to automate management and administration
tasks on Linux, as well as remotely manage Linux systems. In
practice, Linux is extremely reliable and works well for
mission-critical applications.</p><p>In addition to the commercial support available through Linux
vendors such as Red Hat, Caldera and S.u.S.E, customers also get
excellent support from the Internet community. Many customers
mention that Linux support is better than that for more
&ldquo;traditional&rdquo; operating systems.</p><p>One of the biggest advantages customers get is great
price-performance. Linux's reliability, scalability and remote
management capabilities combined with the fact that it runs on
cheap PC-based hardware actually make Linux the price-performance
leader.</p><p>One way companies are dealing with today's IT staff shortages
is by implementing operating systems and software applications that
are based on open source code, such as the Linux operating system.
By working together, the Internet community of developers can
create innovations that no one company could ever afford or be able
to do on its own&mdash;and do so quickly and efficiently. The kind of
distributed development that open source code offers lets everyone
be more productive. Corporate developers, for example, can
implement just the enhancements they need without having to develop
the code themselves. The Internet community is also able to review
the source code for security issues. This allows any security
problems to be quickly and easily resolved. Many security
specialists tell us that the open source nature of Linux makes it
one of the most secure operating systems available.</p><p>Some people ask, &ldquo;Is open source code software reliable?&rdquo;
It can actually be more reliable than commercial software, because
it has such a large pool of developers and beta testers working
with it. With enough diverse people examining the code, just about
every bug is bound to be uncovered and its fix apparent to at least
one developer.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>:
Disadvantages?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Jim</b></span>: Many enterprises are
not yet comfortable with Linux. However, recent announcements of
Linux support from enterprise vendors such as Netscape, Oracle, and
Informix are beginning to change that. Articles like this one are
also helping enterprises to see the advantages of the Linux
operating system.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: What do you find
most attractive about Linux?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Jim</b></span>: The most attractive
thing about Linux for Netscape is that our enterprise customers are
demanding it. They like Linux's security, reliability, scalability
and wide support in the Internet community&mdash;qualities that make it
an ideal platform for companies competing in the Net
economy.</p><p>Linux is strong in many of the same areas as Netscape
products, such as security and support for open Internet
technologies. There are strong synergies between the Linux
operating system and our enterprise software. In addition, the open
source licensing of Linux means that no particular vendor controls
the operating system. In other words, not only is Linux open
source, it is also a truly open operating system.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: How do you compare
Linux with other operating systems?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Jim</b></span>: As I mentioned before,
customers comment that Linux support is better than for more
&ldquo;traditional&rdquo; operating systems. Also, Linux is very popular in
the Internet community, especially with Internet Service Providers,
who need the kind of scalability, reliability and security for
which Linux is known.</p><p>As far as porting our software to Linux, the experience is
similar to porting to other commercial UNIX operating systems. One
key difference between Linux and other operating systems, however,
is that a Linux product only ships when the Internet community says
it is ready, resulting in a much higher-quality product. There is
no marketing pressure to ship a product before it's ready.</p><p>From a security perspective, we believe Linux is a more
secure operating system because of the open source nature of the
code. Because the entire Internet community is able to look at the
source code, any security problems can be quickly and easily
fixed.</p><p>From a development perspective, anyone can develop new
features and functions, not just one vendor. With proprietary
operating systems, if we or any other customer wants an
enhancement, we have to convince the vendor that it should build
the feature into its proprietary OS. With Linux, on the other hand,
if a group of users wants to build a particular enhancement, they
just build it. Linux removes the proprietary nature of operating
systems and moves the control to the customer.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: What other
platforms do you support?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Jim</b></span>: Today, Netscape Server
products are available on many platforms, including Sun Solaris,
HP-UX, Digital UNIX, IBM AIX, SGI IRIX and Windows NT.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: Do you plan to
support Linux with all your products? If not, why not?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Jim</b></span>: We announced in July
that all of our server products will be available on Linux.
Netscape Directory Server and Netscape Internet Messaging Server
will be the first products to be available on Linux and will be out
by the end of the first calendar quarter of 1999. On the client
side, Netscape Communicator is available on Linux now; the Linux
version is the most popular of the UNIX platforms for
Communicator.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: Tell us about the
products you have ported to Linux and why you chose to port
them.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Jim</b></span>: As I mentioned before,
our clients, Netscape Communicator and Netscape Navigator, have
been available on Linux for quite some time. On the server side, we
are working on Netscape Directory Server and Netscape Internet
Messaging Server first. We chose Directory Server because
Netscape's directory service is the cornerstone of our server
products. A scalable, LDAP-capable directory server is a key
component to delivering our solutions for Enterprise Service
Providers (ESPs) and Internet Service Providers (ISPs), our target
customers.</p><p>Netscape Internet Messaging Server, our high-performance
Internet messaging software that enables enterprises and ISPs to
provide &ldquo;mailtone-quality&rdquo; messaging service to millions of
employees and customers, is used by ESPs such as US West and
Knight-Ridder and by ISPs such as World Access. (Similar to
dialtone, mailtone-quality messaging service is a ubiquitous,
universally available, standards-based messaging service that is as
interoperable, scalable, reliable and manageable as the telephone
system.)</p><p>Let me explain further. We all know ISPs are companies that
provide individuals and firms with access to the Internet and other
related services such as web site building and hosting. Enterprise
Service Providers, or ESPs, are companies that deliver their core
businesses as services to all of their customers and partners over
the Internet. In the Net economy, the networks of both types of
companies must meet the demands of thousands&mdash;even millions&mdash;of
users every day, or the companies risk losing business. Together,
Linux and Netscape products provide the scalability, high
performance, reliability and manageability to run the world's
busiest Internet sites.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: Have you
considered making any of your products Open Source?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Jim</b></span>: Back in 1994, Netscape
pioneered the idea of on-line distribution of its key product,
Netscape Navigator. Netscape was both hailed and criticized for
doing this, yet now, a mere four years later, nearly all major
software vendors make their products available for download on the
Internet. While software distribution on the Internet was once
viewed as an unusual idea, it is now commonplace.</p><p>On January 22, 1998, in another unprecedented move, we
announced that we would make the source code to our flagship client
software, Netscape Communicator, freely available for modification
and redistribution on the Internet. This was the first time a
commercial software company allowed broad access to the source code
of a major already-shipping product&mdash;in fact, one of the most
popular software applications in the world. Communicator, also
known as Mozilla, has been available in open source form to the
entire Internet community since March 31, 1998. Not only did we rip
the revenue out of Communicator when we made it free, but we also
made the intellectual property of the product&mdash;the source
code&mdash;available to everyone who wanted to help co-develop it. It's
a great opportunity to leverage the power of the Internet and
enlist an army of developers to help advance the functionality and
features of the browser for all users.</p><p>Mozilla.org (http://www.mozilla.org/) provides a central
point of contact and community for developers interested in using
or improving the Communicator source code. We broke new ground with
the licenses we drew up when we released the Mozilla code. Previous
open-source software licenses have not been attractive to
commercial software developers. The two Netscape licenses&mdash;the
Netscape Public License and the Mozilla Public License&mdash;were
crafted to appeal to three constituencies: open-source code
developers, commercial developers and Netscape customers. Because
the licenses would affect so many people, we put draft versions of
them on the Web for comment and review before they were finalized
and were able to improve the licenses by incorporating much of the
feedback.</p><p>After we released the Communicator source code, we also made
it available for the Netscape Directory SDK in both C and Java;
this is the first open source LDAP SDK to support LDAPv3. The
source code for PerLDAP is also available; PerLDAP gives Perl
developers direct, integrated access to LDAP, making it easier for
them to write directory-enabled applications and automate
processes. The Netscape Directory SDK and the PerLDAP source code
can be found at http://www.mozilla.org/directory/.</p><p>The source code for Netscape Messaging Access SDK is also
available. This SDK includes a set of APIs in C and Java that
enables developers to write applications accessing the services of
messaging servers, such as Netscape Messaging Server, that conform
to Internet messaging standards. The Netscape Messaging Access SDK
can be found at http://www.mozilla.org/msgsdk/.</p><p>We may make other products available in open-source form if
and when it makes sense for both us and our customers. We will
evaluate them on a case-by-case basis.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: What do you think
needs to be added to Linux to make it more attractive to business
users?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Jim</b></span>: We need to get the word
out regarding the availability of commercial software for Linux as
well as the availability of commercial support for Linux. There are
still too many people who think Linux means &ldquo;unsupported&rdquo;, and
that is simply not true. There also needs to be more enterprise
software available for Linux. The most obvious hole had been
support from the major database vendors such as Oracle and
Informix, but since these companies announced plans to port their
databases to Linux, this hole is quickly being filled. Netscape is
pleased to be delivering a Linux version of our client software and
to be working on delivering Linux versions of our server software,
starting with Netscape Directory Server and Netscape Messaging
Server. We'd like to see other enterprise software vendors follow
our lead.</p><p>We'd also like to see more hardware manufacturers, such as
Dell, Compaq, HP and others make systems available that are
preconfigured with Linux. Leaders such as Dell allow large
commercial customers to order systems that are preinstalled with
Linux, but we'd like to see this practice more widely adopted by
the major hardware vendors.</p><p>Finally, although Linux is widely deployed, many Information
Technology executives do not even know it is deployed in their own
shops. We need enterprise customers to be much more vocal about
their use and endorsement of Linux.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: Linux seems to be
climbing rapidly in popularity with all the PR it has gotten
recently. How long do you expect that to last?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Jim</b></span>: I think we're just
beginning to see the development and deployment of ESP and ISP
solutions and applications on Linux.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: What do you see in
the future for your company and Linux?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Jim</b></span>: Eventually, we plan to
make all Netscape products available on Linux.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: Thanks for your
time.</p></div></div>
