    Mr. Benedict show us the way to live in the home of the
    future by using our computer to control lights and
    appliances.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24d5580.0x25cd500"></a></h2></div></div><p>Ever since I was a kid watching the
Jetsons, I've envisioned living in the home of the future, with
intelligent appliances and a central computer controlling the
house, in sync with the occupant's activities.
</p><p>Well, we're not quite there yet, but it has been looming on
the horizon for some time. One of the early pioneers in the home
automation industry was the X10 protocol. Pico Electronics, a small
design house in Glenrothes, Fife, Scotland, developed the X10
project based on a previous project called X9, which was a
random-access scheme for accessing tracks on an audio tape (much
like CD technology of today). Pico was also responsible for
designing some of the first calculator chips. While the X10 system
does have its limitations (some of which are addressed in recent
additions), it is a fairly cheap way to implement home automation
without rewiring your home from scratch.</p><p>The X10 system consists of controllers and modules. The
controllers send &ldquo;power on&rdquo;/&ldquo;power off&rdquo; messages through the
existing house wiring to the controllers, which either throw a
relay or use a triac circuit (an electronic circuit used in light
dimming/motor speed control applications) to perform dimming
operations. Each module is set to an address (1-16) and a house
code (A-P), and the controllers are set to a house code. If
multiple units are set to the same address, they can all be
controlled by one message. If you need additional coverage, you
divide the facility into zones by house code. X10 modules and
controllers, as well as the CP-290 interface for computer control,
can be purchased from a number of mail order vendors, or from Radio
Shack.</p><p>One limitation of the X10 systems is one-way
communication&mdash;no acknowledgement of the signal being received is
returned. Also, the system is limited in range, sometimes having
difficulty getting from one side of the 220V line (split to provide
110V to the home) to the other, in the U.S. anyway. Bridge modules
help with the second problem, and new units are now available that
implement two-way communications (TW-523).</p><p>What does all this have to do with Linux? After having played
around with Linux for a while and learning about
<span   class="bold"><b>cron</b></span>, I started thinking about
leaving my machine on all the time and controlling functions around
the house using my existing X10 gear and the CP-290 interface which
I used to plug into my old DOS box to control the house lights. The
CP-290 can download programs and run the house on its own, but by
letting Linux do the job, I get the extra bonus of letting the
system do other tasks such as upload/download my mail, announce the
time of day and give me verbal reminders.</p><p>Fortunately, someone else had the same idea. Aaron Hightower
(aaronh@acm.org) wrote <span   class="bold"><b>x10-amh</b></span>, a
command-line program which communicates with the CP-290,
controlling those items a person might wish to control around the
house.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>x10-amh</b></span> alone is enough to
work with cron and do tasks automatically; you just make the
appropriate x10-amh commands in your crontab file, and off you go.
Here's a sample from my crontab file:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
55 4 * * mon-fri exec /usr/local/bin/x10 -n 3,4,11
15 5 * * mon-fri exec /usr/local/bin/x10 -f 3,4,11
0 7 * * mon-fri exec /usr/local/bin/x10 -f 10,11,12
0 23 * * sun-thu exec /usr/local/bin/x10 -f 1,4,3,9,6,7
0 9 * * mon-fri exec /usr/local/bin/x10 -f 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12
</pre><p>I'm a frequent participant in Usenet, and one of the groups I
follow is comp.home.automation. If you read this group for any
length of time, you see a plethora of announcements of the latest,
greatest home automation software, with fancy GUIs written for MS
Windows. Being an acknowledged Linux advocate, I started thinking
that Linux deserved a fancy home automation GUI of its own.
</p><p><a href="2504f1.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 1.
x-automate Interface</b></span></a></p><p><span   class="bold"><b>x-automate</b></span> is a Tcl/Tk
frontend that works in conjunction with Aaron's x10-amh. It's fully
customizable, with a remote-control-type interface (Figure 1) and
an assortment of icons representing a few typical home-automation
candidates around my home. In addition to the remote control
interface, you can set up floor plans of your home (Figure 2), with
the devices placed in a reasonable representation of their actual
locations. Carrying the Jetsons' theme one step further, I also
wrote a C program, <span   class="bold"><b>speak</b></span>, that
sends ASCII text through another serial port to a bgmicro
Digitalker speech synthesis board which then &ldquo;says&rdquo; what the
system is doing. This part is optional. You can configure the
system without sound or implement another approach such as
<b  >cat xxx.au &gt; /dev/audio</b> with the appropriate
sound file.</p><p><a href="2504f2.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 2. Home
Floor Plan</b></span></a></p><p>The program and its associated files should be stored
together in a directory. (In my case, it's ~/x10.) You'll have to
run the program from its directory to pick up the bitmap files. The
configuration for your X10 modules is stored in ~/.x10rc and should
look something like the one shown in
<a href="2504l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a>.</p><p><a href="2504f3.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 3.
Configuration Interface</b></span></a></p><p>The program includes a tabular input section for modifying
your configuration (Figure 3). The screen is much like a
spreadsheet, with cells to edit the various parameters for each
unit. You need to indicate the floor the unit is on (for multistory
facilities), the x,y coordinates of the icon for the floor plan
(you can fine-tune this once you load the floor plan), the house
code and the unit number. In addition, you need to assign a
descriptive phrase for the icon prefix and the device, whether it
is dimmable, and the phrase to speak if you're configured for
sound. You can tab from field to field, as well as insert and
delete rows. Once you're finished, store the setup in your .x10rc
file.</p><p>There is also a tabular screen for configuring scheduled
events which can be uploaded to the CP290.
<span   class="bold"><b>x10-amh</b></span> stores event data in the
following format:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
event {
        devmap 2
        daymap 1,2,3,4,5,6,7
        housecode a
        mode today
        minute 39
        hour 23
        function dim
        dimlevel 5
        }
</pre><p><a href="2504f4.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 4.
Events Table</b></span></a>
</p><p>The table in x-automate simplifies editing this data (Figure
4). In short, you need to define the device, the days of the week
for the event, the housecode, the mode, the minute, hour, function
and dimlevel, if applicable. To upload this data from the command
line, you run <b  >x10-amh
<i><tt>filename</tt></i></b>, where
<span   class="emphasis"><em>filename</em></span> contains the schedule data in the
above format.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>x-automate</b></span> also has the
means for accessing other command-line options of x10-amh, mostly
through the menu. You can set the CP-290's date/time, query the
status of the CP290 and perform a self-test.</p><p>To create your floor plans, I recommend using
<span   class="bold"><b>xfig</b></span>, saving or converting the
file to an &ldquo;xbm&rdquo; file for displaying within x-automate. Keep in
mind your screen size when designing your floor plan. A separate
drawing can be made for each floor or area, with the file names
entered in the .x10rc file. Your control icons will be displayed at
the x,y coordinates as defined in your .x10rc file, and can be used
to control devices in the same way as with &ldquo;remote control&rdquo;.
Clicking on the edge of the icon and dragging will move the icon on
the floor plan and update the x,y coordinates in the configuration,
which can be resaved to your .x10rc file. A group of icons in both
large and small sizes (for the floor plan) are included in the
distribution. Feel free to make your own&mdash;if you make some nice
ones, send them to me. Now, Linux users can have a fancy
home-control GUI, just like that &ldquo;other&rdquo; operating system.</p><p><a href="2504s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p><p><a href="2504s2.html" target="_self">Credits</a></p></div></div>
