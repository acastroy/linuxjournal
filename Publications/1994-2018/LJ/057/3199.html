    A look at the Editor's choices for best products of 1998 and
    why she chose them.
    </p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3199f6.jpg"></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1520580.0x1618660"></a></h2></div></div><p> When the <i  >LJ</i> staff
decided to have Editor's Choice Awards this year in addition to the
Readers' Choice, I agreed without truly realizing how difficult it
would be to make decisions. So many fine products that support
Linux are available today, and the number grows daily. This has
indeed been a good year for Linux users, beginning with the
announcement that Netscape would become open source and proceeding
through the announcements of support for Linux by all the major
database companies.
</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3199f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Product of the Year&mdash;Netscape Communicator
</p></div></div>
</p><p>I must admit this one wasn't a hard decision. It is my belief
that Netscape's announcement that Communicator would be open source
started it all. This announcement galvanized the world to find out
about the Open Source movement and the Linux operating system that
was responsible for its creation. Linux needed a big company in its
corner in order for the word to spread, and Netscape provided just
the initiative that was needed.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1520580.0x1618a28"></a>Most Promising Software Newcomers&mdash;GNOME and
KDE</h2></div></div><p>This was probably the most difficult decision, so it ended in
a tie. So many new products are available for Linux this year;
finally, the flood of software applications we have all been
waiting for is happening. However, the one thing everyone has
always said Linux needs to become competitive with the commercial
operating systems is a user-friendly desktop&mdash;both GNOME and KDE
are filling this need.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3199f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Best New Gadget&mdash;Schlumberger Smart Card
</p></div></div>
</p><p>While I was given some interesting suggestions for this one,
I never had any doubt that the Smart Card was the proper choice. A
credit card with a Linux CPU on it is just too extraordinary. The
computer chip embedded in the card stores not only mundane
information about the card holder, but also biometric information
that can be used for identification&mdash;talk about great security! The
suggestion most people gave me was the PalmPilot, which is indeed a
cool product, but even though Linux runs on it, the port was done
by programmers outside 3Com. According to Mr. Bob Ingols, a 3Com
staff member, 3Com does not support Linux and does not plan
to.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3199f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Best New Hardware&mdash;Corel NetWinder
</p></div></div>
</p><p>Corel Computer was the first company to declare Linux as its
operating system of choice and sell computers with Linux
pre-installed. With the continuing growth of Internet popularity,
the network computer's day has come and the NetWinder is one of the
best. It is small, powerful and easily configured. Best of all, it
comes with Linux. Debian's recent port to the ARM architecture
means that it too will run on the NetWinder. A close second was the
Cobalt Qube Microserver&mdash;not only is it a great little server, it's
cute too.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3199f4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Best New Application&mdash;Informix
</p></div></div>
</p><p>Another tough one. My initial choice was the GIMP, but it's
been around for some time (my first thoughts always seem to be free
software). At any rate, a port of a major database to Linux has
long been anticipated, and Informix made the breakthrough with
other database companies following suit. With support from
Informix, Linux can now enter the business &ldquo;big leagues&rdquo;. A close
second, in my mind, is Corel's WordPerfect 8 for Linux for the same
reason&mdash;to be accepted in the workplace, Linux needs this
product.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3199f5.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Best New Book&mdash;<span  class="emphasis"><em>Samba: Integrating UNIX and
Windows</em></span>
</p></div></div>
</p><p>Some might call &ldquo;foul&rdquo; on this one, because it is published
by SSC. However, this award is for the book and the author, John
Blair, not for the publisher. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Samba: Integrating UNIX and
Windows</em></span> was needed and its popularity has proved it.
John has written a comprehensive book of interest to all who are
running multi-OS shops. The book has been endorsed by the Samba
Team, who has gone so far as to make John a member. If the award
had been for &ldquo;best all-around book on Linux&rdquo;, I would have given
it to the ever-popular (with good reason) <span   class="emphasis"><em>Running
Linux</em></span> by Matt Welsh, published by O'Reilly &amp;
Associates.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1520580.0x16195d8"></a>Best Business Solution&mdash;Linux Print System at
Cisco</h2></div></div><p>In our October issue, we had a great article called &ldquo;Linux
Print System at Cisco Systems, Inc.&rdquo; by Damian Ivereigh. In it,
Damian described how Cisco was using Linux, Samba and Netatalk to
manage approximately 1,600 printers worldwide in mission-critical
environments. He also described how he did it and supplied the
source code he used, so that others could also benefit from this
solution&mdash;a wonderful way to contribute to the Linux
community.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1520580.0x16196e0"></a>Most Desired Port&mdash;QuarkXPress</h2></div></div><p><i  >Linux Journal</i> uses Linux as its
operating system of choice on all but one lone machine. For layout,
we must have an MS Windows 95 machine in order to run QuarkXPress.
Each month we hold our breath during the layout period hoping that
when Windows crashes (it always does), it won't be at a critical
juncture. Crashing for no apparent reason creates extra work for
Lydia Kinata, our layout artist, and much stress for all of us each
month. We are more than ready to be rid of this albatross and have
a total Linux shop. Next, like everyone else, we'd like Adobe to
port <span   class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span> its products to Linux.</p></div></div>
