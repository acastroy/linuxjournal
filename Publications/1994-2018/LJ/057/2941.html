    A look at the Linux kernel scheduler.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe81580.0xf79500"></a></h2></div></div><p>One of the most important tasks of an
operating system kernel is to manage processes and threads. A
process is a program in execution, and a thread is just a CPU state
stored within a process. A CPU context is either a process or a
thread. Most processes have only one thread, but some processes,
particularly servers, have more. Sometimes programs other than
servers use multiple threads; Netscape Navigator is an example of
such a program. These processes and threads represent the programs
the user has selected to run. If managing processes and threads is
slow, overall computer performance will also be slow.
</p><p>Linux advocates naturally assume that Linux offers better
performance than MS Windows. Gregory Travis (greg@littlebear.com)
set out to test this assumption by testing the times needed to
manage processes and threads. His benchmark was a simple program
that timed simple operations like
<span   class="bold"><b>fork</b></span> or
<span   class="bold"><b>sched_yield</b></span> by generating a large
number of processes or threads that did nothing more, individually,
than looping in place. His results generated quite a controversy in
the Linux newsgroups and the kernel e-mail list. All tests were
done on a 200 MHz Pentium. (See Table 1.)</p><p><a href="2941f1.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Table
1</b></span></a></p><p>Linux can create a process twice as fast and a thread three
times as fast as NT. Process creation takes longer than thread
creation (12x for NT, 3x for Linux), because processes have much
more overhead. Memory maps and file descriptor tables are just two
of the things that must be created for a process (but not for a
thread). Note, however, that Linux creates an entire process (the
clone function) in about the same amount of time NT takes just to
create a thread (1.0 ms vs. 0.9 ms).</p><p>Using this benchmark and an unmodified Linux 2.0.30 kernel,
NT is much faster than Linux at context switching, either between
processes (1.9x) or threads (3.2x). Since context switching occurs
much more frequently than context creation, it would seem that
Linux has a problem. But does it?</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe81580.0xf798c8"></a>Understanding the Problem</h2></div></div><p>Why does this simple benchmark make the Linux context
switching code so much slower than Windows NT? To answer that, one
must understand the Linux scheduler.</p><p>The scheduler has a list called the run queue containing all
contexts ready to run. These contexts are not sorted in any way.
Each context also has a goodness, which is a measure of the current
priority of the context. Two loops are within the scheduler. The
first loop (the searching loop) finds the context with the highest
goodness from the ready queue and selects that context to run. The
second loop (the recalc loop) recalculates the goodnesses if all
contexts have used their entire time slice. This second loop runs
only occasionally. The code in <a href="2941l1.html" target="_self">Listing
1</a> shows the structure of the schedule function.</p><p>The search loop needs a small bit of CPU time for every
runnable process and needs it on every context switch. The above
benchmark shows the context switch times with 40 contexts present
and ready to run. That corresponds to a load average of 40 for a
single CPU system or 20 for a dual CPU system. These are very large
load averages, much larger than what is normally considered
healthy. Generally, there will be only a few (perhaps one to three)
contexts to choose from. Most processes and threads, even very
active ones, will be waiting for some I/O event to occur and are,
therefore, not on the ready queue and not considered for
selection.</p><p>Even heavily loaded machines will generally have most
contexts waiting for I/O to complete; those contexts will not be on
the run queue. Consider the site http://www.winsite.com/, a very
heavily loaded Internet site, with about 200 copies of
<span   class="bold"><b>httpd</b></span> running as web servers. The
total number of processes for all purposes is about 420. The
machine is a 333MHz Pentium II connected to three T1 lines.</p><p>Measurements of this machine indicate that 24,221,164 context
switches occurred over a 17-hour period (400 switches per second).
For these switches, during 4% of the time there were over 10
contexts ready to choose from at one moment, and during only 0.1%
of the time were there twenty or more. The longest run queue during
the 17-hour stretch was only 36 contexts, out of the 420 possible.
The mean run-queue length averaged only 2.5 contexts. In a sense,
this benchmark represents a worst case for Linux, and the average
case, even for heavily loaded machines, is much better.</p><p>The second (recalc) loop is even more important in
understanding these benchmark results. This recalc loop runs only
when every context on the ready queue has used up its entire time
slice (generally 20 ticks or 0.2 seconds). The recalc loop then
recalculates the priority of each context. Normally, this recalc
loop runs only occasionally. Most rescheduling is done in response
to an interrupt or because of an I/O request; therefore, most
contexts do not use their whole time slice. However, when a process
or thread wants to yield the CPU, it calls sched_yield, which
treats it as if the process had used its entire time slice. In this
way, any process that calls sched_yield has its priority lowered
and will not be scheduled again for a substantial period of time.
The code for sched_yield is shown in
<a href="2941l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2</a>.</p><p>When all contexts have used their entire time slice, the
scheduler recalculates the priority of all contexts using the
recalc loop. Since during this benchmark all contexts do one cheap
operation (sched_yield) and then have <b  >counter</b>
set to zero, this recalc loop runs much more often than normal.
Again, this benchmark seems to be a worst case for Linux.</p><p>For the web site described above, measurements show only one
of 200 context switches required a recalculation of its
priority&mdash;the other 199 context switches did not.</p><p>Half the problem can be solved easily; the other half would
be more difficult.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe81580.0xf79df0"></a>The Search Loop</h2></div></div><p>There is probably no way to make the search loop run faster;
it is well-written code. However, it could be eliminated by simply
keeping contexts in the ready queue in sorted order; then the next
context to run is the context at the head of the ready queue.
Keeping the ready queue in sorted order would require code to take
each context being added to the ready queue and place it in the
appropriate position. The time needed to find this position would
add complexity to the scheduler. For large load averages (implying
many contexts on the ready queue), there might be a considerable
time savings, but in the more normal case of small ready queues,
there is no significant savings.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe81580.0xf79ef8"></a>The Recalc Loop</h2></div></div><p>Minimizing the time needed by the recalc loop would be easy.
Again, it is well-written code not likely to be improved upon, but
it need not run as often as it does. By changing sched_yield, the
recalc loop can run much less often.</p><p>For Linux 2.0.30, sched_yield acts as if the yielding context
has used the entire time slice. Instead, what if sched_yield acted
as if the yielding context had used only one tick of its time
slice? Several effects would be noticed:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The yielding process would have its priority
reduced by one, rather than temporarily set to zero.</p></li><li><p>The recalc loop would run much less often.
Generally, it would run 1/20 as often (depending on process
priority).</p></li></ul></div><p>The new sched_yield is shown in
<a href="2941l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3</a>. Compare it to the one
in Listing 2. Only one more line is included, yet a large increase
in performance is shown for this benchmark.
</p><p>Table 2 summarizes the performance after this change was
made. Note that as the run-queue length increases, both the NT and
the Linux scheduler take longer to context switch. Linux starts out
being the faster context switcher, but NT does relatively better as
run-queue length increases. For run-queue lengths of 20 or less
(almost always the case in real life), Linux is better.</p><p><a href="2941f2.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Table
2</b></span></a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe81580.0xf7a420"></a>Summary</h2></div></div><p>By making a two-line change to the source code, this
benchmark can be greatly improved. However, the benchmark arguably
does not reflect real-life usage. Nevertheless, only a two-line
change to the kernel is required for a significant benefit to a
small number of users. After this change, Linux outperforms Windows
NT in all aspects of process and thread creation and in context
switching.</p><p>All listings referred to in this article are available by
