Learning GCC inline assembly just got one more benefit. Now let's dive in to the
kernel to see how a few things actually work.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2140580.0x2238250"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The GNU C compiler allows you to embed assembly language code into C programs.
This tutorial explains how you can do that on the ARM architecture. As GNU
assembler is similar for different architectures, including assembler syntax
and most assembler directives, the general concepts of inline assembly remain
same for other architectures as well.
</p><p>
Why should you embed assembly code into C? There are at least two reasons:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Optimization:</b></span> the compiler tends to optimize unless specified otherwise. For
some applications, however, hand-written assembly replaces the most
performance-sensitive parts. Because the inline assembler does not require
separate assembling and linking, it is more convenient than a separately
written assembly module. Inline assembly code can use any C variable or
function name that is in scope, so it is easy to integrate it with your C code.
</p></li><li><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Access to processor-specific instructions:</b></span> C does not support saturated math
operations, co-processor instructions or accessing the Current Program Status
Registers (CPSR). C code also does not support ARM LDREX/STREX instructions.
ARM implements its atomic operations and locking primitives with LDREX/STREX.
Inline assembly is the easiest way to access instructions not supported by the
C compiler.
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2140580.0x2238720"></a>
Getting Started</h2></div></div><p>
Let's start with the simple example shown in Listing 1.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2140580.0x2238828"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Listing 1. Example Program</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">

#include&lt;stdio.h&gt;

int add(int x, int y)
{
    int result;
    asm volatile("add %[Rd], %[Rm], %[Rn]"
                 : [Rd] "=r" (result)
                 : [Rm] "r" (x), [Rn] "r" (y)
                 );
    return result;
}

int main(void)
{
    int ret;
    ret = add(5, 7);
    printf("the result is = %d\n", ret);
    return 0;
}

</pre></div><p>
The part from the example program in Listing 1 that needs explanation is
this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
asm volatile("add %[Rd], %[Rm], %[Rn]"
             : [Rd] "=r" (result)
             : [Rm] "r" (x), [Rn] "r" (y)
             );
</pre>
</p><p>
Before explaining the code, let's start with the basics. The
<tt  >asm</tt>
keyword enables you to embed assembler instructions within C code. GCC has two
forms of inline <tt  >asm</tt> statements: basic
<tt  >asm</tt> and extended <tt  >asm</tt>. A basic asm is
one with no operands, while an extended asm includes one or more operands.
Basic asm enables you to include assembly language outside any function. The
extended form is preferred for mixing C and assembly languages within a
function.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2140580.0x2238ca0"></a>
Basic asm and Extended asm</h2></div></div><p>
A basic asm statement has the following format:

<pre     class="programlisting">
asm [volatile] (Assembly code)
</pre>
</p><p>
The <tt  >volatile</tt> qualifier is optional here. All basic
<tt  >asm</tt> statements are implicitly volatile.
</p><p>
Assembly code is a string that can contain any assembly instruction(s)
recognized by the GNU assembler, including directives. A C compiler does not
parse or check the validity of the assembly instructions. Assembly code
parsing and syntax checking is done at the assembling stage. A single
<tt  >asm</tt> string
may contain multiple assembler instructions. You can use a newline followed by
a tab (<tt  >\n\t</tt>) to break and indent the code in the next line.
</p><p>
Below is an example of basic asm in the kernel
(arch/arm/include/asm/barrier.h):

<pre     class="programlisting">
#define nop() __asm__ __volatile__("mov\tr0,r0\t@ nop\n\t");
</pre>
</p><p>
This is simply:

<pre     class="programlisting">
asm volatile("mov r0,r0");
</pre>
</p><p>
The above inline assembly copies the <tt  >r0</tt> register
content to itself. <tt  >nop()</tt> ends up
only introducing some delay. 
</p><p>
Note that the <tt  >asm</tt> keyword is a GNU extension. Use
<tt  >__asm__</tt> instead of <tt  >asm</tt> when
your code is compiled with <tt  >-ansi</tt> and the various
<tt  >-std</tt> options. The Linux kernel uses both
<tt  >__asm__</tt> and <tt  >asm</tt> for compatibility.
</p><p>
An extended <tt  >asm</tt> statement has the following syntax:

<pre     class="programlisting">
asm [volatile] (Assembly code
                : OutputOperands /* optional */
                : InputOperands  /* optional */
                : Clobbers       /* optional */
                )
</pre>
</p><p>
The <tt  >volatile</tt> qualifier is optional here. However,
<tt  >asm</tt> statements may produce side
effects while operating on inputs and generating outputs. You may need to use
the <tt  >volatile</tt> qualifier to disable certain
optimizations in that case.
</p><p>
Assembly code is a string literal that is a combination of fixed text and
tokens that refer to the input and output parameters.
<tt  >OutputOperands</tt> and
<tt  >InputOperands</tt> are optional comma-separated lists of C variables. Clobbers are
also an optional comma-separated list of registers or other special values.
Read on for more about these.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2140580.0x2239900"></a>
Coming Back to the Example</h2></div></div><p>
The example program from Listing 1 includes an extended
<tt  >asm</tt> statement. Colons delimit each
operand parameter after the assembly code:

<pre     class="programlisting">
"add %[Rd], %[Rm], %[Rn]"
</pre>
</p><p>
This is the string literal containing the assembly code:

<pre     class="programlisting">
[Rd] "=r" (result)
</pre>
</p><p>
Output operands consist of a symbolic name enclosed in a square bracket,
followed by a constraint string and a C variable name enclosed in
parentheses:

<pre     class="programlisting">
[Rm] "r" (x), [Rn] "r" (y)
</pre>
</p><p>
The list of input operands uses similar syntax as output operands.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2140580.0x2239c70"></a>
More on Output, Input and Clobbers</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Output Operands</b></span>
</p><p>
<tt  >OutputOperands</tt> has the following format:

<pre     class="programlisting">
[asmSymbolicName] constraint (cvariablename)
</pre>
</p><p>
An <tt  >asm</tt> statement has zero or more output operands indicating the names of C
variables modified by the assembler code.
<tt  >asmSymbolicName</tt> specifies a symbolic
name for the operand. Square brackets are used to reference this inside the
<tt  >asm</tt>
statement. The scope of the name is the <tt  >asm</tt> statement that contains the
definition.
</p><p>
You also can use the position of the operands in the assembler template (for
example, if there are three operands, <tt  >%0</tt> to the
first, <tt  >%1</tt> for the second
and <tt  >%2</tt> for the third). You can re-write the example code as: 

<pre     class="programlisting">
asm volatile("add %0, %1, %2"
             : "=r" (result)
             : "r" (x), "r" (y)
             );
</pre>
</p><p>
A constraint is a string constant specifying restrictions on the placement of the
operand. Refer to the GCC documentation for a full list of supported
constraints for ARM and other architectures. The most commonly used
constraints are &ldquo;r&rdquo;, used as general-purpose registers (r0 to
r15); &ldquo;m&rdquo;, which refers to any valid
memory location, and &ldquo;I&rdquo; for immediate integer. Constraint
character may be prefixed 
with constraint modifiers:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
<tt  >=</tt> &mdash; write-only operand, used for output
operands.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >+</tt> &mdash; read-write operand, must be listed as an
output operand.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >&amp;</tt> &mdash; register used for output only.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Output operators must be write-only, and input operands are read-only.
Constraints without any modifiers are read-only. So, it should be clear why
the output
operand in the example program has <tt  >"=r"</tt> and input
operands <tt  >"r"</tt>.
</p><p>
But, what if your input and output operands are the same?
<tt  >"+r"</tt> can be used as
a constraint and must be listed as output operands:

<pre     class="programlisting">
asm volatile("mov %[Rd], %[Rd], lsl #2"
             : [Rd] "+r" (x)
             );
</pre>
</p><p>
The assembly code goes here:

<pre     class="programlisting">
#APP
@ 5 "inline_shift.c" 1
    mov r3, r3, lsl #2
@ 0 "" 2
</pre>
</p><p>
Sometimes a compiler may choose the same register for input and output, even if
you do not instruct it to do so. If your code explicitly requires different
registers for input and output operands, use the
<tt  >"=&amp;"</tt> constraint modifier.
</p><p>
Constraints in an output operand should follow a
<tt  >cvariablename</tt> that must be an
<tt  >lvalue</tt> expression for output operands.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Input Operands</b></span>
</p><p>
Input operands have a similar syntax as output operands. But, constraints
should not start with &ldquo;=&rdquo; or &ldquo;+&rdquo;. Input operands' constraints for registers do
not have any modifiers, as they are read-only operands. You should never try to
modify the contents of input-only operands. Use <tt  >"+r"</tt> when input and output
operands are the same, as explained above.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Clobbers</b></span>
</p><p>
Sometimes inline assembly may modify additional registers, as side effects, apart
from those listed in the output operands. In order to make the compiler aware of this
additional change, you need to list them in a clobber list. Clobber list items
are either register names or the special clobbers. Each clobber list item is a
string constant and is separated by commas. When the compiler allocates registers
for input and output operands, it does not use any of the clobbered registers.
Clobbered registers are available for any use in the assembler code. Let's
take a closer look at an inline add program that does not have a clobber list. The
inline assembly code may look like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
#APP
@ 6 "inline_add.c" 1
    add r3, r3, r2
@ 0 "" 2
</pre>
</p><p>
Here the code uses register <tt  >r3</tt> and
<tt  >r2</tt>. Now let's modify it and list
the <tt  >r2</tt> and <tt  >r3</tt>
registers in a clobber list:

<pre     class="programlisting">
asm volatile("add %[Rd], %[Rm], %[Rn]"
             : [Rd] "=r" (result)
             : [Rm] "r" (x), [Rn] "r" (y)
             : "r2", "r3"
             );
</pre>
</p><p>
The assembly code:

<pre     class="programlisting">
#APP
@ 6 "inline_add2.c" 1
    add r4, r1, r0
@ 0 "" 2
</pre>
</p><p>
Notice that the compiler did not use the <tt  >r2</tt> and
<tt  >r3</tt> registers as they were mentioned 
in the clobber list. The processor can use <tt  >r2</tt> and
<tt  >r3</tt> for any other work in the assembly
code.
</p><p>
There are also two special clobbers available apart from registers:
&ldquo;cc&rdquo; and
&ldquo;memory&rdquo;. The &ldquo;cc&rdquo; clobber indicates that the assembler code modifies the CPSR
(Current Program Status Register) flag register. The &ldquo;memory&rdquo; clobber tells
the compiler that the inline assembly code performs memory reads or writes on
items apart from input and output operands. The compiler flushes the register
contents to memory so that memory contains the correct value before executing the
inline asm. Moreover, the compiler reloads all memory access after the inline asm
statement so that it gets a fresh value. This way, the &ldquo;memory&rdquo; clobbers form
a read-write compiler barrier across the inline <tt  >asm</tt> statement.
</p><p>
In Linux, a compiler barrier is defined as a macro
<tt  >barrier()</tt> that is nothing but
a memory clobber:

<pre     class="programlisting">
#define barrier() __asm__ __volatile__("": : :"memory")
</pre>
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Important:</em></span>

Inline Assembly in the Linux Kernel</h2></div></div><p>
Now that I've gone through the basics of GCC inline assembly, let's move on
to a more interesting topic&mdash;its usage in the Linux kernel. The rest
of this
article is architecture-dependent and is discussed with respect to ARMv7-A. Basic
knowledge of ARM and assembly language will be helpful in understanding the rest of
the material covered here.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
A Little Background</b></span>
</p><p>
In multitasking computers, shared resource accesses must be restricted to only
one modifier at a time. This shared resource can be a shared memory location or
a peripheral device. Mutual exclusion, a property of concurrency control,
protects such shared resources. In a single processor system, disabling
interrupts could be a way of achieving mutual exclusion inside critical
sections (although user mode cannot disable interrupts), but this solution
fails in SMP systems as disabling interrupts on one processor will not prevent
others from entering the critical section. Atomic operations and locks are used
to enforce mutual exclusion.
</p><p>
Mutual exclusion enforces atomicity. Let's consider the definition of atomicity
first. Any operation is atomic if the operation is entirely successful and its
result is visible to all CPUs in the system instantaneously, or it's not successful
at all. Atomicity is the basis of all mutual exclusion methods.
</p><p>
All modern computer architectures, including ARM, provide hardware
mechanisms
for atomically modifying the memory locations.
</p><p>
The ARMv6 architecture introduced the concept of exclusive accesses to memory
locations for atomically updating memory. The ARM architecture provides
instructions to support exclusive access.
</p><p>
LDREX (Load Exclusive) loads the value of a given memory location into a
register and tags that memory location as reserved.
</p><p>
STREX (Store Exclusive) stores an updated value from a register back to a given
memory location, provided that no other processor has modified the physical
address since its last load. It returns 0 for success, and 1 otherwise, to a
register indicating whether the store operation completed successfully.
By checking this return value, you can confirm whether any other processor has
updated the same location in between.
</p><p>
These instructions need hardware support to tag a physical address as
&ldquo;exclusive&rdquo; by that specific processor.
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Note:</em></span>
ARM says:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
If a context switch schedules out a process after the process has
performed a Load-Exclusive but before it performs the Store-Exclusive, the
Store-Exclusive returns a false negative result when the process resumes, and
memory is not updated. This does not affect program functionality, because the
process can retry the operation immediately.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
The concept of exclusive accesses also is related to the concepts of local and global
monitors, memory types, memory access ordering rules and barrier instructions.
See the Resources section of this article for more information.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Implementation of Atomic Operations</b></span>
</p><p>
Atomic integer operations are generally required to implement counters. As
protecting a counter with a complex locking scheme is overkill,
<tt  >atomic_inc()</tt>
and <tt  >atomic_dec()</tt> are preferable. All the atomic
functions in the Linux kernel
are implemented using LDREX and STREX.
</p><p>
Take a look at <tt  >atomic_t</tt> defined in
include/linux/types.h as the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
typedef struct {
        int counter;
} atomic_t;
</pre>
</p><p>
After simplifying the macro definitions, the
<tt  >atomic_add()</tt> function definition in
kernel-4.6.2 (arch/arm/include/asm/atomic.h) looks like Listing 2.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2140580.0x25465f0"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>

"       bne     1b"                                                     
        : "=&amp;r" (result), "=&amp;r" (tmp), "+Qo" (v-&gt;counter)               
        : "r" (&amp;v-&gt;counter), "Ir" (i)                                   
        : "cc");                                                        
}

</pre></div><p>
Let's take a closer look at the code shown in Listing 2.
</p><p>
The function below uses PLD (Preload Data), PLDW (Preload Data with intent to write)
instructions that are typically memory system hints to bring the data into
caches for faster access:

<pre     class="programlisting">

prefetchw(&amp;v-&gt;counter);

</pre>
</p><p>
<tt  >ldrex</tt> loads the &ldquo;counter&rdquo; value to
&ldquo;result&rdquo; and tags that memory location
as reserved:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ldrex   %0, [%3]
</pre>
</p><p>
The following adds i to the &ldquo;result&rdquo; and stores that to
&ldquo;result&rdquo;:

<pre     class="programlisting">
add     %0, %0, %4
</pre>
</p><p>Two scenarios are possible here:

<pre     class="programlisting">
strex   %1, %0, [%3]
</pre>
</p><p>
In first scenario, strex successfully stores
the value of &ldquo;result&rdquo; into the memory location and returns 0
at &ldquo;tmp&rdquo;. This
happens only when no other processor has modified the location in between the
last load and store by the current processor. However, if any other processor
has modified the same physical memory in between, the current processor's store
fails. In this case, it returns 1 at &ldquo;tmp&rdquo;. 
</p><p>
This instruction tests equivalence and sets the Z (zero) flag of CPSR if
&ldquo;tmp&rdquo;
is 0 or clears it if &ldquo;tmp&rdquo; is 1:

<pre     class="programlisting">
teq     %1, #0
</pre>
</p><p>
For a successful store scenario, the Z flag is set. So, the branch condition
does not satisfy. However, if store fails, the branch takes place and
execution
starts again from the <tt  >ldrex</tt> instruction. The loop continues until store is
successful:

<pre     class="programlisting">
bne     1b
</pre>
</p><p>
All other atomic operations are similar and use LDREX and STREX.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Barriers</b></span>
</p><p>
If a sequence of memory operations is independent, the compiler or CPU performs it
in a random fashion to achieve optimization&mdash;for example:

<pre     class="programlisting">
a = 1;
b = 5;
</pre>
</p><p>
However, to synchronize with other CPUs or with hardware devices, it is
sometimes a requirement that memory-reads (loads) and memory-writes (stores)
issue in the order specified in your program code. To enforce this
ordering, you
need barriers. Barriers are commonly included in kernel locking, scheduling
primitives and device driver implementations.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Compiler Barrier</b></span>
</p><p>
The compiler barrier does not allow the compiler to re-order any memory access
across the instruction. As discussed before, the
<tt  >barrier()</tt> macro is used as
a compiler barrier in Linux:

<pre     class="programlisting">
#define barrier() __asm__ __volatile__("": : :"memory")
</pre>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Processor Barriers</b></span>
</p><p>
Processor optimizations, such as caches, write buffers and out-of-order
execution, can result in memory operations occurring in a different
sequence from the
program order. A processor barrier is an implied compiler barrier as well. ARM
has three hardware barrier instructions:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Data Memory Barrier (DMB) ensures that all memory accesses (in program order)
before the barrier are visible in the system before any explicit memory
accesses after the barrier. It does not affect instruction prefetch or
execution of the next non-memory data access.
</p></li><li><p>
Data Synchronization Barrier (DSB) ensures that all pending explicit data accesses
complete before any additional instructions execute after the barrier. It does
not affect prefetching of instructions.
</p></li><li><p>
Instruction Synchronization Barrier (ISB) flushes the pipeline and prefetch
buffer(s) so that once ISB has completed, the processor can fetch the next instructions
from cache or memory.
</p></li></ol></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2140580.0x25477d0"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>

#define isb(option) __asm__ __volatile__ ("isb " #option : : : "memory")
</pre></div><p>
<tt  >SY</tt> is the default. It applies to the full system, including all processors and
peripherals. Refer to the ARM manual for other options. Linux provides various
memory barrier macros that are mapped to the ARM hardware barrier
instructions:
read memory barrier, <tt  >rmb()</tt>; write memory barrier,
<tt  >wmb()</tt>; and full memory barrier,
<tt  >mb()</tt>. There also are corresponding SMP versions:
<tt  >smp_rmb()</tt>, <tt  >smp_wmb()</tt> and
<tt  >smp_mb()</tt>. When the kernel is compiled without
<tt  >CONFIG_SMP</tt>, <tt  >smp_*</tt> are simply
barrier() macros.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Spinlock</b></span>
</p><p>
To execute any critical section code atomically, you need to ensure that no two
threads of execution should execute critical sections
concurrently. As described
in Robert Love's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Kernel Development</em></span>, &ldquo;The term threads of execution implies any
instance of executing code. This includes, for example, a task in the kernel,
an interrupt handler, a bottom half, or a kernel thread.&rdquo;
</p><p>
For uniprocessor systems, spinlock implementation boils down to disabling
preemption or local interrupts. <tt  >spin_lock()</tt> disables preemption.
<tt  >spin_lock_irq()</tt> and
<tt  >spin_lock_irqsave()</tt> disable local interrupts. But, this is
not sufficient for SMP, as other processors are free to execute the critical
section code simultaneously.

    dsb_sev();

#define wfe()   __asm__ __volatile__ ("wfe" : : : "memory")

#define sev()   __asm__ __volatile__ ("sev" : : : "memory")

</pre></div><p>
Linux uses an improved version of the ticket lock algorithm to implement spinlock.
Like atomic instructions, the spinlock implementation uses LDREX/STREX.
</p><p>
The <tt  >wfe</tt> (Wait
For Event) and <tt  >sev</tt> (Send EVent) ARM instructions need some introduction here.
<tt  >wfe</tt> puts the ARM processor into a lower power state until a wake-up event
occurs. The wake-up events for <tt  >wfe</tt> include the
execution of an <tt  >sev</tt> instruction
on any processor on an SMP system, an interrupt, an asynchronous abort or a debug
event. While contending for a spinlock, the processor goes to a low power state
instead of being busy waiting, hence saving power. The
<tt  >ACCESS_ONCE</tt> macro prevents
the compiler from an optimization that forces it to fetch the
<tt  >lock-&gt;tickets.owner</tt> value each
time through the loop. A memory barrier <tt  >smp_mb()</tt> is
required after you get a
lock and before you release it, so that other processors can be updated on
time with whatever is happening on the current processor.
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Note:</em></span>
acquiring and releasing a lock should be atomic. Otherwise, more than one
thread of execution may acquire the same lock in parallel causing a race
condition.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Semaphore</b></span>
</p><p>
Semaphores and mutexes can sleep, unlike a spinlock. When a task is holding
a
semaphore and another task attempts to acquire it, the semaphore places the
contended task onto a wait queue and puts it to sleep. When the semaphore
becomes available, the scheduler wakes one of the tasks on the wait queue
to
acquire the semaphore. As you can see in Listing 5, the semaphore
implementation uses
<tt  >raw_spin_lock_irqsave()</tt> and
<tt  >raw_spin_unlock_irqrestore()</tt> to acquire the lock.
If another task is holding the semaphore, the current task releases the
spinlock
and goes to sleep (as sleeping is not an option while holding the
spinlock), and
after waking up, it re-acquires the spinlock. <tt  >up()</tt>
is used to release the
semaphore that also uses the spinlock. <tt  >up()</tt> may be
called from any context and
even by tasks that have never called <tt  >down()</tt>, unlike
mutexes.

    return result;

</pre></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Mutex</b></span>
</p><p>
A call to a mutex may take two different paths. First, it calls
<tt  >__mutex_fastpath_lock()</tt> to acquire the mutex. Then
it falls back to
<tt  >__mutex_lock_slowpath()</tt> if it fails to acquire the
lock. In the latter case, the
task is added to the wait queue and sleeps until woken up by the unlock path.

     */
    __mutex_fastpath_lock(&amp;lock-&gt;count, __mutex_lock_slowpath);
    mutex_set_owner(lock);
}

</pre></div><p>
<tt  >__mutex_fastpath_lock</tt> is a call to
<tt  >atomic_sub_return_relaxed()</tt> that is an
atomic operation&mdash;atomically subtract i from v and return the result.
Similarly, <tt  >mutex_unlock()</tt> uses
<tt  >atomic_add_return_relaxed</tt> for incrementing the
counter atomically.
