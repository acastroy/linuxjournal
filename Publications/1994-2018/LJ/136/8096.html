Plug in to an international project and discover
new mathematical truths.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcdc580.0xdd4450"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The Prime Internet Eisenstein Search, PIES, is a long-term effort to
discover prime numbers. PIES is trying to exploit a property of a small
class of numbers previously overlooked by other mathematicians, called
Generalized Eisenstein Fermat numbers. These numbers have the newly
discovered property that they are quicker and easier to prove prime
than are typical numbers. Also in their favor is the fact that they are
exceptionally dense in primes, more so than the candidates in any other
prime-hunting project.
</p><p>
The PIES Project is orchestrated by Phil Carmody, a British mathematician
living and working in Finland. Phil is the mathematician who discovered,
back in 2001, the first &ldquo;illegal&rdquo; prime. This prime number
can be unpacked into the original source code for
DeCSS, the software that decodes the DVD encryption scheme. He also has
discovered a second prime number that actually can execute the code.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="8096f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div><p>
Contributors to PIES come from the US, Canada,
Finland, Germany, France and a couple of other
places around the world, although it is a relatively
small international project. In true Linux form,
the project is based all on volunteer work, runs on a small budget,
is international and produces real results. The goal
is pure research and somewhat esoteric&mdash;the discovery
of large prime numbers of a slightly unusual form.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcdc580.0xdd4818"></a>
Prime Numbers</h2></div></div><p>
Prime numbers are those numbers that can be divided by 1 and themselves
only. The numbers 1 and 0 are not considered prime, and the number 2 is
the only even prime number. Primes are a fundamental part of our numbering
system, and the search for prime numbers has fascinated mathematicians for
more than two millennia. Today, prime numbers are used for public-key
encryption, and large prime number searches are computationally intensive.
The world's largest primes all are archived at Professor Chris Caldwell's
&ldquo;Prime Pages&rdquo;, hosted at the University of Tennessee at Martin.
Prime Pages not only archives the world's largest primes, but it also is the
world's most complete resource for information on prime numbers.
</p><p>
The simplest method of determining whether a number is prime was
understood by the ancient Greeks. Simply divide the number by primes
smaller than the square root of the number being tested. Doing so finds
all factors of the number; if none are found, the number is
prime. This works reasonably well if your numbers are small, but when they
get large, you need to be a bit smarter about how you search, calculate
and prove that the number is indeed prime. Finding what you believe to be
a prime number is not enough. Mathematicians are required to provide
proof.
</p><p>
Bernard Riemann gave a lecture in 1859 in which he proposed a way to count
prime numbers as a general rule. Proving what is known as the Riemann
Hypothesis was one of the great mathematical challenges of the last
century, and it continues to be so this century as well. Trying to figure out how
many primes are in a range and what the distribution looks like within that range
is an active area of research that helps drive the search for prime
numbers.
</p><p>
Prime numbers are a kind of backbone for our number
system. The use of prime numbers is more than simple
intellectual play for mathematicians. Once Ron Rivest
and his colleagues figured out that prime numbers
were the way to make Whitfield Diffie's idea of
asymmetrical, or public-key, cryptography a reality,
prime numbers became indispensable. The more security
required, the larger the prime numbers have to be.

The PIES Project</h2></div></div><p>
The mathematics behind the PIES Project is somewhat esoteric and is
explained partly on the project home page. It shares some properties with
other large-prime-hunting projects, namely that it is a cyclotomic form,
that is a factor of a<sup  >b</sup>&ndash;1. Other
cyclotomic forms are Mersennes (2<sup  >p</sup>&ndash;1) and
Generalized Fermat Numbers
(b<sup  >(2n)</sup>+1). The PIES primes are the first of
the cyclotomic forms that can be found in large sizes, in large
quantities and quickly but are not explicitly of the form
a<sup  >b</sup>&ndash;1 or a<sup  >b</sup>+1.
This particular PIES form, Generalized Eisenstein Fermat numbers, was
first looked at in-depth by English amateur mathematician Mike Oakes
several years before PIES started. But, it was because of Phil Carmody's
advances in sieving&mdash;that is, quick removal of obvious non-primes because
they have small, easily found factors&mdash;and fast primality testing
algorithms that it became practical to look at the larger numbers with
which PIES currently is working. Cyclotomic numbers are what you get from
evaluating cyclotomic polynomials. The nth cyclotomic polynomial is
denoted by Phi(n), and its value at b is denoted by Phi(n,b). Mersennes
are Phi(p,2), and Generalized Fermat Numbers (GFNs) are
Phi(2<sup  >n</sup>,b). The
PIES Generalized Eisenstein Fermats are
Phi(3*2<sup  >n</sup>,b).
</p><p>
Dr David Broadhurst of the Open University has
been watching the development of the PIES Project
with interest, although he has not devoted any cycles
to it. When asked for his opinion, he said:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
This is good maths, good programming and good fun. Phil
Carmody managed to enliven Professor Chris Caldwell's
database of the top 5,000 proven primes. Previously it
consisted almost entirely of strings ending with -1
or +1, since those forms were tuned to existing
primality proving programs. Now, Phil and his
friends have added several hundred entries beginning
with Phi, which is math-speak for a cyclotomic
polynomial, albeit a rather simple one in this case,
based on the cube roots of unity. Phil was able to
do this without losing processing speed. In fact,
he even may have gained speed on rivals, thanks to
specific properties of the two cube roots of unity
that are complex numbers.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Although Phil is serious about mathematics and his various projects, he
does it all for fun. His somewhat unusual sense of humor can be seen on
the PIES Project home page. He believes that PIES is the only distributed
computing project with a project song, for example. As one might guess
from how the project name doesn't quite seem to parse correctly, it is
indeed a complete contrivance, done simply so that the project name was fun
and the search could be &ldquo;themed&rdquo;. Each fixed value of n in
Phi(3*2<sup  >n</sup>,b)
defines a band in which primes can be hunted as b varies. Phil calls the
small n=13 range &ldquo;cherries&rdquo;, the n=14 range
&ldquo;peaches&rdquo; and the recently
started n=15 range &ldquo;apples&rdquo;. Only he and his girlfriend, Anna, who assists
with the project's image, words and song lyrics, know what the upcoming
ranges will be called.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcdc580.0xdd5108"></a>
Distributed Computing</h2></div></div><p>
The work for such prime number finding projects falls into two main areas.
First, the head-scratching is performed by the mathematicians to determine
how to find prime numbers and prove they are prime. If necessary, this
step involves writing custom programs that are optimal for the task at hand. The
second part is the computational work involving network communications and
systems management. It makes for a productive partnership, with little of
the overhead that accompanies larger projects.
</p><p>
Most large primes are found by distributed computing
projects, as can be seen from the top finders' tables
on the Prime Pages. Therefore a real but friendly sense
of competition exists among projects and also among individuals involved. Both get
scores and are ranked by discovering large numbers,
the most numbers and numbers with particular special
forms. For most of 2004, PIES was the single largest
project by count of prime numbers, as it was working
on a hugely fruitful band of small prime numbers,
of about 50,000 digits. Alas, all those primes have
dropped off the Prime Pages' Top 5,000 list, and the
project now is only the third largest producer by
count of primes. Phil considers the ranking by count
to be not particularly important&mdash;large quantities
of small primes are not particularly challenging. They
also are a bad investment, as they don't stay on
the list long.
</p><p>
Probably the best known search project is the Great Internet Mersenne
Prime Search (GIMPS). This project is seeking the largest Mersenne prime
number, which is, at the moment, also the largest prime number of any
form. In February 2005, the largest known prime number, with 7,816,230
digits, was discovered. The calculations took 50 days on one 2.4GHz
machine, and independent verification required an additional five days. A second
verification took 15 days. The discoverer, Dr Martin Nowak from Germany,
joined GIMPS six years ago. In essence, he has been calculating for six
years to find this one number, only the 42nd Mersenne prime found. The
41st was discovered in May 2004; the project has found only eight since 1996.
GIMPS lists about 41,000 people involved in the calculations, many
of whom allow their personal machines' idle CPU cycles to be used to
crunch numbers. Other participants have large academic or commercial
facilities at their disposal, helping the GIMPS global network sustain
over 17 teraflops.
</p><p>
According to Professor Caldwell, Phil has implemented
an important advance by looking at numbers that
often are quicker to test for primality than are the usual numbers.
In a decade or so, such a project
may be able to compete seriously with GIMPS for the
primes of record size. This would happen not because they are somehow
better projects but because the Mersennes numbers
steadily thin out, and many other forms don't thin
out so quickly. Even when the Mersennes once again
lose their lock on the largest known prime, they
may stay the most important primes because of their
long history.
</p><p>
Professor Caldwell, who happens to run his Prime Pages
on Linux, said, &ldquo;PIES quickly has established
itself as a major player by finding a large number
of primes in the 100,000 digit range. I myself am a
PIES member, and I really appreciate the thought and
effort Phil has put into his system.&rdquo; There are a
number of other projects, some even in the teraflop
category. In contrast to these larger projects,
PIES is working on a smaller scale and within
smaller ranges of digit size. More numbers are being
discovered more quickly, in a sense backfilling from
the high Mersenne numbers. In the list of the largest
known prime numbers, PIES has reached 191,362 digits
as of April 4, 2005, but expects to find a new larger prime roughly once
a week.
</p><p>
For simply attracting project members, the ideal distributed computing
setup is client-architecture neutral. All of the largest distributed
projects work equally well with Linux, *BSD and other OSes running on the
clients. Phil decided to use Perl to
write both his client and his server, as it provided all of the
networking primitives that he needed and is secure by design. The task of
actually exchanging assignments and results is such a small part of the
whole project that a p-coded, or compiled into intermediate form, language
such as Perl is perfectly fast enough.
</p><p>
Phil intends to adapt his server so that it can be used for arbitrary
distributed prime-hunting projects. He then plans to release it as free software.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcdc580.0xdd5478"></a>
Linux Computational Facilities</h2></div></div><p>
PIES runs almost exclusively on Linux machines. Linux has enabled the
installation of a reliable OS across many machines, and an
individual license for each machine would be a significant cost. Linux
administration is easy, making it possible for one part-time person to
administer a cluster, and a lot of admin tools are available. Linux
works well on almost any hardware, which means a 200MHz machine can be
used as a subnet gateway or a DNS server, further saving money.
Inexpensive hardware and a free OS gives the hobbyist the ability to run
advanced facilities that produce first-class results.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8096f2.large.jpg"><img src="8096f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. PIES Computational Facility
</p></div></div><p>
Phil runs the project's central server from an Alpha
machine at his home. He first used Linux as his OS
of choice in late 1993 and turned his back entirely
on what one might call high-street operating systems
about five years ago. He has several other Linux
machines, which he uses as clients. He typically
develops for Linux only, but he doesn't discriminate against
architectures&mdash;for example, he has enrolled several
Alpha testers. He happily builds for BSDs and
UNIX-alikes and begrudgingly for whatever else may
be out there.
</p><p>
One of the US computational support sites is located in Vermont, in Bob
Bruen's barn. The barn was built for horses, so there are stables and two
open areas on the first floor and a large open space on the second floor.
One of the two first-floor spaces now is the PIES computational facility.
The facility was under construction before PIES to support work in Linux,
networks and security. Rather than let the facility waste CPU cycles, Bob
offered PIES access to the machines while they aren't working on other
tasks. For a while now, there have been no such other tasks.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8096f3.large.jpg"><img src="8096f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Bob's Barn
</p></div></div><p>
The Vermont facility is a dedicated cluster of more than a dozen machines
ranging from 450MHz to 3GHz, with several SMP machines on a separate
subnet in Bob's barn. The facility is linked by a wireless bridge to the
house, which in turn has a cable modem connection to the Internet. The
majority run Red Hat 9.0 and Fedora Core 2, but SUSE, Mandrake and Debian
have been installed as well.
</p><p>
The hardware was purchased at auction or on sale, and it is server-class
hardware: rackmount, heavy-duty case, some SMP, SCSI and a lot of memory.
The same auctions yielded racks, switches and other hardware
for pennies on the dollar.
</p><p>
Even with Linux as a foundation, there still are some problems. Although the
auction-bought servers did not mind, one Dell SMP server failed in the
extreme cold in the unheated barn. There were several days of temperatures
20&ndash;25 degrees below zero, Fahrenheit. Occasionally, an individual server
has required attention, but by and large, as one would expect from Linux
machines, they keep on running. The wireless bridge required a reboot
once during the same cold snap. The most serious problem, however, has been the
primitive electrical power in that part of Vermont.
</p><p>
One additional, small US facility is located in Arizona, where Steven Harvey, a
criminal defense lawyer, runs PIES on Mandrake 10.1. He uses several
machines for other prime number searches. Phil, a permanent resident
of Espoo (near Helsinki), which is also home to the server and his few
client machines, is working several hundred kilometers away, in Turku.
Within a few days of moving there, he already investigated buying a
handful of refurbished PCs. In order to keep costs minimal, he intends to
buy systems with no hard or floppy drives, simply booting off a CD
instead. Although Debian is his favorite distribution for desktop and server use, he
plans to boot diskless machines with Knoppix.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcdc580.0xdd5b00"></a>
Results</h2></div></div><p>
The outcome of the project can be seen on Professor Caldwell's prime number Web site at the
University of Tennessee at Martin (see the on-line Resources). The Vermont facility has found over 50 prime
numbers, including the six largest, in about 18 months. PIES overall has
found more than 900 large prime numbers.
</p><p>
Nearly 100 more primes from 150,000&ndash;200,000 digits are expected from the
current &ldquo;apple&rdquo; band. The next band, which won't be started until the
current band approaches completion, probably will contain at least 40
primes of between 300,000 and 400,000 digits. Presently, only 50
known primes of that size exist in the world. The PIES Project's impact on the
record tables, despite its current relatively small size, therefore is
expected to be quite significant.
