If you put high-end digital audio on a Linux box, it had better run
quiet. This issue looks at hardware, audio manipulation, security and
more.

I know you're more interested in the parts list for
the Ultimate Linux Box (page 44) than this column,
so go ahead and check it out. I'll wait. Like it?
And now that we can run a four-way SMP, 64-bit monster
in silence, shouldn't noisy fans be a thing of the
past for ordinary systems too? My Commodore 64 didn't
need a fan. The original Apple Macintosh didn't
need a fan. But almost all of today's supposedly
more advanced systems come with them. And who let
the power supply fan and the CPU fan mate and spawn
the north bridge fan and the video card fan? Enough.
</p><p>
Hard drives do make noise, but we have ways to deal
with the impact. Laptop mode, which Bart Samwel
covered last year, lets you keep your hard drive spun
down most of the time. And NFS, ATA over Ethernet
and other technologies mean that you can move noisy
disks to the other end of a long wire from your
long-suffering ears.
</p><p>
Pretty much all desktop systems have more processing
power than we can use, so now it's time to think
about our quality of life. We have to thank the
lm_sensors development team for making it possible
to measure temperature safely&mdash;a must for fan-free
cooling experiments.
</p><p>
Now that I think about it, my Commodore 64 booted
pretty quickly too. Ron Minnich has part of the
answer: replace the legacy proprietary BIOS with
the fast-booting LinuxBIOS. Every motherboard is
a little different, though, so getting LinuxBIOS
working on a new one is a challenge. Get started on
page 323232d check in with our Web site for details
and further steps.
</p><p>
Since the theme of this issue is faster hardware, we
made a point of bringing back kernel developer Paul
McKenney, of RCU fame, to fill you in on what the
CPU is doing behind your back. Your instructions in
a different order putting. Make the CPU do a sanity
check on page 52.
</p><p>
Now that you have your Linux system running as quietly
as possible, Dave Phillips has some gnarly
details on ALSA sound. Learn how you can do mixing,
MIDI and more, whether you have the pro sound
hardware from this year's Ultimate Linux Box or an
ordinary PC sound card (page 58).
</p><p>
Toshiyuki Maeda is back with more on running ordinary
applications as part of the kernel. This time he's
using the x86-64 architecture and running a real
application, MySQL, in kernel space to look for
possible performance improvements (page 20).

We got our columnists and contributing editors
together for Editors' Choice Awards 2005 (page 82).

happening on the Web site (<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/8272" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/8272</a>).

Our Paranoid Penguin column is going through a change.
Mick Bauer, star of DEFCON, Linux Lunacy cruise talks
and two editions of an O'Reilly book, is taking some
time for other projects, and Paranoid Penguin will
be written by various contributors, as Kernel Korner
is now. Mick, thanks for all the good advice over
the years and for the look to the future on page 28.
