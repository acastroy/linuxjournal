Just because Linux can be more secure than other systems
doesn't mean that your Linux system is. How can developers
and distributors help the sysadmins of the future?
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14a5580.0x159d348"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Did you know that I've been writing this column
for the better part of five years? And what an
action-packed five years they've been! In that time,
we've seen some of Linux's biggest former competitors
embrace it, and Linux has made significant inroads
as a desktop platform.
</p><p>
In the realm of Linux security, there also have been
remarkable advances. Linux's firewall functionality
now is so mature that it's the basis for a number of
embedded firewall appliances, not to mention countless
non-security-related devices as well. Linux supports
a staggering variety of security tools, making it
a favorite among security auditors and consultants.
In addition, Linux has formed the basis for several ultra-secure
role-based access control (RBAC)-based operating
systems, most notably the NSA's SELinux.
</p><p>
But what about the future of Linux security? I've
written a lot about present and past Linux security
issues but never about the future, aside from my interview
with the forward-looking Richard Thieme. This month,
I'd like to indulge in a little speculating and
editorializing and talk about where I think Linux
security will go and where I think it <span   class="emphasis"><em>ought</em></span>
to go.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14a5580.0x159d558"></a>
What's Wrong with the Present?</h2></div></div><p>
The revelation a lot of people have been having about Linux security
lately is typical Linux systems are not that much more secure than are typical
Microsoft Windows systems. Before the e-mail flames begin, let me explain this
statement. First, personally, I do happen to think that Linux is more
securable than Windows, and I've said so repeatedly in this very
column over the years. Users simply have more control over
their Linux systems' behaviors than they do with an equivalent Windows system.
</p><p>
The problem is Linux users, like Windows users, tend to focus most of
their energy on getting their systems to do what they need them to do,
and they place too much trust in their system's built-in or default security
settings. Then, when the inevitable software bugs surface, those bugs'
effects tend to be more extensive than they would have been had greater
precautions been taken.
</p><p>
For example, if I run BIND v9 for name services, it takes some work and
some research to get things working. It takes still more work to get BIND
running in a chroot jail, so that the named process can see and use only a
subset of the server's filesystem. Therefore, many if
not most BIND users tend <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> to run BIND in a chroot jail.
When a BIND vulnerability surfaces in the wild, the
majority of BIND users probably experience more pain than if they'd done
the chroot thing. It's probably the same amount of pain they
would experience if they had run a Microsoft name server with fewer security
features than BIND has.
</p><p>
All of this is simply to say that many of Linux's security features
and capabilities are not taken advantage of by its users. The
end result is, at least according to friends of mine who regularly do
professional penetration testing, your average Red Hat Enterprise system
isn't significantly harder to break in to than your average Windows 2003
Server system.
</p><p>
This is unfortunate and perhaps surprising. Given the complete transparency of its code base,
Linux still seems to be prone to the same kinds of software bugs, in roughly
the same quantity and frequency, as Windows. But if you think about it, why
wouldn't this be so? As with Windows, Linux represents an amazingly complex mass of code produced
by hundreds of different people. The more code there is, the more bugs
there may be, right?
</p><p>
I recently was interviewed by SearchSecurity.com for an article about a
Microsoft-funded study conducted by Security Innovation, Inc. The study concluded that Windows
is more secure than Linux, a conclusion based mainly on frequency
of security bugs and mean time to issue patches. I believe I correctly criticized the study for looking
only at these easily quantifiable aspects of security
and not taking into consideration Linux's other
security advantages, such as customizability and greater choice
of software packages. In other words, I felt
the study had the most relevance when comparing
default installation scenarios, irrespective of each
OS' potential for being secured by its users.
</p><p>
But the more I think about it, the more I worry that perhaps a
platform's security potential doesn't count unless most systems
running that platform actually reach that potential. This isn't
strictly a function of end-user behavior; I'm not trying to impugn system
administrators. As I elaborate later, I think Linux's developers and
distributors must continue to figure out ways to make security features
more ubiquitous, transparent and easy to configure and use. By the way,
because I'm comparing Linux with Windows, in fairness I should point out
that Windows too has many security features that its users often do not
take advantage of.
</p><p>
Okay, Linux and Windows both are much less secure by default than they
could be, and both are subject to an unwinnable race between software
bugs and security patches. What else are we up against?
</p><p>
Alas, both operating systems use a rather primitive discretionary access
control model in which entire categories of security settings and
behaviors are optional. In this model, one superuser account&mdash;root in Linux,
Administrator in Windows&mdash;has god-like power over the entire
system, including other users' files. In both OSes, group memberships
can be used to create different levels of access, say, to delegate
various root powers. In practice, however, on most systems you have
to be logged on as the superuser or temporarily become that user in
order to do anything important.
</p><p>
As a result, gaining complete control over any Linux or Windows
system is a matter of compromising any process running with superuser
privileges. But wait, you say, I've configured my important d&aelig;mons
to run as unprivileged users; bugs in those d&aelig;mons can't lead to
total compromise, can they? No, not directly, but bugs in other
software may make it possible for a non-root process to escalate
its privileges. For example, suppose you've got a Web server running Apache, and one
day an attacker manages to exploit an unpatched Apache buffer overflow
vulnerability that results in the attacker getting a shell session
on your server. At this point, the attacker is running as www,
because that's the user Apache is running as. But suppose further that
this system also has an unpatched kernel vulnerability that involves
local privilege escalation.
</p><p>
You, the system administrator, may even know about this vulnerability
but have opted not to patch it, because after all, it's strictly a
local vulnerability, and nobody besides you has a shell account on this
system, and who wants to have to reboot after patching the kernel? But
now a remote attacker does have local shell access, and if she
successfully exploits this kernel vulnerability, she's root! This
all-too-common scenario illustrates that bugs are bad enough, but they're
even worse when combined with a root-takes-all security model.
</p><p>
This, in a verbose nutshell, is the present state of Linux
security. Securing Linux requires us to expend considerable effort to
take full advantage of sometimes-complicated security features that
usually are not enabled by default, to keep absolutely current on
all security patches, and to do all of this within the limitations
of Linux's simple security model. But we're in good company: most
commonly used contemporary operating systems have exactly the same
limitations and challenges.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14a5580.0x159da80"></a>
Mandatory Access Controls</h2></div></div><p>
I've alluded to the fact that access controls or file permissions on Linux,
UNIX in general and Windows are discretionary, and that this is a
weak security model. Well, what about SELinux? Doesn't that use RBACs and type enforcement (TE), both of which are examples
of mandatory access controls? Yes, indeed, it does. But I'm afraid that
this probably isn't the future of Linux security, for the same reasons
that SELinux isn't a huge part of present Linux security.
</p><p>
RBACs restrict users' behavior and access to system
resources based on carefully defined roles that are analogous to but more
far-reaching than the conventional UNIX groups mechanism. Similarly,
type enforcement restricts processes' activities based on their
predefined domains of operation. The net effect of RBAC and TE is to
create segregated silos (my term) in which users and processes operate,
with strictly limited interaction being permitted between silos.
</p><p>
This is an elegant and effective security model. However, for most
people, RBAC, TE and other mandatory access controls are too complicated
and involve too much administrative overhead. This, in many people's
view, dooms SELinux and similar operating systems to the realm of niche
solutions: OSes that are useful to people with specific needs and
capabilities but not destined for widespread adoption. Despite admiring
SELinux's security architecture and being a fan of the concept of RBAC
in general, I do not think that mandatory access controls by themselves
are likely to revolutionize Linux security.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14a5580.0x159dc38"></a>
Hypervisors and Virtual Machines</h2></div></div><p>
If RBAC and TE do in fact prove too unwieldy to compartmentalize security
breaches at the OS level, hypervisors and virtual machines (VMs) may
achieve this at a higher level. We're already familiar with virtual
machines in two different contexts: runtime virtual environments, such
as those use by Java programs, and virtual platforms, such as VMware,
plex86 and VirtualPC, that allow you to run entire operating systems
in a virtualized hardware environment.
</p><p>
The Java Virtual Machine was designed with particular security features,
most notably the Java sandbox. In general, though, Java security comes
from the fact that Java applets run isolated from raw or real system
resources; everything is mediated by the Java Virtual Machine. Besides
being a good security model, it's also relatively simple to use safely,
both for programmers and end users. Java also is, for many reasons,
already ubiquitous.
</p><p>
Virtual platforms take this concept a step further by mediating not only
individual programs but the operating systems on which they run. Security
architecture in this scenario, however, isn't as mature as with the
Java Virtual Machine. For the most part, security is left to the guest
operating systems running in the virtual environment. A SUSE Linux virtual
machine running on VMware, therefore, is no more or less secure than a
real SUSE system running on its own hardware.
</p><p>
Hypervisor technology addresses the need to isolate
virtual machines running on the same hardware from
one another, restrict their interactions and prevent a
security breach on one virtual machine from affecting
others. IBM has created a security architecture called
sHype for hypervisors. An open-source hypervisor/virtual-machine
project called Xen also is available.
</p><p>
Although the driving purpose of a hypervisor is to prevent any one virtual
machine from interfering with other virtual machines running on the same
hardware&mdash;for example, by monopolizing shared hardware
resources&mdash;the idea of having some sort of intelligence managing systems at this level
is powerful. It may even have the potential to overshadow or, at
the very least, significantly augment traditional intrusion detection
systems (IDSes) as a means of detecting and containing system compromises.
</p><p>
Mandatory access controls and hypervisors/virtual machines aren't mutually
exclusive. On the one hand, I am of the opinion, strongly influenced
by my friend and fellow security analyst Tony Stieber, that hypervisors
have much greater potential to shape the future of Linux security than
do MACs. But on the other hand, the two can be used together. Imagine a large, powerful server system running several virtual machines
controlled by a hypervisor. One VM could be running a general-purpose
OS, such as Linux, serving as a Web server. Another VM, serving as a
database for sensitive information, could run a MAC-based OS such as
SELinux. Both VMs would benefit from security controls enforced by the
hypervisor, with SELinux providing extra levels of security of its own.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14a5580.0x159def8"></a>
Anomaly-Based Intrusion Detection and Antivirus</h2></div></div><p>
One additional technology, like MACs and hypervisors, already
exists today but potentially will have a much bigger impact on the
future: the anomaly-based intrusion detection system. The idea of
anomaly-based IDS is simple: it involves creating a baseline of normal
network or system activity and sending an alert any time unexpected or
anomalous behavior is detected.
</p><p>
If the idea is simple and the technology already exists, why isn't this
approach commonly used? Because it isn't nearly as mature or easy to use
as signature-matching. We're all familiar with signature-based IDSes; they
maintain databases of attack signatures, against which observed
network packets or series of packets are compared. If a given packet
matches one in the attack database, the packet is judged to be part of
an attack, and an alert is sent.
</p><p>
The strengths of this approach are that it's easy to use and typically
involves few false positives or false alarms. The fatal weakness
of signature-based systems is if an attack is too new or too
complicated for there to be a corresponding signature in your IDS'
signature database, it is not detected.
</p><p>
With anomaly-based IDS, in contrast, any new attack that sufficiently
differs from normal behavior is detected. The trade-off is the
IDS administrator must train and periodically re-train the IDS system
in order to create the normal-behavior baseline. This results in a period
of frequent false positives, until the baseline has been fine-tuned.
</p><p>
I attended a lecture by Marcus Ranum in 1999 or so in which he described
anomaly-based systems as the future of IDS. Obviously, we're not
there yet. Such products are available from vendors
such as Lancope and Arbor Networks. But I remain hopeful that someone
will figure out how to do this sort of thing in ways that are cheaper
and easier to use than current systems. Potentially, this could lead to a
sort of network hypervisor that lends the same sort of intelligence to
networks, whether comprised of virtual or real machines, that hypervisors
lend to virtual platforms.
</p><p>
By the way, virus scanners need and can benefit from anomaly detection
technology as much as IDSes do. This point is illustrated amply
by the fact that the vast majority of organizations that use modern
virus scanners, which rely almost exclusively on virus-signature
matching, nonetheless suffer from major virus/trojan/worm outbreaks. Current
signature-based antivirus tools clearly are not effective enough.

Conclusion&mdash;and Goodbye for Now</h2></div></div><p>
So those are my thoughts on the future of Linux
security. In the mean time, keep on using the
techniques this column has focused on over the years:
firewalls, virus-scanners, automatic-patch/update
tools, VPNs and application-specific security
controls such as chroot jails and audit trails.
</p><p>
With that, I bid you farewell, not only for this month but indefinitely.
It's time for me to focus on other things for at least a little while
and allow fresh voices take over the Paranoid Penguin. I'm continuing in
my role as Security Editor and in that capacity will keep on doing my bit
to help <i  >Linux Journal</i> bring you outstanding security content. I
also will try to contribute an article now and then myself, on an ad hoc basis. But
the article you are reading now is my last as exclusive author of this column.
</p><p>
Thanks to all of you for five years of support, encouragement and
edification&mdash;I've never made a mistake in this column that wasn't noticed
and corrected by someone out there and always to my benefit. It's
been a great five years, and I'm grateful to this terrific magazine's
staff and readers alike for all you've done for me!
