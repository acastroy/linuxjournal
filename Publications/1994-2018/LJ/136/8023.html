When user code runs inside the kernel, system calls
become function calls, 50 times faster. How does that affect
the performance of a real application, MySQL?
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf6b580.0x1063240"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Kernel Mode Linux (KML) is a technology that
enables the execution of user processes in kernel
mode. I described the basic concept and the
implementation techniques of KML on IA-32
architecture in my previous article, &ldquo;Kernel Mode Linux&rdquo;, which appeared
in the May 2003 issue of <i  >Linux Journal</i> (see
the on-line Resources). Since then,
I have extended KML to support AMD64, or x86-64,
architecture, which is a viable 64-bit extension
of the IA-32 architecture. In this article, I briefly
describe the background of KML and then show the
implementation techniques of KML for the AMD64
architecture. In addition, the results of a
performance experiment using MySQL are presented.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf6b580.0x10633f8"></a>
The Problem of Protection by Hardware</h2></div></div><p>
Traditional OS kernels protect themselves by using
the hardware facilities of CPUs. For example, the
Linux kernel protects itself using a privilege level
mechanism and a memory protection mechanism built in to CPUs.
As a result, to use the services of the kernel, such as
the filesystem or network, user programs must perform costly and complex
hardware operations.
</p><p>
In Linux for AMD64, for example, user programs
must use special CPU instructions (SYSCALL/SYSRET)
to use kernel services. SYSCALL can be regarded as
a special jump instruction whose target address is
restricted by the kernel. To utilize system services or,
in other words, to invoke system calls, a user program
executes the SYSCALL instruction. The CPU then raises
its privilege level from user mode to kernel mode
and jumps to the target address of SYSCALL, which is
specified by the kernel in advance. Then, the code
located at the target address switches the context of
the CPU from the user context to the kernel context
by using the SWAPGS instruction. Finally, it executes the
requested system service. To return to the user
program, the SYSRET instruction reverses these steps.
</p><p>
Some problems exist, however, in this
protection-by-hardware approach. One problem is
system calls become slow. For example, on
my Opteron system, SYSCALL/SYSRET is about 50 times
slower than a mere function call/return.
</p><p>
One obvious solution to speed up system calls is to
execute user processes in kernel mode. Then, system
calls can be only the usual function calls, because user
processes can access the kernel directly. Of course,
it is dangerous to let user processes run in
kernel mode, because they can access arbitrary portions
of the kernel.
</p><p>
One simplistic solution to ensure safety is
to use virtual machine (VM) techniques such as VMware
and Xen. If user programs and a kernel are executed
in virtual kernel mode, user programs can access the kernel directly.
However, this protection-by-VM approach does not quite work, because the overhead of
virtualization is considerable. In addition, although
VM can prevent user programs from destroying the host
system outside of the VM, it cannot prevent them
from destroying the kernel inside the VM. It is unlikely that
these difficulties could be solved even if CPUs, such as Intel's
Vanderpool and AMD's Pacifica, provide better support for virtualization.
</p><p>
A recommended way to execute user processes
in kernel mode safely is to use safe languages, also known as
strongly typed languages. The recent advances
in static program analysis, or type theory, can be
used to protect the kernel from user processes. For
example, many technologies already enable this
protection-by-software approach, such as Java
bytecode, .NET CLI, Objective Caml, Typed Assembly
Language (TAL) and Proof-Carrying Code (PCC). I currently
am implementing a TAL variant that is powerful
enough to write an operating system kernel.
</p><p>
Based on this idea, I implemented Kernel Mode Linux
(KML) for IA-32, a modified Linux kernel that can
execute user processes in kernel mode, called
kernel-mode user processes. My previous article
described KML for IA-32. Since then, I have
implemented KML for AMD64, because AMD64
has come into widespread use as a possible successor
to IA-32. Interestingly, in spite of the similarities
between IA-32 and AMD64, the implementation
techniques of KML for these two architectures differ
considerably. Therefore, I describe the basic
concept, usage and implementation techniques
of KML for AMD64 in the rest of this article.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf6b580.0x1063710"></a>
How to Use KML for AMD64</h2></div></div><p>
KML is provided as a patch to the source of the
original Linux kernel. To use KML, all you have to
do is patch the original source of the Linux kernel
with the KML patch and enable the Kernel Mode Linux
option at the configuration phase, as you might do with
other kernel patches. The KML patch is available
from the KML site (see Resources).
</p><p>
In current KML, programs under the directory
/trusted are executed as kernel-mode user
processes. Therefore, if you want to
execute bash in kernel mode, all you have to do is
execute the following commands:

<pre     class="programlisting">
% cp /bin/bash /trusted/bin
% /trusted/bin/bash
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf6b580.0x10638c8"></a>
How to Speed Up System Call Invocations</h2></div></div><p>
In KML for IA-32, system call invocations are
translated automatically into fast, direct function
calls without modifying user programs. This is possible
because the recent GNU C Library for IA-32 has a
mechanism to choose one of several methods that
the kernel provides for system call invocation, and
the KML provides direct function calls as one way of
invoking system calls.
</p><p>
However, the GNU C Library for AMD64 doesn't have
such a mechanism for choosing among methods of system call invocations.
Therefore, I created a patch for
the GNU C Library. With the patch, kernel-mode user
processes can invoke system calls rapidly, because
the invocations automatically are translated to
function calls. The patch is available from the KML
site (see Resources).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf6b580.0x1063a28"></a>
What Kernel-Mode User Processes Can Do</h2></div></div><p>
One of advantages of KML is the kernel-mode
user processes are almost the same as usual user
processes except for their privilege level. That
is, kernel-mode user processes can do almost anything that
ordinary user processes can do. For example, kernel-mode
user processes can invoke all system calls. This means they can use
filesystems. They also can call open, read, write and other
functions, including network systems, with socket,
connect and bind. They even can create processes and
threads with fork, clone and execve. In addition,
they have their own memory address space that they can
access freely. Even if a kernel-mode user process
uses tons of memory, the kernel pages out the memory.
</p><p>
Moreover, the scheduling mechanism and the signal
mechanism of the original Linux kernel work for the
kernel-mode user processes. You can check this by
executing the following commands:

<pre     class="programlisting">
% cp /usr/bin/yes /trusted/bin
% /trusted/bin/yes
</pre>
</p><p>
You should notice that your system does not hang. This is true,
because the kernel's scheduler preempts the
kernel-mode yes and gives CPU time to other
processes. You can stop the kernel-mode yes
by sending Ctrl-C. This means the kernel can
interrupt the kernel-mode yes and send a signal to
kill it.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf6b580.0x1063c38"></a>
What Kernel-Mode User Processes Cannot Do</h2></div></div><p>
As described in the previous section, kernel-mode
user processes are ordinary user processes and can
perform almost every task that user processes can perform.
However, there are a few exceptions:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Kernel-mode user processes cannot modify their GS
segment register, because KML uses the GS segment register
internally to eliminate the overhead of SWAPGS
instruction.
</p></li><li><p>
32-bit binaries cannot be executed in kernel mode on AMD64.
KML for AMD64, like other typical OS kernels for AMD64, runs
in 64-bit mode and there is no efficient way to let 32-bit
programs directly call 64-bit functions.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
Please notice that, as in the case of KML for IA-32,
these limitations are present only in kernel-mode user
processes. Ordinary user processes can alter their
GS selector, and IA-32 binaries can be executed if an
IA-32 emulation environment is set up.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf6b580.0x1063f50"></a>
How KML Executes User Processes in Kernel Mode</h2></div></div><p>
The way to execute user processes in kernel mode in
AMD64 is almost the same as it is in IA-32. To execute
user processes in kernel mode, the only thing KML
does is launch user processes with the CS segment
register, which points to the kernel code segment
instead of user code segment.
</p><p>
In AMD64 CPUs, the privilege level of running
programs is determined by the privilege level of
their code segment. This is almost the same as
in IA-32 CPUs; the only difference is the
segmentation memory system is degenerated in AMD64.
Although segment registers still are used in 64-bit mode
of AMD64, the only segment that the segment
registers can use is the 16 EB flat segment. Thus,
the role of the segment descriptors is simply to
specify privilege levels. Therefore, only four segments&mdash;kernel code segment, kernel data
segment, user code segment&mdash;exist in 64-bit mode.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf6b580.0x10640b0"></a>
The Stack Starvation Problem and Its Solution</h2></div></div><p>
Although it is fairly easy to execute user processes
in kernel mode, as shown in the previous section,
there is a big problem&mdash;the stack starvation
problem. The problem itself is almost the same as
that of KML for IA-32, so I describe it briefly
here. Further details are available in my previous
article.
</p><p>
The original Linux kernel for AMD64 handles
interrupts and exceptions by using the legacy
interrupt gates mechanism. For each
interrupt/exception, the kernel specifies an
interrupt handler by using the interrupt gates in
advance, typically at boot time. If an interrupt
occurs, the AMD64 CPU suspends the running program,
saves the execution context of the program and
executes the interrupt handler specified in the
corresponding interrupt gate.
</p><p>
The important point is the AMD64 CPU may or may not
switch stacks before saving the execution context,
depending on the privilege level of the suspended program. If the program is running in
user mode, the CPU automatically switches from the
stack of the running program to the kernel stack,
whereas the CPU does not switch stacks if the
program is running in kernel mode. The CPU then
saves the execution context&mdash;RIP, CS, RFLAGS, RSP
and SS register&mdash;to the stack.
</p><p>
Now, let us assume that a kernel-mode user process
accesses its memory stack, which is not mapped by the
page tables of the CPU. First, the CPU raises a page
fault exception, suspends the process and tries to
save the execution context. This cannot be done, however,
because the CPU does not switch stacks, and
the stack where the CPU is ready to save the context
is nonexistent. To signal this serious
situation, the CPU tries to raise a special
exception, a double fault exception. Again, the CPU tries to access the nonexistent stack
to save the context. Finally, the CPU gives up and
resets itself. This process is known as the stack starvation
problem.
</p><p>
To solve the stack starvation problem, KML for IA-32
uses the task management mechanism of IA-32 CPUs.
The mechanism can be used to switch CPU contexts
including all registers and all segment registers,
when interrupts or exceptions are raised. KML
for IA-32 switches stacks using the mechanism when
double faults are raised. However, in 64-bit mode
on AMD64, the task management mechanism cannot be used
because it simply does not exist.
</p><p>
Instead, KML for AMD64 uses the Interrupt Stack
Table (IST) mechanism, which is a newly introduced
mechanism of the AMD64 architecture. In AMD64, the
task state segment (TSS) has fields for seven pointers
to interrupt stacks. In addition, each interrupt
gate descriptor has a field for specifying whether
the CPU should use the IST mechanism instead of the
legacy stack switching, and if so, which interrupt
stack should be used. If an interrupt occurs that
is specified to use the IST mechanism, the CPU
unconditionally switches from a user stack to the
interrupt stack specified in the interrupt
gate descriptor.
</p><p>
In KML for AMD64, all interruptions and exceptions
are handled with the IST mechanism. Therefore, even
if an interrupt or exception occurs while a
kernel-mode user process is running with its %rsp
pointing to an invalid memory, the kernel can keep
running without any problem, because the CPU switches
stacks automatically.
</p><p>
There are two reasons why KML for AMD64 handles not
only double faults but also other interrupts and
exceptions with the IST mechanism. One reason is
that the overhead incurred by the IST mechanism is
negligibly small. Therefore, I think it is
better to keep it simple. Handling only double
faults with the IST mechanism requires complex
modifications to the original kernel, as in KML for
IA-32. Second, the red zone of the
stack is required by System V Application Binary
Interface for AMD64 architecture. The red zone
is a 128-byte memory range located just below the stack,
that is, from %rsp - 8 to %rsp - 128. System V ABI
for AMD64 specifies that user programs can use the
red zone for temporary data storage and signal
handlers, and interrupt handlers should never touch
the zone. If KML handles an interrupt with the usual
interrupt handling mechanism, this red zone is
corrupted, because a stack is not switched. In this case, some
CPU contexts are overwritten to the red zone if a
kernel-mode user process is running. Therefore, KML
for AMD64 handles all interrupts/exceptions with the
IST mechanism in order to provide System V ABI to
user programs correctly.
</p><p>
There also is a limitation in KML for IA-32:
kernel-mode user processes cannot change their CS
segment registers. This is not possible because KML for IA-32
requires at least one scratch register to switch
from a user stack to a kernel stack manually when
exceptions or interrupts are raised. It prepares
the register by using the memory where the CS
register is saved. This limitation is not applicable
to KML for AMD64, because stacks are switched by the
IST mechanism. It is not so important, however, to
change the CS segment register in 64-bit mode of
AMD64 because there can be only two code segments.

Performance Measurement</h2></div></div><p>
To see how much performance improvement is possible,
I ran the Wisconsin benchmark for MySQL both
on the original Linux kernel and on KML, using
sql-bench, which comes with MySQL. The experimental
environment is shown in Table 1. In the test on KML,
both the MySQL server and the benchmark client were
executed as kernel-mode user processes, and the
patched GNU C Library was used to eliminate the
overhead of system call invocations. In addition,
the loop count of the test was increased to 10,000, as
the default loop count of 10 was too small to produce
meaningful results.
</p><div class="table"><a name="N0xf6b580.0x1064580"></a><p class="title"><b>
Table 1. Experimental Environment
</b></p><table     summary="&#10;Table 1.

The result is shown in Table 2. The second column
shows the total CPU time consumed by the benchmark.
The third and forth columns show the breakdown of
the total CPU time. The third column shows the CPU
time consumed by the user process, and the forth
column shows the CPU time consumed by the kernel.
</p><div class="table"><a name="N0xf6b580.0x105b5f8"></a><p class="title"><b>

The results show that the total CPU time was
improved by about 3%. The user CPU time was improved
by about 1%, and the system CPU time was improved by
about 14%. The result indicates that KML could
improve the performance of database
applications slightly by eliminating the overhead of system
call invocations.

Conclusion and Future Work</h2></div></div><p>
KML is a modified Linux kernel that can execute
user processes in kernel mode. By executing in
kernel mode, the performance of user programs can be
improved by, for example, eliminating the overhead
of system call invocations. Besides the performance
improvement, KML also can be used to ease inspection
and debugging of the kernel and development of kernel
modules, because kernel-mode user processes can access
the kernel and use large amount of memory and CPU
time. I now am considering implementing a helper
library to provide kernel-mode user processes
with an easy way to access kernel functions and data
by exporting them as some kind of shared object.
