Turn a borrowed machine into your personal Linux box, with
a distribution you can carry on a business-card CD or USB key.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17e5580.0x18dd3a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Honestly, Fran&ccedil;ois, why does <span   class="emphasis"><em>ultimate</em></span> always have to mean bigger,
faster and more resource-intensive? <span   class="emphasis"><em>Mon Dieu</em></span>, sometimes all this
speeding up just seems to make things work more slowly. Although I think your
idea of building a supercomputer cluster in the restaurant would be
a wonderful idea for this month's Ultimate Linux Box issue, there simply
isn't room. The wine cellar? <span   class="emphasis"><em>Non</em></span>, Fran&ccedil;ois, the wine cellar is
for wine and I would like to keep it that way, and I'm sure our guests
would agree. Speaking of which, they will be here any moment.
</p><p>
Ah, Fran&ccedil;ois, they are already here. Welcome, everyone, to <span   class="emphasis"><em>Chez
Marcel</em></span>,
home of the world's greatest wine cellar and of course, the best in
fine Linux fare. Your tables are ready. Please sit and make yourselves
comfortable. Fran&ccedil;ois, to the wine cellar! Please bring back the 2003
Auslese Riesling from Germany. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Vite!</em></span>
</p><p>
While my faithful waiter fetches the wine, let's take
a look at another definition of what constitutes
the ultimate Linux box. Fran&ccedil;ois suggested a
supercomputer. I was thinking of something much
smaller, but nevertheless extremely useful&mdash;something
small enough to fit in my pocket. On more than one
occasion, I've been saved by having a copy of Linux
with me. Actually, the person saved was usually a
user of another OS who had the kind
of trouble that only a Linux system could help them
out of. The mini-distributions I carried with me
tended to be single-diskette (sometimes two or three)
distributions with basic text-based tools. Today,
I want to introduce you to a couple of excellent
ways to take Linux with you wherever you go. These
mini-distributions are no longer stripped-down
sets of text-based tools, but fully graphical, fully
networked distributions that still can fit in your
pocket or wallet. Best of all, they can run entirely
from a live mini-CD or USB key.
</p><p>
The first item on the menu is one of my personal
favorites, the cleverly named Damn Small Linux (DSL).
DSL is a Debian-based distribution
built using live CD technology. The whole
thing is less than 50MB and can fit on a business-card-sized CD, which you can get at your local computer
or office store. Download your ISO image (see the on-line
Resources), burn it
to a CD (it easily can be a standard CD as well as
the business-card size), and reboot your PC.
</p><p>
DSL is extremely light and fast. It uses Fluxbox for a window
manager. You can run it on modest hardware with very little memory&mdash;as little as 16MB. DSL comes with a number of desktop applications,
all of which are designed to be equally light and fast. There are Dillo
and Firefox Web browsers, Sylpheed for e-mail, an instant messaging
and IRC client called Naim, XMMS for music, Xpaint for graphical editing
and screenshots, FLwriter for word processing, Siag for spreadsheets
and a host of others. Check out Figure 1 to see DSL in action.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8302f1.large.jpg"><img src="8302f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. DSL provides a
rich but resource-lean desktop experience.
</p></div></div><p>
There is no program starter button in the lower left-hand corner with
this distribution. To bring up the menu, right-click anywhere on the
desktop and the top-level application menu appears offering you
several submenus covering everything DSL has to offer. To banish the
menu, left-click on a blank portion of the desktop.
</p><p>
One of the first things you probably want to do
is set up networking. Right-click to bring up the
menu, select System, then Net Setup. The options
there include dial-up, network card configuration,
DSL (the other DSL) and some wireless support as
well. ndiswrapper is included for those cards that
support only Microsoft drivers. All of these network
choices are menu-driven; simply fill in the blanks.
</p><p>
Speaking of the System menu, look under Daemons and you'll discover
another rather amazing aspect of DSL. An SSH server, NFS, a
Web server and an FTP server are there as well. Printer d&aelig;mon support also
is available using classic LPD.
</p><p>
In all of this, DSL still manages to include some desktop eye-candy. From
the Desktop menu, navigate over to Styles and you can choose from a
small handful of alternate looks.
</p><p>
Before I move on to the next item on today's menu, let me direct you to
the Tools menu under Apps. Look near the bottom and you'll see an option
to install DSL to a hard drive, which can be pretty tiny, as well as
one to install it to a USB pen drive so you can carry it with
you. There are also menu items to enable apt and Synaptic so you
easily can install other packages. The usefulness of this is obvious if
you install to disk, but look back to the top of the Tools menu for
another reason.
</p><p>
The option is labeled Make myDSL CD remaster, and with it you
can create your own custom-DSL distribution. When you click on
this option, another window appears with instructions on how
to change to runlevel 2 to remaster. In effect, you need to reboot
and type <tt  >dsl toram 2</tt> at the boot prompt. Then, when the
shell prompt appears, type <tt  >mkmydsl</tt>. This process is
somewhat beyond the space I have alloted, but I direct you to
<a href="http://www.damnsmalllinux.org/talk/node/113" target="_self">www.damnsmalllinux.org/talk/node/113</a> if you want to roll
your own DSL.
</p><p>
Another tiny graphical Linux you might want to look at is Puppy
Linux. This fully networked distribution also comes with a bevy of
applications. In terms of networking, Puppy comes with Mozilla for
Web browsing as well as sending and receiving e-mail with Sylpheed,
SSH for remote administration, Gphone for VoIP calls, VNC and rdesktop
clients to control remote desktops and much more. AbiWord is included for
word processing, as is the Scribus desktop publishing application. There
are file managers, graphic editors, HTML editors, a spreadsheet program,
a personal finance application and more.
</p><p>
There's also a small handful of games. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Bubbles</em></span>, somewhat reminiscent of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Frozen Bubble</em></span>, is a lot of fun, as is
<span   class="emphasis"><em>gtkfish</em></span>. That last one is a strange
little game were you go fishing with a tissue-paper net. If the fish
move too fast when you catch them, they break the net. Click the left
mouse button to drop the net below the water and go for the slow-moving
fish. Release the mouse button to catch the fish. It's very strange and yet
strangely addictive.
</p><p>
For a copy of Puppy Linux, go to the Web site
and download the latest ISO
image (see Resources). Use your favorite CD burning tool (I tend to like K3b) and create
your CD. When you have your freshly burned CD in hand, pop it in to the
drive and reboot your system.
</p><p>
When Puppy Linux starts up, the first thing you'll see is a keyboard
selection screen. I scrolled down to us qwerty and pressed Enter. It
then asks for your mouse type. In all likelihood, you simply can
accept the default choice made for you, in my case, ps/2. The program
then asks if you have a scroll wheel. Immediately after this, the
graphical desktop starts, offering you a chance to select the video
mode you want to use whether it be 648x480, 800x600 and so on. The
resolution will change on the fly and you can lock it in by clicking
OK at any time. That's it. Your Puppy Linux system is up and running
(Figure 2). You even can remove the CD at this point.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8302f2.large.jpg"><img src="8302f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Haven't you always wanted a Puppy&mdash;Linux, that is?
</p></div></div><p>
On the Puppy Linux page, there's a statement that effectively says you
can install Puppy to anything whether it be a hard drive, a Zip disk,
on a network (to boot a thin client) or a USB key, much like DSL. That's
the one that really got me excited. I kind of like the idea of carrying a
fully graphical Linux system in my pocket. Besides, Puppy, in its default
configuration, is too big to fit on a 50MB business card without some
tweaking (more on that).
</p><p>
Click the Start button then head to the Setup menu. Under that
heading and near the bottom, you'll find some rather interesting options,
one of which is to install Puppy to USB card. Choosing this brings up
a dialog that takes you through the various steps from plugging in your
USB key to selecting a drive (if you have more than one plugged in),
choosing a partition and finally copying the files. The copy itself
can take place from local files on the hard disk or the live Puppy CD
that you booted from.
</p><p>
The next step takes a few minutes while various files are copied
(vmlinuz, image.gz and usr_cram.fs). After the
copy is complete, you are asked to choose a default keyboard language. I
chose us and pressed Enter. You have one more choice to
make after this point and that's to decide how the Puppy filesystem
is stored. The first choice is a vfat partition mounted as /root with
no other changes. The second creates a small ext2 filesystem on the
partition. This is the preferred choice and a more efficient one. The
first option does have the advantage, however, that its files can be seen
under Windows. I chose option 2 and pressed Enter.
</p><p>
Now that Puppy is installed to your USB key, you can edit the boot-up
script to provide a password to an encrypted filesystem. This is an
excellent idea if you want an additional level of protection in case
your USB key is ever lost or stolen. Finally, your USB drive is made
bootable and you are ready to take your Puppy for a walk (Figure 3).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8302f3.large.jpg"><img src="8302f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. The definition of take-anywhere Linux: Puppy Linux on a USB key.
</p></div></div><p>
A word of caution though&mdash;not every PC knows how to boot from
a USB drive, although you may be able to change the boot device
settings in your BIOS if it doesn't work immediately. If your
PC still doesn't support a USB drive boot, there is still hope, assuming you have a diskette drive. On the Puppy site, there is a boot
image (called boot2pup.img.gz) that you can copy to a
diskette. Uncompress the image, then copy it:

<pre     class="programlisting">
gunzip boot2pup.img.gz
dd if=boot2pup.img of=/dev/fd0
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, just make sure you carry this diskette with you as well.
</p><p>
Before I wrap up this exploration of Puppy Linux, I want to tell you
about another great little feature. Under that Setup menu is an option
labeled Remaster Puppy live-CD. This is a simple script that takes you
through the various steps necessary to copy your existing CD into RAM
(so you need at least 256MB for this), edit the filesystem, recreate
the image and finally, burn it to a CD.
</p><p>
It takes a couple of tries to get the hang of it, but all in all, it's
not a bad process. One strange step asks you to
confirm your CD burner and reader. It is at this point that Puppy will
reboot (yes, I know it sounds strange for a live CD) in order to turn on
SCSI emulation. When the system is back up, return to the Setup menu
and restart the remaster program. It should jump immediately to step
three where you'll be asked to insert the CD into whichever device you
identified as the reader. What follows is a question-and-answer session
that lets you define exactly how you would like your next version of Puppy
to appear.
</p><p>
As I mentioned, it can take a little time to get the hang of this, but
treat it as a hobby project, and you'll be a pro in no time. When you
have finished creating the new ISO image, Puppy launches the Gcombust
CD burning program to let you finish the job.
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Mon Dieu!</em></span> Is it that time already? The clock seems to be telling
us that closing time has arrived. No need to rush though. Relax a little
longer as I am sure Fran&ccedil;ois would be more than happy to refill your
glasses. Grab one of those business-card CD blanks and cook yourself
up a little Linux to take home with you. Please raise your glasses,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, and let us all drink to one another's health.
