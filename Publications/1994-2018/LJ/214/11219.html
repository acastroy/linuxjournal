VariCAD, VariCAD Viewer</h2></div></div><p>
One of the most veteran CAD apps on the Linux platform, VariCAD, 
recently was upgraded to version 2012-1.0. The application is a 3-D/2-D CAD
system for mechanical-engineering design, whose core features include
tools for 3-D modeling and 2-D drafting and dimensioning; libraries of
standard mechanical parts (ANSI, DIN); calculations of standard mechanical
components; and tools for working with bills of materials (BOM) and blocks.
Enhancements in version 2012-1.0 include significant improvements to the
GUI, improved and rebuilt 2-D printing dialog, new 2-D dimensioning and
editing of dimensions, improvements to DWG/DXF and STEP interfaces, a batch
printing module and a better 3-D modeling kernel. Also included in the new
update is VariCAD Viewer, a free combination viewer/converter/printing
software for working with 2-D DWG, DXF, 3-D STEP and 2-D/3-D VariCAD file
formats.

SecPoint Penetrator</h2></div></div><p>
The SecPoint Penetrator, upgraded to version 9.9, is a vulnerability-scanning appliance that recently was beefed up with new applications to
boost corporate security. The product helps companies prevent hackers
from entering their servers and networks, as well as understand their
vulnerabilities. The new version 9.9 now includes the Google Hacking
Database to identify whether sensitive company information or files have
been indexed by search engines, improved word lists for cracking (now more
than 1.1 billion entries) and a tool to show whether a Wi-Fi network is
vulnerable. SecPoint Penetrator has no limit on the amount of auditing nor
a limit on the number of IP addresses.

Josh Carter's <span   class="emphasis"><em>New Programmer's Survival Manual</em></span> (Pragmatic
Programmers)</h2></div></div><p>
This one is for all of you recent comp sci grads! Think of Josh Carter's
new book&mdash;<span   class="emphasis"><em>New Programmer's Survival Manual: Navigate Your Workplace, Cube
Farm, or Startup</em></span>&mdash;like job insurance. The book is intended to
introduce novice programmers to practices they'll find while working on
large-scale, long-lived programs at a professional level of quality. They
will find out how to work most efficiently with current tools and discover
essential new ones. Other aspects include learning &ldquo;street
smarts&rdquo;,
navigating the corporate working environment, collaborating with
colleagues, fitting into the big picture and contributing to company
success&mdash;thus, increasing one's job security. Finally, the title
helps readers look ahead to the years to come to make plans for their
long-term success as programming professionals, regardless of their area of
focus.

Penelope Trunk's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Slave to Happiness</em></span> (Que)</h2></div></div><p>
In her new book, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Slave to Happiness: Why Having an Interesting Life is the
New American Dream</em></span>, author Penelope Trunk posits a societal trend that
Linux folk can relate to. The new American dream, she says, is not based on
the acquisition of more stuff, more money, more happiness or the like.
Instead, a powerful new motivator replacing &ldquo;more&rdquo; for a new generation of
Americans is the goal of an interesting life. Publisher Que calls Trunk's
book a &ldquo;powerful, revelatory book [that] captures a radical shift
that's been taking place just below the surface of American culture: one
that is about to explode across the American landscape&rdquo;. Some of her
revelations include why Americans will increasingly choose interest over
contentment, how to make choices when all of the world's knowledge is at
your fingertips and how collaboration and connection are gaining a central
place in the new American dream. Sound familiar? It will be interesting to
see greater society adopt a philosophy that Linux community has embraced
for nearly a generation.

JetBrains' PhpStorm</h2></div></div><p>
Beside providing a delightfully psychedelic mental picture, JetBrains'
PhpStorm, which is now in version 3.0, offers software developers an
intelligent, productivity-enhancing, code-centric PHP IDE. The most
noteworthy features of the new version include UML for quick view of the
entire code structure plus the changes in the recent VCS commits,
Smart Duplicated Code Detector to remove similar blocks of code without
losing intended functionality, and a new PHPUnit test runner and
JSTestDriver to make code run faster than ever. Other new functionality
includes support for cutting-edge technologies, such as CoffeeScript and
XSLT 2.0, an integrated XSLT debugger, PHP UML roundtrip diagrams,
streamlined UI across all operating systems and Mac OS X Lin support, among
others.

MetaCase's MetaEdit+ Plug-in for Eclipse</h2></div></div><p>
The case that MetaCase makes for its new MetaEdit+ Plug-in for Eclipse is
that now development teams can combine the use of models and
code&mdash;that is, modeling tools and programming environments&mdash;in the Eclipse
environment. Until now, teams have utilized the MetaEdit+ domain-specific
modeling environment on its own. The new MetaEdit+ Plug-in allows users to
work with MetaEdit+ models directly from Eclipse, and it automatically
imports source code generated from the MetaEdit+ models into Eclipse and
builds and runs it there. Traditionally, development teams have found it
difficult to combine the use of models and code due to the modeling
languages used and the programming environments. Now, with the plugin,
however, the domain-specific models&mdash;expressed as diagrams, matrices or
tables in MetaEdit+&mdash;can be browsed and used directly from Eclipse.

Opengear IM4216-34</h2></div></div><p>
The Opengear team capped a productive 2011 with the release of Opengear
IM4216-34, a high-capacity infrastructure management gateway that
proactively monitors and maintains the health of all the IT equipment in
data centers and remote locations. The IM4216-34 provides one point of

enterprise-grade security technologies, Automated Remote Management and
Support (ARMS) and remote rack-level management capabilities. Opengear says
that the IM4216-34 allows overstretched IT and security organizations to
get more results with fewer resources.

Paragon Universal File System Driver</h2></div></div><p>
The target market for the new Paragon Universal File System Driver (UFSD)
is OEMs of consumer multimedia devices that are seeking cross-platform filesystem support. The software's creator, Paragon Software Group, says that
if its Paragon UFSD, which supports all popular filesystems, is
built in to digital devices, consumers can enjoy issue-free compatibility
between filesystems used on all of their devices including those found not
just in media centers, digital televisions and set-top boxes, but also various
storage media. Key features include full read-write access, easy mounting
of any NTFS, HFS+ or exFAT partition like a native one, non-Roman character
support, low system requirements and no limitation on maximum
file/partition size.
