<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #214, February 2012</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
After the security breach on <span   class="bold"><b>kernel.org</b></span>, the administrators of that
site had to re-implement the site from scratch, and they had to prioritize
the features that would be coming back soonest. They also had the
opportunity to exclude features that seemed to be more trouble than
they were worth.
</p><p>
One of the latter seems to be the <span   class="bold"><b>Mercurial</b></span>-based kernel repository
mirror that <span   class="bold"><b>Matt Mackall</b></span> had maintained on kernel.org. Matt's
repository offered an alternative for developers who didn't care for
Git's approach to source control&mdash;or at least who just liked Mercurial
better.
</p><p>
Matt intends to bring the repository back to life somewhere else, but
he's not sure when that might be, and he's also affirmed that the new
repository won't be fully compatible with the old. So, people wanting
to update their local repositories will need to get a fresh one
instead.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Davidlohr Bueso</b></span> recently inaugurated an
argument over <span   class="bold"><b>user quotas</b></span>,
when he posted a patch to limit regular users' ability to fill up the
<span   class="bold"><b>/tmp</b></span> directory on Linux systems. His justification was that filling up
that directory represents a denial-of-service attack. His patch
actually created a quota system for all <span   class="bold"><b>tmpfs</b></span> filesystems.
</p><p>
Everyone (except the attackers) agrees that DoS attacks are bad, but this
may be an area where it's not so easy to agree on the best approach.
<span   class="bold"><b>Christoph Hellwig</b></span>, for example, felt that Davidlohr should just use
the existing user quota system and apply it to /tmp. <span   class="bold"><b>Lennart
Poettering</b></span> argued that this would require a lot of user-space
configuration that wouldn't be necessary with Davidlohr's approach.
And, <span   class="bold"><b>Alan Cox</b></span> felt that other security issues were more pressing than
this one. No one's argument won the day, and it's not clear that such
a long-standing issue will catch <span   class="bold"><b>Linus
Torvalds</b></span>' attention.
</p><p>
Likewise, long-standing security problems in <span   class="bold"><b>/proc</b></span> may not be on the
radar either. <span   class="bold"><b>Vasiliy Kulikov</b></span> posted a patch to give tighter
permissions to <span   class="bold"><b>/proc/interrupts</b></span>, but this got a cool reception.
Apparently the longtime weaknesses of things like /proc and /tmp are
dangerous only if someone already has a login account on a given
machine, in which case a variety of other exploits are available
as well.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Marek Szyprowski</b></span> has been working on a
<span   class="bold"><b>contiguous memory allocator</b></span> for
<span   class="bold"><b>Samsung</b></span>. The idea is that a lot of smaller embedded systems don't
support software jumping around in RAM, and video-editing software can
sometimes require a contiguous chunk of memory for its image data. But
even on regular systems, contiguous RAM can provide a speedup over
fragmented RAM. However, the problem with trying to make everything use
contiguous memory is that eventually you get stuck with chunks of RAM
that aren't big enough for anyone, and that just hang out, unused,
even when the system really needs more RAM. Marek said his code wasn't
quite ready for inclusion, but it was coming along.

With our recent transition to a digital-only format, it's now possible to
consume <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> in a number of ways. For those so inclined, it's
even possible to print each issue and bind it into a paper magazine.
(The PDF lends itself quite nicely to that in fact) Electronically
speaking, however, it's hard to beat the .epub/.mobi editions.
</p><p>
If you'd like to browse this month's issue without ever leaving your
computer, you might want to check out EPUBReader, a Firefox add-on
that turns your browser in a mini-library. After installing the add-on,
epub files are opened automatically and added to the local epub library.
To access your library, simply go to Tools, and select ePub-Catalog.
You'll be presented with a list of all your locally stored epub books,
and with a simple click, you can be browsing.
</p><p>
EPUBReader includes support for an interactive table of contents, which
makes
wise use of a computer's widescreen display. It even supports keyboard
shortcuts! EPUBReader is free, cross-platform and quite honestly,
a really nice e-reader app. Check it out for yourself at <a href="http://www.epubread.com" target="_self">www.epubread.com</a>.

TrueCrypt is a fully open-source tool for encrypting data. That data
can be on a completely encrypted hard drive, or just an encrypted image
file. Thankfully, the encryption works the same regardless of your
platform, so Windows and OS X users can share encrypted files between
computers.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11212fossf1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
We really like to use TrueCrypt in combination with Dropbox, another
cross-platform tool, to protect our data in the cloud. Pictured here
is the OS X version of TrueCrypt, mounting an encrypted image as a local
hard drive. Whether you are storing sensitive data or Grandma's secret
recipe, TrueCrypt can keep your data private, even if it's stored on
someone else's server.

<h2 class="title">Science the GNU Way, Part I</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Joey Bernard</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #214, February 2012</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
In my past several articles, I've looked at various packages to do all
kinds of science. Sometimes, however, there just isn't a tool to solve a
particular problem. That's the great thing about science. There is always
something new to discover and study. But, this means it's up to you to
develop the software tools you need to do your analysis. This article takes
a
look at the GNU Scientific Library, or GSL. This
library is the Swiss Army library of routines that you will find useful in
your work.
</p><p>
First, you need to to get a copy of GSL and install it on your
system. Because it is part of the GNU Project, it is hosted at
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/s/gsl" target="_self">www.gnu.org/s/gsl</a>. You always can download and build from the
source code, but all major distributions should have packages available.
For example, on Debian-based systems, you need to install the package
libgsl0-dev to develop your code and gsl-bin to run that code. GSL is
meant for C and C++, so you also need a compiler. Most of you probably
already are familiar with GCC, so I stick with that here.
</p><p>
The next step is actually the last step. I'm looking at compiling now so
that I can focus on all the tools available in GSL. All the header
files for GSL are stored in a subdirectory named gsl. So, for example, if
you wanted to include the math header file, you would use:

<pre     class="programlisting">

#include &lt;gsl/gsl_math.h&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
All the functions are stored in a single library file called libgsl.a
or libgsl.so. You also need a library to handle basic linear algebra. GSL
provides one (in the file libgslcblas.so), but you can use your own.
Additionally,
you need to link in the math library. So, the final compile and link
command should look like this:


<pre     class="programlisting">
gcc -o hello_world hello_world.c -lgsl -lgslcblas -lm
</pre>
</p><p>
There are optional inline versions for some of the performance-critical
functions in GSL. To use these, you need to include
<tt  >-DHAVE_INLINE</tt> with
your compile command. To try to help with portability issues, GSL offers
some functions that exist only on certain platforms (and not others). As an
example, the BSD math library has a function called
<tt  >hypot</tt>. GSL offers
its own version, called <tt  >gsl_hypot</tt>, that you can use on non-BSD
platforms. Some functions have both a general algorithm as well
as optimized versions for specific platforms. This way, if you are running
on a SPARC, for example, you can select a version optimized for SPARC if it
exists.
</p><p>
One of the first things you likely will want to do is check 
whether you are getting correct results from your code or if there were
errors. GSL has a number of functions and data structures available in the
header file named gsl_errno.h. Functions return a value of zero if everything
is fine. If there were any problems in trying to complete the requested
action, a nonzero value is returned. This could be an actual error
condition, like a wrong data type or memory error, or it could be a
condition like not being able to converge to within the requested accuracy
in the function call. This is why you always need to check the return value
for all GSL function calls. The actual values returned in an error
condition are error codes, defined in the file gsl_errno.h. They are
defined as macros that start with <tt  >GSL_</tt>. Examples
include the following:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
<tt  >GSL_EDOM</tt> &mdash; domain error, used by functions when an argument doesn't fall
into the domain over which the function is defined.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >GSL_ERANGE</tt> &mdash; range error, either an overflow or underflow.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >GSL_ENOMEM</tt> &mdash; no memory available.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
The library will use values only up to 1024. Values above this are available
for use in your own code. There also are string versions of these error
codes available. You can translate the error code to its text value with
the function <tt  >gsl_errno()</tt>.
</p><p>
Now that you know how to compile your program and what to do with errors,
let's start looking at what kind of work you can do with GSL. Basic
mathematical functions are defined in the file gsl_math.h. The set of
mathematical constants from the BSD math library are provided by this part
of GSL. All of the constants start with <tt  >M_</tt>. Here are
a few of them:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
<tt  >M_PI</tt> &mdash; pi.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >M_SQRT2</tt> &mdash; the square root of 2.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >M_EULER</tt> &mdash; Euler's constant.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
There also are capabilities for dealing with infinities and non-numbers.
Three macros define the values themselves:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
<tt  >GSL_POSINF</tt> &mdash; positive infinity.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >GSL_NEGINF</tt> &mdash; negative infinity.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >GSL_NAN</tt> &mdash; not a number.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
There also are functions to test variables:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
<tt  >gsl_isnan</tt> &mdash; is it not a number?
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >gsl_isinf</tt> &mdash; is it infinite?
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >gsl_finite</tt> &mdash; is it finite?
</p></li></ul></div><p>
There is a macro to find the sign of a number.
<tt  >GSL_SIGN(x)</tt> returns the
sign of x: 1 if it is positive and &ndash;1 if it is negative. If you are
interested in seeing whether a number is even or odd, two macros
are defined: <tt  >GSL_IS_ODD(x)</tt> and
<tt  >GSL_IS_EVEN(x)</tt>. These return 1 if the
condition is true and 0 if it is not.
</p><p>
A series of elementary functions are part of the BSD math
library. GSL provides versions of these for platforms that don't have
native versions, including items like:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
<tt  >gsl_hypot</tt> &mdash; calculate hypotenuse.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >gsl_asinh</tt>, <tt  >gsl_acosh</tt>,
<tt  >gsl_atanh</tt> &mdash; the arc hyperbolic trig functions.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
If you are calculating the power of a number, you would use
<tt  >gsl_pow_int(x,n)</tt>, which gives you x to the power of n. There are
specific versions for powers less than 10. So if you wanted to find the
cube of a number, you would use <tt  >gsl_pow_3</tt>. These are very efficient and
highly optimized. You even can inline these specialized functions when
<tt  >HAVE_INLINE</tt> is defined. 
</p><p>
Several macros are defined to help you find
the maximum or minimum of numbers, based on data type. The basic
<tt  >GSL_MAX(a,b)</tt> and <tt  >GSL_MIN(a,b)</tt> simply return either the maximum or
minimum of the two numbers a and b. <tt  >GSL_MAX_DBL</tt> and
<tt  >GSL_MIN_DBL</tt> find
the maximum and minimum of two doubles using an inline function.
<tt  >GSL_MAX_INT</tt> and <tt  >GSL_MIN_INT</tt> do the same for integer arguments. 
</p><p>
When you
do any kind of numerical calculation on a computer, errors
always are introduced by round-off and truncation. This is because you can't exactly
reproduce numbers on a finite binary system. But, what if you want to
compare two numbers and see whether they are approximately the same? GSL
provides the function <tt  >gsl_fcmp(x,y,epsilon)</tt>. This function compares the
two doubles x and y, and checks to see if they are within epsilon of each
other. If they are within this range, the function returns 0. If x &lt; y, it
returns &ndash;1, and it returns 1 if x &gt; y.
</p><p>
Complex numbers are used in many scientific fields. Within GSL, complex data
types are defined in the header file gsl_complex.h, and relevant functions
are defined in gsl_complex_math.h. To store complex numbers, the data
type <tt  >gsl_complex</tt> is defined. This is a struct that stores the two
portions. You can set the values with the functions
<tt  >gsl_complex_rect(x,y)</tt>
or <tt  >gsl_complex_polar(x,y)</tt>. In the first, this
represents &ldquo;x+iy&rdquo;; whereas
in the second, x is the radius, and y is the angle in a polar representation.
You can pull out the real and imaginary parts of a complex number with the
macros <tt  >GSL_REAL</tt> and <tt  >GSL_IMAG</tt>. There is a function available to find the
absolute value of a complex number,
<tt  >gsl_complex_abs(x)</tt>, where x is of
type gsl_complex. Because complex numbers actually are built up of two
parts, even basic arithmetic is not simple. To do basic math, you can use
the following:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
<tt  >gsl_complex_add(a,b)</tt>
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >gsl_complex_sub(a,b)</tt>
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >gsl_complex_mul(a,b)</tt>
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >gsl_complex_div(a,b)</tt>
</p></li></ul></div><p>
You can calculate the conjugate with
<tt  >gsl_complex_conjugate(a)</tt> and the
inverse with <tt  >gsl_complex_inverse(a)</tt>. 
</p><p>
There are functions for basic
mathematical functions. To calculate the square root, you would use
<tt  >gsl_complex_sqrt(x)</tt>. To calculate the logarithm, you would use
<tt  >gsl_complex_log(x)</tt>. Several others are available too. 
</p><p>
Trigonometric functions are provided, like
<tt  >gsl_complex_sin(x)</tt>. There also
are functions for hyperbolic trigonometric functions, along with the relevant
inverse functions.
</p><p>
Now that you have the basics down, my next article will explore all the
actual scientific calculations you can do. I'll look at statistics,
linear algebra, random numbers and many other topics.

Many Webcam applications exist for Linux.
If you want to play with
self-portraits, there's Cheese. If you want to set up a security system
in your office, there's Motion. But, if you just want to have some fun,
give HasciiCam a try.
</p><p>
HasciiCam does for Webcams what aalib+mplayer does for video files. It
renders your live video directly into ASCII. It also has a feature
to create a live Web feed of your ASCII video for the whole world to
see! HasciiCam might not be the most practical application to use
with your Webcam, but if you ever have been fascinated with ASCII
art, it might be the most fun. It's most likely packaged with your
favorite distro, but if not, the source is available from its Web site:

If you love shopping in the Android Marketplace but hate typing on that
tiny keyboard, you might like the Web interface to the Marketplace. This
isn't a new feature, but it's one I didn't know about, so it seemed
apropos to share with the class.
</p><p>
On a desktop computer, simply browse over to <a href="http://market.android.com" target="_self">market.android.com</a>,
and log in with your Google account. (The same account you use on your
Android phone.) You can select an app and have it automatically installed
on whichever Android device you like! There's no need to touch your phone;
it automatically will install the app you chose from the Web site.
</p><p>
As you can tell from the screenshot, I found an excellent productivity

This month's issue is about my favorite Linux-related topic, Web
development. The Linux-powered Web
is a subject I believe we all particularly enjoy, as it is one of those
fantastic instances where Linux enters many
people's lives without their awareness. It's always fun for geeks like us
to know that our work behind
the scenes can have such impact on the unsuspecting public. The
technologies highlighted in this 
issue are shaping the current and future Web, so we hope you'll take away
some inspiration to go out 
and make something awesome on-line.
</p><p>
I am more than a little biased, as Drupal powers LinuxJournal.com, but I
hope you'll be inspired to 
try Drupal 7 after this month's introduction to content types and views,
