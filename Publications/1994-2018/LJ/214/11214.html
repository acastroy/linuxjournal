Linux has become mainstream in server rooms, commonplace on the desktop
and dominant in mobile devices. Unfortunately, it's still a rarity in the
classroom. This month, I start a column dedicated to Linux in education.
Grab a desk, sharpen your pencils and join me!
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24f5580.0x25ed358"></a></h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>'s newest column, the one you're currently reading, is dedicated to
education. Each month, I plan to equip readers with ways to improve
student achievement using freely available tools. Schools are required
to function on less and less money every year, yet due to the demand for
technologically proficient students, they need to spend more and more every year on
technology. In turn, there is no money left to invest in training the
teachers. That is one reason open-source software is such a perfect
fit for education. If money is spent on preparing teachers rather
than buying software, we will have state-of-the-art technology and
teachers fully prepared to use it. That's why this column was born. If
our kids grow up with open-source tools, they'll turn into adults who
understand the difference between investing in software versus investing
in people. Basically, we want to take over the world, and we want to
start with the kids.
</p><p>
Moodle is an open-source Learning Management System (LMS) designed for
students of various ages. The concept of LMS isn't a new one, and it
isn't limited to the FOSS world. Many colleges are using systems like
Blackboard (<a href="http://www.blackboard.com" target="_self">www.blackboard.com</a>) to facilitate a virtual classroom
environment. Blackboard offers many features, including
collaboration, document management, information dissemination and
even live discussions. Unfortunately, those awesome features come at a
substantial price. Enter: Moodle.
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> has covered Moodle before, but it has matured
so much through the years that it deserves another look. Moodle started as a little
project teachers might implement in their classrooms, but it has grown
into a product used at multiple universities and schools around the world.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24f5580.0x25ed720"></a>
What Does It Do?</h2></div></div><p>
Figure 1 shows a demonstration course set up in Moodle. Instructors can
set up their &ldquo;classrooms&rdquo; in a variety of ways. In the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Romeo and Juliet</em></span>
example, the instructor has given a basic outline of the class with
appropriate links for downloading assignments, taking on-line quizzes
and on-line journaling. Figure 2 shows a demo course on Film Studies. In
this example, the instructor has broken up the class into sections
(apparently, each section represents a class session).
Classes can be broken up in several ways&mdash;flexibility is one of
Moodle's strengths. Every instructor doesn't have to use it the same way.

Why Would a School Choose Moodle?</h2></div></div><p>
Let's be honest. For most <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> subscribers, this one is
simple. When it comes to school boards and school administrators,
the argument, &ldquo;Because it's open source!&rdquo;, doesn't really mean
much. Certainly Moodle goes along with the traditional reasons
an organization might choose open source:
the initial cost is lower, the maintenance cost is lower, licensing
isn't an issue, it's free, free, free and so on. But with Moodle, there are even
more reasons.
</p><p>
Moodle was designed by teachers and made for teachers. Although certainly
the commercial alternatives have large ties to the educational
community, ultimately their goal is to make money. There's nothing wrong
with that, but it would be foolish to assume altruism when it doesn't
exist. Moodle, on the other hand, was designed fully and completely for
the sole purpose of improving pedagogy. Moodle exists to bolster student
achievement. Period.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24f5580.0x25edeb0"></a>
Features</h2></div></div><p>
This is where Moodle really shines. Students can interact with the
course directly in their browsers. It means less paper waste and
fewer lost assignments. It also means a single place for all course
information. Resources like handouts, photos, URLs and study notes can be
placed into the Moodle course and always be available to students. Some
instructors simply use Moodle as an on-line repository for those types of
documents and don't use the interactive features Moodle offers.
Nothing is wrong with that approach, and Figure 1
shows that type of Moodle in action.
</p><p>
For teachers wanting to use Moodle as a more-interactive platform,
there are many built-in features:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Assignments: students can upload finished assignments directly to the teacher,
upload a file with comments or additional information, or even complete
an assignment directly into the on-line text editor (Figure 3). The
instructor decides how the assignment should be completed, and students
complete it using the appropriate method. Moodle even allows assignments
to be completely off-line, with no interaction from the student. They 
simply are listed so the student knows the assignment must be completed.
Assignments are graded by the instructor, and students can see the
results on-line.
</p></li><li><p>
Gradebook:
instructors can choose to keep their gradebooks directly in the Moodle
database. This allows students to see their grades at any time and also
interact with other modules that can assess materials and automatically
enter grades.
</p></li><li><p>
Chat:
instructors can have &ldquo;office hours&rdquo; when they are available for
real-time chat. Students also can use the real-time chat feature to
collaborate with other students from the class. Chats can
be designed to be available constantly, or they can be scheduled for specific
times. If instructors aren't available, they still can go back
and look at the chat log to identify areas that need more classroom
discussion (Figure 4).
</p></li><li><p>
Forum:
each course may have a forum available for discussion. Unlike chat,
the forum is not real time. Like any traditional forum, a user posts
questions or discussion items and waits for responses.
</p></li><li><p>
Surveys and polls:
Moodle offers instructors the opportunity to ask their students survey
questions from within the course. These surveys could be used as an
assessment for the teacher, as a way to gauge the level of understanding on
an upcoming assignment, or to get feedback from students on any topic the
teacher desires. They also can be set to anonymous so the students aren't
identifiable, or they can be set to record user accounts with responses
(Figure 5). 
</p></li><li><p>
Quizzes:
Moodle quizzes are similar to surveys, but they are designed more specifically 
to be graded automatically. Quiz times can be specified to avoid at-home
cheating, or they can be left open for students to take at their leisure.
The multiple-choice nature of Moodle quizzes makes grading automatic,
so students see their results immediately.
</p></li><li><p>
Wikis:
each course can have a wiki that students are able to edit
collaboratively. This wiki might contain information gathered from
multiple groups that needs to be shared with the class. Every enrolled
user can edit the wiki, so it's truly collaborative.
</p></li><li><p>
Workshops:
assignments are set up as direct communication between students and
instructors. With the workshop module, students can participate in
peer reviews and assessments. Instructors can design specifically how
students can respond to assignments in the workshop module, so although it is
a peer assessment, the process still is guided by instructors. Figure
6 shows an example of a possible workshop, with some criterion for the
users to assess.
</p></li><li><p>
Site design:
the classroom features mentioned above are the meat and potatoes of
using Moodle. The Moodle course itself can be tweaked and modified as
well, however, to make the site as useful as possible. The layout for
the course page is designed using blocks. Anyone familiar with content
management systems like Drupal or WordPress will understand the concept
of blocks. Figure 7 shows the default layout of blocks in a newly
created course. Blocks can be added, deleted and moved around. The
function of available blocks varies from calendars to quiz results,
and it includes the ability to embed Flickr photos or YouTube videos right
into the Moodle page.

Installation</h2></div></div><p>
Installing Moodle is a breeze. The current stable version, at the
time of this writing, is 2.2. In order to install it, your server needs
to have PHP 5.3.2 or higher, MySQL 5.0.25 (or Postgres 8.3) and a Web
server. That's really about it. Any recent server distro with a LAMP
stack will be able to run Moodle pretty easily out of the box.
</p><p>
If you're not interested in installing Moodle onto a server, 
a few VM appliances also are available to download, although you might not
find one with the latest version of Moodle installed. My recommendation
for those desiring a VM of Moodle is to install a Linux VM, then install
the most recent version of Moodle on top of it. It will take a little
more time, but you'll have more control over the install, and you'll be
assured of the most recent version.
</p><p>
The actual installation is pretty simple. You are required to create
an empty database for Moodle to use and a data directory with write
access. Once that is in place, simply extract the archive to your Web
root, and point a browser to http://your.moodle.site/install.php.
The installer will populate your database and walk you through initial
configuration.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24f5580.0x29e7390"></a>
Managing Moodle</h2></div></div><p>
Moodle has tiers of management, so all the responsibility doesn't fall
on a single administrator. Anyone logging in as administrator has full
access to every aspect of the system, while individual users in the
Manager role can be limited in what permissions they have.
A few sysadmin items must be configured by whoever is in charge of those
sorts of things&mdash;for example:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Authentication:
Moodle can be completely independent and store user login information in
its own database. This has the advantage of working without interfacing
with an established infrastructure, but it has the same as a disadvantage:
it doesn't interface with the existing infrastructure. Thankfully, Moodle
has extensive support for external authentication, and some of those things
can be configured with minimal knowledge of the network. For example,
Moodle supports authentication from IMAP or POP3 servers. That means any
user with a valid e-mail account can log in to your Moodle server. Moodle
also supports more complex authentication schemes like LDAP, and in
Linux, it even supports PAM authentication from the local server.
</p></li><li><p>
Course creation:
administrators (or managers with the proper permissions) create a course
and then assign an instructor to be in charge of it. Once a course is
created, instructors can configure it in whatever way they desire,
including adding content, changing layout and so on. Instructors also
can decide how students can enroll in their courses. Students can be added
manually; they can be given a code that allows them to join, or they even
can gain access
to a course via PayPal payment.
</p></li><li><p>
Server management:
this is the only part that really requires a sysadmin to manage. System
backups, security settings, performance tweaks and other server-related
tasks are done by the administrator. Some of these roles can be
assigned to manager accounts, but at some point, the server maintenance
leaves the realm of Moodle administration and enters the domain of the
IT department. This responsibility line obviously will be different for
every case. It's possible for Moodle to be centrally administered and
accessed over the Internet for multiple locations. It's just as possible
for teachers to run Moodle on their classroom workstations and administer
it for their single class. The important thing is to determine in advance
who will be in charge of what aspects of administration.
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24f5580.0x29e7758"></a>
Let's Collaborate!</h2></div></div><p>
You've seen Moodle and what it can do, but the power of open source isn't
just in free code. A huge community of Moodle users is providing
plugins, pre-packaged assignment modules, themes and countless other
enhancements for Moodle. Here are some great on-line resources for teachers
interested in implementing and enhancing Moodle:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Moodle Docs (<a href="http://docs.moodle.org" target="_self">docs.moodle.org</a>):
this Moodle-hosted wiki is a collaborative effort to document every aspect
of using Moodle. Whether you're an administrator trying to configure
a secure install or a teacher trying to add a quiz to your course,
the Moodle Docs site is invaluable.
</p></li><li><p>
Moodle Plugins (<a href="http://moodle.org/plugins" target="_self">moodle.org/plugins</a>):
Moodle offers an extensive number of features in the standard install,
but it also allows for third-party plugins to enhance courses. The official
repository for plugins is hosted on the Moodle.org Web site. You can find
pre-packaged assignments, alternate course layouts, visual themes and
additional blocks to customize your Moodle site or individual course. Once
you become a Moodle user, you may want to contribute back
to the community as well.
</p></li><li><p>
Course Exchange (<a href="http://moodle.org/course/view.php?id=15" target="_self">moodle.org/course/view.php?id=15</a>):
many Web sites share complete Moodle courses, but this
particular exchange is hosted on the Moodle.org servers. There are
direct links to downloadable courses and lists of Web sites offering
courses to download. In true &ldquo;eat your own dog food&rdquo; style, the Course
Exchange is actually a Moodle course open for enrollment. You can enroll
and participate in the Exchange.
</p></li><li><p>
Moodle Share (<a href="http://www.moodleshare.org" target="_self">www.moodleshare.org</a>):
this third-party Web site offers an extensive selection of courses available
for download. Many of the courses were designed by Minnesota District
287, using funding from ARRA Grant Funds. Hats off to District 287 for
sharing its resources! (Figure 8 shows a freely available lesson from
Moodle Share.)
</p></li><li><p>
Commercial Support (<a href="http://www.moodle.com" target="_self">www.moodle.com</a>):
although Moodle itself is free in every sense of the word, there is a
commercial side as well. That doesn't mean Moodle comes crippled or
feature-stripped, it just means that commercial support is available if
required. The moodle.com Web site offers links to vendors that can host a
Moodle install, offer support for existing installs, train on the use of
Moodle or even become certified in Moodle itself. Again, these commercial
options don't offer any &ldquo;Pro&rdquo; features to Moodle; they're just available
if customers need them.
</p></li></ul></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11214f8.large.jpg"><img src="11214f8.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

Finally, Let's Take Over the World!</h2></div></div><p>
The world we live in is one of on-line collaboration, 24-hour interaction
and digital communication. Heck, you're reading this right now on a
digital device, or you printed it from a digital source. Moodle is a
perfect example of open-source ideals succeeding in regular, everyday
life. The first step toward an Open Source world is to get kids excited
about open-source tools. Hopefully, the next steps will take care of
themselves.
