Got a burning desire to cheat on your next crossword or
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Scrabble</em></span> game? 
If so, you'll want to explore Dave's latest shell script.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26cd580.0x27c5460"></a></h2></div></div><p>
It's been a while since I've delved into the world of games
and game programming in this column, so I thought it'd be interesting to
look at writing a word-finding or matching script from the perspective of
crossword puzzles and <span   class="emphasis"><em>Scrabble</em></span>-like games.
</p><p>
You know the drill. You're playing and have encountered a six-letter
word with the clue &ldquo;cat, family&rdquo;, and you know only a few letters:
_ E _ I _ _. You've already figured out &ldquo;feline&rdquo;, but can you
write a script that you could give that sort of partial match and have it
figure out possibilities?
Let's give it a whirl.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26cd580.0x27c56c8"></a>
Finding a Word List</h2></div></div><p>
Linux includes the slick GNU aspell program, but the dictionary is
compiled,
and it's also not designed for word games but is instead based on common
English language usage&mdash;not optimal.
</p><p>
Fortunately, you can grab some free word-list files off the
Internet to use as the basis for this particular script. The one I
work with here is the English Open Word List, which contains almost 129K words.
Grab a copy for yourself at
<a href="http://dreamsteep.com/projects/the-english-open-word-list.html" target="_self">dreamsteep.com/projects/the-english-open-word-list.html</a>.
</p><p>
The download is a ZIP archive, and it's a bit of a mess, sprawling
across multiple directories and ultimately creating a set of 26 files
called A Words.txt, B Words.txt and so on. I dumped it
all into a single file called words.txt by using the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
cat *Words.txt &gt; words.txt
</pre>
</p><p>
The resultant file is not tiny:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ wc ~/words.txt
128985  128985 1123743 /Users/taylor/words.txt
</pre>
</p><p>
That's okay though. On a modern Linux system, it'll still be
lightning fast, even with 128,985 lines of data.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26cd580.0x27c5a38"></a>
Looking for Words</h2></div></div><p>
Let's start by looking up that partial match for &ldquo;feline&rdquo; from
earlier. Fortunately, we don't need to look much further than grep,
because we can express what we need with a regular expression:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ grep -E '.e.i..' words.txt
</pre>
</p><p>
The problem is, a quick glance at the output reveals that this pattern
isn't good enough:

<pre     class="programlisting">
abbreviate
aberdevine
abiogenist
abstemious
academical
</pre>
</p><p>
To root the search so that it's an exact match, not a portion within a
larger word, we need to root the regular expression. This is done
with ^ to denote the beginning of the line and $ to
denote the end:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ grep -E '^.e.i..$' words.txt
aecium
aedile
aerial
aerier
</pre>
</p><p>
That's better, except there are a lot of words that match this
pattern. In fact, it's surprisingly common. How common? Let's see:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ grep -E '^.e.i..$' words.txt | wc -l
     264
</pre>
</p><p>
Sheesh, there are 264 possibilities. Drop in another letter though, and it's a
bit more manageable:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ grep -E '^.e.in.$' words.txt | wc -l
      58
</pre>
</p><p>
One more letter, and although theoretically we should be able to guess it
anyway, at least the choices are reduced to a viewable list:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ grep -E '^.elin.$' words.txt
feline
heling
reline
</pre>
</p><p>
That's actually the problem with crossword-puzzle-finder apps. There
simply are too many words in the English language. Still, it's quite
possible that for some letter combinations, even having most letters missing still
produces a short list:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ grep -E '^...cc.t.$' words.txt
braccate
placcate
spiccato
staccato
stoccata
</pre>
</p><p>
This should be motivation to learn how to solve as much of that darn
crossword puzzle as possible before turning to our little shell solution!
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26cd580.0x27c60c0"></a>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Words With Friends</em></span></h2></div></div><p>
Games like <span   class="emphasis"><em>Scrabble</em></span> and <span   class="emphasis"><em>Words With
Friends</em></span> present an opposite problem. We
know all the letters; we just want to figure out what words we can create
with them.
</p><p>
On first blush, the solution could be as simple as searching the words
database for all words that contain zero or one occurrence of each letter
in the sequence. Not so fast though&mdash;look at this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ grep -E '^s*t*a*c*c*a*t*o*$' words.txt
aa
act
at
cat
coo
oo
sac
sat
scat
scatt
so
st
staccato
ta
taco
tact
tao
tat
tatt
tattoo
to
too
</pre>
</p><p>
There are two problems here. The first is that the * actually
is shorthand for zero or more matches, and the second is that the letters in
the pattern are analyzed in order of occurrence. So, although
&ldquo;tao&rdquo; is
a valid word extracted from the letters &ldquo;STACCATO&rdquo;, the word
&ldquo;tots&rdquo; never will be found, because the letter s appears
before the others in the pattern.
</p><p>
The first problem can be solved by making a more complex regular
expression: <tt  >X{0,1}</tt>
means zero or exactly one occurrence of the letter X in the
pattern. It's definitely more complex:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ grep -E '^s{0,1}t{0,1}a{0,1}c{0,1}c{0,1}a{0,1}t{0,1}o{0,1}$' 
 &#8618;words.txt
aa
act
at
cat
sac
sat
scat
so
st
staccato
ta
taco
tact
tao
tat
to
</pre>
</p><p>
The second problem of letter order is a lot harder to solve. We could
generate random sequences, but some quick math shows that if we have ten
characters, that's 10*9*8*7*6*5*4*3*2 possible combinations&mdash;a lot!
</p><p>
However, a more interesting way to try to address this is to take a
complete left turn and lose this increasingly complicated
regular-expression approach by using a chained set of simple one-letter grep
patterns instead.
</p><p>
That's not quite what we'll do though, because the first thing
we need to do is screen out all words that contain letters not in
our acceptable set. That's done with the set notation:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ grep -vE '[^staccato]' words.txt
aa
accoast
accoasts
accost
accosts
</pre>
</p><p>
That's still not quite right, because we're not taking into
account the frequency of individual letters (note that
&ldquo;accoasts&rdquo;
has two occurrences of the letter s, but there's only one in
our original letter set).
</p><p>
Let's wrap this up here for this month, however. Next month,
I'll dig deeper into the problem and see if I can come up with some
sort of smart solution.
