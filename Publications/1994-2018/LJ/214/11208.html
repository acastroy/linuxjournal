Digital Edition for the Kindle</h4><p>
Congratulations on going all digital, and thank you for making it available
for the Kindle. I live in Poland, and the digital edition made it possible for
me to subscribe and read your magazine for a very fair price. I've one
suggestion for the Kindle edition: it would be great if it had a table of
contents available under directional buttons (like it has for other
magazines in Kindle format&mdash;see the ones generated by Calibre, for
example). As it is now, switching between articles is painful, because
you have to go back to the first page. Apart from this, well done. I hope
this step will be a great success for <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>!

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Pawel 
Stolowski
  <br><br>
</p><p>
Pawel, thanks for the suggestion! The epub/mobi edition is still new for
us, and we're constantly trying to improve it. We appreciate the
recommendations, and we'll do our best.&mdash;Ed.

Will Not Resubscribe</h4><p>
I'm not going to renew my subscription once it expires due to the fact that
<span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> went all digital. I absolutely abhor it. Even though I've downloaded the
latest issues since the conversion, I haven't read any of them. I just lost
complete interest in what was a magazine I anticipated and loved to read
every month. I will not resubscribe again until you do on-demand printing.
</p><p>
I haven't used MagCloud's services, but at some point, I'm going to try it when I
decide to go ahead with my own magazine (<a href="http://www.magcloud.com" target="_self">www.magcloud.com</a>). Perhaps
<span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> should consider a print-on-demand option.
</p><p>
So, yeah, sorry, but I seriously cannot convey in words how much I hate
this all-digital conversion. I abhor it with every fiber of my existence.
It's a shame such a legendary magazine has decided to screw things up.
E-publishing sucks.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Patrick Baker  <br><br>
</p><p>
Patrick, the response to our switch has met both accolades and disdain. I
do honestly appreciate the desire for a physical magazine, and your
MagCloud recommendation is actually pretty cool. Although we don't have any
current plans to offer a print-on-demand subscription, it certainly seems
individuals could print their own. This is especially true since your
example at MagCloud has no minimum print run. Heck, I might try to print
one just to see how it looks!&mdash;Ed.

Digital Format Forces Some Personal Changes</h4><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>'s abandoning paper is taking some getting used to and will
require some personal changes if I am to continue to enjoy my favorite
magazine. I used to keep may latest copy next to my favorite chair and
would read it in bits and pieces and during commercials on TV. Now the
issues go mostly unread because I don't like reading magazines or books on
my desktop or laptop. Today, I took my last paper copy to the gym to read
while using the elliptical exercise machine (there is a book holder on
the machine). This was very workable, but then it dawned on me that I cannot
do this with the digital version unless I purchase a Kindle or other E Ink
equivalent. Your conversion to digital media is going to cost me at least
$79 and force some behavior changes about which I am not too happy. That
said, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> is my favorite magazine, and I am willing to invest
in making it more readable for me. Maybe you should do a deal with Amazon
and sell Linux-branded Kindles!

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Edward Comer  <br><br>
</p><p>
Edward, although <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> certainly can be read on a desktop or laptop, I
must admit an e-reader is my favorite way to read it. There are advantages
and disadvantages to both E Ink devices and color ones, but for a
traditional paper &ldquo;feel&rdquo;, you are correct, E Ink is hard to
beat. And, as far
as a Linux-branded Kindle? I'm not sure Amazon would go for it, but because
the Kindle runs Linux, we'll claim the victory anyway.&mdash;Ed.

The Web Is Not Paper</h4><p>
HTML should be the format for Web publications. One of the first things a
Web page designer learns is that Web pages are not paper. There is no need
to fill a Web page like a sheet of paper. Web pages can have open space and
uncluttered design with no cost. Paper is expensive; pixels are not.
</p><p>
One should be able to scroll through your entire magazine with the
mouse wheel and an occasional click on a link. The PDF format itself is bad
enough, but laying out the pages side by side makes it worse. If you
stacked single pages, it would be easy to read even a PDF file by a
continuous scroll down with the mouse wheel.
</p><p>
If you feel a need to have narrow columns like a paper magazine,
don't think paper and put them side by side&mdash;have one continuous
column with a larger font size. On paper, narrow columns have a purpose, but
on the Web, they are just a nuisance. The computer screen is rarely both
wide enough and tall enough to display a single magazine page at a decent
font size. This forces the reader to scroll both up and down and side to
side instead of smoothly scrolling in one direction.
</p><p>
It would be even more readable if you would place two or three
paragraphs per Web page&mdash;at most&mdash;with links at the top and bottom to the
previous and next page as well as back to an index. Then, readers could
click from page to page and hop around like they can with a paper magazine.
To avoid constant trips back to the server, each article could be a single
download with links and whitespace, making it appear to be separate pages.
</p><p>
Your content is interesting, but please try delivering it in several
styles and let your readers evaluate the readability of each choice.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Jim Fuqua  <br><br>
</p><p>
Jim, I assume you're referring to the on-line interactive version of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span>? It (along with the PDF) is attempting to maintain a traditional
magazine feel. For some folks, that's very important. In fact, some folks
print the PDF, so in that case, the traditional layout really is a
benefit.
</p><p>
We do have epub and mobi versions available, which are not HTML, but they do
offer flowing text and a much less traditional layout. One thing the
digital transition has allowed us to do is offer the same information in a
multitude of formats. Hopefully, one of them will fit your needs.&mdash;Ed.
</p><a name="N0x17f5580.0x18ee3d8"></a><h4 class="title"><a name="N0x17f5580.0x18ee3d8"></a>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> Shines in Digital Format</h4><p>
Switching to digital format was a great idea not only for you but for us,
the readers. First, I did only very rarely purchase magazines, because they
tend to pile up, and most issues either get lost under the sofa or 
shredded by my resident pets. Second, I now can carry
<span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> in my pocket,
so it is always available for all those short breaks either in the bathroom
(we all do that) or waiting for my significant other to try on each color
and size of the same T-shirt at the mall. Having said that, it still needs
improvements. The low resolution of the iPad version is a real problem.
Most screenshots are almost unreadable. Also, the content could be improved
with media, such as videos and downloadable code snippets. Interactivity is
the key for the future. Being a paper magazine on a digital device will not
be enough in a very near future. When an article mentions an event, I
expect an &ldquo;add to calendar&rdquo; link, for example. Still, my annual subscription
was the best bucks spent ever. Keep up the great work!

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
M. Belgin  <br><br>
</p><p>
Those are some great ideas, thank you. We currently are working on the
screenshot and code issues. With tablets and phones being so different,
coming up with a layout that looks best on all devices is a real learning
experience.
</p><p>
The interactive stuff is partially in place with the on-line version of the
magazine. We will keep trying every month to improve the digital offerings.
It's actually pretty exciting. Because the e-publishing world is so young, I
think we'll see some amazing things in the coming years.&mdash;Ed.

Digital Publishing</h4><p>
In the December 2011 issue's Letters, Valentin asked that
<span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> write about digital
publishing, because that is the only format available now. The editor's
response was that he would like to get some experts to write some
articles, but I think he missed the point. You (<span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> staff) are the experts.
You should write about the process you use to create an issue, why
different decisions are made and the issue with the various formats. It will be
informative for us subscribers, and perhaps by writing things
down,
you'll gain insight into the process.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
bil jeschke  <br><br>
</p><p>
Perhaps I wasn't clear&mdash;my apologies. I meant we'd like to get articles
from experts using specific software for manipulating and creating digital
material. Although publishing is certainly in our wheelhouse, we're the first
to admit we don't know everything about everything. Contributions from the
community are what make the Open Source world, and our publication itself,
so great. Yes, our staff is part of that community, but we don't want to
limit information to what we know.&mdash;Ed.
</p><a name="N0x17f5580.0x18eecc8"></a><h4 class="title"><a name="N0x17f5580.0x18eecc8"></a>
Digital Edition</h4><p>
I have been a newsstand subscriber for years, enjoying thumbing through the
magazine at my local Safeway while my wife does her shopping and taking the
magazine home with me for sharing with friends as a coffee-table
&ldquo;ice-breaker&rdquo;. Sadly, this past year I decided to pay for a real subscription
and have it delivered to my door, only to have the print edition done away
with halfway through my subscription. To this day, I have not read a
single digital edition. My subscription ended in November, and I didn't even
notice it. How sad, considering the years I have spent reading the
magazine. I understand dead-tree editions may cost money, but I always
assumed that was covered by the advertisers in the magazine, of which yours
is plenty filled with!
</p><p>
I have an Android phone, with a good-size screen, but I do not have a
Kindle or a NOOK, nor am I really interested in spending the money on one.
I enjoy holding physical magazines or books, and reading them or looking
through them while relaxing at my desk (and, of course, throne-room time).
</p><p>
I have long loved your magazine, and although I am not and never have been
an
Ubuntu guy, I still look forward to the magazine. However, I feel a great
disturbance in the force with the loss of a good magazine. Oh, how many
conversations have been struck up due to holding the magazine while
standing in a checkout line! I feel as though I wasted my year's
subscription, since I never cared to read a digital edition. My money would
have been better spent on <span   class="emphasis"><em>Wired</em></span> or some other magazine that still prints.
</p><p>
Maybe I will have to buy a NOOK, but I cannot justify spending $200
to read a $3 magazine.
I wish you the best, however much longer it lasts.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Nathan England  <br><br>
</p><p>
Nathan, I could give you the ad-to-content ratio of our magazine compared
to others, showing our passion for filling pages with content and only
limited, relevant ads. But really, what a boring discussion that would be.
We had to switch for reasons we've highlighted during the past few months, so
for better or for worse, we're 100% digital.
</p><p>
I am curious, however, if you've tried the several ways to consume
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span> on your phone. The <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> app for the Android will keep your
library automatically up to date. As an e-reader, your phone also
can display the epub version using a variety of programs. I'm the first to
admit reading the PDF on a smartphone is a recipe for frustration, but
perhaps one of the other formats will be more comfortable on your phone?
And, of course, if you prefer the traditional paper look, an E Ink-based
reader like the $79 Kindle is always a possibility.&mdash;Ed.

At the Forge&mdash;December 2011 Issue</h4><p>
I was quite dismayed by Reuven M. Lerner's comment &ldquo;I hope you're not really using a
queue class but rather just using arrays&rdquo;. Not only does this contradict
the seminal research and arguments for using abstractions in the first
place (see Dijkstra, Hoare, Wirth and many others), but it has the immediate
practical problem of polluting the code with functions that will not make
sense should the implementation of queues have to be changed, even
slightly.
</p><p>
It is almost axiomatic that someone will get bitten when code is written
that depends on implementation details.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
David Jameson  <br><br>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Reuven M. Lerner replies:</b></span>
I wasn't trying to say that people should avoid writing their
own abstractions that wrap native data types.
Rather, I was saying that if all you need is the simple implementation
that I showed, you should just use a Ruby array, rather than what amounts
to a wrapper around the array, which offers no additional functionality.
</p><p>
Wrappers are great, and they do provide a large degree of safety and
abstraction that can be useful if the implementation changes. But if you
just need an array, there's no need to wrap it in a class just in case
you might eventually need additional functionality.

<span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> Electronic Magazine</h4><p>
I wanted to let you know that I just subscribed to <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>
for two years and love
the material. In Western Australia, your magazine was very hard to find,
and by chance, I picked up the August 2011 issue and loved it.
</p><p>
I looked around after that and could not find the September 2011 issue.
Finally, I picked up my old copy, checked your Web site and realized why. I
actually had read the Slashdot article about the cancellation, but many
months before I bought your print version.
</p><p>
I really just wanted to make this point: without the newsstand copy, I never
would have seen the magazine and never would have become a subscriber. I am a Linux
lover, and I've been reading <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Format</em></span>/<span   class="emphasis"><em>Magazine</em></span>/<span   class="emphasis"><em>User and
Developer</em></span>, and they
don't cut it compared to your mag. Going electronic only, how will people
ever find you?
</p><p>
I am an avid reader of Slashdot and LWN. I imagine that the latter
especially is your core market, and I know it struggles to find
advertisers (or used to, it runs AdSense now). You probably should run a
PPC campaign every so often to gain new subscribers. Just make sure you
have a decent landing page, as your home page makes subscribing a mission
and a half.
</p><p>
I really hope the switch to electronic works for you, as Linux needs all the
good quality journalism and documentation it can get.
</p><p>
PS. I bought the back-issue DVD as well, so total lifetime value of
subscribers can be pretty high.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
David   <br><br>
</p><p>
David, thanks! Yes, losing a newsstand presence is something we're bummed
about. You highlight one of the changes we need to make, and that is how
we promote the magazine. Thank you for the suggestion, as it's an issue we
need to address.&mdash;Ed.
</p><a name="N0x17f5580.0x18e66e0"></a><h4 class="title"><a name="N0x17f5580.0x18e66e0"></a>
Digital = Awesome</h4><p>
I love that you went all digital. Normally, I run to the local Fred Meyers
each month to pick up <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>. I use an iPhone and have a Kindle. I hate carrying
books or magazines due to the equipment I have to carry for work. I
subscribed as soon as I found out you guys went all digital. I know some are
annoyed by the conversion, but I'm really liking the new format. I have
200+ manuals for work, and it makes a great addition, and when I'm on the
go,
I can keep reading on my iTouch. Thanks for the great work. You guys
rock. I have converted my wife to Linux and even she enjoys your mag.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Robert   <br><br>
</p><p>
That's great to hear, Robert! If you've been reading the Letters for the
past few months, it's clear that reactions to the switch have been mixed.
We've purposefully posted letters from both sides, because we don't want to
minimize anyone's frustration. It is great to hear that a large number of
folks not only tolerate, but also prefer the digital format. Thanks for the
feedback!&mdash;Ed.
</p><a name="N0x17f5580.0x18e6a50"></a><h4 class="title"><a name="N0x17f5580.0x18e6a50"></a>
Electronic Version</h4><p>
I cannot save trees, since I have found that I need to print an article in
order to be able to read it easily.
</p><p>
The problem is that the height of a laptop screen is not sufficient to
display fonts that an old geezer like me can read without overflowing the
page. Page overflows would require me to scroll up and down (and maybe left
and right) in order to see everything.
</p><p>
I understood that you used flowing text, which meant to me that page
boundaries would not be hard-coded, but that zooming in could simply result
in the reformatting of the pages to make the articles easier to see.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Jim   <br><br>
</p><p>
Jim, we do use flowing text, but only in the formats that support such a
thing. It sounds like you're reading the PDF version, which unfortunately
is the least flexible when it comes to reformatting.
</p><p>
Although e-reader devices are the best for reading the
&ldquo;flowing&rdquo; versions (epub
and mobi), it is possible to read those versions on your computer as well.
Calibre, for example, includes an e-book-reading application, and there are
ways to read epubs from inside your Web browser. One disadvantage to
having so many versions available is that it's easy to get confused
regarding which version is best for different situations.&mdash;Ed.
</p><a name="N0x17f5580.0x18e6ec8"></a><h4 class="title"><a name="N0x17f5580.0x18e6ec8"></a>
More on E-Formatting</h4><p>
I'm slowly coming around to life without paper. I now have two e-zines. I
have two suggestions on improving yours.
1) Add links within your Kindle version to skip the current article and
jump to the next. There are just some parts that don't interest me. Right
now, I have two choices: hit the Next button on my Kindle numerous times or
jump to the table of contents and then jump again.
2) Give us a link to download all the formats with one link. Right now, I
am downloading each of them. I use Calibre to store all my electronic
reading content, and this great tool allows me to store different formats of
the same document under one title.
</p><p>
On my Christmas list is a Kindle Fire, so I hope I am reading your magazine
on this new baby come January 1.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Scott   <br><br>
</p><p>
Scott, I'm jealous you're getting a Kindle Fire, but I hope you enjoy it
nonetheless. Thank you for the formatting suggestions; we are trying every
month to make the magazine more and more user-friendly. Recommendations
from readers are vital, so thank you very much.&mdash;Ed.

Electronic vs. Paper</h4><p>
Like some of the readers who have been unpleasantly surprised by the sudden
switch to pixels from paper, I was initially outraged. As one reader said, I paid
for print and have issues remaining in my subscription. Your explanation
of the reasons for the switch made sense, and you were obviously doing your
best to give value for the money under adverse conditions, so I decided to
wait and see how life in the 21st century would work. After downloading
the PDF versions, and then the iPad app, I can say that I'm
<span   class="emphasis"><em>glad</em></span> you
switched! I much prefer the digital version. I can carry multiple issues
with me, read in the dark, follow links with a finger touch rather than
having to write down URLs for later entry into a browser, and I can put the
old issues up on my LAN server for future reference (the HTML versions are
even searchable!). It's even easy to send thank-you notes to the editors!
Thanks!
 
<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Mike Bartman  <br><br>
</p><p>
Mike, thanks for sticking with us! We tried (and continue to try) to be as
transparent as possible regarding the switch. Although there are obvious
frustrations when transitioning to digital, we honestly are excited about
the advantages it can offer. Of course, those advantages don't erase the
frustration about the end of paper, but looking forward is exciting. We're
glad you'll be here with us.&mdash;Ed.

ezPDF Reader</h4><p>
I read in the December 2011 issue's Letters that Dave was having issues
with the PDF version on his NOOK Color. I too have a NOOK Color and would
like you to please pass on some advice to Dave. Tell him to buy the app ezPDF Reader. It is far superior to the NOOK's built-in PDF reader.
</p><p>
By the way, I've been a subscriber for 14 years, and I love the digital transition.
You've all done a fantastic job of it.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Doug McComber  <br><br>
</p><p>
Doug, we decided this was the best way to pass the information on to Dave. We
figured he'd read it here, and then anyone else reading would benefit as
well! For the record, our Webmistress Katherine Druckman agrees with you 100% and
seconds your recommendation of ezPDF.&mdash;Ed.
