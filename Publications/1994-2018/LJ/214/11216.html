Your hardware is ready. Now, let's load up some software and get cracking.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27e9580.0x28e13b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
In Part I of this series, I explained how password cracking works in general terms and
described my specific password-cracking hardware. In this article, I dig
into the software side of things and describe how to put that hardware to
use cracking passwords. I also discuss the two main types of attacks:
dictionary and brute-force attacks. As I describe each attack, I also
give specific examples of how I used the software to attack phpass, the
hashing algorithm currently used for PHP-based software like WordPress.
</p><p>
For the purposes of this article, I created a sample WordPress blog on
my server and created a few custom accounts&mdash;some with weak passwords
and others with truly random passwords. Then, I went into the database
for the site and pulled out the phpass password hashes for each account
and put them into a file that looked like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$P$BpgwVqlfEwuaj.FlM7.YCZ6GQMu15D/
$P$BGMZP8qAHPjTTiTMdSxGhjfQMvkm2D1
$P$BOPzST0vwsR86QfIsQdspt4M5wUGVh.
$P$BjAZ1S3pmcGOC8Op808lOK4l25Q3Ph0
$P$BPlIiO5xdHmThnjjSyJ1jBICfPkpay1
$P$BReStde51ZwKHVtiTgTJpB2zzmGJW91
</pre>
</p><p>
The above hashes are legitimate phpass hashes created from six-character
passwords. I could tell you the passwords, but that would defeat the
fun of cracking them yourself.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27e9580.0x28e1670"></a>
Proprietary Video Drivers</h2></div></div><p>
For those of you who, like me, believe in open-source software, this next
section may be a bit disappointing. To get hardware-accelerated password-cracking software working on your system, you need to install the
proprietary video drivers from either AMD or NVIDIA. That said, if you
already have been using your system for Bitcoin mining, you already have
the drivers and libraries you need, so you can skip to the next section
about Hashcat. Honestly, you also could just follow the Bitcoin mining
HOWTOs for Linux, and that would describe how to get all the drivers and
libraries you need.
</p><p>
Many modern desktops make it relatively easy to pull down and install the
proprietary video drivers. For instance, an Ubuntu desktop will prompt
you that restricted drivers are available to install both for AMD and
NVIDIA cards. Most other popular distributions provide good documentation
on how to pull down the proprietary drivers as well. In the worst case,
you may have to download the software directly from the AMD or NVIDIA and
install it that way&mdash;they both have clear instructions and software
available for Linux just like for other OSes.
</p><p>
Once you have the proprietary drivers installed, you also need
the AMD APP SDK for its OpenCL libraries or the NVIDIA CUDA
libraries, depending on who made your video card. You likely will need to
get these libraries
directly from AMD or NVIDIA Web sites. The
install is straightforward though. In my case, I downloaded the
AMD-APP-SDK-v2.5-lnx32.tgz file from AMD, extracted it, and ran the
provided Install-AMD-APP.sh shell script as root.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27e9580.0x28e1828"></a>
Hashcat</h2></div></div><p>
Many different password-cracking suites exist both for CPU-
and GPU-based cracking. After reviewing all the options, I decided on the
Hashcat family of cracking tools available at <a href="http://hashcat.net" target="_self">hashcat.net</a>. On the
site, you will see that a number of different tools are available. At
first glance, it can be a bit confusing, as you can choose from hashcat,
oclHashcat, oclHashcat-plus, oclHashcat-lite and even software called
maskprocessor. Each program has its purpose though, depending on what
you intend to do.
</p><p>
hashcat:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
CPU-based, so slower than the GPU-based software.
</p></li><li><p>
Supports the widest range of hashing algorithms.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
oclHashcat:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
GPU-based password cracker.
</p></li><li><p>
Supports a moderate number of hashing algorithms.
</p></li><li><p>
Built-in support for dictionary, brute-force and mask attacks.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
oclHashcat-plus:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
GPU-based.
</p></li><li><p>
Supports the most hashing algorithms of the GPU-based hashcat crackers.
</p></li><li><p>
Optimized for dictionary attacks against multiple hashes.
</p></li><li><p>
Can support dictionary input from a pipe, so brute-force is possible.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
oclHashcat-lite:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
GPU-based.
</p></li><li><p>
Optimized for attacks against a single password hash.
</p></li><li><p>
Fastest of the hashcat family, but with the most-limited password hash support.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
maskprocessor:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Generates dictionaries based on patterns you supply.
</p></li><li><p>
Not a password cracker in its own right, but can pipe output to
oclHashcat-plus for a brute-force attack.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Even with the above lists, it may not always be clear which software to
use. Basically, it comes down to what type of password you want to crack
and what kind of attack you want to use. The page on hashcat.net devoted
to each piece of software provides a list of the hashing algorithms they
support along with benchmark speeds of how many comparisons they can do
per second on different types of hardware. For a given password hash,
go through those pages and see which type of Hashcat software supports
your hash and has the highest benchmarks. Beyond that, use oclHashcat for
mask or brute-force attacks against multiple hashes, oclHashcat-lite for
single hashes or oclHashcat-plus if, as was the case with me, it's the
only GPU-accelerated version that supported your hash.
</p><p>
Once you decide which type of Hashcat software to use, installation is
relatively simple, if old-school. Just download the .7z package that
corresponds to the software, and use the 7za command-line tool (which
should be packaged for your distribution) to extract it. The software
will extract into its own directory that provides 32- and 64-bit versions
for both Linux and Windows. If you have NVIDIA hardware, you will use
the binaries that begin with cuda; otherwise, you will use the versions
that start with ocl. The directory also will contain a number of example
hashes and dictionaries and example shell scripts you can use to make
sure your libraries and drivers are in place. For instance, here's the
example provided with the oclHashcat-plus software for cracking a phpass
hash on a 64-bit system:


<pre     class="programlisting">
cat example.dict | ./oclHashcat-plus64.bin -m 400 example400.hash
</pre>
</p><p>
Here's what the command output looked like when I ran the example against
the 32-bit version on my test rig:


<pre     class="programlisting">
cat example.dict | ./oclHashcat-plus32.bin -m 400 example400.hash

</p><p>
In this case, the password was hash234. For all of the hashcat commands,
it's simple enough just to open a terminal and change to the directory
you extracted and run the commands locally from there. At the beginning
of the command output, you will be able to see what GPUs the software can
detect. If you have multiple GPUs in use (even if they aren't chained), it
should find them automatically. If it can't find your GPU, you will need
to revisit how you installed your proprietary drivers and extra libraries.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27e9580.0x28e29b0"></a>
Dictionary Attacks</h2></div></div><p>
The first attack you should try is a dictionary attack. With a dictionary
attack, you provide the cracking software with a dictionary full of
possible passwords to try, such as all the words in the English
dictionary. The cracking software then tries each dictionary word until
one matches your hash. Since the number of combinations in a dictionary
attack is much smaller than with a brute-force attack, dictionary attacks
complete much faster. As an example, when I was first researching this
article, I let a brute-force attack run for days against a sample set
of hashes without cracking one of them. I was able to crack three out of
the five hashes with a dictionary attack in less than a minute.
</p><p>
To run a dictionary attack with oclHashcat-plus, first run the command
with the <tt  >--help</tt> argument. That will provide you with the number that
corresponds to the hash algorithm you want to crack. In the case of phpass,
that number is 400. Then, run the command a second time and specify the
password hash to use with the <tt  >-m</tt> option, the file in
which to store the recovered
passwords with the <tt  >-o</tt> option, and then list the file that contains your
hashes and the file or files you want to use as a dictionary. Here's
an example dictionary attack against phpass hashes:


<pre     class="programlisting">
/path/to/oclHashcat-plus32.bin -m 400 -o recovered_hashes 
 &#8618;example400.hash example.dict
</pre>
</p><p>
If I had multiple dictionaries, I could list all of them on the command
line or even use a shell glob. A dictionary attack is only as good as
its dictionaries, but a number of good password dictionaries are
available on the Web that you can find with a quick search for &ldquo;password
cracking wordlist&rdquo;.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27e9580.0x28d9608"></a>
Calculating Cracking Speed</h2></div></div><p>
Before I discuss brute-force attacks in detail, it's important to learn
how to estimate how long a particular brute-force attack will take. With a
brute attack, you aren't just going through a dictionary of words, you
are actually trying all possible combinations of a set of characters.
In
researching the article, I wasted days attempting a brute-force attack
against an eight-character password before I finally did the math and
realized it was completely impractical.
</p><p>
The first step is to figure out how fast your hardware can crack a
particular type of hash. As you will discover, the number of comparisons
per second your hardware can perform will vary widely depending on the hash
type, so start a sample brute-force attack just long enough to get a
bit of progress output, and then press Ctrl-c to exit. In my case, because I'm
using oclHashcat-plus, I needed to download and extract the maskprocessor
software from hashcat.net, so it, combined with oclHashcat-plus, could
perform a brute-force attack against phpass (don't worry about the
command syntax for now, I discuss the specifics later):


<pre     class="programlisting">
/path/to/mp32.bin -1 ?d?l?u ?1?1?1?1?1?1 | \
/path/to/oclHashcat-plus32.bin -m 400 \
-o recovered_hashes phpass-hashes

</pre>
</p><p>
The output line to pay attention to is the line that begins with
<tt  >Speed</tt>. As
you can see from that output, my GPU can do around 350,000 comparisons
per second, so I'll use that number for the rest of my calculations.
</p><p>
One good site I've found for doing cracking estimates is
<a href="http://www.lockdown.co.uk/?pg=combi" target="_self">www.lockdown.co.uk/?pg=combi</a>. This site describes all sorts of
different character sets and password lengths, and it describes how long
anything from a single Pentium CPU to a mythical government supercomputer
might take to brute-force all combinations. Otherwise, the math is pretty
straightforward. Just take the number of characters in your character set
(for instance, all lowercase letters would equal 26), then figure out
how long of a password you want to brute-force, then raise the first
number to the power of the second.
</p><p>
So, for instance, all mixed-case alphanumeric characters
(A&ndash;Za&ndash;z0&ndash;9)
equals 62 characters. If I wanted to brute force a six-character password,
that would be 62<sup  >6</sup> = 57 billion combinations.
</p><p>
If you divide 57 billion combinations by a system that can do 350,000
comparisons a second, you get approximately 45 hours to complete the
brute-force attack. That's not bad, but let's do the same math for
eight-character passwords: 62<sup  >8</sup> = 218 trillion
combinations.
</p><p>
At 350,000 comparisons per second, it would take me approximately 7,200
days, or 19 years, to complete the attack. On the plus side, for another
$250, I could complete the attack in less than 10 years! If you add
symbols to your brute-force attack, the number jumps to 7.2 quadrillion
combinations, or around 652 years.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27e9580.0x28d9b88"></a>
Brute-Force Attacks</h2></div></div><p>
Once you've figured out whether a brute-force attack will complete in
your lifetime, the next step is to run maskprocessor and tell it what
kind of word list to generate. The maskprocessor command supports a
number of common character sets by default with the following symbols:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
<tt  >?d</tt> = all decimals (0&ndash;9).
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >?l</tt> = lowercase characters (a&ndash;z).
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >?u</tt> = uppercase characters (A&ndash;Z).
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >?s</tt> = symbols.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
You also can define a custom character set with <tt  >-1</tt>
(or <tt  >-2</tt>, <tt  >-3</tt>)
and then use <tt  >?1</tt> to use that custom set. For instance, if I wanted to
enumerate through all three-character passwords made up of lowercase
characters and numbers, I could type:

<pre     class="programlisting">
/path/to/mp32.bin -1 ?d?l ?1?1?1
000
001
. . .
zzy
zzz
</pre>
</p><p>
In my example brute-force attack, I wanted to run through all combinations
of uppercase, lowercase and numbers in a six-character password. The
resulting maskprocessor command would be:

<pre     class="programlisting">
/path/to/mp32.bin -1 ?d?l?u ?1?1?1?1?1?1
</pre>
</p><p>
Then, I would pipe the output of that command to oclHashcat-plus:

<pre     class="programlisting">
/path/to/mp32.bin -1 ?d?l?u ?1?1?1?1?1?1 | \
/path/to/oclHashcat-plus32.bin -m 400 \
-o recovered_hashes phpass-hashes
</pre>
</p><p>
As with my dictionary attack, the <tt  >-m</tt> option specifies I want to crack
phpass hashes, the <tt  >-o</tt> lists the file in which I want to
store my recovered hashes, and finally, I specify the file that contains the phpass hashes to
crack. On my hardware, it took around two days to run fully through the
above brute-force attack.
</p><p>
Now you should be ready to get cracking, but as you'll find, the world
of password cracking can get pretty dense, pretty quickly. In my next
and final part of the series, I will discuss how you can tune the above
attacks to get better performance, and also how to blend both dictionary
and brute-force attacks to get the best of both worlds.
