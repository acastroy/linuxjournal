Obix&mdash;Reliable Programming, Quickly
(<a href="http://www.obix.lu" target="_self">www.obix.lu</a>)</h2></div></div><p>
Do you want to create more reliable code in less time? Obix may be just
what you need. However, I'm guessing this probably looks like
just another programming language, but it's actually contained within a
philosophy that may be an important evolutionary step in programming
methods, called &ldquo;Fail fast!&rdquo;
</p><p>
Take note of that term. At first, it may seem bizarre, but on
further inspection, the amusing name is actually very logical with a
profound approach to programming. I explore this philosophy
and its implications following the next section.
</p><p>
To quote some carefully chosen parts of the documentation:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Obix is a high-level, object-oriented, statically-typed, compiled,
portable programming language.
</p><p>
The compiler generates Java binary code (.class files). Hence,
applications written in Obix can run on any system with a Java Virtual
Machine (JVM) installed, such as Linux, Mac OS, Windows and so on.
</p><p>
Obix has been designed from the outset with a very specific main goal in
mind, namely to help write more reliable code. In practice, this means that:
1) once your code passes compilation it contains less bugs and
2) remaining bugs are more quickly detected at runtime.
</p><p>
As a result, you can expect to reduce development time and costs.
</p></blockquote></div><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11221f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
random_arcs is a cool tutorial that comes with Obix.
</p></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Installation</b></span>
</p><p>
Whether it be in development mode or production mode, Obix is designed
around Java, so installing Java on your PC is a prerequisite. If you
haven't done
so already, install the Java JDK version 6.0 or later. The documentation
notes that it's not enough to install the Java Runtime Environment (JRE);
you need to have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed.
</p><p>
If your machine is Debian/Ubuntu-based, the package name
is sun-java7-jdk. If your machine is RPM-based, look for
jdk-7u1-linux-x64.rpm or jdk-7u1-linux-i586.rpm. Either version 6 or 7
will do, but version 7 of Java is preferable. Other than that, there is
nothing else in the way of dependencies.
</p><p>
To install Obix, grab the latest tarball from the Web site, extract it,
and open a terminal in the new folder. From there, you now can check the
installation with the following command that displays Obix's version
number in your terminal:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ./obix.sh version
</pre>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Usage</b></span>
</p><p>
As these are early days, Obix isn't supported by a graphical environment.
All tools for managing projects and compiling, running and testing
code are executed from the command line, so get a console and text
editor ready.
</p><p>
So what was all the &ldquo;Fail fast!&rdquo; stuff about? The idea is this:
<span   class="emphasis"><em>every coding error should be detected as early as possible, preferably
at compile time, or else as early as possible at runtime.</em></span>
</p><p>
To achieve this, Obix has error-preventing concepts, such as:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Contract programming (design by contract).
</p></li><li><p>
Feature re-definition in child types.
</p></li><li><p>
Unit testing.
</p></li><li><p>
Generic types without type erasure at runtime.
</p></li><li><p>
Objects are immutable by default.
</p></li><li><p>
Void (null) values are not allowed by default.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Although this may seem like a hassle, Obix designer Christian Neumanns
found that a forgiving approach to coding in a language resulted
in some horrendous errors in the long run, with some very angry
customers. However, start out with a &ldquo;Fail fast!&rdquo; approach, and your
coding naturally will be tighter and more reliable.
</p><p>
To illustrate one of Obix's unique features for more reliable code,
look at the following example source code:

<pre     class="programlisting">
int server_port = 8080
int age_of_my_elephant = server_port
</pre>
</p><p>
Can you see the error? Of course you can.
Can your compiler see the error? No, it can't. Although
<tt  >server_port</tt> and
<tt  >age_of_my_elephant</tt> obviously are two semantically different values,
the compiler can't see an incompatibility, because both values are of
type integer. Moreover, no runtime error will be generated, despite
the fact that elephants can't be older than about 100 years.
</p><p>
You might say, &ldquo;No programmer would ever write silly code like
this!&rdquo; This
is true (for most programmers). However, look at this code:

<pre     class="programlisting">
int age_of_elephant = utilities.get_initial_value
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, you can't tell if the assignment is okay just by looking at the source
code. You would have to verify manually that
<tt  >utilities.get_initial_value</tt>
actually returns an &ldquo;age of elephant&rdquo; value that can't be negative and
can't exceed 100. It would be helpful if the compiler could check all
this for you automatically, wouldn't it?
</p><p>
Without digging too deeply into how it works, here is the solution in
Obix. You would define a specific type
<tt  >age_of_elephant</tt> and declare
a positive maximum value of 100. The source code for this type looks
like this:


<pre     class="programlisting">

type age_of_elephant
   
    inherit simple_positive32
        attribute value and_check: i_value &lt;= 100~ end
    end
   
end

</pre>
</p><p>
Then, you would declare a variable and assign it a value as follows:

<pre     class="programlisting">
var age_of_elephant age_of_my_elephant = ...
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, the Obix compiler ensures that the right side of the assignment
actually returns an <tt  >age_of_elephant</tt> value (and not a
&ldquo;server port&rdquo;
value). And, it is impossible to assign an invalid value, such as -5
or 8080.
</p><p>
Many applications contain hundreds or thousands of integer variables with
semantically different (and, therefore, incompatible) values. Thus, compile-time
and runtime checks like the above are very important
and effective, because any incompatibilities and illegal values are
immediately and automatically reported. The same observation can be made
for other data types, such as strings. For example, in Obix, you would
define different types with specific validation rules for
<tt  >customer_name</tt>,
<tt  >email_address</tt> and <tt  >ISBN_number</tt>.
</p><p>
Unfortunately, that's about as much as I can cover here. One area I
would like to have highlighted is being able to insert Java script
into Obix code (see Chapter 3 of the tutorial), but my favorite part is
Chapter 4: &ldquo;How to develop a standard PC application&rdquo;. Here you will
see how Obix already has tools to develop projects, with their own
compilation, tools, directory structures and so on&mdash;very cool.
</p><p>
In the end, Obix is built around some fantastic concepts, and I hope that
it soon reaches a level of maturity where it's sitting in all major distro
repositories. You also can help improve Obix by getting involved in
the Open Source community or just by sending feedback to the author. Even
outside of Obix, I'm hoping that Christian's &ldquo;Fail fast!&rdquo; ethos will take
root in future programming languages, creating another evolutionary step
in programming methods, and ultimately, more reliable computing.

darktable&mdash;Virtual Photo Darkroom
(<a href="http://www.darktable.org" target="_self">www.darktable.org</a>)</h2></div></div><p>
If you're a photographer dealing with many images at a time, darktable
may well strike the perfect compromise between image browsing and
picture enhancement.
</p><p>
According to the Web site:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
darktable is an open-source photography work-flow application and RAW
developer&mdash;a virtual lighttable and darkroom for photographers. It
manages your digital negatives in a database, lets you view them through
a zoomable lighttable and enables you to develop raw images and enhance
them.
</p><p>
...darktable tries to fill the gap between the excellent existing free
raw converters and image management tools (such as UFRaw, Rawstudio,
F-Spot, digiKam and Shotwell). It focuses on the work flow to make it easier
for the photographer to handle quickly the thousands of images a day of
shooting can produce. It's also one of the very few FOSS projects able
to do tethered shooting. 
</p></blockquote></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11221f2.large.jpg"><img src="11221f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

those are my drums.
</p></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Installation</b></span>
</p><p>
Binary packages are provided for Ubuntu, Fedora, SUSE and Arch Linux, as
well as a Portage package for Gentoo/Funtoo. There also is an experimental
version for Mac OS X, and Windows also is a possibility, but amusingly, the
Web site notes that the community for this commercial distribution hasn't
made a native version yet, so it recommends installing Ubuntu instead.
</p><p>
In terms of library requirements, the Web site gives the following list
of packages: libsqlite3, libjpeg, libpng, libraw (supplied), rawspeed
(supplied), gtk+-2, cairo, libglade2, lcms2, exiv2, gconf, tiff, curl,
gphoto2, dbus-glib, gnome-keyring, fop and openexr.
</p><p>
If you want to build from source, the Web site is incredibly helpful,
with all the instructions you'll need, in great detail. Nevertheless,
I include a simplified version here.
</p><p>
Download the latest tarball, extract it, and open a terminal in the new folder. Enter the command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ./build.sh
</pre>
</p><p>
Once the building has finished, change into the build folder with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ cd build
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, to install darktable, if your distro uses sudo (such as Ubuntu), enter:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo make install 
</pre>
</p><p>
If your distro uses root, enter:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ su
# make install
</pre>
</p><p>
Note that on my machine, it installed darktable to /opt by default,
in which case, at the command line, it may be required that you enter:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ /opt/darktable/bin/darktable
</pre>
</p><p>
For other users (especially with binaries), you can run the program
with this command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ darktable
</pre>
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Usage</b></span>
</p><p>
As soon as you're inside the main window, you'll notice an arrow at each
edge: this is for expanding and collapsing panes within the window. You
may wonder why I'm starting with something so mundane, but
this function actually is incredibly useful (more on that later).
</p><p>
Working within darktable, the interface is split into three view modes:
lighttable (browsing), darkroom (editing) and camera tethering (a clever
means of interacting with a camera). I don't really have the word space
or equipment to explore the tethering mode, so I primarily cover
the lighttable view and the darkroom view here.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>lighttable</b></span>
</p><p>
When the program starts, you should find yourself in lighttable view.
Here, you manage your images as well as do things like add tags and
color labels. Keep in mind that its shortcut key is L, as darktable's
design has been based around switching between the lighttable and
darkroom views, easily and rapidly.
</p><p>
The first order of business is to import some images with the import
field on the left.
</p><p>
Do you see a field? If not, remember the arrows that I mentioned at the
start of this section. Click on the left arrow, and the import section
will expand and collapse. Collapsing one section can be very useful,
as it lets the actual picture section grow much larger. With the import
section expanded, import some pictures (you have the choice of a singular
image, a folder or to scan for devices), and they will appear in the
main section in the middle.
</p><p>
While you're still here, try expanding and collapsing all four arrows,
and see how it affects the rest of the window. With all the fields
collapsed, the image section gets center stage and takes up the whole
window, and with all the fields expanded, you have a great many tools
available, but your images are reduced to small, insignificant squashy
things. With just a small number of clicks, this clever GUI design
allows you to switch between beautiful Zen-like minimalism on one end
and ugly but useful functionalism on the other.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
darkroom</b></span>
</p><p>
With that covered, select some of your pictures, and let's move on to the
darkroom. Remember that its shortcut key is D. In fact, try alternating
between lighttable and darkroom with L and D now. Nice, huh? This
darkroom is where you do the editing, and you can do all sorts of things, like
toy with the color profile, sharpen the image, apply cropping, rotate
and so on.
</p><p>
While you're in the darkroom, you still can change between images
with the filmstrip, toggled with Ctrl-F. Chances are that you'll
have quite a number of images along the strip, so if you want to
scroll along it, hover your mouse pointer over the strip and use your
scroll wheel. Double-clicking will open an image.
</p><p>
That's about all the space I have for darktable, but it's been
an absolute pleasure to use. The GUI design is one of the best I've ever
come across, and I hope to see its design copied in the future. Plus,
the aesthetics are great as well, with a really cool light-black color
scheme that is such a nice change from the endless beige and grays that
make computing so depressing at times.
</p><p>
For mid-level photo management, this probably is the coolest tool I've
come across, and whether you like your interface minimal or maximal,
it doesn't matter. You can change it around in about two seconds.
