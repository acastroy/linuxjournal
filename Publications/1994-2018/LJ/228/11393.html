SciPy is used in scientific programming, but now with the parallel
functionality in IPython, you can run your code in an HPC environment.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e95580.0x1f8d1f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
More and more science is happening on silicon, if not completely, then
at least partially. With its ability to run interactively, as well as
heavy support for packages with tuned C components, Python quickly
is filling the scientific computing environment. The main package
people
import for handling scientific programming is SciPy (<a href="http://scipy.org" target="_self">scipy.org</a>). This package
provides several functions that allow you to write code to solve your
scientific problems. To take full advantage of all of these capabilities,
however, you really need a decent development environment. IPython
(<a href="http://ipython.org" target="_self">ipython.org</a>) can provide just
such an environment. It is a good balance between ease of use, especially
for exploratory work, and it offers a complete development environment. This
article covers using IPython and SciPy to set up an environment for
scientific computations.
</p><p>
The first step is to install IPython and SciPy. Luckily, most
distributions should have packages available for both of these. For
example, on Ubuntu, simply execute:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo apt-get install ipython python-scipy
</pre>
</p><p>
Most distributions, unless they are rolling-release distros, are at least
a version behind the latest and greatest. If you want to have the latest
capabilities or bug fixes, you need to download the sources
from the projects' Web sites. For both packages, you should be able to 
download the sources, unpack them and run the following in each source
directory:

<pre     class="programlisting">
python setup.py install
</pre>
</p><p>
Be sure to check the documentation for both
packages. They each have a rather large set of dependencies that need
to be installed before you try to build.
</p><p>
Now that you have them both installed, let's look
at what you can do, starting with IPython. IPython provides
a very enhanced interactive shell for interactive work, including
access to GUI components, and an architecture for interactive parallel
computing. When you start working with IPython, you have access to the
sorts of features available to users of bash. For example, pressing Tab 
provides auto-completion of the command you currently are typing. All of
your previous commands, both input and output, are available as numbered
items. They are stored in two separate arrays called In and Out. You can
access them by using In[1] or Out[3], just like any other array. 
</p><p>
IPython
also is really useful in interacting with the objects in memory. You can
look at details of these object with the ? operator. For example,
you can pull up information on your object by typing:

<pre     class="programlisting">
my_object?
</pre>
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11393f1.large.jpg"><img src="11393f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Starting IPython shows the license information and some 
help functions.
</p></div></div><p>
You also can get specific pieces of information by using the commands
<tt  >%pdoc</tt>, <tt  >%pdef</tt>,
<tt  >%psource</tt> and <tt  >%pfile</tt>.
</p><p>
A useful feature of IPython in code development is the ability to
log all of the work you are doing to an external file. Within your
session, you can start logging with the magic command
<tt  >%logstart</tt>. Or,
you can turn on logging from the start by adding the command-line option
<tt  >--logfile=log.py</tt> to IPython. You then can load this log file at a later
time to get IPython to replay the commands and essentially restore your
session to its previous state. It's not perfect, but it's still useful. (I
discuss the plotting functions and parallel options after covering a
bit of SciPy.)
</p><p>
SciPy is actually an extension to another Python package, NumPy. NumPy
provides extensions that define numerical array and matrix types, along
with basic operations that apply to them. SciPy builds on these, allowing
you to do advanced math, signal processing, optimization, statistics and
more. Let's get some work done by starting up IPython. You'll see
the licensing information, along with some initial commands that tell you how
to get help. To begin with, let's look at some of the extras that NumPy
gives you for scientific computing. One of the best features, from a
code-writing perspective, is the overloading of mathematical operators. For example,
the old way of adding two vectors looks something like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
for i in range(len(a)):
   c.append(a[i] + b[i])
</pre>
</p><p>
This actually can be relatively slow for large vectors, because Python
needs to do some verifying of the data types and the operations at each
iteration of the for loop. With NumPy, you can rewrite this as:

<pre     class="programlisting">
import numpy as np
...
c = a + b
</pre>
</p><p>
This is quite a bit faster, because the actual work is handled by an
external library as a single unit of work. As you can see above, in Python,
you need to import external packages with the <tt  >import</tt> command. The most
basic version of the import statement is:

<pre     class="programlisting">
import numpy
</pre>
</p><p>
This adds everything from NumPy into your Python session's namespace,
and you can access the imported functions with their short names. You
can import a package and attach it to a new name, as I did in the
example above. You then can access the imported items by prepending
the name that it is imported as to the function short names. 
</p><p>
Importing
the entire package is fine for something moderate in size like NumPy,
but SciPy has grown over the years to be a rather large and complicated
package. Importing everything available can be quite time-consuming
initially. To try to help with this, SciPy actually subdivides the available
functions as sub-packages. When you import SciPy, you get only the
functions not in one of the sub-packages. If you really want to load
everything in SciPy, you need to use this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
import scipy;
scipy.pkgload()
</pre>
</p><p>
If you know what kind of work you will be doing, it will make more sense
to import only the parts you need, with a command like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
from scipy.fftpack import fft as scipy_fft
</pre>
</p><p>
When you use IPython, you can skip all of this by using the profile
system. In IPython, you can define a session profile that takes care
of initialization steps that you would have to do every time.
Several profiles are included when you install IPython, so in this case, you
simply can start IPython with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ipython -p scipy
</pre>
</p><p>
This handles the imports for you so you have everything
you might need.
</p><p>
As an example, one thing that gets done numerically is transforming
and analyzing sound. When looking at sound, you may be interested
in analyzing the spread of frequencies. This can be done by using
fast Fourier transform (FFT) functions. In SciPy, you can import the
sub-package fftpack to access the FFT functions. For example, you can
create a vector of 100 ones followed by 900 zeros with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
a = zeros(1000)
a[:100] = 1
</pre>
</p><p>
You can get the Fourier transform of this vector with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
b = fft(a)
</pre>
</p><p>
The result is a list of complex numbers. 
</p><p>
When you are doing
exploratory work, it is really helpful to be able to see the results
graphically. Luckily, IPython includes the matplotlib module. If you
want to have it available, you either can start your IPython session with
<tt  >ipython -pylab</tt>, or you can import the pylab module
manually. With that done,
you then can plot results with something like:

<pre     class="programlisting">
plot(abs(b))
show()
</pre>
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11393f2.large.jpg"><img src="11393f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. SciPy has a lot of functionality, like fast Fourier transforms.
</p></div></div><p>
Matplotlib is modeled after the graphics system in R where
the different steps of plotting are actually separate manual steps. So
plotting graphs is one step, and showing the plots on the screen is
a separate step. This means you need the <tt  >show()</tt> command to get the
graphical output. Lots of options are available in matplotlib to
handle graphical display of data and results.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11393f3.large.jpg"><img src="11393f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Matplotlib gives you the functionality to analyze your
results graphically.
</p></div></div><p>
The last thing to look at here is the parallel support you get with
IPython. In any large scientific code, you will need to run on some sort
of parallel machine in order to get your work done in a reasonable amount
of time. With IPython, you have support for the following:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) parallelism.
</p></li><li><p>
Multiple Instruction Multiple Data (MIMD) parallelism.
</p></li><li><p>
Message passing using MPI.
</p></li><li><p>
Task farming.
</p></li><li><p>
Data parallelization.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
You can use combinations of these or develop your own custom
parallel techniques. The most powerful capability in IPython
is the ability to develop, execute, debug and monitor your parallel
code interactively. This means you can start to develop your code
and then add in parallelism when you reach the appropriate stage. 
</p><p>
The
IPython architecture consists of four parts:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
IPython engine: an instance that takes Python commands over the network and
runs them.
</p></li><li><p>
IPython hub: the central process that manages engine connections,
schedulers, clients and so on.
</p></li><li><p>
IPython scheduler: all actions go through a scheduler to a specific engine,
allowing work to be queued up.
</p></li><li><p>
Controller client: made up of a hub and a set of schedulers, providing an
interface for working with a set of engines.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
To start using IPython's parallel components, you need to start up
a controller and some number of engines. The easiest way to start is to
use ipcluster on a single machine. For example, if you want to start
a controller and four engines on a single host, you can type:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ipcluster start -n 4
</pre>
</p><p>
You likely will get an error at this point due to not being
able to import the module zmq. This module handles the security issues
in the communications between the different parts of IPython. Again,
there should be a package for that. In Ubuntu, the package is named
python-zmq. 
</p><p>
Once you get your four engines started, they are available when
you start IPython. You will need to do this in another terminal window,
because ipcluster still will be running in the original terminal. After
importing the parallel module, you can create a Client object to interact
with the engines created by ipcluster:

<pre     class="programlisting">
from IPython.parallel import Client
rc = Client()
</pre>
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11393f4.large.jpg"><img src="11393f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. When you start ipcluster, it will display status information to the
console.
</p></div></div><p>
As a first test that the parallel functionality is working correctly,
you can check the IDs of the available engines by executing:

<pre     class="programlisting">
rc.ids
</pre>
</p><p>
In this case, you should notice that four engines
are available. 
</p><p>
One of the simplest forms of parallelism is to divide
Python's map command across the available engines. Remember that the map
command takes some function and applies it to each element of a list. The
parallel version of map takes the list and divides it across the available
engines. To do so, you can create a DirectView object using list notation
and use its map method:


<pre     class="programlisting">
dview = rc[:]
parallel_results = dview.map_sync(lambda x: x**10, range(32))
</pre>
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11393f5.large.jpg"><img src="11393f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. when you start IPython, it will pick up the newly created engines.
</p></div></div><p>
In more complicated systems, you actually can create profiles defining
how the parallel system is to be configured. This way, you don't need to
remember all of the details. To create a profile, you can run:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ipython profile create --parallel --profile=myprofile
</pre>
</p><p>
This will create a directory named profile_myprofile in
$IPYTHONDIR. This is usually in $HOME/.config/ipython. You then can go in
and edit the generated files and define the options. For example, you can
set up a system where the IPython engines are created on machines over a
network with MPI and a controller is created on your local machine. 
</p><p>
Once
the profile is finished, you can start the cluster with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ipcluster start --profile=myprofile
</pre>
</p><p>
Then when you start IPython, you can run code on all of these networked
machines. With this kind of functionality, you can get some really
serious work done on a full-sized HPC cluster.
</p><p>
Python, with IPython and SciPy, has been growing in popularity as
a language for doing high-performance scientific work. Traditionally, the
opinion was that it is useful only for smaller problems, and that
you needed to move to C or Fortran to get &ldquo;real&rdquo; work done. With the
parallel functionality in IPython combined with SciPy, this no longer
applies. You can do work on larger clusters and deal with even larger
problem sets. This article barely scratched the surface, so look at the related Web sites to learn even more.
