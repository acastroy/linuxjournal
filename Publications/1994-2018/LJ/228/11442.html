Cloud infrastructure must become efficient as demand grows&mdash;thus, the end
of VMs.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12a2580.0x139a1f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Cloud infrastructure providers like Amazon Web Service sell virtual machines.
EC2 revenue is expected to surpass $1B in revenue this year. That's a lot
of VMs. 
</p><p>
It's not hard to see why there is such demand. You get the ability to scale
up or down, guaranteed computational resources, security isolation and API
access for provisioning it all, without any of the overhead of managing
physical servers. 
</p><p>
But, you are also paying for lot of increasingly avoidable overhead in the form
of running a full-blown operating system image for each virtual machine. This
approach has become an unnecessarily heavyweight solution to the underlying
question of how to best run applications in the cloud. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11442f1.large.jpg"><img src="11442f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Traditional virtualization and paravirtualization require a full operating
system image for each instance.
</p></div></div><p>
Until recently it has been assumed that OS virtualization is the only path to
provide appropriate isolation for applications running on a server. These
assumptions are quickly becoming dated, thanks to recent underlying
improvements to how the Linux kernel can now manage isolation between
applications. 
</p><p>
Containers now can be used as an alternative to OS-level virtualization to run
multiple isolated systems on a single host. Containers within a single
operating system are much more efficient, and because of this efficiency,
they will underpin the future of the cloud infrastructure industry in place of VM
architecture. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11442f2.large.jpg"><img src="11442f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Containers can share a single operating system and, optionally, other binary
and library resources.
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12a2580.0x139a828"></a>
How We Got Here</h2></div></div><p>
There is a good reason why we buy by the virtual machine today: containers used
to be terrible, if they existed in any useful form at all. Let's hop back to
2005 for a moment. &ldquo;chroot&rdquo; certainly didn't (and still doesn't) meet
the resource and security isolation goals for multi-tenant designs.
&ldquo;nice&rdquo; is a winner-takes-all scheduling mechanism. The
&ldquo;fair&rdquo;
resource scheduling in the kernel is often too fair, equally balancing
resources between a hungry, unimportant process and a hungry, important one.
Memory and file descriptor limits offer no gradient between normal operation
and crashing an application that's overstepped its boundaries. 
</p><p>
Virtual machines were able to partition and distribute resources viably in the
hypervisor without relying on kernel support or, worse, separate hardware. For
a long time, virtual machines were the only way on Linux to give Application A
up to 80% of CPU resources and Application B up to 20%. Similar partitioning
and sharing schemes exist for memory, disk block I/O, network I/O and other
contentious resources. 
</p><p>
Virtual machines have made major leaps in efficiency too. What used to be
borderline-emulation has moved to direct hardware support for memory page
mapping and other hard-to-virtualize features. We're down to a CPU penalty of
only a few percent versus direct hardware use. 
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12a2580.0x139aae8"></a>
The Problem with VMs</h2></div></div><p>
Here are the penalties we currently pay for VMs: 
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Running a whole separate operating system to get a resource and security
isolation.
</p></li><li><p>
Slow startup time while waiting for the OS to boot.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
The OS often consumes more memory and more disk than the actual application it
hosts. The Rackspace Cloud recently discontinued 256MB instances because it
didn't see them as practical. Yet, 256MB is a very practical size for an
application if it doesn't need to share that memory with a full operating
system. 
</p><p>
As for slow startup time, many cloud infrastructure users keep spare virtual
machines around to accelerate provisioning. Virtual machines have taken the
window from requesting to receiving resources down to minutes, but having to
keep spare resources around is a sign that it's still either too slow or not
reliable enough.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12a2580.0x139ae58"></a>
So What's the Difference?</h2></div></div><p>
VMs are fairly standardized; a system image running on one expects mostly the
same things as if it had its own bare-metal computer. Containers are not very
standardized in the industry as a whole. They're very OS- and
kernel-specific (BSD jails, Solaris Zones, Linux namespaces/cgroups). Even on
the same kernel and OS, options may range from security sandboxes for
individual processes to nearly complete systems.
</p><p>
VMs don't have to run the same kernel or OS as the host and they obtain
access to resources from the host over virtualized devices&mdash;like network
cards&mdash;and network protocols. However, VMs are fairly opaque to the host
system; the hypervisor has poor insight into what's been written but freed
in block storage and memory. They usually leverage hardware/CPU-based
facilities for isolating their access to memory and appear as a handful of
hypervisor processes on the host system.
</p><p>
Containers have to run the same kernel as the host, but they can optionally run
a completely different package tree or distribution. Containers are fairly
transparent to the host system. The kernel manages memory and filesystem
access the same way as if it were running on the host system. Containers obtain
access to resources from the host over normal userland/IPC facilities. Some
implementations even support handing sockets from the host to the container of
standard UNIX facilities.
</p><p>
VMs are also heavyweight. They require a full OS and system image, such as
EC2's AMIs. The hypervisor runs a boot process for the VM, often even
emulating BIOS. They usually appear as a handful of hypervisor processes on the
host system. Containers, on the other hand, are lightweight. There may not be
any persistent files or state, and the host system usually starts the
containerized application directly or runs a container-friendly init d&aelig;mon,
like systemd. They appear as normal processes on the host system.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11442f3.large.jpg"><img src="11442f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Virtualization decoupled provisioning from hardware deployment. Containers
decouple provisioning from OS deployment and boot-up.
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12a2580.0x139b278"></a>
Containers Now Offer the Same Features as VMS, but with Minimal
Overhead</h2></div></div><p>
Compared to a virtual machine, the overhead of a container is disruptively low.
They start so fast that many configurations can launch on-demand as requests
come in, resulting in zero idle memory and CPU overhead. A container running
systemd or Upstart to manage its services has less than 5MB of system memory
overhead and nearly zero CPU consumption. With copy-on-write for disk,
provisioning new containers can happen in seconds. 
</p><p>
Containers are how we at Pantheon maintain a consistent system architecture
that spans free accounts up to clustered, highly available enterprise users. We
manage an internal supply of containers that we provision using an API. 
</p><p>
We're not alone here; virtually every large PaaS system&mdash;including Heroku,
OpenShift, dotCloud and Cloud Foundry&mdash;has a container foundation for
running their platform tools. PaaS providers that do rely on full virtual
machines have inflexibly high infrastructure costs that get passed onto their
customers (which is the case for our biggest competitors in our market).
</p><p>
The easiest way to play with containers and experience the difference is by
using a modern Linux OS&mdash;whether locally, on a server or even on a VM. There
is a great tutorial on Fedora by Dan Walsh and another one with systemd's
nspawn tool that includes the UNIX socket handoff.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12a2580.0x139b4e0"></a>
Evolving Containers in Open Source</h2></div></div><p>
While Pantheon isn't in the business of providing raw containers as a service,
we're working toward the open-source technical foundations. It's in the same
spirit as why Facebook and Yahoo incubated Hadoop; it's part of the
foundation we need to build the product we want. We directly contribute as
co-maintainers to systemd, much of which will be available in the next Red Hat
Enterprise Linux release. We also send patches upstream to enable better
service &ldquo;activation&rdquo; support so containers can run only when needed. 
</p><p>
We have a goal that new installations of Fedora and other major distributions,
like Ubuntu, provide out-of-the-box, standard API and command-line tools for
managing containers, binding them to ports or IP addresses and viewing the
resource reservation and utilization levels. This capability should enable
other companies eventual access to a large pool of container hosts and flavors,
much as Xen opened the door to today's IaaS services. 
</p><p>
One way we'll measure progress toward this goal is how &ldquo;vanilla&rdquo; our
container host machines are. If we can prepare a container host system by just
installing some packages and a certificate (or other PKI integration), we'll
have achieved it. The free, open-source software (FOSS) world will be stronger
for it, and Pantheon will also benefit by having less code to maintain and
broader adoption of container-centric computing. 
</p><p>
There's also an advantage to this sort of FOSS contribution versus Cloud
Foundry, OpenShift or OpenStack, which are open-source PaaS and LaaS stacks.
What Pantheon is doing with projects like systemd redefines how users manage
applications and resources even on single machines. The number of potential
users&mdash;and, since it's FOSS, contributors&mdash;is orders of magnitude
larger than for tools that require multi-machine deployments to be useful. It's
also more sustainable in FOSS to have projects where 99% of the value reaches
99% of a large, existing user base. 
</p><p>
Efficiency demands a future of containers running on bare-metal hardware.
Virtual machines have had their decade.
