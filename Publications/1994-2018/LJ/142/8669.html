Thin clients make cost-effective diskless clients for education and the
workplace.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x284d580.0x2945298"></a></h2></div></div><p>
At the Superemos community education programme in Esteli, northern
Nicaragua, we use secondhand computers as thin (diskless) clients in
networks controlled by a Linux server. Many organizations already benefit
from the Linux tools available for setting up such networks. They save
money, simplify system administration, enhance security and increase
autonomy. They are ideal for our low-budget education programmes in
Nicaragua. Plenty of information and know-how on setting up these networks
is published on the Web. Although that knowledge can be intimidating to
try and make work, the effort certainly pays off.
</p><p>
This article explains how we have been using old hard drives and Flash
drives to boot diskless clients over a network. It should be helpful
to anybody on a tight budget who wants to offer a large group of people
low-cost access to computing facilities. At our project, we are especially
anxious that educators realise they can recycle older machines to deliver
the latest software. But the principles apply equally to better-resourced
outfits of all kinds including commercial businesses and government
offices.
</p><p>
Before moving on to explain some of the basics for people with no
experience of diskless client networks, I should detail and acknowledge our
project's sources of tools and information. We have been using Novell's
SUSE Linux 10.0 and Ubuntu's Breezy Badger distribution with a variety
of new and old machines and parts supplied to us by the Rotary Club of
Toronto-Leaside and by SSC Inc., the publishers of <i  >Linux Journal</i>. It's
worth pointing out that our machines are all PCs. Optimally, it's worth
trying to standardise as much as possible. That's always awkward to do
when one depends on donated or inherited equipment.
</p><p>
Among the indispensable tools that make our project work
smoothly are the superb diskless client software developed by
the Linux Terminal Server Project
 and the comprehensive library of boot-ROM images (see the on-line
Resources).
The original
tool we used for getting old hard disks to substitute for boot-ROM came
from Andy Rabagliati (see Resources).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x284d580.0x2945500"></a>
Diskless Client Network Basics</h2></div></div><p>
As in any network, diskless client systems consist of a server connected
to clients, in our case by Ethernet cable. Once the server is powered
up, the diskless clients receive their operating system from it. As
each client is switched on, it learns from its BIOS that no system is
available on hard disk. It then tries to boot from the local network
(LAN) by sending a request via its network card for a server to give it an
operating system. The server receives the request and looks to see whether
it has the appropriate operating system to send out. If it does,
the client boots up as normal using that operating system. For its users,
the client machine works just as if it had its own operating system. In
fact, it is receiving its operating system from the remote server.
</p><p>
It took us a while to understand the fundamental components of this
concept and how they interact. The first thing to find out is whether a
potential client has options in its BIOS allowing the machine to &ldquo;Boot
from LAN&rdquo; (LAN stands for local area network) via boot-ROM. On some machines
this is obvious, and on others, the settings are squirrelled away in
suboptions of the main BIOS. On still others it just does not exist. If
it is available, it enables the machine to boot through a boot-ROM chip,
usually with Pre-boot Execution Environment (PXE) capability located in
the machine's network card.
</p><p>
If you find the Boot from LAN option and configure the BIOS to boot
from LAN you may well be lucky and everything will just work. But don't
be dismayed if it does not. One of our machines with a VIA chipset
swore solemnly that it would boot from LAN using PXE and persistently
refused to do so before finally deciding one day that it would. Such
frustrations are a trivial part of setting up a diskless client network
and well worth overcoming in order to get a first-class network facility
using whatever machines may be available.
</p><p>
Some machines have the network card integrated into their motherboard. If
the network card is not integrated into the motherboard, it
usually will be plugged in to the PCI slot. (It is possible to work with
machines using older ISA cards, but they require special configuration
so we have avoided using them.) If the network card is not integrated
into the motherboard, it is unlikely to have pre-installed boot-ROM.
</p><p>
We found two main obstacles to using machines as diskless clients. One
was that the potential client machine did not offer a Boot from LAN
option. The second was that even if the machine offered to boot from LAN,
the network card generally had no boot-ROM. We found we could readily
overcome those obstacles by putting the necessary files to imitate a
boot-ROM on an old hard drive or on a USB Flash drive. The core of this
article is devoted to explaining how simple it is to do so. Doing this
completely avoids using floppy disks which, in Nicaragua, have simply
become too unreliable.
</p><p>
The clients will work with just 32MB of RAM but seem happier with
64MB. Older machines with processor speeds of just 266MHz work okay,
but processors with faster speeds obviously work better. Older mice, monitors
and non-English keyboard layouts can be configured on the server if
necessary. We found no configuration necessary for the majority of our
hardware, thanks to the comprehensive LTSP software.
</p><p>
It is well worth investing resources in the server. We now use
1GB of RAM with a 2.4GHz processor and that provides really fast
service for more than a dozen clients using Internet, office and game
applications. It should be possible to run dozens of clients off one
server if the server has adequate specifications. In this article,
there's no space to say much about setting up the server for a
thin-client network. A couple of excellent articles explaining how
<i  >Linux Journal</i> helped us do this have already been written by Kevin
Brown (see Resources).

Assembling the Necessary Files</h2></div></div><p>
For our project, we use the LILO (Linux Loader) bootloader because
all we are interested in is booting Linux. The version of LILO to use
is important. We discovered that the latest version of LILO by default
insists on using lba32 to manage disk geometry and that gave us problems
configuring our Flash drive. Fortunately, we found that older versions of
LILO don't impose that option. We copied the LILO we used for our Flash
drives from Andy Rabagliati's wizzy package. For convenience, we also
copied the boot.b file from Andy's package. To configure old hard
drives, we relied on Ubuntu and SUSE's prebundled LILO packages. (See the
Configuring Old Hard Drives section for a brief mention on using the GRUB
bootloader.)
</p><p>
We also need the relevant boot-ROM images for the different network cards
that our boot-ROM disk may end up working with. Our network cards are
either 3Com 905, Realtek 8139 or Via-Rhine. We got these image files
from ROM-o-matic. It took a certain amount of trial and error to get
the images that worked. ROM-o-matic updates its releases regularly.
All the releases have similar options, and ROM-o-matic helps keep the
trial-and-error process to a minimum by offering a button that gives a
list of the cards that particular images will work for.
</p><p>
Once you have selected the card image that is probably the right one,
you need to select the image type. Because we are using LILO, we chose
the current zlilo image type as well as the older type called lzlilo. We
used lzlilo on our Flash drive because we found the newer zlilo images
seemed to work only on the hard drives. We have yet to figure out why. It's
worth emphasizing that experiment yields invaluable information. Here
I summarise only the results of our own experimentation. Other people
will certainly get different and very likely better results as they try
out their own equipment.
</p><p>
ROM-o-matic offers a Get Rom button to download the image files it
produces. That option leads to a prompt allowing you to save the image
files in your local directory system. We downloaded the various .lzlilo
and .zlilo images we thought we would need for our three types of network
card. With those files and the LILO files, we had all we needed to make
our boot-ROM disks using either a Flash drive or an old hard disk. So
we copied them all to one place in a directory we decided to call
/flashlilo. Then we needed to put them onto our boot-ROM disk.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x284d580.0x2945ad8"></a>
Working with Flash Drives</h2></div></div><p>
For newer machines that don't boot from LAN but that do have a BIOS
option allowing boot from USB hard drive, a Flash drive that imitates
boot-ROM is a handier alternative than an old hard drive. Once one
client is booted, the Flash drive can be removed and used to boot another
client. We found that we could treat the USB Flash drive as if it were a
SCSI hard drive. Plugging the Flash drive in to a convenient USB socket
we powered up, although thanks to hotplug, we could have just plugged
the USB drive in while the machine was already running. This machine
ran SUSE, so the YaST configuration tool recognised the new device and
asked whether to configure it. We said no.
</p><p>
To ensure the drive we wanted to use for our boot-ROM was clear
of any formatting or partitioning problems, we deleted the existing
partitions, as the root superuser, using fdisk, and installed a new
bootable partition. (If there is anything on those disks that you need,
make copies. Partitioning afresh destroys everything on the disk!) We
then used fdisk to partition the Flash drive by typing:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# fdisk /dev/sda
</pre>
</p><p>
Something very important to note for later use when configuring the bootloader is the number of heads, sectors and cylinders fdisk discovers on
the drive. Make a note of these. After using fdisk to set up a bootable
partition free of any potentially bothersome history, we were ready to
put a filesystem on it. We took the easy option and typed:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# mke2fs /dev/sda1
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x284d580.0x2945d40"></a></h2></div></div><p>
to put on an ext2 filesystem on the Flash drive. In order to tell
Linux what device to mount and where, we used the
traditional directory /mnt as our mountpoint, checking first that it was empty. For the
Flash drive, we typed:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# mount /dev/sda1 /mnt
</pre>
</p><p>
Then we copied all the files in /flashlilo to /mnt:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# cp /flashlilo/* /mnt
</pre>
</p><p>
At this point, we needed to write a configuration file for LILO. Being
frightened of vi and emacs, we used pico:

<pre     class="programlisting">
boot = /dev/sda
disk = /dev/sda
   bios = 0x80
   sectors = 62
   heads = 4
   cylinders = 1015
install = /mnt/boot.b
map = /mnt/map
root = /dev/sda1
vga = normal
read-only
delay = 30
pROMpt
image = /mnt/viarhine6102.lzlilo
	label=viarhine2
	read-only
image = /mnt/3c905b.lzlilo
        label=3Com905b
        read-only
image = /mnt/rt8139.lzlilo
        label=RTL8139
        read-only
</pre>
</p><p>
We saved that file to /mnt with the standard name lilo.conf.
</p><p>
The main part of that configuration file applies to the overall boot
process before the user selects an option from the final menu. In this
part, the first line tells the client machine to boot from the
Flash drive. The second line and its sub-lines tells it about the
disk geometry so it knows where to put things. (This is where you need
that disk information you noted from fdisk!) The install line tells it
to use boot.b to install the boot stages.
</p><p>
The map line tells the thin client where to find stuff in a file
created by the LILO program. The root line tells it where to find
the filesystem. The vga line explains how to output information to the
monitor. The read-only option keeps everything from getting interfered
with. The delay line tells the machine how long to wait before displaying
the prompt.
</p><p>
The image sections of the configuration file offer the client user
different boot options. So when the client starts up, LILO offers these image options to the user via a menu with three choices of network
card from which to boot: Via-RhineII, Realtek 8139 or 3Com905.
</p><p>
Why are boot.b, map and LILO images referred to as residing in the
/mnt directory? The reason is that now we have written the configuration
file for LILO, we have to tell LILO to use that configuration file. We
can do that only in the directory where we are working, which is where
the drive we are working on is mounted. In our case, this is /mnt. The
command to tell the LILO version we want to work with to update the
lilo.conf file is therefore:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# /mnt/lilo -C lilo.conf
</pre>
</p><p>
This is fine for the moment because we are in /mnt. But what happens when we unmount the Flash drive, remove it and insert in the machine we
hope it will boot? Won't we need to change references in the lilo.conf
file? And won't we then get into a manic circle of eternally having to
run LILO to reconfigure lilo.conf? No, as it turns out. When we tried
booting this in our client machines, it all ran smoothly. So, now that we
have our boot-ROM drive, we move out of the /mnt directory and type:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# umount /dev/sda1
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x284d580.0x29462c0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
before removing the drive from the machine.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x284d580.0x29463c8"></a>
Configuring Old Hard Drives</h2></div></div><p>
When we first started configuring old hard disks to imitate boot-ROMs,
we followed a procedure similar to the one we used for the Flash
drive. We had to learn this might mean changing the jumper on the hard
disk before connecting it to the machine. (The term jumper refers
to a tiny connector located in a set of pins on the side of the hard
drive.) It is very easy to change the jumper. Most hard drives have
little diagrams on their casing explaining how to set the jumper for
the different options. Usually there are three: Master, Slave and Chain
Select. Chain Select allows the machine's BIOS to decide what status to
assign the hard drive.
</p><p>
Most commonly used PC machines have just one IDE hard drive, which is
usually the master drive. Linux identifies that drive as /dev/hda. If
the old machine has enough memory and a fast enough CPU, it makes sense
to connect a CD-ROM drive with its jumper set to Chain Select or Slave
and configure the machine's hard drive directly. However, to save time
on installation, we ended up deciding to use a much faster new machine
with a newish CD-ROM to configure our old hard drives. That meant simply
disconnecting the existing hard disk on the faster machine and connecting
our old hard drive with the jumpers set to Master. So once we finish
the configuration and we connect it to the motherboard of the diskless
client, it will be recognised straight away as the primary master drive.
</p><p>
Whatever method we use to prepare the old hard drive for configuration,
we install either Ubuntu's Breezy Badger directly from the CD or else
SUSE 10 over our local network. In either case, we do a minimum text-based
installation and choose LILO as our bootloader. Once the installation
is done, we can edit the /etc/lilo.conf configuration file to add the
images exactly as they appear in the lilo.conf file described above for
the Flash drive. Finally, we run the line:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# lilo -C /etc/lilo.conf
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x284d580.0x29465d8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
to update LILO with our new image options.
</p><p>
In relation to the GRUB bootloader, we had an old slow machine already
running Linux that we wanted to turn into a client. We found we could get
it to boot off a boot-ROM image simply by adding this entry to GRUB's
menu.lst file (substituting the name of the appropriate boot-ROM image
file):

<pre     class="programlisting">
title Via-Rhine Boot-ROM
    root (hd0,0)
    kernel /boot/via-rhine.zlilo
</pre>
</p><p>
Before we rebooted, we set the hard drive as the first boot option. In
this case, the machine on which we did the configuration has the same
kind of network card as a couple of the older machines we want to use as
diskless clients, so it was a handy control to make sure the hard drive is
doing its job imitating boot-ROM. Once satisfied that everything works,
we can transfer the drive we just configured to the machine it will be
booting. Alternatively, if we configure an old machine by connecting
a CD-ROM drive to it, when done we just disconnect the CD-ROM drive and
reboot. We have found this simple configuration procedure also works well
on old laptops, so long as they have a built-in CD-ROM and network card.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x284d580.0x29467e8"></a>
Configuring the Server for Its Clients</h2></div></div><p>
Our system in Esteli now serves nine clients, some that have boot-ROM PXE
and the rest with various drives imitating boot-ROM. In the case of the
Flash drive we configured to imitate boot-ROM, we just put it in a USB
drive on the client machine before starting up. The BIOS needs to be set
correctly for each client so that the first boot device corresponds to
the relevant disk on that client. To access the BIOS, search the monitor
screen when you start the computer.
</p><p>
There should be a line that says something like &ldquo;Press DEL to enter
Set-up&rdquo;. Whatever the key or combination of keys indicated, this will
enable access to the machine's BIOS menus. The configuration of the
order of boot devices is usually in the second menu, which should be
called something like &ldquo;Advanced BIOS options&rdquo;. In that menu, you should
find the option to set the first boot device. In the case of the Flash
drive, we found that setting the first boot device to USBHDD works fine.
</p><p>
The clients need to get a kernel image from the server. A kernel image
is another way of describing the files that make up the operating system
software that makes it possible to work with different applications. To
get their kernel image, the clients have to provide the network
server with their identity and establish a network address. Each client
identifies itself by offering the unique code on its network card called
the MAC address. In response, the server provides each client with a
network address called the IP (Internet Protocol) address.
</p><p>
The clients get this information from the server via a networking standard
called the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP). Clients booting
with PXE get assigned a dynamic address automatically from a general
section of the DHCP configuration file dhcpd.conf. Clients without PXE
get a fixed IP address through a specific configuration in dhcpd.conf
to ensure they are recognised and can get an appropriate Linux kernel
image. We have found older machines like to work with kernel images
called vmlinuz rather than bzImage.
</p><p>
In our configuration for each non-PXE client, we told the server's
/etc/dhcpd.conf file their Mac address, a fixed-IP address and the
kernel image they would like. It may sometimes be necessary to configure
the Linux Terminal Server Project (LTSP) package that provides the filesystem architecture for our network. The LTSP lts.conf configuration file
can be adjusted when a client is using a mouse or monitor or keyboard
layout not recognised automatically by LTSP.
</p><p>
Here is some of our server's dhcpd.conf file:


<pre     class="programlisting">
ddns-update-style ad-hoc;
allow booting;
allow bootp;
subnet 198.186.207.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
range dynamic-bootp 198.186.207.205 198.186.207.220;
default-lease-time 21600;
max-lease-time 43200;
}
next-server 198.186.207.124;
filename "pxelinux.0";
option root-path "198.186.207.124:/opt/ltsp/i386";

host ws001 {
hardware ethernet    00:11:5B:86:46:B5;
fixed-address        198.186.207.201;
filename             "/lts/vmlinuz-2.6.9-ltsp-3";
}

host ws002 {
hardware ethernet    00:60:08:C6:2B:43;
fixed-address        198.186.207.202;
filename             "/lts/vmlinuz-2.6.9-ltsp-3";
}
</pre>
</p><p>

And here is the main part of our server's LTSP lts.conf file:

<pre     class="programlisting">
[Default]
        SERVER             = 198.186.207.124
        XSERVER            = auto
        X_MOUSE_PROTOCOL   = "PS/2"
        X_MOUSE_DEVICE     = "/dev/psaux"
        X_MOUSE_RESOLUTION = 400
        X_MOUSE_BUTTONS    = 3
        XkbLayout          = es
        USE_XFS            = N
        SCREEN_01          = startx
</pre>
</p><p>
LTSP's package permits a wide range of sophisticated configuration
options for multimedia and other applications run off individual client
workstations that can be configured in lts.conf similarly to individual
workstations in dhcpd.conf. We keep our system simple because we are
working mainly with Internet and office applications. In our case, LTSP's
default configuration recognised all our various clients' hardware except
the keyboard layout, so we added a line configuring a Spanish keyboard.
</p><p>
This technology is incredibly accessible and flexible. For us in
Nicaragua, it enables us to offer computer skills training to a large
number students on low incomes using old equipment to deliver the latest
software. The widely available tools and information mean that even
relative beginners in Linux can readily implement such diskless client
systems for a broad range of educational, commercial and administrative
purposes. Rarely can a bottom line show such a large beneficial return
for so modest an investment of resources.
