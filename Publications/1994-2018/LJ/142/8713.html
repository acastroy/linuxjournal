Infocom Games</h4><p>

&ldquo;The closest I got this time was pulling out my <span   class="emphasis"><em>Classic Text Adventure

You and many of your readers probably didn't know that you can
already play most of these under Linux very smoothly. It turns out
that the Infocom games were written for a virtual machine (sort of
like Java); they come in two pieces, the actual game and the virtual
machine interpreter. Several replacement virtual machine interpreters
have been written that run on Linux and are under the GPL. One is
called Frotz, and the current version is 2.43. It's available from
<a href="http://www.cs.csubak.edu/~dgriffi/proj/frotz" target="_self">www.cs.csubak.edu/~dgriffi/proj/frotz</a>; it's also packaged for
Debian and probably other distributions. There are many others.
</p><p>
You have to experiment a bit to find out where the actual game
file is on the CD, since they've been put in different places for
each game. For <span   class="emphasis"><em>zork 1</em></span>, it's in
pc/zork1/data/zork1.dat, so run <tt  >frotz
pc/zork1/data/zork1.dat</tt> in a console and you're off. Some of the game
files have a .zip extension rather than a .dat extension (that's what
Infocom called its virtual machine format, back in the days before
PKZIP).
</p><p>
Frotz doesn't behave properly on the games with graphics,
like <span   class="emphasis"><em>Zork Zero</em></span>; support for those is in a derivative GPL
program that runs only on Windows, called WindowsFrotz2002,
and will hopefully be ported back to the original someday. In the
meantime, WindowsFrotz2002 runs under Wine, and can be downloaded from
<a href="http://www.ifarchive.org/indexes/if-archiveXinfocomXinterpretersXfrotz.html" target="_self">www.ifarchive.org/indexes/if-archiveXinfocomXinterpretersXfrotz.html</a>,
but it requires pictures translated into the Blorb format, which you'll
have to poke around the Net for.

Thank you very much! I think I might have known this at some point along
the way many moons ago and then forgot. When I get home from being on
the road, I just might pull out that Infocom CD again and cover this.

A Happy Subscriber with Suggestions</h4><p>
I have been a very delighted <i  >Linux Journal</i> subscriber
for several years. The last year or so I felt that I
had several sources of information, including <i  >LJ</i>. So I
decided to let my subscription expire and just receive
the remaining copies until they stopped. And then came
along Mr Lerner's article about Ruby On Rails, which
was very informative and inspiring [<i  >LJ</i>, October
2005]. This made me
change my mind about not renewing, so I just subscribed
for another two years.
</p><p>
Even though I'm a (very happy) FreeBSD user for just
about as many years as I've subscribed to <i  >LJ</i>, many
articles in <i  >LJ</i> are just as relevant to FreeBSD and
other open-source OSes, which I believe is the true
force of open source.
</p><p>
Open source is the possibility to borrow and grow ideas
and principles from each other. Many articles are well
written, but I do still wish that some of them weren't
so Linux-centric and would take on a broader view.
</p><p>
Remember that in the quest of trying to grab a larger
share of the server and desktop segment dominated by
one large company, Linux advocates should be careful
not to use the same rhetoric as the one vendor does.
One idea you could try out is a BSD-corner (or other
open-source OSes for that matter) once in a while so
Linux users are exposed slightly to other concepts.

Another Name for Linux</h4><p>
Regarding the frivolous little bit, &ldquo;Might be Just Right&rdquo;
[<i  >LJ</i>, December 2005, page 94] does the
word Lagom apply to Linux? I think it might, but maybe another word
that applies to Linux is Gaia, in that Linux consists of many organisms
working together as a single organism. Linus Torvalds did not create an
operating system; he created a kernel that was made into a successful
operating system by obtaining the cooperation of an array of GNU
utilities, which in turn spawned many computer geeks around the world to use the
fledgling and somewhat useful UNIX system to fix and enhance the system
and its utilities, adapt other stuff to work with Linux and write new
stuff from scratch and so on. You get the picture. There is no real
master organism, but there are many organisms spontaneously working
together toward the one common good.
</p><p>
Another definition: Linux is an example of a near-perfect anarchy for all
the same reasons that make it a Gaia&mdash;all work together for the
advancement of their common good without a government or owner directing
their activities. Alexander Berkman would be proud.
</p><p>
Is that black helicopters I hear coming this way?

Clarification</h4><p>
I'd encourage Maestro Mr Taylor to make a point of reminding the
readers of his Work the Shell column that his work environment is specific to the
Bourne shell, and some users, for any number of legitimate reasons, may
be confronted with a C-Shell environment. As a nicety to these
readers, maybe a quick side-track into how to get their won Bourne
shell environment? [See Dave Taylor's Work the Shell column, beginning in
the December 2005 issue of <i  >LJ</i>.]
</p><p>
Thank you all for your hard work!

I knew we couldn't go too long without someone bringing up the great
religious war of the shell scripting world, which shell to use. I tried
to
highlight in my first column that I would be writing for the Bourne Again
Shell (though almost everything will work with any modern Bourne Shell
too,
especially if it's a Posix-compliant distro), but just to clarify, I don't
think
it really matters what shell you opt to use; with just a few relatively
minor syntactic changes, the basic concept of scripting and how you
utilize
Linux commands to accomplish extraordinarily difficult programming tasks
in
just 5-10 lines remains the same.
</p><p>
Also, you can certainly have the C Shell or one of its variants as your
command-line interpreter / login shell and still use Bash as your
scripting
environment of choice.
</p><p>
To find out what shell you're currently running, simply type in
the following command: <tt  >ps -p $$</tt> it'll either say
<tt  >sh</tt>, <tt  >csh</tt>,
<tt  >bash</tt>, <tt  >tcsh</tt> or similar. The syntax used throughout the shell
scripting column is for sh or bash.

Thanks for the Old School Article</h4><p>
Matthew Hoskins' article &ldquo;UNIX: Old School&rdquo; in the December 2005 issue
was a gem. I found it intriguing that a vintage 1974 release of UNIX
could be booted under a PDP-11 simulator and experienced firsthand. A
terrific retrospective.

Love the December 2005 Issue</h4><p>
Just had to drop a quick note to say excellent issue. I'm thrilled with
the new column, Work the Shell. This was by far my favorite issue in
the past few years. I eagerly await next issue to see if it can hold up!

On Patents</h4><p>
Subject: Re: On Patents
</p><p>
Roger Wolff's response to Don Marti [see Letters in the December 2005
issue of <i  >LJ</i>] displays a weak understanding
of patents. He uses the descriptions of the patents to decide
what they cover. That doesn't work. To understand what the
patent covers you must read the claims section. Everything else
is little more than window dressing. Unfortunately, the claims
section is written in lawyer-ese. Reading the rest of the patent
can be helpful for setting context for the claims. But that is
all that it is.
</p><p>
For his example &ldquo;method for coding an audio signal&rdquo;, the claims
could be very narrow or could be broad. Much depends on how
careful the patent examiner was. But you simply cannot tell
from the description.
</p><p>
Disclaimer: I am not a lawyer. But I do have some patents.

And More on Patents</h4><p>
I found it interesting to read the &ldquo;Archives, Patents&rdquo; letter by Kari
Laine, and the answer from <i  >LJ</i> [November 2005 issue,
page 10].
The answer totally avoids the issues involved, when you form a symbiosis
with something that you're trying to fight. Kari's letter gives the impression
that patents are evil, and yet Kari suggests a model where a part of the Open
Source community relies on patents to fill the bank account.
How can you whole heartedly fight something that puts food on your
table?
</p><p>
Now, I'm not saying that the Patent Commons Project is bad because it
forms a
symbiosis with the patent system&mdash;open-source purists will take that
discussion if needed.
</p><p>
Maybe <i  >LJ</i> can clarify the implications of forming symbiosis with what
you're
trying to fight, by having Doc Searls write about it, all the way from
putting hooks to binary-only modules into the kernel (pwc/pwcx), over
the
emulation of &ldquo;the deselected OS&rdquo; (Wine), to making money on patents when
you
actually don't like them?

A Few Words on Usability</h4><p>
I have a few comments to share about the article
&ldquo;Bringing Usability to Open Source&rdquo; in the January
2006 issue of <i  >LJ</i>.
</p><p>
First off, I must thank Nate and the <i  >Linux Journal</i>
for
printing the article. I have to stress that usability
should be one of the number one goals of all software
creators, open source or otherwise. There is no
substitute for observing users, because as Nat has
pointed out, they often have a different mindset from
that of the developer. Furthermore, developers often
consider a feature finished when it &ldquo;works&rdquo;, without
realizing how normal users flow through the
processes they use on a daily basis. More times than
I can count, I have sat down at my software with users
and realized immediately that I missed the usability
boat entirely as I watched them go through several
painstaking and frustrating steps I had never
envisioned to accomplish their task. In most of these
cases, it wasn't a case of &ldquo;bad user&rdquo;, it was a case
of &ldquo;bad software&rdquo;--which is hard for a guy like me to
admit.
</p><p>
However, I think one has to be careful when making
software more &ldquo;usable&rdquo; not to be equally blinded by
the actions of a few users.
</p><p>
As an exercise, imagine you took a young child out to
your vehicle, set up a camera, and asked the child to
&ldquo;take me to the store&rdquo;. While this is a very simple
task, you might imagine your young friend might grasp
the wheel, step on a couple of pedals, turn the key
(with the clutch out) smash into the garage door (oops
that wasn't right), and then give up and admit that
he or she doesn't know how to do it.
</p><p>
In my mind, this does in no way imply that the car is
&ldquo;broken&rdquo; from a usability perspective. A well-meaning
engineer may take this feedback to indicate that the
vehicle should be altered in some way to ensure that
this novice would succeed next time. The problem is
that any individual with driving experience would get
in this &ldquo;fixed&rdquo; vehicle and become instantly annoyed
at having to step through some new sequence of steps,
most likely taking more time, and ultimately being
much less usable.
</p><p>
In Nat's specific example of the New button being
wrong, I would have to disagree respectfully. First
of all, the New button is quite consistently used in
many software packages to begin a new action. New
may be too terse, but conceptually it's correct. In
my opinion Send would be incorrect, because the
option doesn't <span   class="emphasis"><em>send</em></span> anything, it only creates a new
message. If you want to <span   class="emphasis"><em>send</em></span> the message, you need
to
press Send. This would be my interpretation of
course, which doesn't imply it is correct.
</p><p>
In this case, I might recommend that the button should
say New Email (for English speakers). This is both
more clear and yet remains true to the action it
represents. Perhaps this user would not have stumbled
with this minor change in place.
</p><p>
The point is not to disagree with the article or Nat's
intentions. The point is to ensure that software
engineers and developers understand the need to take
usability very seriously and look at a problem from
several angles before making a decision. Because
writing bad software is much easier than writing good
software, and there are more wrong ways than right
ways, selecting the best way is a huge challenge.
</p><p>
There are a lot of factors that go into usable
software. I have always believed that some key
elements are 1) consistency, both internally and among
other applications. 2) Clarity&mdash;language should fit
the action precisely and be backed up by verbose tooltips that users can
rely on to clarify. (Tooltips
should always be present as a matter of consistency).
3) Efficiency&mdash;displays should present all relevant
information organized comprehensibly. Help should be
available and abundant. Help should never restate the
question (that is, help like &ldquo;The Sort button will sort
your results&rdquo; is not really very helpful). The number
of keystrokes and mouse clicks needed to accomplish
tasks should be minimized. Repetitive tasks should have
short cuts. Process flow should always be taken in to
consideration. Things like allowing multi-select
rather than single select can mean the difference of
an hour of work versus five seconds of work. Always
automate where appropriate, but give options. Never
lock the user into a process but ensure that the most
basic processes are well designed and flow well and
have a minimum of &ldquo;speed bumps&rdquo;. Allow the user to
turn off or skip features designed to assist a novice.
 You can try to anticipate what a user wants, but
don't insist.
</p><p>
I can easily give examples of &ldquo;bad&rdquo; usability that has
been coded into software. Just for fun, consider some
features that I have experienced while running
Windows. Every time I put in a new CD the OS tries to
&ldquo;guess&rdquo; what I want to do with it, wasting my time
when I could have already been doing it. And I really
love it when Windows tries to &ldquo;help&rdquo; me clean up the
icons on my desktop. Yeah, I really want to delete
those links, thanks for asking me (<span   class="emphasis"><em>every day</em></span>). This
does not improve my experience, and it's frustrating
how difficult it is to disable these behaviours, even
for a relative expert without a lot of time to go
hunting down the method.
</p><p>
And yes, I could give examples in Linux as well.
</p><p>
I'm sure I could write on the subject for days.
Though I don't consider myself an expert at interface
design I am fairly passionate about the need for
usability in software, and I've made my share of
mistakes. I've also been subjected to my share of bad
software as I go about my own daily tasks, as I'm sure
most readers have.
</p><p>
It is my hope that the article and the work of the
Novell Usability Labs will help spur more work on the
subject. Success of the Linux desktop has more to do
with mindshare than anything else at this point. The
platform is ready.
We are close folks! Let's keep going!
