IF you need conditions in your scripts, THEN this is the column for you.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23e8580.0x24e03f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The last of the basic building blocks of shell scripting are conditional
statements, allowing you to decide programmatically whether to execute a
block of statements based on a logical test, and flow control statements,
the great innovation from the earliest days of programming where you could
have a block of code execute more than once. We explore both of these
in this column and, finally, are done with the proverbial Lego blocks of
scripting, allowing us to start exploring how to solve complex scripting
problems with novel and unique combinations of simple statements.
</p><p>
The most obvious conditional statement is if-then-else, which in shell
scripting looks like:

<pre     class="programlisting">
if condition ; then ; statements ; else ; statements2 ; fi
</pre>
</p><p>
Of course, you'd usually see this on multiple lines, so it's more likely
to look like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
if condition; then
  statements
else
  statements2
fi
</pre>
</p><p>
There are some variations on this, including safely omitting any
sort of else clause, but more interestingly, you can &ldquo;chain&rdquo; conditionals
together with an else if structure:

<pre     class="programlisting">
if condition; then
  statements
elif condition2 ; then
  statements2
fi
</pre>
</p><p>
That's perfectly valid and, worth noting, functionally different from
the structure:

<pre     class="programlisting">
if condition
then
  statements
  if condition2; then
      statements2
  fi
fi
</pre>
</p><p>
The difference will be obvious to anyone who has programmed before.
In the first example, statements2 would execute if condition was false
and condition2 were true. In the latter example, however, statements2
would be executed only if condition were true and condition2 were true.
Subtle, but very important!
</p><p>
Specific logical conditions can take on a wide variety of appearances,
because the only requirement for a conditional expression is that it
return zero if the evaluated condition is false and nonzero if it
should be considered true. Indeed, there are commands in Linux called
false and true, so you can use statements like &ldquo;if true;
then....&rdquo;
Most conditions, however, are built around the invaluable test command,
with its many different flags and options.
</p><p>
Want to compare two string (text) values? You could use:

<pre     class="programlisting">
if  test $myvar = "exit" ; then
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23e8580.0x24e09d0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
or its shortcut alternative of:

<pre     class="programlisting">
if [ $myvar = "exit" ] ; then
</pre>
</p><p>
Compare two numeric values with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
if test $numval -lt 10 ; then
</pre>
</p><p>
There's also a world of file and variable tests available in the test
command too, including -r to test if a file is readable, -e to see if
it exists at all, -s to see if the file exists and has a nonzero size,
and -d to test for a directory and -f to test for a regular file.
</p><p>
So if you want to differentiate whether $filename is a file, directory
or other file type, you could use a statement sequence like:

<pre     class="programlisting">
if test -f $filename ; then
  echo "$filename is a regular file"
elif test -d $filename ; then
  echo "$filename is a directory"
else
  echo "$filename is neither a file nor a directory."
fi
</pre>
</p><p>
Check out the test man page (use <tt  >man test</tt>) to read about all the many
different conditionals you can use in a shell script.

Flow Control</h2></div></div><p>
There are a number of different looping and flow control structures
above and beyond simply the if-then-else conditional, luckily, and here
are the big three:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
<tt  >for x in y; do; statements; done</tt>
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >while x; do; statements; done</tt>
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >case x in ; condition1) statements ;; condition2) statements
;; esac</tt>
</p></li></ul></div><p>
There are more conditional statements, but you'll find that in the vast
majority of cases, having for loops, while loops, case statements and
if-then-else statements will serve as the building blocks of even the
most complex script.
</p><p>
The for loop is particularly useful in its variations. Want to step
through the parameters given to the shell script itself? Use something
like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
for value ; do ; statements ; done
</pre>
</p><p>
Want to step through a set of matching filenames for a given pattern?
Here's how to do that in a script:

<pre     class="programlisting">
for filename in *.c ; do
  statements
done
</pre>
</p><p>
Let's look at how a couple of these can be combined in useful ways,
rather than just duplicate the man page, however. Here's a simple script
that examines each entry in the current directory, indicating whether it's
a file or directory:

<pre     class="programlisting">
for name in *
do
  if [ -f "$name" ] ; then
    echo "$name is a file"
  elif [ -d "$name" ] ; then
    echo "$name is a directory"
  else
    echo "$name is neither a file nor directory"
  fi
done
</pre>
</p><p>
For illustrative purposes, let's try another version of this script,
one that recognizes *.c as C source files, *.h as included header
files and *.o as intermediate object files, but this time we'll use
the case statement:

<pre     class="programlisting">
for name in *
do
  case "$name" in
    *.c ) echo "$name is a C source file"       ;;
    *.h ) echo "$name is a header file"         ;;
    *.o ) echo "$name is an object file"        ;;
  esac
done
</pre>
</p><p>
From a readability perspective, the case statement is hard to beat!

Wrapping Up</h2></div></div><p>
There are, of course, many different ways to create more-advanced and
sophisticated scripts, notably including shell script functions, but
we'll delve into those as we proceed. I'm a big fan of just doing rather
than talking around the topic forever.
</p><p>
I hope that's enough on the basics of flow control and conditional
expression evaluation in this column. If you've some questions, don't
forget that <tt  >man sh</tt> produces more information
on the power and capabilities of the Bourne Shell.
</p><p>
I don't know about you, but I'm eager to get moving onto some more complex
and interesting scripting tasks, and I invite you to let me know via e-mail
if there are specific types of scripts that you're interested in seeing
featured here.
