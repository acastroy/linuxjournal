Grab some relatively inexpensive hardware and use Python to string it all
together into a home security system.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18b2580.0x19aa298"></a></h2></div></div><p>
In this article, I describe the process I used to create a home
automation system using off-the-shelf products, Python and Linux.
I start by describing the Serial I/O Kit, drive alert, water
alarm, smoke detector and cameras that make up the hardware portion
of the system. Next, I give a short description of the command-line
programs and packages that are used by the Python program. I finish
up by giving a brief run-down of the major parts of the Python program
that ties all of the hardware and packages together.
</p><p>
The idea for
this system was born when some of my neighbor's party guests parked in
my drive for several minutes while they were trying to figure out if
they were at the correct house. I was caught off-guard, because I didn't
immediately notice that someone had pulled up. It became very clear
to me that they could have entered my residence or shop unnoticed.
I decided to create a system on my own, because I knew that a commercial
security system that would monitor driveway traffic and capture images
from the various cameras positioned around my property would be expensive.
</p><p>
Because I have coded several programs at work in Python, I have had firsthand experience with the rapid development provided by Python. It allowed
me to concentrate on the problem at hand rather than the complicated
language syntax and semantics. I would recommend Python for any program
that crunches text-based data, because it is easy enough for beginning
programmers, but powerful and flexible enough to handle larger tasks.
</p><p>
The Python home automation system is centered around an Isolated Serial
I/O Kit (Figure 1) from Quality Kits,
which is available assembled for an extra $10 US. The kit contains
four inputs and eight relays. The inputs detect DC voltage from a source
within the 6-24 volt range. The relays can be used to turn voltage to
a source on or off, so they can be used to control the power to multiple
12v light bulbs or any other gadget that requires DC voltage within the
relay's specified voltage range. The Serial I/O Kit uses simple read
and write commands to a serial port connection for setting the relays
and monitoring the inputs. The inputs and relay circuits are isolated,
which means there is no direct connection between these circuits and
the computer's serial connection. This prevents damage to the computer
if something goes wrong with the Serial I/O box. Figure 2 shows how to
connect the Mier Drive Alert and alarms to the Serial I/O box inputs.

Figure 2. Connecting the Mier Drive Alert and Alarms to the Serial I/O
Box Inputs
</p></div></div><p>
The second major part of the system is the Mier Drive Alert (Figure 3).
This system is reliable, and it also
provides an adjustable timed 24-volt output when activity is detected.
If you decide to use the Mier Drive Alert, connect one of the Serial
I/O inputs to the terminals marked Neg and NO on the Mier Drive Alert
controller. Otherwise, any drive alert system that provides a voltage
output in the 6-24 volt range when activity is detected should work.
If you are not sure that the unit you chose provides this type of output,
you probably need to contact the company.
</p><p>
The Mier controller box
detects very small changes in voltage, which are produced by the sensor
probe due to changes in the earth's magnetic field when a metal object
passes by the sensor probe. This is why the sensor probe cannot be
connected directly to the Serial I/O Kit's input, because the voltage
produced by the probe is much smaller than the input's minimum voltage
detection value of 5 volts.
</p><p>
Other drive alert systems are available that
use a beam or a pressure-activated switch and a rubber hose. This type
was once pretty common at drive-throughs and full-service gas stations.
I didn't choose the beam type, because it would detect anything that
moves, and I doubt that a rubber hose would have held up very well on
my gravel drive. The Mier unit produces an occasional false alarm due
to inclement weather and lighting strikes, but these are minimal and
could be reduced if the controller sensitivity were adjusted.

As we all know, water and house interiors don't mix, which is why I added
this cheap and simple water-detection circuit to the mix. The circuit
performed well in a test environment using a pan of water, but lacks
any real-life testing. The circuit shown in Figure 4 was created from
a schematic that is listed in the on-line Resources. I removed the
timer, buzzer and other unnecessary components,
leaving a single switching transistor and a resistor. The circuit
can be powered by a DC adapter in the 6-9-volt range. The probes in my
system are simply a short piece of scrap copper tubing, and they just sit
on the floor of my shop bathroom several inches apart. I have multiple
probes connected to the same water alarm circuit, which provides multiple
monitoring points per circuit at the loss of being able to identify the
exact location of the leak. I leave it up to you to determine the
correct probe separation for your application, because I don't have any
exact distances. The water alarm (Figure 5) that I created contains two
transistors and thus two alarm circuits on the same board.

The smoke alarm has never been tested in a real emergency and was added
as an afterthought. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Do not</em></span> replace any existing smoke alarms with
this modified version, because it must be tampered with. The following
reasons are very good reasons not to rely on it in case a fire
occurs, because if your computer, the Serial I/O Kit connection, and/or
your Internet connection is the first to go, the alarm is useless.
If you decide to duplicate this portion of the project, do so at your
own risk. The smoke detector used in this portion of the project is
just a model with an exit light that should be available from your local
home hardware center. It employs two 9-volt batteries; one to power
the alarm, and the other to power the light. Now, you need to void
the warranty by modifying the detector as follows. Begin by removing
the cover and locating the exit light. Use a volt meter to determine
the positive and negative connections to the light. Then just solder a
couple of wires to the proper connection points and connect them to one
of the Serial I/O Kit's inputs.
</p><p>
The system uses several relatively inexpensive Logitech Webcams along
with a couple of network cameras. Any cam that's supported by video for
Linux should work along with most network camera models. The best advice
I can offer is to verify that the camera is supported by Linux and that
a driver is available. Logitech Quickcam Pro models perform quite well,
but not all of the Logitech models are supported by the same driver.
The Quickcam Pro models use the pwc module available from saillard.org.
</p><p>
The system uses several command-line programs available for Linux that
handle WAV-file playback, zip file creation and image file captures.
The SOX package is a sound conversion and utility package for Linux.
It provides the play command, which is used for playing the various alarm
warning sounds. Several sound wrapper modules are available for Python,
but I found that it was fairly easy to make a system call to the play
command. The zip command is used to create zip files from the camera
image captures. Python includes a zipfile module, but it was easier to
use the command-line version, which easily can be replaced with another
command, such as tar.
</p><p>
Image file captures are handled using Motion and Curl. The later
is a fairly powerful program that will transfer data from a server.
According to the man page, it handles http, https, ftp, telnet and
some other formats. I make a system call to it to retrieve images from
the D-Link network camera's HTTP server by using a command similar to
this one, <tt  >curl http://192.168.0.98/IMAGE.JPG -uusername:password -m2
&gt;outputfile.jpg</tt>, where -m2 tells it to stop trying after two seconds.
Motion creates MPEG motion capture and time-lapse movie files along with
single JPEG image files at a preset rate. The simple HTTP server built
into Motion provides an image stream, but it does not allow for single
image retrieval using Curl. For more information on Motion, see the
<i  >Linux Journal</i> March 2005 article, &ldquo;GNU Motion:
Your Eye in the Sky for Computer Room Surveillance&rdquo; by Phil
Hollenback, because it does a good job
explaining the details required to get it up and running.
</p><p>
Once you have a working Motion setup, you should change the
snapshot_interval in Motion's config file to a one or a value acceptable
to your application. Lower values are better, because they prevent
duplicate image captures. Now set the snapshot_filename value to a
temporary filename, such as, tempmotionimagefile, so that Motion
creates only a single capture file. Leaving the default motion.conf
snapshot_filename will work, but Motion will create a new file using
the snapshot interval value, which can result in a very large number
of stored image files. These settings cause Motion to create a
symbolic link named lastsnap.jpg that always points to the latest
snapshot file, which in the case of the settings above, always is
overwritten with the most recent image.
</p><p>
Now that all of the hardware and required programs above are configured,
installed and are functioning on their own, it is time to discuss the
Python program that glues all of it together. I briefly touch on
the most important parts of the program, along with any second-party
modules that are required. The pyserial module contains a posix serial
I/O implementation for Linux and is used to handle reads and writes to
the Serial I/O Kit. A thread-enabled Python installation is required
by the program, because it must perform several simultaneous operations
in order to monitor input activity and so forth.
</p><p>
The MonitorInputs class is one of the most important, because it handles
input monitoring by employing the GetInputStatus method (Listing 1).
This method checks for input activity by writing the input name (I1 to I4)
to the serial port. The write method is provided by the Serial class
in the pyserial module. Notice that there is a Python list defined as
Expect in the example code. This is a list of the expected output from
the serial class read command executions that are required to clear and
validate information that is returned from the write request. If an
unexpected read result is obtained, the serial port connection is reset.
This allows the program to recover from serial communication failures
and short power losses to the Serial I/O Kit.

            self.ser.write(Input + '\r\n')
            Expect = [Input[0], Input[1], '\r', '\n']
            cnt = 0
            while cnt &lt;= 3:
                a = self.ser.read()
                if a == '' or a != Expect[cnt]:
                    return -1
                cnt += 1

                return 1
            else:
                return 0

</pre></div><p>
When activity is detected, MonitorInputs checks to make sure that input
activity has not occurred within the input activity timeout. The timeout
is used to keep the alarm threads, which simply send a plain-text e-mail,
from executing too many times during a single input activity voltage
on condition. The timeout is not the best solution, because the smoke
and/or water alarm would still send a new e-mail every 60 seconds.
This is acceptable to me, because if I receive a water alarm e-mail
while at work, I'm going to rush home. The unused Serial I/O Kit
relays could be used to correct this shortcoming, because each input
positive connection could be routed through a relay, which could be
turned off to disable the alarm voltage.
</p><p>
Another solution is to signal
the GetInputStatus method to ignore input activity on a specific input.
Either method will work, but a remote trigger mechanism will be required
in either case, because the serial port connection is maintained by the
home automation program. A possible solution adds a server thread to the
home automation program that would accept simple string commands from a
client connection. This would allow a simple Python CGI script to send
commands that could control input monitoring and/or the relay states.
Pyro is a Python distributed object system that provides another more
complex solution using an event server. This is very similar to the
client/server approach, but Pyro is more robust and provides opportunities
beyond the scope of this article. One of these solutions will probably
find its way into a future upgrade to the home automation program.
</p><p>
Now that the program is monitoring for input activity, it needs to
produce notifications, such as a warning sound or e-mail when activity
is detected. Smoke and water alarm activity is handled by the generic
threaded Alarm class, and drive alert activity is handled separately.
The Alarm class plays a WAV file using the PlayWav class, and it also
sends a notification e-mail using the MailAttachment class. The PlayWav
class uses a popen call to the wavcmd value (sox play command) set in
the configuration file. The PlayWav class is threaded to prevent a busy
sound device from holding up the e-mail notifications. The end result
of all of the threaded classes is that the input activity is monitored
almost continuously with only slight delays.
</p><p>
The DriveAlert class handles detected input activity for the drive
alert signal. This class employs the GetImage (Listing 2), PlayWav
and SSHRemote threaded classes. A new GetImage instance is created
for each camera command (camcmd) set in the configuration file, so
that images can be collected from each camera at about the same time.
The GetImage class makes a popen call to the camera command and waits
until it has completed. This is repeated until the number of images
set in the configuration file have been collected and saved in the
directories defined in the camdir section of the configuration file.
Once all of the images have been collected, the GetImage class uses the
ZipIt class to create a zip file via a popen call to the zip command.
When all of the image files are zipped up, the MailAttachment routine is
used to e-mail the zip files. If you would like to stagger the images
collected from the cameras, you can add a camera image delay section to
the configuration file and modify the GetImage class by adding a call
to the sleep function using the preset camera delay as input.

I briefly mention the SSHRemote class because the name is ambiguous.
This class could be used to execute any command by replacing the ssh
remote command in the configuration file with another one. I currently
use it to play some tunes on my shop machine to make it appear that
someone is home. The ssh call executes another simple Python script on
the remote machine, which uses the play command to play all WAV files
in a specified directory.
</p><p>
This article shows how Linux, Python and some cheap off-the-shelf
hardware can be used to create a home automation system in a reasonable
amount of time. The article focuses on the main parts of the system and
cannot possibly describe the setup of all of the required components
in detail. I must also stress that this system has not been tested in a
production environment and therefore comes with no guarantees, express or
implied, as to its suitability for any of the purposes listed above,
so use it at your own risk. I am looking forward to making future
enhancements, such as a voice modem that will dial a preset number and
play a message. This will supplement the unreliable e-mail
notifications,
which are often delayed. I hope this article sparks your interest
in simple monitoring systems and the flexibility of the Serial I/O Kit
used in this project.
