Using Linux and the TI MSP430 processor to create blinking LEDs is a
learning exercise, not just a way to make cheap Sci-Fi movie panels.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2630580.0x27282f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Linux embedded development doesn't only mean embedding Linux in
a product, it also means using Linux as a development platform for
embedded microprocessors. The majority of computer processors are not on
the desktop or in Beowulf clusters, they are embedded in the millions of
devices that you use every day: your alarm clock, microwave, thermostat,
car, cell phone and so on. Linux can be used to develop software for embedded
projects using microprocessors like the Microchip PIC, Atmel AVR,
Philips LPC ARM and TI MSP430 devices.
</p><p>
You don't need to be a professional developer to have fun with these tiny
computer devices. The development tools are inexpensive, and the hardware
required is minimal. Soldering skills and some experience writing in
C are really all you need to get started creating a controller for
your next Sumo Bot, remote controlled helicopter or digital lock.
</p><p>
The Texas Instruments (TI) MSP430 family of microprocessors have a wide
range of features:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Power consumption as low as 0.1uA in off mode.
</p></li><li><p>
Multiple 16-bit timers with capture/compare.
</p></li><li><p>
PWM outputs, which are very useful for robotics.
</p></li><li><p>
A/D converters for monitoring sensors.
</p></li><li><p>
SPI and Asynchronous UARTs for communications.
</p></li><li><p>
Integrated LCD display controllers.
</p></li><li><p>
Onboard oscillators.
</p></li><li><p>
Multiple clock sources for low-power sleep modes.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
The '430 family includes more than 80 devices in four major groups. Flash, where
the program is stored, ranges from a paltry 1KB to an extravagant
60KB. The available RAM is as large as 5KB or as small as
128 bytes.
</p><p>
Of course, 128 bytes isn't much RAM, but it is enough to get the job done
for small projects. Many of my embedded projects are written in assembly
code to conserve space, but with the MSP430, I have found myself using C
as the primary language. Instead of using a commercial compiler or IDE,
I have chosen to use the GNU GCC toolchain, which has had MSP430 support
added to it. The GCC compiler does a pretty good job of generating code,
and C is certainly the better choice if the the code is going to be
maintained over a number of years. There's nothing worse than returning
to heavily optimized assembly project five years later and trying to make
adjustments without the whole system crumbling to its knees.
</p><p>
With the Microchip PIC processors that I wrote about in 1998, the
development process was a bit tedious. I would write some code, compile
it, flash the PIC, wonder why it didn't work and then repeat. I used
a couple of I/O lines and LEDs as debugging tools, but there's only so
much information that you can grok from two flashing LEDs. I really had no
way to know exactly what was going on inside the processor when things
went wrong. One solution could have been to buy an In Circuit Emulator
(ICE). An In Circuit Emulator is a device you plug in to the socket where
the processor normally goes. It emulates the CPU and lets you examine
every instruction, memory locations and much more. But the $1,200+ US
price for an ICE was out of my reach.
</p><p>
Today, things are much easier for both the the hobbyist and professional.
Many of the newer processors include built in real-time debugging support
using the IEEE Std 1149.1 JTAG specification. This six-wire interface allows
real-time debugging of the software running on the target device.
You can
step through your code, watch registers and memory locations change, insert
breakpoints and modify RAM on the fly. This is a dramatic improvement over
the old 1- or 2-bit diagnostic line.
</p><p>
Instead of dropping a dozen c-notes on expensive debugging tools, you can get
a parallel port JTAG adapter from Olimex for the amazing price of $15 US. This
allows people to debug their code with interactive debuggers like gdb
instead of relying on blinking LEDs and serial ports.

Setting Up MSP430 Software Development</h2></div></div><p>
MSP430 support was added to GCC by a group headed by Dimitry Diky and Chris
Lichti. Their project includes the gcc compiler, linker, libraries, gdb
debugger and a closed-source interface to the parallel JTAG adapter. The
main emphasis of the mspgcc project has been on the Windows. Getting it
working on Linux is a bit of a struggle, involving compiling the alternate
toolchain, libraries and so on. Maybe I'm getting old, lazy or just used to .deb
and .rpm packages, but these days, I prefer not to fight with the software I'm
installing. Running <tt  >rpm -Uhv &lt;package&gt;</tt> saves my energy for debugging my
MSP430 code.
</p><p>
Thanks to Stephan Linz and his Cross Development Kit for MSP430, I don't
need to spend more than five minutes installing development tools. He has done
all the hard work getting mspgcc compiled and packaged as RPMs. Stephen
also has created Cross Development Kits for the AVR processor and the Altera
soft core NIOS, if you are interested in those target processors. If I ever
need to write code for the AVR, I know where to go.
</p><p>
The cdk4msp project is available from SourceForge, and here is a
minimal list of the packages that need to be installed from the cdk4msp
SourceForge download page:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
cdk-msp-base-0.2-20031111.i386.rpm

</p></li></ul></div><p>
Additional document packages can be downloaded, depending on
your preference for man pages, info files, PDF or HTML pages. I have
successfully used these packages on Fedora Core releases 1 through 4, and
although I haven't tried any other RPM-based distributions, I expect them to
work just fine. These RPM packages function as a self-contained unit, and
don't
depend on any outside packages.
</p><p>
Install the packages in this order with the following commands:

<pre     class="programlisting">
rpm -Uhv cdk-msp-base-0.2-20031111.i386.rpm
rpm -Uhv cdk-msp-binutils-2.14-20031106.i386.rpm
rpm -Uhv cdk-msp-libc-20031101cvs-20031102.noarch.rpm
rpm -Uhv cdk-msp-gcc-3.3.2-20031106.i386.rpm
rpm -Uhv cdk-msp-gdb-5.1.1-20031106.i386.rpm
rpm -Uhv cdk-msp-jtag-lib-20031101cvs-20031102.i386.rpm

rpm -Uhv cdk-msp-examples-mspgcc-20031101cvs-20031102.noarch.rpm
</pre>
</p><p>
The install places everything in the directory tree below /opt/cdk4msp.
Take a look at the examples in /opt/cdk4msp/examples/mspgcc and the
documents in /opt/cdk4msp/doc, info and man directories, depending on which
style of documentation you installed.

A Simple Blinking LED</h2></div></div><p>
Blinking an LED is the embedded equivalent of &ldquo;Hello World&rdquo;. We will modify
one of the examples to make it a little easier to understand. Copy the leds
example from /opt/cdk4msp/examples/mspgcc/leds/ to a working directory, and
replace main.c with the simplified version below. Edit the Makefile and set
the CPU variable to msp430x149 so that it compiles for the correct
target. If you are using a different version of the MSP430, you can get a
list of the supported types by running <tt  >msp430-gcc
--target-help | less</tt> and
then set CPU to the appropriate type.

        delay(0x4fff);
    }  /* while */
}

</pre>
</p><p>
Run <tt  >make</tt> to compile it. You should see no warnings
or errors:

<pre     class="programlisting">
msp430-gcc -mmcu=msp430x149 -O2 -Wall -g   -c -o main.o main.c

msp430-objcopy -O ihex leds.elf leds.a43
msp430-objdump -dSt leds.elf &gt;leds.lst
</pre>
</p><p>
At this point, we have the software development set up, but no hardware to run
it on or LEDS to blink.

MSP430 Simple Hardware Setup</h2></div></div><p>
Very little hardware or money is required to get started with the MSP430.
You need a PC board with the processor on it and a JTAG adapter to connect
the board to the parallel port. Olimex makes a number of inexpensive
evaluation boards and JTAG adapters for the MSP430, ARM, AVR and PIC. In the
US, their products are carried by a neat place called Spark Fun
Electronics,
which carries the Olimex boards as well as its own unique collection of
adapter boards and projects. Table 1 shows what's needed to build the circuit on
the schematic in Figure 1.
</p><div class="table"><a name="N0x2630580.0x2720700"></a><p class="title"><b>Table 1. Materials and Cost for Circuit

One problem with low-powered devices like the MSP430 is that when you try to
turn them off, they don't discharge the supply capacitors all the way to
ground. This can result in a brownout condition where the processor won't
reboot until reset properly. For the sake of simplicity, we are going to run
the processor directly off of a pair of AA batteries. It will also run off
the power from the JTAG adapter itself if you don't have any batteries
handy.
</p><p>
In a production design, I would add a power supply with reset manager to
prevent any brownout problems, but for our simple circuit, pulling the
batteries loose for a few seconds is sufficient to reset it.
</p><p>
The next thing we need to do is set up the gdb proxy and JTAG software. This
requires using the PC's parallel port, and if your Linux installation is
set up to use a local printer, you need to remove the printer and disable
the printer d&aelig;mon before you can use the port for JTAG. You also
may need
to add your development user to the group that has access to the port. On
Fedora Core, this is the lp group, and you can add users to it by editing
the /etc/group file as root.
</p><p>
Now that we have the required hardware set up, it's time to compile and flash
our LED blinker program. In the directory where we ran
<tt  >make</tt> earlier, you
can now run <tt  >make download-jtag</tt>, and the program will be flashed into the
target processor:

<pre     class="programlisting">
msp430-jtag -e leds.elf
MSP430 parallel JTAG programmer Version: 1.3
SHF_MASKPROC    = 0xf0000000
Mass Erase...
Program ...
188 bytes programmed.
</pre>
</p><p>
Next, we need to start the gdb proxy that creates a local port for gdb
to connect to and handles the communication with the target hardware. Run
this in a second window, because it outputs debugging info to stdout while it
is running:

<pre     class="programlisting">
msp430-gdbproxy --debug --port=2000 msp430

</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8682f3.large.jpg"><img src="8682f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Simple Diagram of GDB to Target Board Connections
</p></div></div><p>
GDB needs to know how to connect to the MSP430 JTAG proxy port. Create a
file named .gdbinit in your working directory and put the following three lines
into it:

<pre     class="programlisting">
set remoteaddresssize 64
set remotetimeout 999999
target remote localhost:2000
</pre>
</p><p>
Now we are ready to debug our LED blinker program. When you ran
<tt  >make
download-jtag</tt>, the LED should have begun to blink, and when the gdbproxy was
started, it should have stopped, because the processor is being held in reset
by the JTAG.
</p><p>
Start debugging by using the msp430-gdb program:

<pre     class="programlisting">
msp430-gdb leds.elf
</pre>

</p><p>
Run until main() by entering:

<pre     class="programlisting">
break main
c
</pre>
</p><p>
Debug as you normally would. Here is an example session:

<pre     class="programlisting">
(gdb) break main
Breakpoint 1 at 0x1152: file main.c, line 16.
(gdb) c
Continuing.

Breakpoint 1, main () at main.c:16
16          WDTCTL = WDTPW|WDTHOLD;
(gdb) n
19          P1OUT  = 0x00;
(gdb) n
20          P2OUT  = 0x00;
(gdb) break delay
Breakpoint 2 at 0x1140: file main.c, line 7.
(gdb) c
Continuing.

Breakpoint 2, delay (d=20479) at main.c:7
7           for (; d&gt;0; d--) {
(gdb) n
8               nop();
(gdb) n
9               nop();
(gdb) n
7           for (; d&gt;0; d--) {
(gdb) print d
$1 = 20479
(gdb)
</pre>
</p><p>
What's happening here is that the proxy is communicating with the JTAG
adapter and opening up port 2000 to accept connections from the gdb
debugger. The debugger needs to know where to connect to, hence the creation
of the .gdbinit file with the port number and timeout in it. When you run
msp430-gdb, it is making a TCP/IP connection to the JTAG proxy program, which
is in turn communicating with the target hardware if all is going well.

Schematics and Custom PC Boards</h2></div></div><p>
Flashing LEDs get boring pretty quickly. Once you get the bugs worked out
of your blinking LED, you probably are going to want to design a custom PC
board with interfaces to the outside world. One of my projects is a one-wire
lock controller with an RS232 interface that uses Dallas Semiconductor
iButtons for access control.
</p><p>
For this project, I chose one of the smallest of the family, the MSP430F1101
with 1KB of Flash and 128 bytes of RAM. It uses a pair of transistors to
switch a DC motor on and off and a MAX3221 for serial communications with a
PC. The C code to control the lock just barely fits into the 1K Flash
space of the '1101. A low dropout voltage regulator is used to power the
board and provide a clean reset to the processor. I drew the schematic and
designed the board using Eagle CAD Lite under Linux. Eagle has several
versions of its schematic and PCB auto-router, including a free version for
noncommercial use:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Free for noncommercial use.
</p></li><li><p>
Board size limited to 3.2"x4" and two layers.
</p></li><li><p>
One schematic sheet.
</p></li><li><p>
Lite version for $49 US with same limitations as the free version.
</p></li><li><p>
Standard version for $600 US.
</p></li><li><p>
Pro versions for $1,200 US.
</p></li><li><p>
Linux, Windows and Mac versions are available
</p></li></ul></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8682f4.large.jpg"><img src="8682f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Lock Project PC Board Layout from Eagle
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="8682f5.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. Picture of the Prototype PC Board
</p></div></div><p>
Eagle CAD is easy to get started with, low cost and very powerful. A user
scripting language allows you to add features and customize the program to
fit your needs. User support for Eagle is very strong, and the Web site has an
extensive collection of user-created libraries.
</p><p>
The Eagle auto-router supports advanced features like back-annotation,
keepout areas, design rules checks and one of my favorites&mdash;flood fill with
thermal relief. If you have ever tried to solder a pin surrounded by a large
ground plane, you will appreciate the advantage of thermal relief on power
pins. Without it the ground plane acts like a large heat-sink and solder
won't stick. All levels of the PCB and Schematic editor support the concept
of back (and forward) annotation. You can make changes on the PCB, and they
will be reflected on the schematic and updates made to the schematic are
reflected on the PCB.
</p><p>
After designing a PC board, you actually need to make one. You can etch your
own, but it is difficult to match the quality of even the least-expensive
board manufacturers. Some manufacturers will accept Eagle PCB files
directly, which saves you the step of converting the design to the Gerber
format. The Gerber format is a lot like an old pen plotter, it tells PCB
etching equipment where to draw the trace and how large a line to draw. Most
PCB manufacturers still require Gerber files, so Eagle includes a script to
output the necessary Gerber files.
</p><p>
One difficulty in dealing with Gerber files is that although Eagle can
export the PCB in the correct format, it has no way to view the output to
verify it was converted correctly. Linux has needed a good Gerber viewer for
years, but it has been available only with recent releases of the gerbv
program. It isn't as intuitive as I would like, but it does function well
enough to display the Gerber files so that you can check the final output
before sending it off to have 1000 of your latest widget design created.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="8682f6.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. Picture of LinkWiFi PC Board
</p></div></div><p>
I have used four different PCB manufacturers myself. Their prices and features
vary, but customer service and quality from all four have been excellent. Olimex
and PCB Pool both accept Eagle CAD files directly, with no need for
conversion to Gerber. Olimex is in Bulgaria, and turn-around time can
be up to three weeks, but prices are excellent. PCB Pool is in Ireland and
has quick turn-around or longer turn-around times, depending on price (as do most). I used PCB
Pool for the one-wire Wi-Fi boards (Figure 6).
</p><p>
AP Circuits is in Canada and has very good prices and very fast
turn-around. The
bare one-wire lock boards were ordered on a Saturday, and I received them on
Wednesday. I ordered them with no silkscreen or solder mask in order to keep
the price low. For production, I used E-Teknet for my DT-1A temperature
sensor boards with excellent results.
</p><p>
The MSP430 is a fun and easy-to-use processor; its wide range of
features and access to free development tools and low-cost JTAG hardware
make this processor a good choice for both the hobbyist and the
professional developer. Using the GNU gcc toolchain reduces the learning
curve and allows you to use the same tools for developing code on the MSP430
that you would use for Linux projects. My set of development tools includes
make, gcc, gdb and joe.
