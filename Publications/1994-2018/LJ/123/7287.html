One of the more powerful features of Linux is the simple way that
new commands can be constructed using aliases, shell scripts and other
textual tricks. These techniques rely on a command-line interface, but
what
if you need a tool with a GUI interface? Few techniques exist
that are both easy to use and professional looking. This article
discusses a
promising technique that uses the Mozilla platform. It focuses on a rather
hard but standard problem: how to display the hierarchical
information delivered by the ps(1) command usefully. A recent version of Mozilla
(at least 1.4) is required.
</p><p>
Numerous GUI toolkits are available for Linux, from Xt to Tcl/Tk. Tutorials
for these kits usually start with a button example. That's very routine, so let's see it and move on. In Mozilla, GUIs are described using
XML syntax. A document named button.xul that specifies a button looks
like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;
&lt;window xmlns="http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/
&#8618;gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul"&gt;
  &lt;button label="Press Me"/&gt;
&lt;/window&gt;
</pre>
</p><p>
The unmanageably long string,
http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/etc...,
tells Mozilla this file isn't HTML. It's instead XUL, a GUI description
language that is Mozilla-specific and a dialect of XML. Make the
button's window appear with this command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
mozilla -chrome button.xul
</pre>
</p><p>
This example is simple and not worth dwelling on, although there's a lot
going on even for a simple button. A ps(1) display is a far more ambitious
goal, so let's leap forward.
</p><p>
Instead of the simple &lt;button&gt; widget, one of Mozilla and XUL's bigger
guns is required, the &lt;tree&gt; widget. Some coding also is required and
a lot more XML. Here, the focus is on fast development, not on seamless
perfection. The coding part comes first.
</p><p>
To begin, ps(1) does the initial data gathering. Listing
1 shows the file psdata.ksh, with mode 777.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1702580.0x17fa660"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Listing 1. A Command-Line Wrapper for ps(1)</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">

#!/bin/ksh
export COLUMNS=300
ps h -ew -o '%p,%P,%C,%x,%z,%G,%n,%U,%a' \
  &gt; /tmp/psdata

</pre></div><p>
The output holds all the interesting fields, comma-separated with no
header line. Mandatory components are PID and PPID; the rest are optional but
informative fields, such as COMMAND. That's all traditional
Linux requires.
</p><p>
The rest of the coding depends on Mozilla technology. The standard compiled
distributions provide at least two executables, mozilla and
regxpcom. Here, a binary named xpcshell is used as well. This
binary is Mozilla's JavaScript equivalent of the Perl interpreter; it
has no GUI support. xpcshell sometimes is a good starting point for
development, but it is never essential.
To acquire this binary, a full compilation
of Mozilla is required. First, check toolchain requirements against
<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/build" target="_self">www.mozilla.org/build</a>. Next, grab the source by FTP or remote
CVS. A major release rather than a nightly release is recommended. Once
unpacked, follow standard compilation steps:

<pre     class="programlisting">
cd mozilla
./configure --disable-debug
make
make install
</pre>
</p><p>
Debug versions are slow and have messy diagnostics; although
harmless, they're avoided here. The build takes an hour-plus to finish
and requires up to 1GB of space. The resulting binaries are located in
mozilla/dist/bin. They can be run from that directory or from anywhere
if the MOZILLA_FIVE_HOME and LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variables are
set and exported to that directory's absolute path. Now all the required
binaries and shell scripts are available.
</p><p>
With Perl, the output of ps(1) needs to be sucked up into a
coding environment. In this case, that's a JavaScript interpreter. To
do this, you need more than language syntax&mdash;you need support for
I/O. In Perl, support is built into core language functions. By comparison,
JavaScript has no I/O functions. In Mozilla, that I/O support is added
using objects. Such objects cannot come from a scripting library, because
the core language has no I/O. So, a Perl <tt  >use</tt> or
<tt  >require</tt> doesn't work.
There are no back-tick operations either, such as <tt  >echo
`pwd`</tt>. Instead,
Mozilla has XPCOM.
</p><p>
XPCOM is an implementation of Microsoft's COM, and it works portably
on Linux/UNIX, Windows and Macintosh. It's restricted to a single
process at the moment; there's no DCOM. XPCOM/COM is the fastest way to add new
functionality to a scripting environment. It hooks up a compiled (say C or
C++) object to an object reference in the scripting language. The nearest
Perl equivalent is XM, but XPCOM does not require the re-linking that XM
demands. Mozilla includes thousands of XPCOM objects by default. XPCOM
is not some Java-like virtual machine at work, however. XPCOM objects usually
are compiled code that runs efficiently on the bare metal.
</p><p>
It might seem strange to use Microsoft ideas on Linux, but
XPCOM is fully open source and occupies a UNIX niche that has long
been unaddressed: Linux/UNIX lacks a useful intermediate-sized component
model. There have been CORBA and dynamic link libraries in the past, but
those things are, respectively, very heavyweight and very lightweight.
XPCOM
is suited perfectly to middle-sized jobs, to application development
of large binaries and to performance-critical work. Here it's
simply
extremely handy.
</p><p>
Use of XPCOM or COM typically includes many calls to the
Windows QueryInterface() method. For the sake of Linux programmer
sensibilities, this article uses createInstance() and getService()
instead. QueryInterface() is available too.
</p><p>
Back to the code. Let's suck up the output of the ps(1) wrapper. Listing
2 shows how.

</pre></div><p>
The first part of this listing sets up some globals. The Components
object is a pre-existing object that acts as a directory of all existing
XPCOM objects, called components, and their supported interfaces (in the
Java or COM sense). To get an XPCOM object, find the right component
(named with a string called a Contract ID) and construct an interface
object for it (also named by a string or by a property name; the
latter is used here). It's common to reuse components, so once found,
they're saved as handy property values on the klass object&mdash;class
is a reserved word in JavaScript.
</p><p>
Two defined functions are
run at the end of this listing. execute_ps() simply executes another process: the ps(1) wrapper
script. For that it needs a file object (an nsILocalFile) and a process
object (an nsIProcess). run() invokes the process using fork(). Mozilla is
designed to do all this portably, but here only Linux is supported because
the path of the executable is hard coded as a constant. The other function,
read_raw_data(), sucks up the data. Mozilla uses stream, transport and
channel concepts the same as do some high-level features of Java, but without the
complexity of having to write any classes. A file object is needed for
the data file dumped by ps(1). A stream object opens a content pathway
to that file. A minor hack is required as well: a special scriptable
stream object must wrap the basic stream. With one read() call the whole
file is slurped up into a string. Next, some Perl-like regular expression
wizardry breaks the content down into an array of lines and then further
into an array of arrays. All data is treated as string data. To see if
the data is processed correctly, try using the diagnostic and rudimentary
print() method supplied with xpcshell. Alas, Mozilla currently does not
support retrieving PIDs, so files named /tmp/psdata.$$ don't
work yet. That support is nearly here, though.
</p><p>
Many XPCOM objects are in this script, so how are you to find the right
ones? As with any programming library, there's reference material. Look
for .IDL files in the Mozilla source code (or under mozilla/dist/idl),
on the Web or read a book.
</p><p>
That's enough scripting to start with; scripting and tabular data are well
understood in Linux. To build the GUI, Mozilla requires XML,
specifically,
XUL. That's a different world from the command line, and you have to be
familiar with XUL to succeed. Here, the process is broken down into easy
stages. First, Listing 3 and Figure 1 show an XUL &lt;tree&gt; widget.

    &lt;/treeitem&gt;

 &lt;/treechildren&gt;
&lt;/tree&gt;

&lt;/window&gt;
</pre></div><p>
The tree looks nice because the &lt;?xml-stylesheet?&gt; processing instruction
drags in the current Mozilla theme for free. Display this tree with
the normal Mozilla executable, using the -chrome option to rip away the
normal navigation buttons and other decorations:

<pre     class="programlisting">
mozilla -chrome static_tree.xul
</pre>
</p><p>
The XML content (henceforth, the code) is a bit like an HTML &lt;table&gt;
tag: both column headers and rows of data are specified. The
&lt;treeitem&gt; tag is the tricky part; it can contain a &lt;treechildren&gt;
tag, which allows the tree to have subtrees, rather than only depth 1
leaf nodes. As seen in Figure 1, the tree widget has a number of interactive
features; subtrees can be opened and closed in the same manner as any file explorer
application, including Nautilus or Windows Explorer. Columns can be added or
deleted using the column picker, the small icon at the extreme
right of the tree header that holds column names.
</p><p>
If we wanted, JavaScript scripts could be used to insert the ps(1) data
into this XUL document dynamically. That's not hard, and all of the W3C's
DOM interfaces are available to do the job. Start by adding Element
objects or even use the .innerHTML property. This is an ambitious
article, so instead you see a fully data-driven approach, one that
avoids hand-constructing any tree.
</p><p>

&lt;template&gt; tag instead

An XUL template is like a report template and not like a C++ template. It's
the basis for repeated sets of data. The template starts with the
&lt;vbox&gt; tag that has a datasources= attribute. The &lt;action&gt; part of the
&lt;template&gt; is the content to be repeated for every record that
the &lt;conditions&gt; part identifies in the trivial.rdf file. If you're
an intermediate at make(1) or SQL or have touched Lisp, Scheme or Prolog,
you should be able to grasp how the template system works.
Listing 5 shows the trivial.rdf file that
drives the display of Figure 2.

&lt;/RDF&gt;

</pre></div><p>
If this file is modified, Figure 2 can change even though Listing 4
hasn't been altered. That's a data-driven arrangement. This file is RDF,
one of the harder W3C standards. Basically, it's a graph of nodes, each
node holding three items of data. The items are called subject, predicate
(or property) and object. Simple graphs are trees, so Listing 5 is
a tree. Combine the &lt;hbox&gt; in Listing 4 with the &lt;li&gt; tags in Listing 5,
and the result appears as illustrated in Figure 2. This is somewhat like an SQL join
or join(1). For now, notice that the ref= attribute in Listing
4 matches the &lt;Seq&gt; tag in Listing 5. This is how the two are matched
up in Mozilla's template processing logic. Mozilla support for RDF is
basic rather than strict, so nearly all the URIs and URLs can be made up
on the spot, as though they were variables or constants. That's done
throughout this article. Try adding another &lt;li&gt; tag to Listing 5;
restart Mozilla and display the page again.
</p><p>
A tree is a good way to display a hierarchical list of processes, and a
&lt;template&gt; is a good way to drive the appearance of a tree direct
from data. No RDF document is available to work with, though; instead, we
have a JavaScript array of records. The solution is to put
a &lt;tree&gt; and a &lt;template&gt; tag together and set the RDF file to
<tt  >rdf:null =</tt>
no file. A script is used to create the RDF content directly from
JavaScript data. Because of RDF's peculiar
design, the content can be
dumped into the template in a careless manner and everything simply
works. That's a far cleaner but admittedly a more subtle solution than
hand-building an XUL tree from JavaScript. Another clean aspect
of RDF and templates is the tree can be updated anytime in a
simple manner. This means the window can display ps(1)
data dynamically, as though a GUI version of <tt  >watch ps H</tt> were run. That dynamic
step is beyond this article's scope, however.
</p><p>
If the &lt;tree&gt; and &lt;template&gt; tags are put together, the final XUL document
is as shown in Figure 3 and Listing 6.

Again, you can spot the datasource= and ref= attributes and the
&lt;template&gt; tag. The URLs beginning with rdf: indicate spots where RDF
data should be put into the template. In the earlier example, variables
started with a question mark. Two syntaxes are available to mark
such spots. Not surprisingly, there's one such piece of data for every
column and every row.
</p><p>
The &lt;splitter&gt; tag is simply friendly decoration; it allows the user to
resize the columns. Doing so aids readability, as do the minwidth= and flex=
attributes.
Figure 3 shows how the displayed process hierarchy
naturally fills the tree.
</p><p>
Near the top of Listing 6, a &lt;script&gt; tag includes all the code
from Listing 2, plus more. When such scripts are included, there is an
immediate security problem. The problem is Mozilla technology must
ensure secure display of remotely located files and scripts, such as
HTML pages. This is like the Java Server of Origin rule. xpcshell is
entirely unsecured, but the main Mozilla binary has normal security. With
an intensive configuration effort, security restrictions can be overcome,
but it's simpler to register the script as a package. To do that, all the
files have to be moved to the chrome, a directory inside
the Mozilla install area where all security restrictions are lifted.
How to do that is explained shortly, but first we finish the application
with a script that moves the ps(1) data from a plain JavaScript data
structure into an RDF datasource. This script replaces the static RDF
file used earlier (Listing 7).

Listing 7 shows the extra script logic that substitutes for a static RDF
file. Adding the JavaScript data to the RDF used by the tree's template
requires a process of steps. Mozilla sucks up RDF data into an object
called a datasource. Because rdf:null has been specified, no
datasource object exists, so one must be created and attached to the template.
load_handler() does that, after the document is loaded safely. Using an
onload handler is a standard HTML trick, and such tricks apply equally
well to
XUL. The update_tree() function then fills that datasource with RDF content
for the template. It's done pretty simply. A double loop steps through
each data item in the JavaScript array. For each ps(1) process, Assert()
is called to create one RDF node of data (a triple of three items) that
states PPID X has child PID Y and a further set of RDF nodes that states
PID X has USER A or PID X has GROUP B. The &lt;template&gt; and the &lt;tree&gt;
tag work together to sort those RDF nodes automatically into a tree
arrangement; this is like make(1) calculating the dependency tree for
all the targets stated in a given Makefile. With this script acting in
place of a static RDF file, the simple process viewer is complete.
Finally, the steps required to lift security by registering the code as
a package are:

<pre     class="programlisting">
M5H = $MOZILLA_FIVE_HOME
mkdir -p $M5H/chrome/psviewer/content
cp *  $M5H/chrome/psviewer/content
vi    $M5H/chrome/psviewer/content/contents.rdf
vi    $M5H/chrome/installed-chrome.txt
</pre>

&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;
&lt;RDF
xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#"
&gt;

   chrome:author="Nigel McFarlane"
   chrome:name="psviewer"&gt;
 &lt;/Description&gt;
&lt;/RDF&gt;

</pre></div><p>
The first vi editing session creates the file contents.rdf. It must look
exactly like Listing 8.
The second vi editing session adds to the file installed-chrome.txt. A
single line is added:


<pre     class="programlisting">
content,install,url,resource:/chrome/psviewer/content/
</pre>
</p><p>
When Mozilla starts up, it examines this last file. If it is modified,
the directories listed are examined for contents.rdf files. Those files
are then read, and like make(1), Mozilla builds in its head a picture
of all the packages known to exist. All known packages have
full security access, and Listing 8 adds the package psviewer.
The secure files now can be displayed and run with a URL such as:

<pre     class="programlisting">
mozilla -chrome chrome://psviewer/content/tree.xul
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1702580.0x1b07788"></a></h2></div></div><p>
instead of:

<pre     class="programlisting">
mozilla -chrome file:///home/nrm/psviewer/tree.xul
</pre>
</p><p>
The psviewer tool has first-class status within the Mozilla
installation. If necessary, it could be integrated with other applications,
such as the Firefox/Firebird browser or Thunderbird e-mail client. It also could be
added as a menu option to the Tools menu, for example.
</p><p>
There's a lot of technology in this article. The biggest mistake you can
make is to try to use all the features described here in your first
Mozilla experiment. Because validation of XML is less than verbose in
Mozilla, you easily can become tied in a knot. It's best to start with
a simple project and work up to the challenging combinations played with
here. Although the output of ps(1) also can be made into a dynamic
HTML page, XUL is a more robust and professional GUI in the end, fully
integrated with the desktop.
</p><p>
Mozilla is a powerful GUI environment waiting to be explored. It is
likely to occupy the same niche under Linux that Visual Basic occupies
under Windows. Even better, Mozilla is a portable and cross-platform
technology. Your projects can be designed to work on BSD, HP-UX, SunOS,
AIX and Mac OS X, as well as Linux.
