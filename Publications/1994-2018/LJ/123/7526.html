Yes, I admit it, Fran&ccedil;ois. That's very funny. When I told you that this
month's theme was cross-platform development, I didn't mean platforms
that make you cross, although I can understand thinking of some OSes
as cross platforms. As amusing as those images are, I think the artwork
you chose for the menus tonight might raise a few eyebrows, despite our,
shall we say, sympathetic audience.
</p><p>
Speaking of which, I see that our guests have arrived. Welcome,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>mes
amis</em></span>, to <span   class="emphasis"><em>Chez Marcel</em></span>, home of exceptional Linux fare, one of the
world's greatest wine cellars and the greatest customers in the
world. Make yourselves comfortable. Fran&ccedil;ois and I were
discussing the theme of this month's issue, cross-platform development,
and my waiter was getting a little rambunctious. It almost seems as
though we should bring out a white Zinfandel for this, but luckily,
we have none in stock. Fran&ccedil;ois, to
the cellar, <span   class="emphasis"><em>imm&eacute;diatement</em></span>! Bring up the 1992 Napa Valley Cabernet

</p><p>
As many of you know, Microsoft Windows remains a part of the average
business IT department. Many of us
must be able to exchange information between
Windows and Linux.
For example, somehow you convinced management to let you run Linux
on your workstations instead of Windows. Maybe you are using your
own notebook. Whatever the reason, you now are going to have to deal
with the Windows workgroup or domain and the appropriate shared files
and printers. Although Jon in accounting
isn't particularly fond of his Windows XP box, many
important files are shared from that machine, files that are shared in
the network neighborhood.
</p><p>
You might ask yourself how easy it is to take advantage of the network
neighborhood. This is an interesting question considering how many file
and print servers out there aren't running Windows but Linux,
providing the file sharing experience through Samba. Consequently, it
isn't surprising that Samba-compatible client software tends to come as part of
the standard installation on most modern Linux distributions. What that
means is you can connect to a Windows share on the network using the
smbclient program, started with <tt  >smbclient -L
sedna</tt>, which would produce a report of shares that looks something like this:


<pre     class="programlisting">
Domain=[ACCOUNTING] OS=[Windows 5.1] Server=[Windows 2000 LAN Manager]

        Sharename      Type      Comment
        ---------      ----      -------
        SEDNA_C        Disk
        IPC$           IPC       Remote IPC
        Reports        Disk
        Policies       Disk
</pre>
</p><p>
Assuming you had permission to view the Reports
folder, you could connect to it like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
smbclient //sedna/reports -U winuser
</pre>
</p><p>
In the above example, I am connecting to a Windows XP box from my Linux
workstation as user winuser. The system then asks me for a password,
after which I am taken to a Samba prompt that looks like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Domain=[ACCOUNTING] OS=[Windows 5.1] Server=[Windows 2000 LAN Manager]
smb: \&gt;
</pre>
</p><p>
From there, type <tt  >help</tt> and smbclient offers up a list of all the
things you can do while connected using the commands at your disposal. A
number of them are obvious things, such as <tt  >dir</tt>,
<tt  >copy</tt> and so
on. Although all of this is good, it's not pretty in the graphical sense and
you can't use this while working in your graphical file managers or
inside OpenOffice.org's applications.
</p><p>
Whether you are using KDE or GNOME as your desktop environment, rest
assured that all the tools you need to join the network neighborhood
are right there at your disposal. Best of all, it's extremely easy to
do. Let's start by taking a look at Konqueror.
</p><p>
Open up Konqueror (either as the file manager or the browser) and type
<tt  >smb:/</tt> in the Location field.
</p><p>
Samba servers or Windows machines advertising network shares first
appear in the browser window under their workgroup name (for example, ACCOUNTING,
SALESGRP). Figure 1 shows a Konqueror session with
a two-panel view; click Window on the menubar and select Split View,
Left/Right. In the left panel, we have the basic network browser view
with three active workgroups. In the right-hand panel, I've clicked
on the ACCOUNTING workgroup to show the computers
belonging to that group.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="7526f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Using Konqueror to Browse Workgroups
</p></div></div><p>
To read, write or otherwise make use of the files shared on those
computers, double-click on the corresponding folder for that
computer&mdash;Fran&ccedil;ois' computer for instance. All of the available shared directories
(or folders) then are visible (Figure 2).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="7526f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Once connected, browsing is basic file manager navigation.
</p></div></div><p>
From here, it's all classic drag and drop, graphical file manager
browsing. By clicking (or double-clicking, depending on the
configuration), I can go inside the cooking folder, locate the
appropriate document and open it with OpenOffice.org Writer if I choose.
(Right-click on the file, select Open with and
<span   class="emphasis"><em>voil&agrave;</em></span>,
I'm editing a document on a shared Windows resource.)
</p><p>
Ideally, we don't want to go through this whole navigation process each
and every time. To bring a given network share a few clicks closer,
simply bookmark the appropriate shared folder.
</p><p>
Over on the GNOME side of things, we have Nautilus. You should find the
process similar to what we went through with Konqueror. Start Nautilus
and type <tt  >smb:///</tt> in the Location bar.
Nautilus then displays the active workgroups on the network (Figure 3).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7526f3.large.jpg"><img src="7526f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Nautilus in SMB Network Browse Mode
</p></div></div><p>
From there, you can double-click on one of the
workgroups to select a computer. Then, from the list
of computers, double-click on your choice, and you
can browse the individual resources offered (Figure
4). Be aware that when you move around from computer
to computer like this, you occasionally may be asked
for a user name and password for that computer or
even the specific folder.

Figure 4. Windows and Samba shares are accessed easily.
</p></div></div><p>
As with the Konqueror example before this, you can save yourself a little
time by bookmarking the folder of your choice. The problem with both of
the suggestions I've made is that neither of them lets you permanently
mount network drives. Accessing a particular folder requires that you do
a little command-line work, an easy enough process but not quite the
point-and-click ease that Windows users on your network want to see. Let's
have Fran&ccedil;ois refill our glasses while we take a look at a way to
solve this dilemma.
</p><p>
For a more robust and flexible means of working in and with the network
neighborhood, you simply must take a look at Smb4K, a super-classy
SMB browser tool that also is flexible and powerful. Furthermore, Smb4K makes
it possible to preview shares, mount shares locally without needing to
run as root, reconnect automatically on startup and more.
</p><p>
At the time of this writing, Smb4K was sitting at the 0.3.2 release, but
I found it to be a capable package and definitely worth the time it takes to
investigate. Binary packages for Debian, SuSE and Fedora are available
from the site, as is the full source. Building Smb4K from source is as
easy as the classic extract and build five-step:

<pre     class="programlisting">
tar -xzvf smb4k-0.3.2.tar.gz
cd smb4k-0.3.2
./configure --prefix=/usr
make
su -c "make install"
</pre>
</p><p>
When you have installed the package, run the program by calling
<tt  >smb4k</tt>. As soon as you start Smb4K, it scans the network looking
for active shares. You can fine-tune its functionality, including such options
as whether you want shares to be reconnected automatically by clicking
on Settings in the menubar and selecting Configure Smb4K. The
graphical interface is intuitive and easy to navigate, and the package as
a whole
is easy to use.
</p><p>
The display is divided into a left-hand side navigation panel where
workgroups, computers and shares can be listed and navigated. To mount
a share, right-click on it and select mount. If you would rather see
what you are getting into first, choose Preview instead.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7526f5.large.jpg"><img src="7526f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. Smb4K: could this be the ultimate SMB browser?
</p></div></div><p>
Mounted drives appear in the top right-hand window as drive
icons. Double-clicking on one of the drive icons calls Konqueror. If
you run <tt  >df</tt> from the command line, you see that the
drives now are mounted for your use in your own home directory under an
Smb4K directory prefix. For instance, for the example in Figure 5,
the listing looks like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Filesystem       Size Used Avail Use% Mounted on
//SEDNA/Reports  4.0G 3.0G  1.1G  75% /home/marcel/smb4k/SEDNA/Reports
//FRANCOIS/wine   13G 8.8G  3.3G  73% /home/marcel/smb4k/FRANCOIS/wine
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, any of my applications&mdash;whether KDE, GNOME, shell-based or anything
else&mdash;can access the shares. Being part of the neighborhood
has never been easier.
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Mon Dieu, mes amis</em></span>, closing time has come so quickly. Fran&ccedil;ois,
would you be so kind as to refill our guests' glasses a final time? We
certainly don't want anyone going home cross, and with the items on
today's menu, the neighborhood's doors all are open to you.
Until next time, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes
amis</em></span>,
let us all drink to one another's health. <span   class="emphasis"><em>A v&iuml;&iquest;&frac12;re sant&iuml;&iquest;&frac12; Bon
