No Accounts for the Penguins?</h4><p>
On a recent trip to the Camden Aquarium in Camden,
New Jersey, I found that the penguins were attracted to my
Linux hat. My girls loved the penguins, and I plan
on raising them on Linux desktops (the girls that is).

BSD, Please</h4><p>
May I suggest including other open-source UNIX-like
operating systems? I have just installed OpenBSD
for a project at work. Although it would have been
easier with Linux, if the boss says BSD then it is
BSD. I must admit that it was a pain; however, after
going through the process for the right application
environment, OpenBSD would be a good choice. In my
opinion, Lintel is no better than Wintel. I
would urge you to consider articles on ports, the
BSD solution to software distribution. Two choices
are better than one but not much better.

<i  >LJ</i> Web Site&mdash;Too Political?</h4><p>
The article I received via e-mail titled &ldquo;Hot Air&rdquo;
(<a href="http://linuxjournal.com/article/7493" target="_self">linuxjournal.com/article/7493</a>) was a huge
disappointment to me. Now, I am not a conservative.
I am a liberal, but not the socialist flavor
represented by Kerry and Kennedy. This, however,
is all beside the point. Using this technical forum
to promote these views is the kind of thing that
frankly makes me want to cancel my subscription.
Having said that, I'm willing to give <i  >LJ</i> one more
chance, but I will be paying closer attention to
what comes in my e-mail. When I want politics,
I know where to go to get it, and I won't support
your magazine with my dollars so they can be spent
promoting political agendas.

if Air America were a right-wing network in the same
position, I would have covered it the same way.
Was the whole thing a stretch as a Linux
subject? Sure. But I think it would help broadcasters
of all sorts to take advantage of Linux, the Net and
technologists who understand both. That's what I was
trying to get across.
</p><p>
We've been writing about the intersection of Linux,
the Net and radio for years, by the way. The Web site
has much more room for material, and much more leeway
around subject matter, than the magazine.
</p><p>
I'm sorry the piece disappointed you, and that you saw
it promoting a political agenda. For what it's worth,
I'm a registered independent. In recent elections
I've mostly voted Libertarian. If there's an ax I
try not to grind, that's the one.

Thanks for the Recommendation</h4><p>
Wow! After reading Marcel Gagn&eacute;'s article on
SuperKaramba [<i  >LJ</i>, May 2004], I took just a few minutes and configured
it for my system. Hats off to all the SuperKaramba
and theme authors and to Marcel for bringing this to
your readers' attention. Thanks for the great magazine
and the great articles.

Shielded CPUs vs. RTLinux/RTAI</h4><p>
I enjoyed the article entitled &ldquo;Shielded CPUs:
Real-Time Performance in Standard Linux&rdquo; in the May
2004 issue of your magazine. I have two brief
comments about this article that should be perceived
as constructive criticism.
</p><p>
1) Steve Brosky could have been even more informative
in his performance numbers had he also compared
the interrupt response times of his shielded CPUs
technique to the more conventional RTLinux/RTAI
(which he himself acknowledges as being a very good
standard by which to judge a real-time solution).
The advantage of providing actual numbers that
compare his system to RTLinux/RTAI is that it would
have helped people to decide more quickly which
RTOS is right for them.
</p><p>
Specifically, RTLinux and
RTAI have better performance numbers, with latency
and jitter measured in the 10s of microseconds,
not 100s, as was demonstrated using shielded CPUs.
For some applications the shielded CPUs technique is
sufficient, while for others it is not. Having had
sets of numbers representing RTLinux/RTAI would have
helped people to decide more quickly which real-time
approach is right for them.
</p><p>
2) The article should have spent more time discussing
the potential pitfalls inherent to the shielded
CPUs technique. Specifically, CPU shielding
still suffers from priority inversion problems
inherent in any system that shares resources with
non-real-time components. In order for CPU shielding
to guarantee hard real-time performance, one must
be careful to write programs that do not access any
potentially blocking operations in the Linux kernel.
</p><p>
More specifically, any swapping of memory to disk
in the shielded process throws real-time performance
out the window. One has to do things like lock all
process memory to RAM, for example, mlockall(), as well as be
careful not to access any device drivers that may run
on non-shielded CPUs or that may sleep. This must be
done in order to avoid priority inversion with the
normal, non-real-time, Linux system.
</p><p>
Overall, a good article, but it could have been even
more informative, in my opinion, had the two points
above been addressed.

into the article&mdash;but with limited space you pick
and choose what to include.

Bank Answer One: Monoculture Is Risk</h4><p>
I just read [William Mitchell's] letter to the editor in the May 2004 issue
about Microsoft IE-only bank Web sites.
As he mentioned that his bank did this, a letter to
the chairman of the board and the board of directors
might do the trick. I suspect if one points out that
mandating usage of the least secure Web browser is
not only an annoyance to those who use more secure
ones, but that insisting on this puts the bank at risk
for more theft, this may change.

Answer Two: Moo-ve to Another Bank</h4><p>
What I would do in Mr Mitchell's case is inform
my bank that <span   class="emphasis"><em>I</em></span> am the customer. They exist to
service <span   class="emphasis"><em>me</em></span>, and not like a bull services a cow,
either. If they choose not to do that, then
I will simply find a bank that will.

Answer Three: Fake It</h4><p>
I've been using User Agent Switcher for Mozilla and
Firefox to get to sites that claim to be IE/Netscape-only friendly. It's been working fine. You can check
it out here: <a href="http://www.chrispederick.com/work/firefox/useragentswitcher" target="_self">www.chrispederick.com/work/firefox/useragentswitcher</a>.
</p><p>
I'd e-mail William Mitchell but you don't post e-mails
in the Letters section, for obvious reasons! Maybe
you could pass this on to him.
