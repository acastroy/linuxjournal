Use the development tools in this issue to
clear the way for a low-pain migration from
your remaining non-Linux systems.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1473580.0x156b2f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Our reader surveys consistently show that a lot of
our readers are still running, and even developing
code for, non-Linux operating systems. Whatever
system you're coding for today, you can use Linux
as your development platform and give yourself the
flexibility of moving to Linux tomorrow.
</p><p>
In a recent essay entitled &ldquo;Free But
Shackled&mdash;The Java Trap&rdquo;, Richard
Stallman wrote, &ldquo;If you develop a Java program
on Sun's Java platform, you are liable to use Sun-only
features without even noticing. By the time you find
this out, you may have been using them for months,
and redoing the work could take more months.&rdquo;
That's bad news, but platform lock-in isn't only for
Java developers. So build and run your projects on an
all-free system regularly to save yourself
from accidental lock-in as you work. We're happy to
offer four complete cross-platform sample applications
in this issue.
</p><p>
First, Python is one of our favorite languages here
at <i  >Linux Journal</i>. Its simplicity makes old code,
and other people's code, easy to understand and
maintain. Let David Reed's GladeGen (page 40) write
the GUI code for you, so you can focus on business
logic.
</p><p>
The best development frameworks are the ones that
grow cooperatively with an application that depends on
them. Mozilla is a good example. Don't get Mozilla the
browser mixed up with Mozilla the framework&mdash;work
through Nigel McFarlane's process viewer utility on
page 66 to understand how to use Mozilla's framework
to write non-Web applications.
</p><p>
As dedicated followers of fashion, we're happy to have
a blog tool written with the .NET-compatible
Mono. Ian Pointer shows how it's done and scores
two buzzword points on page 50.
</p><p>
If you need to develop for Microsoft Windows, you
can save yourself the expense and learning time of
another set of development tools. Joey Bernard's
article on MinGW (page 58) shows you how to add
Windows support to your Linux apps or
bring Windows apps to Linux with minimal rewriting.
</p><p>
Finally, on page 83, John Healy, Andrew Haley and Tom
Tromey explain how Red Hat made the popular Eclipse
integrated development environment build natively
with no Java Virtual Machine (JVM), and no proprietary dependencies, at
all. Maybe Java developers are finally getting the
hang of this cross-platform thing. Stay out of traps,
don't fall for lock-in, and enjoy the issue.
