### Linux Journal Ceases Publication: An Awkward Goodbye

IMPORTANT NOTICE FROM LINUX JOURNAL, LLC:

On August 7, 2019, Linux Journal shut its doors for good. All staff were laid off and the company is left with no operating funds to continue in any capacity. The website will continue to stay up for the next few weeks, hopefully longer for archival purposes if we can make it happen.

Final Letter from the Editor: The Awkward Goodbye
_by Kyle Rankin_
_Kyle Rankin - August 7, 2019_

## GOODBYE LINUX JOURNAL! and WELCOME LINUX JOURNAL!
_The Open-Source Crusaders_


### Work in progress...
1. README.md changes
2. Website archive for local publishing
3. 1994-2019 Archive to include 2019 issues in Archive
4. Youtube download for local publishing
5. Podcasts download for local publishing

any additional requirement, files that you have, or contribution, let me know to work in that to be included here,

### Why this?
I loved this magazine from the first issue in 1994, I use a lot of excelent information from this magazine to start all my linux projects from 1994 until today.
I have a lot of history in linux, unix, networking, development, operations and many others thanks to this magazine, and this is my contribution to keep alive the Linux Journal information to everyone.

I hope you find the information you need in this archive,

Best Regards
AC
